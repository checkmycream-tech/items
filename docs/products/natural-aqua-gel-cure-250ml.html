            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful exfoliator but it may be better for the body than the face.</li>
            <li>Wonderful satin smooth skin!</li>
            <li>so it may not be very suitable for me.</li>
            <li>So happy it came so soon :) !</li>
            <li>very good product, love it.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on my face and exfoliates it greatly.</li>
            <li>I always try to take good care of my skin</li>
            <li>its good for your skin to remove that).</li>
            <li>Its that good-</li>
            <li>It sounded so good</li>
            <li>Sometimes I get good results and sometimes I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Take incredibly good care of their skin over there.  </li>
            <li>Good value as it&#x27;s priced fairly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One applicantion made my mom&#x27;s leg keratosis look so good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with a good cartoons</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been envious of how wonderful skin products are readily available in Asia but not in the states</li>
            <li>Asia knows what&#x27;s up with good skin.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>For me, I like to use it fairly often to manage the flaky skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still kept buying it, because it was that good.  </li>
            <li>I brought this based on the good reviews</li>
            <li>absolutly freaky how good this stuff is and how well it works.</li>
            <li>My husband even tried it and loved t.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of good reviews here in amazon</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li>realized it was no where close as good as the version I had &#x3D; 1 dime of the product works all over face and neck.  </li>
            <li>realized it was no where close as good as the version I had &#x3D; 1 dime of the product works all over face and neck.  </li>
            <li>This is a good exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>It is a good exfoliator for weekly usage.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>SO GOOD PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>not so good, ruff on skin.</li>
            <li>but soon it turned into something good for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rate this 5 stars because it is a good product but nothing like a HOLY GRAIL product for me</li>
            <li>but nevertheless it is a good purchase if you ever decide to give it a try.</li>
            <li>(in a good way).  </li>
            <li>But i would reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a good exfoliator, though it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>The gel worked good.</li>
            <li>because that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li>I saw this product on a bubzbeauty youtube review, saw the good and so-so reviews on amazon, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I received the product on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li>This stuff I tried for weeks and nothing good happened.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good product for others that&#x27;s why I purchased, however this does not work for me at all.</li>
            <li>When I intially bought this I loved it and told all my friends to get it</li>
            <li>Good product, this is my 5th bottle already, thx</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I heard that it was supposed to be good for exfoliating your face.</li>
            <li>Feels good after rinsing.</li>
            <li>My mom - who is in her 50&#x27;s - reluctantly tried some one evening and was delighted by the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but a good investment.</li>
            <li>and i heard lots ppl saying this is a good product.</li>
            <li>I have yet to use it as part of my routine, but I am hopeful for good results.</li>
            <li>Apply a fair amount of Cure to your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty good at exfoliating, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>It worked good</li>
            <li>But this one was good size for this</li>
            <li>I bought another one for my sister and recommend it to all my good friends and family.</li>
            <li>I will say you need a good moisturizer after using Cure.</li>
            <li>It is a really good product，clean</li>
            <li>but it never gave me as good results as this one.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product</li>
            <li>I use it at night and slather on a good night cream</li>
            <li>I loved it ! :-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true believer in Cure!!!</li>
            <li>And remember that it works best if you use some lotion after, just like you have to oil leather after you clean it.</li>
            <li>True to reviews, this was a great buy!  </li>
            <li>Awesome product.. really cool to see the beads form.</li>
            <li>This one product has changed her life, boost her confidence and made her more beautiful.</li>
            <li>Cure is more runny, and seems to spread more evenly and exfoliate with the best of them.</li>
            <li>My skin was nice and smooth and it looked great!</li>
            <li>Finally, I can say that this is indeed the best selling and the best exfoliator around in this period.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, mild cleanser.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and in great condition!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super impressed.</li>
            <li>This is the best exfoliator out there - gentle, yet very effective.</li>
            <li>I have never tried anything like it, and trust me, I have tried many many many beauty products!!!  </li>
            <li>There, I came across a bubzbeauty (very cool and adorable gal) channel and learned that CURE was Japan&#x27;s best selling exfoliater.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SUPER CLOSE TO GETTING IT!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SUPER CLOSE TO GETTING IT!!!  </li>
            <li>skin feels very, very smooth!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my very favorite products.  </li>
            <li>shes amazing and in her videos she gives really good explanations of why she is using the products she does</li>
            <li>I buy it just to use on my feet sometimes, tho is great for many places.</li>
            <li>I have not notice any great improvement in how my skin looks though so I&#x27;m wondering if exfoliation is important after all!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best exfoliating scrub out there; my St. Ives apricot exfoliating scrub would leave my combination skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>Fun to use and it works great!</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>And feeling beautiful naturally is a feeling that is priceless for any woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading so many reviews about how great this product was, I tried it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and after using for almost 6 months</li>
            <li>for the Aqua gel, I am very pleased with the results, will be buying back-up soon.</li>
            <li>glad I found out about this product great product</li>
            <li>I have been using this gel once a week for a couple of weeks now and have been very pleased with how it&#x27;s been working.</li>
            <li>Is amazing how good is this product .</li>
            <li>i used it one/twice a week and very pleased</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for lips, too, and I love to give myself a luxurious lip exfoliation when I&#x27;m feeling chapped.</li>
            <li>Very glad I ordered this product.</li>
            <li>gave it three stars to indicate a good face wash but not as an effective exfoliating agent.</li>
            <li>Amazing wonderful sexy fabulous gorgeous  </li>
            <li>I switched to Paula&#x27;s Choice (their BHA exfoliant is light years better for my skin than this product), and my skin is the best it has looked in years.</li>
            <li>so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I have the best performance wth this product the first time.</li>

            <li>I believe that the product is balling up itself and that the lumps created are not skin, but my skin feels amazing after using.  </li>
            <li>And I can also vouch for this being an AMAZING exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>And I had thought I was rather nicely exfoliated to begin</li>
            <li>Effective.</li>
            <li>and I really do consider this the best exfoliate without harming your skin.</li>
            <li>( Thank you for being so kind) on the bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(3) Extremely effective.  </li>
            <li>Works like an eraser to pull out sebaceous residue from pores and remove any residue of any kind on skin surface.</li>
            <li>so I kind of just gave up.</li>
            <li>I thought this was some kind of gimmick also.</li>
            <li>Hope they buy their own.</li>
            <li>I have tried also doing the top and bottom eyelid areas as well, with good results...</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best skin exfoliator ever.</li>
            <li>I can see why its so popular.  </li>
            <li>There are effective exfoliation products on the market</li>
            <li>This has no effect, its basically water with some kind of foaming agent....</li>
            <li>Exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li>Cure works effectively and you do not have to worry about burning your skin etc.</li>
            <li>I can see why it is a most loved product in Japan.  </li>
            <li>As mentioned, once makeup is applied, you may still notice dryness depending on severity of your own face&#x27;s condition--but texturally speaking, it does make your skin feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All of them combine don&#x27;t work as effectively as this stuff.</li>
            <li>Now I want to make my OWN demo video!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What comes off is its own product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it never makes contact with your skin because it builds its own barrier.</li>
            <li>nice surprise</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this on my face anymore, but on my body, where it still is nice to see clumps of formula/dead skin cells come off every so often.</li>
            <li>The nice shop assistant gave me a sample to take home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i could honestly do without it</li>
            <li>I wish this company would start their own website for us USA citizens already.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still buy it in the states for the price because it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
            <li>and I do see the &amp;#34;rolls of skin&amp;#34; forming, but honestly it cannot be skin.</li>
            <li>Aqua Gel is absolutely THE BEST you can get.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have the directions, ingredients, and any warnings translated and enclosed with the package purchase.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to try a product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d bought this product because I&#x27;d seen so many good reviews on it, and boy does it meet expectations.</li>
            <li>How I ordered this product was because I heard it was the number 1 selling exfoliating product in Japan, being so popular that it doesn&#x27;t even need to advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even now I still can&#x27;t believe how nice my face feels.</li>
            <li>and my skin is just so nice and silky now.</li>
            <li>~three times a week, it is really effective.</li>
            <li>but honestly it doesn&#x27;t matter to me either way.</li>
            <li>* MAKE YOUR OWN EXFOLIANT:</li>
            <li>* MAKE YOUR OWN EXFOLIANT:</li>
            <li>Best gentle exfoliate ever.</li>
            <li>Product dries on it own.</li>
            <li>it is unbelievably effective and will not disappoint.</li>
            <li>This is kind of like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>and you think does this do more harm then good, but this products feels like jelly water.</li>
            <li>I rinsed off with warm water</li>
            <li>rinse your face with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found the product really nice after just one use.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I got ripped off because when I think of an exfoliating I assume it&#x27;s always a scrub</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product and I am so happy that I stumbled upon it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is looks like a foggy kind of water and its rather runny when you put it on your hands.</li>
            <li>my skin looks and feels so nice</li>
            <li>Works great - love how smooth it makes my skin!</li>
            <li>also it kind of smells like bleach</li>
            <li>so I have yet to observe what good this exfoliator will do more for my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a nonabrasive, nonirritating exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I wish I could buy this in the US because it is simply astounding</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I use this gel, and it works spectacularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved having smooth skin and thankfully I have good genes from my mother</li>
            <li>Nice touch.</li>
            <li>honestly, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>However even though my skin feels very good right now</li>
            <li>Working good, and fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is not that great, but the results are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to see the difference in time!!</li>
            <li>My face may feel &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s probably because of the alcohol in the product that gives your face the squeaky clean feel, but after using this item for a month, I do NOT see any great results.</li>
            <li>Great way to clean and exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Best exfoliator ive used so far!!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many cleansing product including some very famous one but none of them could satisfies me as this one does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty freaking incredible.</li>
            <li>clean!!</li>
            <li>I was in need of a new scrub and decided to give this one a try because I saw that it was a best seller.</li>
            <li>When I do get good results my skin is smooth and it gives it a nice hint of brightness and glow to it.</li>
            <li>Your face will feel amazing and baby soft and perfect to absorb your skin care</li>
            <li>After hearing so many good things about this product, I decided to splurge and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>There are so many good products with better price out there.</li>
            <li>Package came really quickly and I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed that I decided I really had to write a review immediately :).&lt;br</li>

            <li>br /&gt;- somewhat pricey, you might be able to make your own with some blended rosemary/ginkgo/aloe (but I have not tried)&lt;br</li>

            <li>Too good to be true</li>
            <li>Phenomenal product, innovative formula and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This works, but it is waterier than it should be, and you have to be very accurate with the timing and the amount of friction used.</li>
            <li>very important thing is that it does not contain parabens and alcohol.</li>
            <li>This is really great thing!I love it very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave your skin feeling very smooth, and feels like it has silicone in it.</li>

            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to rubbing your own skin off :D</li>
            <li>I tried the mildedst ones but none of them worked just as easily and effectively as Aqua Cure Gel.</li>

            <li>Parabens is a type of preservative (which is found in many skin care products)</li>
            <li>* The picture is of the Cure bottle and another one of my favorite products, Bior&amp;eacute;</li>
            <li>UV protection $11. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Guys, I am in love.</li>

            <li>I love the gel like feel.. then..</li>
            <li>This is one product that I will continue to purchase for sure.</li>
            <li>This is more watery than some liquid cleansers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it works on any skin type too.</li>
            <li>This products are well known to many beauty guru on Youtube, and it was the reason why I decided to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and will for sure buy again :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Its an OK cleanser (or</li>
            <li>most affects me--around my nostrils, and under my chin.    </li>
            <li>If you decide to apply this 2-3 times in a row, you may exfoliate all your epidermis, and you better cover up with an SPF lotion.    </li>
            <li>I am sure about this bc</li>
            <li>I thought for sure nothing would come off my face.  </li>
            <li>My foundation settles better on my skin and my skin seems a bit glowy if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>Ever since then I use it twice a week, along with Egyptian Magic to moisturize.</li>
            <li>The love it too.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>you could find much better exfoliator in Sephora.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s where I need exfoliation the most.  </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s &amp;#34;balling&amp;#34; and I can say for sure, that&#x27;s incorrect.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>If you watch the video, the person talking says that it&#x27;s okay to apply the product twice, in a way</li>
            <li>From a cleansing point of view, it is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I also felt like my skin broke out more after using it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I</li>
            <li>my cure was wrapped safely in a bubble wrap too.  </li>
            <li>The Cure Aqua Gel is okay.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love that it is from Japan.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>Does what it says, exfoliates, better than anything else</li>
            <li>and I know many factors could have influenced the answers</li>
            <li>A cleanser- use any of your preference, i haven&#x27;t found a favorite yet.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>This is only my opinion and my craziness :D</li>
            <li>I love Asian skin care products; they are the best!  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>The skin is noticeably lighter, softer, and more healthy/alive looking after the product is used, which basically means that you are *</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Okay..</li>
            <li>Would not recommend, more watery than anything.  </li>
            <li>Like it, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this !</li>
            <li>Light but effective exfoliate product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks flawless, oil free, soft, and glowing without any shine when I use this product.</li>
            <li>BEST FACIAL PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for any type of skin, because it&#x27;s made up of mostly hydrogen water.</li>
            <li>I love it, after using, my skin feel like baby skin.</li>
            <li>love this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so satisfying seeing all the gunk that comes off your skin.</li>
            <li>A great exfoliant that is gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>Really love this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not supposed to do it more than twice a week (which, even that seems like a lot for chemical peels).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether the beads are skin cells or not, but I do know that while I was using it, I noticed no change in my skin except more redness, more dryness, and more tenderness.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth!</li>
            <li>However, make sure to wash it off at night, because it can clog pores leading to breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re more than three times the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this product at night after I get out of the shower and in the morning my skin looks so healthy and glowy.</li>
            <li>it was like magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more and more</li>
            <li>Feel my skin texture is much more smoother than before.</li>
            <li>(I know - cute),</li>
            <li>that sure if it worked, but as I&#x27;ve been using it (for around 3 months now), I&#x27;ve tried it many times when my skin has been peeling</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been able to witness the effects well.</li>
            <li>Okay I have a clarsonic</li>
            <li>This product has shone me the light!</li>
            <li>Serums work better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and she just fell in love it</li>
            <li>So its ok.</li>
            <li>I even considered applying to be a US distributor myself, just so I could be sure to get it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wish I did more research before purchasing it.</li>
            <li>and there was a top layer of skin that did not want to shed.</li>
            <li>Has completly changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li>,you can use it everyday,it is safe to you</li>
            <li>It is more a want than need.</li>
            <li>The best I can say is, it hasn&#x27;t done any actual harm to my skin.</li>
            <li>My make-up sits better, and my skin tone is more ever.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>so i think its more of a heat thing, I&#x27;m not too sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Magical.</li>
            <li>I wish this would have been available to me 40 years ago!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product..</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item after many months of research and reading many reviews.</li>
            <li>Looks like this will be a staple product for me! :)</li>
            <li>When I tried this I immediately fell in love</li>
            <li>like I said I love this I do reccomend it</li>
            <li>It goes without saying that foundation goes on better, too.</li>
            <li>That said, by the time I set with powder, I still notice some dryness about 50-60% of the time--but it&#x27;s MUCH better than without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some more googling went on</li>
            <li>I do use this way more</li>
            <li>I use jasmine water Bb cream for foundation and my skin looks better now</li>
            <li>my friend was visiting me and she love it.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite exfoliant ever.</li>
            <li>, I ordered two more.</li>
            <li>I like it,I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it every now again, until I can find something better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I gambled and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a much better deal for your money</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be sure you get the translated directions and make sure you know how to use</li>
            <li>but this gel is much more diluted.</li>
            <li>I think it helps masks and moisturizers to better penetrate my skin.</li>
            <li>i love this product work like wonders</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>For me, I find that after using Cure, I like to use my favorite mask, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The sulfur mask is nice and light and after using it your skin feels tighter and clearer.</li>
            <li>how many times I put it on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, maybe if it were able to get everything off in 1</li>
            <li>have ordered two more bottles</li>
            <li>my face feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;m very impressed and will purchase again when it runs out.</li>
            <li>This is ok.</li>
            <li>Love this exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>I can use it more than the suggested 2 to 3 times a week; I&#x27;ve used it every day but then breaking from using it for a day or two depending on the dryness of my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I also love to use this on my elbows and feet.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use more than twice a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and seems to retain moisture better as a result.</li>
            <li>Will buy this again :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Even after using my favorite cleanser, I could see bits of makeup stained skin pilling up with the gel balls.  </li>
            <li>Maybe max 2x for more oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is now my can&#x27;t-live-without-it favorite product.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t work with your skin, then maybe pass it on to a friend who might be able to benefit from its magic.</li>
            <li>But after going through 5 sample packets, my skin was significantly better.</li>
            <li>And when I put lotion on after it worked way better than it ever had before.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get nearly as many zits or bumps.</li>
            <li>and you should be able to find some.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this.  </li>
            <li>I would love it more if it was slightly more like a gel</li>
            <li>Cleaner than my Clarisonic and more exfoliated than when I use microdermabrasion crystals in my face wash.</li>
            <li>I would not reccommend using it more than twice a week.</li>
            <li>start rubbing it onto your face and watch the magic work.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure many are going to disagree with me.</li>
            <li>I love it for the backs of my legs and arms too.</li>
            <li>Suspicion confirmed - I&#x27;ve been tricked!</li>
            <li>I trust the many reviews that have proven that it works.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and follow with a moisturizing mask and find that my face lotions sink in much better after using this then when I used a grittier exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>so I forgot :)</li>
            <li>does cost more than most exfoliators, but I have noticed it has lasted longer than any of them that I have used.</li>
            <li>I have gotten many friends to switch over to this.</li>
            <li>and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li>I have the confidence to go makeup free any day now!</li>
            <li>In LOVE with this product... item came faster than i excepted</li>
            <li>Love it, I used to pay 60 USD for a trial sized equivalent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>awww nice skin after using.</li>
            <li>I think I have more breakouts now</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li>this is the best facial product I have ever got.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most off-putting part of this product is the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the result.</li>
            <li>I love it does not have fragrance.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Is &#x27;considered&#x27; safe for use in hair rinse-off products and for use at concentrations of up to 0.25% in leave-on hair products.</li>
            <li>Dermal exposure is &#x27;considered&#x27; safe up to 2%.&lt;br /&gt;-Aloe</li>
            <li>: We all know this one :-)&lt;br /&gt;-Gingko</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right after using this I have noticed that my skin is brighter, plumper, more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Besides that it does all that it promises :)</li>
            <li>I feel like i had better results from apricot scrub.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of minutes I felt the top layer of the skin come off.  </li>
            <li>LIKE :-)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better and better.  </li>
            <li>Now, it just looks better, and feels softer.</li>
            <li>so I was expecting greater results upon using product.</li>
            <li>I think I may prefer MyFaceshop product better</li>
            <li>Interesting stuff.  </li>
            <li>But I do wonder what it&#x27;s made of, and if it&#x27;s safe for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned for me it works better if I put it on and let it sit for about a 1/2 min before rubbing.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to read most of the reviews before purchasing this.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>More even skin color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i found this product.</li>
            <li>Give it a try and you will totally love  this.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Interesting chemistry.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>My favorite exfoliator</li>
            <li>Just a heads up :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK in my book.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel nice and smooth after I use it</li>
            <li>but my skin also feels nice and smooth after I use an apricot scrub or an exfoliating face towel.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The Cure (which is a bit over the top in the name) is really an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking visibly better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no equivalent product in the US, and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries this.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay with that trade off.</li>
            <li>Probably will not buy another one :)</li>
            <li>and it felt like healthy baby</li>
            <li>I squeeze a bit more gel on my hands and continue, thinking maybe the gel is coagulating or something.</li>
            <li>I put on some lotion and stared at the bottle of hoodoo magic for a bit before setting it on the counter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product but</li>
            <li>LOVE lOVE</li>
            <li>on OpenSky (Molly Sims endorsed it there), ordered their product and found it worked better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I often find that when in search of an exfoliant for my face, I tend to think that the more abrasive the product, the better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more affordable )around $15.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>There is no nasty drying or stinging</li>
            <li>Skin79&#x27;s gel is more gel-like and thicker, which I think is easier in the application.</li>
            <li>Works just as most of these reviews say, and I can tell a difference in the texture of my skin immediately after cleansing.</li>
            <li>and I feel safe.</li>
            <li>The Korean water peels are a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love the glow and feel of my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li>Now that my skin is looking and feeling better</li>
            <li>Its the perfect fit for overly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I love love love this product I use after cleansing almost every day  </li>
            <li>my lotions and potions all sink in much better</li>
            <li>Exfoliates better than any scrub or even my clarisonic .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a watery consistency</li>
            <li>I found most at-home</li>
            <li>so my skin sheds a bit more</li>
            <li>My skin truly has never looked better than it does now.</li>
            <li>make sure you use sunscreen with this product.</li>
            <li>just so I can be sure I won&#x27;t run out of it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and this item will be an ongoing part of my skin care for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>so I cannot use most exfoliating products as they cause my skin to become irritated.</li>
            <li>He is pleased with the results also.  </li>
            <li>I use every day, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Like most of my favorite products I stumbled across this accidentally one day when looking for an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll buy it from you :)</li>
            <li>and I always my skin has gone softer and more radiant.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Just like water:)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I try to use this twice a week at the most.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It works and satisfyingly so.</li>
            <li>This does a great job, it is not harsh on my face and leaves it looking smooth and bright.</li>
            <li>I say most because even if I go over my skin 3 times with this product, I&#x27;ll sometimes still see flakes around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the feeling of rubbing it on my face and seeing the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34;  come off.  </li>
            <li>I did some research when it was time to get more</li>
            <li>This formula is a bit more watery than you would expect a gel to be.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling refreshing.</li>
            <li>This was just okay for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just okay to me....</li>
            <li>That was OK, sorta.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li>I think the problem is that I keep my skin very well exfoliated and fresh with the Holika Holika Egg Soap, Perfect Whip, a pore scrubber, and Wonder Pore Freshner.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m baffled how this brand has</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use more.</li>
            <li>I have literally become a spokesperson for this product because I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>top layer)</li>
            <li>I love Cure.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use the Clarisonic brush for cleansing my face, plus a toner with salicylic acid, so my exfoliation needs are not that many.</li>
            <li>Any moisturizer I put on after that made it hurt even more.</li>
            <li>Japanese products are great!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>It looks more even.</li>
            <li>Love this!❤️</li>
            <li>and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser/exfoliater.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>My complexion always looks better after I exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I feel moisturizers and vitamin C penetrates better with use of product.  </li>
            <li>But the thing is, I love exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>And I tried it on a surface to make sure it doesn&#x27;t just automatically clump up</li>
            <li>I also watched a couple of videos on Youtube to make sure I understood how to use it.  </li>
            <li>My make up goes on better.</li>
            <li>Most of those people didn&#x27;t use it correctly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like rubbing plastic drops on your skin...</li>
            <li>it is not your skin cells for sure.</li>
            <li>Continue with the rest of your skincare routine (cleanser, toner, repairing lotion, treatment, moisturizer, etc.)and keep in mind that if you use a micro-exfoliating cleanser like Proactiv, that you should use is as a more of a 1 minute wash off mask</li>
            <li>This is one of the best facial products I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li>Your face will be silky smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li>and makeup go on and look much better.</li>
            <li>There are so many great videos on YouTube showing how to use it, but you really don&#x27;t even need to watch one.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean, my pores diminished and my complexion looks more even after using this product.</li>
            <li>This product has a very unique way of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I originally said this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>i was very excited to purchase this producti.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how good it is!</li>
            <li>My face is so nice and clean after using CURE.  </li>
            <li>My biggest worry was if the bottle would break during its travel and the packaging was good and safe and fast too!</li>
            <li>It was a good exfoliator as it gets the job done very very well, but in terms of softening my skin, it didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>Mild, effective and harmless, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Japan really has some amazing products !</li>
            <li>Great Japanese beauty cult favorite!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect at first that this would be really good</li>
            <li>I rinse with warm water, then cool water and pat</li>
            <li>it is a reaalllly good gentle exfoliator!</li>
            <li>works pretty good.</li>
            <li>then got my 10 yr old niece to try it (who still has that beautiful baby type skin)</li>
            <li>My Daughter has some skin issues and CURE has cleared her up pretty good.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m noticing some pretty good results.</li>
            <li>This was a knock off rip off of the original!</li>
            <li>and i was so excited!</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best applied to dry skin after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>so I was glad to find this one easily on amazon.</li>
            <li>then I was even more ecstatic that it is sold on Amazon &#x3D; Easy acess.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s colorless and scentless, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use a strong moisturizer (I use a moisturizing face mask) after using this.</li>
            <li>It works best after a shower or bath and when skin is completely dry.  </li>
            <li>but I really liked how quickly it worked.  </li>
            <li>I love it and strongly recommend it~</li>
            <li>But to my dismay, this awesome skin care line is now opting for cheaper ingredients, not to mention dry patches and oily clogged pores</li>
            <li>Works best with a dry face and hands.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but admire my own new skin &amp; my confidence has skyrocketed!!!!  </li>
            <li>This is literally the single best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I always feel 100% clean when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li>But it does make me feel clean!</li>
            <li>Im sure alot of people will disagree with me and thats fine.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>It rinses clean!</li>
            <li>Rinse with warm water until your face feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>This is very cool.  </li>
            <li>It is a very cool product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like this replaces that, but it makes it more effective because your skin is super clean and prepped for anything.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t know that my skin could ever feel that soft and great.</li>
            <li>Like I&#x27;ve said before, I have sensitive skin and it works great.</li>
            <li>best of all, it leaves my skin super clean and soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best $26 I spent for my skin.</li>
            <li>The store has a tester available and I put a pump on my forearm, massage it into my skin and so many greyish residue come out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great exfoliator, and my skin feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li>Many primers also use silicone because it does give a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>great product leaves the skin so soft  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid anti-aging prevention ranger for my own skin for many years now.  </li>
            <li>Japan sure do know their skincare, What I like most is that there are no harsh beads or granulate particles in most exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I mention this because others seem to have gotten tampered bottles filled with rubbing alcohol and that is not the authentic product.</li>
            <li>I can see how my makeup will go on so much more smoothly.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth, and even looks better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made in the US, their ingredients are clearly printed on the label, and their customer service is great.  </li>
            <li>My BB cream glides on my face more smoothly.</li>
            <li>4 stars...pretty good, but want to know if it&#x27;s really doing what it appears to be doing.</li>
            <li>I do weekly Lactic peels but wanted to make sure that in between I was getting in a gentle exfoliation to make the peel more effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wondered for years why there wasn&#x27;t something like this that could just kind of dissolve the outer layer of skin to leave the fresh underlayer.  </li>
            <li>and I do not have to use it very often to get good results (I use it once every 2-3 weeks).</li>
            <li>but this gentle solution seems to do a good job at exfoliating skin.</li>
            <li>Since it is so mild, I just need to use more every time and more often, like twice a week.</li>
            <li>little miracle; bet exfoliator ever, I use it on my face and body, works like a charm, my skin is beautiful and soft, scalling is gone, I love it !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Very effective and also clear my keratosis pilaris on my arm</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sensitive and you just rinse the debris off with warm water and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li>Very light weight, gentle gel, was immediately effective in exfoliating my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>After washing the product off, my face felt soft and beautiful and clean.</li>
            <li>Cool product!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this!</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers I would say that this is one of the awesome product you should use for exfoliating for your face.</li>
            <li>Those Asians have some of the coolest and most unique makeup and skincare products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so excited about this exfoliator after trying it out...and have been using it on all my friends :)</li>
            <li>This stuff is so cool!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use this MAXIMUM once a week, or once every other week if you use a micro-exfoliating cleanser like Proactiv.</li>
            <li>is one of those products that is actually \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>It has a simple formula also that is free of fragrance which is very good for the skin.</li>
            <li>for best results I found every other day works best (at least for my skin)combined with a nice mask afterwrds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not the prettiest, most charming girl in the world, I&#x27;m just THAT much more confident now because of my baby soft, super smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>That easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it seemed like they&#x27;d be easy to extract at that point.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>But more amazingly, after about a week of use, it has gently removed about 30% of a discoloration caused by a popped pimple.  </li>
            <li>Very mild and no scent.</li>
            <li>The product is great, shipping was a day early which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>but oils are good too if you want a more natural way)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is by far the best exfoliation product around, gentle and effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Product was easy to wash off</li>
            <li>After using this product my face looks more clean and polished.</li>
            <li>I had received Cure as a Christmas present and I was literally filled with Christmas \\&quot;glee;\\&quot; after hearing so many good things about it from beauty gurus such as Bubzbeauty I was about to begin a wonderful exfoliating journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A clean and dry face is recommended for best results before using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to notice this because there will be areas that feel raised as you scrub this product on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;ve never used a chemical exfoliant, go easy my friend.</li>
            <li>but the product was easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li>My skin is now glowing and are so easy to unslough with fingers alone.</li>
            <li>Liquid is easy to apply and massage into skin.</li>
            <li>I read some of the good reviews of this gel and order one, however it doesn&#x27;t work as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>but she said the gel was a bit too strong for her skin.</li>
            <li>I Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt or burn at all, but I still strongly considered consulting a doctor because of the amount of skin that came off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most gentle and effective exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>This make your skin smooth, soft, clean and so touchable and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I am very light skinned, with mild sensitivity to &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>Usually other sites sell these for $40 or more!!!</li>
            <li>I just finished my first two weeks using Cure, and it is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It may be because they have access to some pretty amazing (and often inexpensive) skincare technology.  </li>
            <li>This product, cure natural aqua gel, is amazing!</li>
            <li>just wish it was as effective as the first application.</li>
            <li>This product is suppose to last 3 months so think of it as putting $20 a month for beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>Nice and gentle exfoliation!</li>
            <li>Have you ever noticed that Japanese and Korean women have remarkably beautiful skin?</li>
            <li>Skin is nice and soft after it, you can see for sure top layer of the skin is gone</li>
            <li>Face skin feels so clean and smooth after use it. :-)</li>
            <li>But my skin feels nice, clean , and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>Best exfoliator I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li>Great products, have been using it weeks now (twice a week), feel great, and it really works as lot other customers said.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have had a 100% improvement in my breakouts and fine line reduction since I began using this about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li>Along the jaw line you might need to \\&quot;pluck\\&quot; off some debris from the fine hairs.    </li>
            <li>Best part, it costs way, way, less.  </li>
            <li>Best part, it costs way, way, less.  </li>
            <li>so I figure its fine.</li>
            <li>I have previously used this product before, and when I ran out and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to repurchase, even though it was the best exfoliator I ever used.</li>
            <li>Works best on slight damp skin.</li>
            <li>I used about three pumps on my face with each go around and rubbed in light circles until the balls stopped forming easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what is in this product, but I&#x27;ve tried many exfoliators and this one is definitely on my top 10.</li>
            <li>, I use Retin-A on my forehead to keep fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li>is just fine.</li>
            <li>so it was fine.</li>
            <li>The first use was great and seemed promising.</li>
            <li>Package came in quick and neatly bubble wrapped which came with samples!</li>
            <li>good, very natural peeling</li>
            <li>I guess this is good for those with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Probably better used as a gentle exfoliater for those who have pretty good skin</li>
            <li>This is so easy and gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>Good product; didn&#x27;t irritate my skin; my skin felt very soft and smooth after I used it.  </li>
            <li>After my first try, my skin felt very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>and it is far more better than my expectation!</li>
            <li>Using it again right away exfoliated away my new, happy skin and it hurt.</li>
            <li>I called and they were super nice and sent me the bag right away.  </li>
            <li>Of course, I was a little suspicious, that&#x27;s just my nature, but this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my baby smooth skin after the very first time using this!</li>
            <li>It feels nice to gently massage after a weekend in the sun or a night wearing makeup to leave a smooth surface, but it won&#x27;t fix every problem.  </li>
            <li>the price is accurate as it is also around 30 bucks in Japan</li>
            <li>It really does exfoliate well and leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>So I guess that&#x27;s important to consider--</li>
            <li>Fantastic exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I heard about Cure and decided to order sample packs (you can get free samples from Beauty Carousel or buy them on eBay)</li>
            <li>and i got it scratch free.  </li>
            <li>so it leaves my face smooth</li>
            <li>This exfoliating gel starts working almost as soon as I apply it, and makes my skin feel so smooth.  </li>

            <li>I like how smooth it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>My face wasn&#x27;t remarkably smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have used many facial exfoliators in my day and this is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li>(I think) it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>baby-soft, smooth skin with no drying or irritation.</li>

            <li>I had used a light chemical peel to remove the skin and that did not work.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so smooth and silky</li>
            <li>/&gt;we think it&#x27;s a fantastic product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>I use a sugar scrub/mask once a week as well, but my akin never feels as smooth as when I use this.</li>
            <li>your toner/moisturizer is also absorbed better on account of using it.</li>

            <li>Overall i think the product is great.</li>

            <li>Super easy to use...</li>
            <li>It has truely lives up to its claim and is both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>This is a gentle exfoliant (which makes more sense for facial skin) with a nice touch of moisturizer that feels so nice after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am always trying new products and this is now at the top of my favorite list.  </li>
            <li>minutes made my face feel very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that does best when it is left alone.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any significant changes on my face....</li>
            <li>On the bottle, it says to use it twice a week, but since it&#x27;s so gentle, I&#x27;m able to use it almost everyday with wonderful results.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this product.</li>
            <li>It was the same kind of stinging I get from applying a 15% TCA peel!  </li>
            <li>#1:  This stuff is for real, most definitely.  </li>
            <li>I need to modify my original review.</li>
            <li>love this product so much!</li>
            <li>but this is awesome, It really does get rid of excess skin leaving soft and ready for lotion/mask skin</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t look like the face I had started with, it was significantly brighter.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>What a bargain for such an effective product!</li>
            <li>It is worth every dime!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt that Japanese often come out with the most magical skin care products!</li>
            <li>Simple to use, effective, and does what it claims!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my face and it worked</li>
            <li>excellent exfoliator of dead skin!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Having clear skin is very important to me and this is a life saver!</li>
            <li>You must have!Very useful!</li>
            <li>So excited about this product, I&#x27;m gifting it out to my friends.  </li>
            <li>When I received this item I was extremely excited and used it immediately.</li>
            <li>Ok first of all it smells like alcohol and when you start to rub your skin it burns</li>
            <li>:) This product has really worked miracles for my skin!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it out that I immediately opened it and rubbed two or three pumps onto my face.</li>
            <li>In general, I have found the skin care products made in Korea to be superior to those made elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>This is where I first bought the Hankook product and then order more from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this exfoliator for my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited that this product is in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>This product is truly worth the price!</li>
            <li>Originally found this at trade show.</li>
            <li>but well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Love it work very well for exfoliating!</li>
            <li>This is the most gentle exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>With the first use you will notice a fresher, cleaner, more even complexion.</li>
            <li>Love it from the first use</li>
            <li>Overall, this is best exfoliate product so far!</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in 15-20 days of use yet.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth checking out!</li>
            <li>Very good exfoliator,  leaves  skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>Excellent amazing removes all the dead skin like no other product!</li>
            <li>Get all of the skin around the face and rinse off cleanly.</li>
            <li>My face is clean after..</li>
            <li>Finally, after a week of use, I&#x27;ve also discovered that my Ponds pore strips are much more effective now on my pores.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for sloughing off dead skin and giving the face a fresh clean look.</li>
            <li>It did make my skin feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 months and its by far the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used, beating out my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>After I use this on my face, it feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Clean smelling.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean or remove dirt.</li>
            <li>All my skin care products feel more effective, my skin simply RADIATES with sunshine from within.  </li>
            <li>Saying what I have the really big question is do I want to spend that kind of money on a product that I can&#x27;t be sure if it works?</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after I&#x27;m done using it.</li>
            <li>I give a four cause my face still need to feel clean</li>
            <li>Start with a washed clean face and put the product on your face avoiding your eye</li>
            <li>yeah my face is clean and then the so called balls form once the product is rubbed for a min.</li>
            <li>Rub this gel on a clean surface, I used a glass.</li>
            <li>Loved the product, light exfoliator,nice for daily use.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think it will help clean my face.</li>
            <li>squeaky clean after.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face feels clean but not overstripped.</li>
            <li>this is great for people who have dry skin or like me</li>
            <li>After rinsing, your face is soooo smooth and feels fresh and light.</li>
            <li>Cure is Magic in a bottle, best kept secret in Japan.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best facial wash product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Your face will feel super smooth and clean just after one use.</li>
            <li>I put it on my face twice a week, though your face feels clean</li>
            <li>My skin felt &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; but without any physical or chemical irritation and that it enabled the softening water and moisturizer that I use to penetrate more effectively afterward.  </li>
            <li>,, it leave your face fealing so clean</li>
            <li>It lit your skin shine and clean</li>
            <li>Works great for exfoliating my face, gets the rough peely skin off and makes my face smooth</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling clean and supple.</li>
            <li>it does make my face feel clean.</li>
            <li>I believe with continuos use I&#x27;ll be pimple and acne scar free very soon :).</li>
            <li>Now my face is clean.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job making your skin feel soft and smooth but no miracle.</li>
            <li>It does moisturize as it contains a dose of glycerin and is good for sensitive skin mainly because it&#x27;s mostly water and unscented, but it smells a bit like chlorine to me.</li>
            <li>After I read many positive reviews, I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this is the FIRST exfoliator that is the most gentle, non-irritated product yet exfoliates the most off my face.  </li>
            <li>I have to say how surprised I am to read that there is anyone out there who isn&#x27;t completely in love with this product!</li>
            <li>Its a bit messy, so best to use right before showering.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it could be easily found out online, but it would be much more convenient to have it on the actual bottle.</li>
            <li>gel would probably best fit sensitive or minimally dry skin.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because after I do a good job exfoliating other skin care product and hydrating masks can be absorb more easily&lt;br</li>
            <li>At any rate, I was so impressed that I decided to exfoliate a second time, and this time when I rinsed, it was like i rinsed off my old face and revealed a NEW one!!!!</li>
            <li>It certainly feels as if my face has been exfoliated better than ever, and it also feels gentler than any exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>If you are doubting getting this than stop right there!</li>
            <li>This was right after I had scrubbed my face with a blackhead scrub (baking soda and orange juice)!</li>
            <li>Forever customer right here!</li>
            <li>One great thing about it is that it allows other products like serums or moisturizers to be absorbed more effectively, so it really is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I take very good care of my skin and exfoliate, yet this still found  dead skin... after exfoliating.</li>
            <li>When the bottle arrived I was super excited as I&#x27;ve wanted this for sometime.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this seller, my product was intact when i received it, it was carefully bubble wrapped</li>
            <li>I used to have to be very creative with concealer in order to hide it, now my light foundation is enough.  </li>
            <li>Cure Natural Aqua Gel is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for rough heels, elbows, and knees, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watery and glides onto the face pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>It is strange and wonderful all at once, and my skin ends up so soft, and the hyper-pigmentation I suffer from seems to lighten each time I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely hooked on this amazing product.</li>
            <li>It is made up of mostly water and it works great getting all of the dead skin off of your face!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was hoping it would be, a gentle and effective exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Not too many products really do what they say.  </li>
            <li>before I buy the full product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the product so far.  </li>
            <li>This is the most gentle exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product..</li>
            <li>.. cause everything it claims its absolutely true..</li>
            <li>surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t have any blue bead.</li>
            <li>Overall, good buy</li>
            <li>and I love the gentle exfoliating on my can-be-problematic skin.</li>
            <li>I am able to use this exfoliator once every 2 days; that&#x27;s how gentle and nonabrasive</li>
            <li>I believe the maker of the product developed something that does some kind of chemical change producing gobs of something that the masses think is exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>it is wise to use this on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, always see a difference, and people comment on my skin more.</li>
            <li>BUT  everyone loves it and wants more,.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I began using it as a full body exfoliator just to use it up</li>
            <li>If you buy it with one of the nylon towels, you can exfoliate and then hop in the shower for a full rinse.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a pump that is a good size for extensive use.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that this is true.</li>
            <li>just knowing it works is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I was drying out my face too much, which was in turn also probably causing more of that flakiness, which I think would trap dirt and oil under my skin.</li>
            <li>I am a true believer in the benefits of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It may be the holy grail for many people, but this item just doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to love this product</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m good for the next three years unless I give them away.</li>
            <li>I love this thing so much.</li>
            <li>so the price was a heck of a lot more reasonable.</li>
            <li>This is the most gentle exfoliator one can buy.</li>
            <li>WHERE near as effective.  </li>
            <li>I think that is true.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this exfoliator. 1.</li>
            <li>my skin is left smooth, even and better able to absorb my skin care products.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use it twice a day, but that&#x27;s because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t much to exfoliate off once you&#x27;ve started to maintain your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this product earlier this year after hearing good reviews.</li>
            <li>After looking up the ingredients online, I realized this was true - alcohol mixes with plasticizers and balls up on your skin.</li>
            <li>Used about once a month on those areas it keeps those areas nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This is way more gentle than using the exfoliates that have the beads in them.  </li>
            <li>So cool and unclogs all dirt out of my skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels super clean, cleaner than using my apricot scrub</li>
            <li>Better products for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Its 90% water which is really cool, and</li>
            <li>It is much more gentle than particle ones and still works well.</li>
            <li>my favorite gentle exfoliant.</li>
            <li>This is a really GENTLE product unlike most.</li>
            <li>product is a FANTASY COME TRUE for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Decide to see if all the hype was true on this product.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I will continue to use this as a way to gently get all the flakies away :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s akin to using a pencil eraser on your face but much more gentle.</li>
            <li>Back to the superior product.</li>
            <li>Speaking off of that this product will last you a good while</li>
            <li>PTR has the similar product works good but pricy.</li>
            <li>This is such a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda smells like a gasoline type smell but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>exfoliation itself was not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation process is super easy and pretty clean:</li>
            <li>but again, nothing special, for an extraordinary price.</li>
            <li>It does not include perfumes or colors or most of any strong chemicals for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive, but it reacts nicely to this brand.</li>
            <li>because of the super fast free shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m on the hunt again for my tried and super true exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m on the hunt again for my tried and super true exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>It does everything it&#x27;s said to do and has made a real positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Love it cause it works well with all the types of skin specially that I have a very sensitive one and till now it works as it described!</li>
            <li>When my face is very clean and pre washed it doesn&#x27;t gel up as much.</li>
            <li>Works great for minimizing pore size, but needed to use it every other day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very fair skinned blonde with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After reading good reviews and because my skin tends to like Japanese product better since I used to live there, I decided to try Cure.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feels so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>My face felt so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is the best beauty product I have ever bought for myself.</li>
            <li>Got here quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t observed any extraordinary exfoliation results.  </li>
            <li>In route, I&#x27;ve researched, invested, and tried many, many products from drug stores to $$$ stores and also from different countries.  </li>
            <li>current exfoliater is a bit more grainy than needed, served me better in the summer.  </li>
            <li>:) I will definitely be purchasing more before I run out.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency toward adult acne, joy, and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mild chemical peel in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Using this 2-3 times a week helps to keep my skin looking much more smooth, soft, and radiant than ever before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say much because this product already has a following, but this things is great.</li>
            <li>One bottle lasted almost 3 years, so the value is tremendous.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a gentle, but effective exfoliator-</li>
            <li>But luckily i found a comparable product from natures republic.</li>
            <li>super soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my t zone is super oily and</li>
            <li>my skin has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was given to me as a trial gift.</li>
            <li>Doesnt do anyting, Super overpriced</li>
            <li>Pretty happy that I have an in-home solution for a problem that has plagued me for a long time.</li>
            <li>; Most recently I use Acnefree (better than proactiv)</li>
            <li>It takes me awhile for the stuff to works on me though maybe because my skin is super clogged or something I don&#x27;t know because I almost never exfoliate.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Lotion seems to absorb so much better now, and my make up actually applies on so smooth now!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s skin that everyone keeps claiming I think it turns into a mild exfoliant  ...</li>
            <li>Ten outta ten best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and smooth my skin feels afterwards.  </li>
            <li>sent the item quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>read another reviewer&#x27;s tips, and she&#x27;s right about how the product works better if you gently massage it into your skin in circular motions.</li>
            <li>As soon as you start rubbing this gel on your face it turns into an extremely soft exfoliator -- very unique and extremely effective; it left my face feeling smooth and fresh!  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product - gently exfoliates, not much product needed per use, easy on sensitive</li>
            <li>This is very gentle and can be use everyday after a good makeup off to making sure everything is clean under pores</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; in the dark (LOL)</li>
            <li>From the first use I have had glowing smooth skin</li>
            <li>The product description states that using the product will make your other skin care products more effective.</li>
            <li>You can feel the difference from the very first application</li>
            <li>This is an okay product and you must make sure your face is clean and dry before you apply</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time too which makes it a good value.</li>
            <li>it perfect new condition in less than 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can see my skin is more clear and clean</li>
            <li>My absolute new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had laser done on my breasts (three grand!!), which only minimized the marks by maybe 10% and the doctor recommended 3 more packages of 3 sessions (nine extra grand--no way!), so those \\&quot;tiger stripes\\</li>
            <li>and it sure seems to do a great job of exfoliating the dead top layer of skin, especially if you&#x27;re using retinol or Retin-A.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin feel so soft and smooth and CLEAN!</li>
            <li>Nice product, different from all the other, does a great job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for black heads.  </li>
            <li>Normally, my skin doesn&#x27;t respond all that great to standard exfoliators.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a pretty good size of this stuff for $30 and will last me for months.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased, and would highly recommend Cure!</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use and is very affective.</li>
            <li>While not ALL of it came off the first time I used it last night, a GOOD portion came off.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t make a fair judgment on the actual process without consistent biweekly uses.</li>
            <li>She loved it, she said she had a dry patch on her chin</li>
            <li>Gentle, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>First of all, what I love about this scrub is that it has watery consistency, so it&#x27;s extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>Also, my boyfriend (who used to never do much to take care of his skin because skin care products &amp;#34;don&#x27;t do anything&amp;#34;), uses this more than I do.</li>
            <li>was good on m face, didn&#x27;t over dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright not like magical but it does the job and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I feel clean after using the production.that &#x27;s very gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing gentle EXFOLIATOR that gently sloughs off that first layer of skin.</li>
            <li>it can be addicting;)!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for everyone!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a neat idea, but there are better products out there!</li>
            <li>but she was hesitate, after bunch of times asking, my mom finally gave it a try and immediately fell in love with CURE!</li>
            <li>A ton of skin came off of my face first try!</li>
            <li>It left my skin more radiant after I applied my moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Product does exactly what it says and anyone CAN use it!</li>
            <li>so glad it came early!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: Highly Highly Recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>This works pretty well!</li>
            <li>They each ordered their own bottle and bought me a new one since they used so much of mine while they visited on vacation.</li>
            <li>If this gel is available in store near you, I strongly recommend you try the tester to see if it would works for your skin.</li>
            <li>The gel immediately clings to the makeup and pulls it off with the top layer of skin, easy to see when you&#x27;ve cleaned it all because the beads run white again.</li>
            <li>have to think your other skin care products will be able to work much better now that you have truly clean skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant right now</li>
            <li>I was really excited of the fact that cure is made up with 91% of hydrogen water because at this point water was the only thing which was suitable for my skin</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what this does but no elbow grease needed and nothing to clean.</li>
            <li>The instructions are to clean the face first, so</li>
            <li>My face feels pretty clean after the use.</li>
            <li>I works just as advertised; very easy and gentle on skin while leaving my skin squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li>You know the kind with the dry skin in top that makeup only draws more attention to?</li>
            <li>This product is a great exfoliating and with little effort.  </li>
            <li>Now, I can feel comfortable in my own clear, radiant, soft skin!</li>
            <li>I wonder why US brands haven&#x27;t made a similar product because this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I imagine this would be great to use after a peel as well to help slough off the dead skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super smooth, clean, and clear after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing product - I&#x27;m a big fan now.  </li>
            <li>After I finish washing my face, it feels incredibly smooth and much like baby skin.</li>
            <li>Simple amazing.</li>
            <li>This is by far much kinder to the skin and has amazing results.</li>
            <li>Gosh where do I begin, this is such an amazing product</li>
            <li>Received fast and secure, thank you.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why so many people say that this product is amazing, SO DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I use a Clairsonic a few times a week, which works great, but I&#x27;m always looking for products to help exfoliate my skin since my pores are always getting clogged.</li>
            <li>He even uses moisturizer now, because he wants to keep his skin as smooth as it is after he uses this gel.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason japanese women and men are known for their amazing skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and I will stock up before I move back to the states (because it is cheaper in Japan than on</li>
            <li>and I was breaking out way more than a 30 year old should.</li>
            <li>best kept beauty secret.</li>
            <li>I write for a living and consequently rarely write product reviews.</li>
            <li>I tend to only let myself read the &amp;#34;good reviews&amp;#34; and thought I&#x27;d give this a try after reading so many good reviews, however I have used this many times and I&#x27;m now convinced that it does nothing but roll up into blobs of gook, (which is what everyone else thinks is their dead skin rolling off).  </li>
            <li>The main problem with my skin is that my skin turnover is very quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- leaves skin feeling and smelling fresh</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective exfoliator that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is worth buying it though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fun to use.  </li>
            <li>My face tone has is more even and my skin insanely soft.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER seen such an effective product in my life.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s over priced and just isn&#x27;t worth your time if you&#x27;re just looking for an exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>If you’re looking for a fun toy to play with your skin?</li>
            <li>Well then you decided if it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is an inexpensive purchase for the amount and its effectively.</li>
            <li>I have the kind of skin that burns, stings, gets bumpy, and turns beet red when I use just about anything on it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Toner get to absorbed faster</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m sure those who moderate how much they use could geteven more out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, fun product</li>
            <li>When I used it, I was stunned, utterly stunned at how effective it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I maybe end up using this once a week or so, so definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>I also use face masks to cleanse my skin and this product works really the same as ANY good quality face washing product.</li>
            <li>would be useful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled about the result of this facial wash!</li>
            <li>I have the most frustratingly sensitive,</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so fresh after cleaning and the dirt is all out .</li>
            <li>TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>and my skin feels so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but for me it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a week now and my skin has never looked and felt so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It works magic on my mid-forties skin, making it dewy and soft.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>real results, real woman, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>I think it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I also use my cleanser to be sure I get the gel completely off, and follow up with toner and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when you notice the difference because your skin will have absorbed your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much it has helped clear my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, so once a week is ok</li>
            <li>This exfoliator works fairly well on facial skin; does absolutely nothing for hands, cuticles, etc.  </li>
            <li>I love that it isn&#x27;t a scrub because I feel that scrubs are somewhat damaging and still don&#x27;t completely accomplish the job.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>They were kind enough to include a generous amount of samples and a hand written note thanking me for shopping with them!</li>
            <li>I have only used this product 2 times but so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>so if I feel it is worth it I will buy it.  </li>
            <li>After that, I rinse it with warm water thoroughly and begin to put my facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>but I bought some for my daughter to try because I think it is worth the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I make sure my face is completely dried.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Which is fun to use</li>
            <li>The price is I know a lil pricy but its worth it</li>
            <li>Skin feel refreshed and baby soft after. :)</li>
            <li>Elementary math leads me to a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li>But no feeling any kind different</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every freaking penny.</li>
            <li>overall, This is s great product for sensitive and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels lovely and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for month and liquid is still near the top.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just a fun alternative exfoliant.</li>
            <li>It results in smooth skin and overall better complexion when used semi-frequently.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really worth the money.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Cure Natural Aqua Gel.</li>
            <li>My face looks brighter and fresh every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I think that the price of this product is worth every penny....</li>
            <li>and it feels so fresh.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was hesitant to even purchase this, but glad I did.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and smooth after using this and it healed my acne faster than time alone plus prevented and fixed scars, which was way beyond what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>My skin feels super soft and clean!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for a quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Amazing how much dead skin this removes, very exciting to see!  </li>
            <li>but I can say that it really made my skin much smoother and cleaner!!!</li>
            <li>I can see why most people would think spending that much for some kind of magic water is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>if I overused this (around my nose and mouth, for the most part), so I recommend using it every other day at most.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an awesome gel or not, but I feel that I can get similar cleanliness with other products of my Clarisonic</li>
            <li>In its original state, the liquid is clear, non-fragrant, and smooth (so no beads or granules to aid in exfoliation).  </li>
            <li>luckily its not making her breakout but sadly not making any difference in her appearance.</li>
            <li>(Also my seller got it to me super fast, way before Amazon estimated it would come!)</li>
            <li>Let it sit on clean skin for about a minute, then rub, rub, rub and exfoliate GENTLY, revealing super soft clean skin for days!</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit concerned, because it smelled like rubbing alcohol when I applied it to my skin, but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li>Cure is actually super gentle and claims to made up of over 90% water!</li>
            <li>My face, literally, feels squeaky clean when I wash this off as well as leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but for the price my other exfoliators do a good job too.</li>
            <li>price is excellent and I&#x27;m fairly certain this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Appropriate for sensitive skin as it&#x27;s very gentle.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do so, because i don&#x27;t have the right tools, but something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did I do it right?</li>
            <li>Does leave skin baby-smooth right after use.</li>
            <li>I counted the days until arrival and tried this product right away.</li>
            <li>so your skin might get irritated .. so I would advice not to wait and work with the product right away.</li>
            <li>I were trying it out right when I got it.</li>
            <li>I watched a lot of YouTube demos to see if this was the right product for me</li>
            <li>SO this product should of had no problem removing it right??</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have the money right now</li>
            <li>They were right.</li>
            <li>But when opening the bottle out of it&#x27;s plastic wrapping the pump tip cracked and fell right off.</li>
            <li>right?).</li>
            <li>it cleanse the blackheads from my nose right off.</li>
            <li>I put the gel on my right face cheek and rubbed it in.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this product a couple of days ago and when I received it I tried it out right away.</li>
            <li>If you start rubbing right after you apply it, you&#x27;ll be rubbing for a while before you get any clumps.</li>
            <li>so I always apply lotion or face mask right after.</li>
            <li>then I used Cure right after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those who buys something and want it to work right There.</li>
            <li>This is just what my skin needs right now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before attending a major special occasion (wedding, dinner, graduation party, etc...), I used to have to stop using the tretinoin cream a few days before so that my skin could be smooth and look great.</li>
            <li>Your skin has a very squeaky clean feel and almost flushed look to it (like a baby), maybe it helps with blood circulation also.</li>
            <li>No rough grains, no stretching, all gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>After using this product, I&#x27;m pretty sure that nothing about this product is natural.</li>
            <li>The results on my skin are wonderful and quickly noticeable after only a few uses.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin clean and buffed and sealed and ready for the day</li>
            <li>Just apply on clean skin and rub gently in circles on your face, body, feet.</li>
            <li>so its not super pleasant to wash your face with</li>
            <li>I really like the way this gel makes my skin feel so clean</li>
            <li>It is very mild and it make my skin very soft</li>
            <li>The Cure is hands down the best exfoliator I have found, and I have tried numerous exfoliators over the years.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, from time to time I have major acne breakouts that require medication which dries out my skin and leaves it flaky and hideous under foundation.</li>
            <li>After several uses my skin was always left bright, calm, &amp; smooth-</li>
            <li>I bought this product for exfoliation of my very sensitive skin based on reviews left by other customers, and was very happy to find that it is as great as other people have said.</li>
            <li>And of course alcohol can severely dry out your skin causing more acne!</li>
            <li>Costco where I live has Avocado Oil in stock, which is another oil that can be used and is quite nice for mature skin :</li>
            <li>Costco where I live has Avocado Oil in stock, which is another oil that can be used and is quite nice for mature skin :</li>
            <li>It really gets that top layer of your skin off, helping for new skin to form.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for everyone since it is a gentle exfoliant by does the job right!  </li>
            <li>when i clean the residue with water my skin was sooo Soft and it looked clean and radiant and it felt refreshed.</li>
            <li>I did not use a washcloth, just my hands for application, but the dead skin still came off as easy as a warm knife going through butter.</li>
            <li>Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]], which acts as an excellent acne treatment after you&#x27;ve shredded a few layers of dead skin with Cure.</li>
            <li>As freelance makeup artist its important to have good skin; especially clear of of dead skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every few days and my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Great so far, you can clearly see the results after just using it once and leaves your skin feeling all soft.</li>
            <li>This product is great to remove dead skin cells from your face!  </li>
            <li>not sure if you should though lol</li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but exfoliates very well, Not a bad investment to add into my skincare routine</li>
            <li>Definitely fell in love with this product since the very first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li>really recommend this if you have sensitive skin and are looking for an exfoliator! :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel even after the very first use.  </li>
            <li>Very loved it removes dead skin efficiently but for why became the product does not ship directly to Saudi Arabia?</li>
            <li>There are a lot of really amazing reviews about this product but from my personal experience and expectations I didn&#x27;t find it as amazing as other customers.</li>
            <li>After rubbing it into my skin for less than 30 seconds (and seeing the white bits that accumulate) and rinsing, my skin immediately felt incredibly baby soft, smooth, silky, and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle and effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that once I complete my lactic acid peels, I won&#x27;t see as much skin</li>
            <li>* Be sure you&#x27;re applying to a clean, completely dry face.  </li>
            <li>I bought two but am going to order a few more to share with family and to make sure that I never run out.</li>
            <li>I personally this its worth it. :]</li>
            <li>I had outstanding results with just three pumps on dry, clean skin.  </li>
            <li>With the earthen instant peel, you can tell it works great because once you use it, you cannot use it again on the same spot.</li>
            <li>After putting it on entire face and leaving for three minutes or so, I experienced no tingling or burning (Which I don&#x27;t necessarily oppose if the product works).</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and it made my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless of how much came off , etc all three of us were left with squeaky clean skin that looked better.</li>
            <li>its so soft and easy to apply</li>
            <li>sensitive skin, skin is gorgeous when I keep up with regular glycolic peels and facials.</li>
            <li>this really does do a great job at exfoliating dead skin off your face.</li>
            <li>My face looks fresh, clean and clear!</li>
            <li>But it was amazing, my skin never felt so clean and light despite the much harsher exfoliants I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>used it once and right after my skin felt incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This just exfoliate you skin very gently.</li>
            <li>It was very gentle on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very gentle exfoliator</li>
            <li>very gentle, doesn&#x27;t feel like it is working if you don&#x27;t look at it</li>
            <li>It exfoliates so very gently...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very unusual feeling (the clumps)</li>
            <li>I then moisturize with Rohto Hadalabo Gokuyn Hyaluronic Acid Cream -- it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>it is a very gentle exfoliator but directions</li>
            <li>This one is very gentle and I have never had irritation using this.</li>
            <li>My acne is disappearing and the leftover hyper-pigmentation marks are improving very fast as well.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, and did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>And the price is very reasonable considering the amount of product you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very gentle and exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and not abrasive.</li>
            <li>Very gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Retail is still pricey but totally worth it, I do highly recommend it to anyone who wants a deeper clean feeling.</li>
            <li>All the positive reviews got it right.</li>
            <li>simple, smooth onto clean face...</li>
            <li>I was definitely not expecting it to go away so quickly and easily with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin blemishes and mild acne</li>
            <li>After applying either my shiseido mattifying moisturizer, or any of my other moisturizers desired at the moment, my already smooth face felt and looked more smooth and soft than I could have ever imagined.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this stuff dissolves skin like other reviewers think, but after I use it my face feels very smooth, clean and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>Before, my skin was peeling heavily from retinol use and now it&#x27;s smooth, bright, and clear.</li>
            <li>But if I had to pick one, this gentle one would be it!</li>
            <li>but I am not 100% sure that it is actual skin and not the product itself.</li>
            <li>The regular St Ives scrub seems to do a better job in doing deeper pore cleaning and skin exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Not a perfect system but perfect for in between pedis.  </li>
            <li>According to another reviewer, the bottle lasts for 6 months so if it lasts me two to three months, it would be worth every penny and really reasonable and affordable.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t even have a chance to let it sit on my skin first -</li>
            <li>Yet my skin is soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>If you think that you have soft and smooth skin now, just try Cure once</li>
            <li>I will totally recommend this product to my friends :)</li>
            <li>2 days later I bought 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED CURE 1 1/2 WEEKS LATER :)  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>THIS IS AMAZIMG, FOLLOW DIRECTIONS EXACTLY.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s gentle!</li>
            <li>I bought my first cure aqua gel in Japan.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to those who are interested in buying this product. :)</li>
            <li>Thanks Cure!</li>
            <li>it really does work!</li>
            <li>,i use it once one week.it make me skin soft smooth</li>
            <li>nothing like it really!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel gritty and sandpapery like most exfoliatiors.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff very regularly and love the results.</li>
            <li>Will most definitely buy this again</li>
            <li>Soft and smooth skin and cleaner pores are the result.</li>
            <li>;D)</li>
            <li>so I should love my skin the way it is even though I look like a Mexican version of a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sidenote: This product definitely is not &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;scam.&amp;#34; I sincerely doubt the reviewers who say so.</li>
            <li>Have bought for several ppl now, who also love it.</li>
            <li>It arrived so fast!  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The next morning my face is now more evenly textured and silky.</li>
            <li>and I was trying to use more asian products to see if it would help my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels pretty soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>most products leave my face very red.</li>
            <li>very bad,don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li>When I used it, the first thing I noticed was that it smelled like alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have used it twice in the last week, just since receiving it, and it makes my skin sooo smooth!</li>
            <li>reminds me of the Pretty Feet &amp; Hands sloughing lotion (anyone remember that stuff??).</li>
            <li>Will be back again! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can google it or something, but don&#x27;t care enough to...</li>
            <li>After doing more research I was sold and bought a bottle the same day.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>So much skin came off!</li>
            <li>does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit at first I got a bit over-enthusiastic and used it every 2-3 days but found it was too drying so, for me, twice a week is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really thought that its worth it</li>
            <li>The first time I used this it removed those patches.</li>
            <li>Like many things, using it aggressively for more days is not necessarily better and won&#x27;t fix this dryness issue I&#x27;m experiencing.</li>
            <li>Sadly, it is a no go</li>
            <li>Sadly, it is a no go</li>
            <li>but sadly, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I also bought another one for back up :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a smooth clear gel with no grit.</li>
            <li>Just be aware of the lag time and order in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just finished my first two weeks with it</li>
            <li>You get a very exfoliated and fresh face after using.</li>
            <li>I had bought one of those facial brushes w/ scrub gel you need to keep buying to exfoliate my skin, but this product works even better.</li>
            <li>the first time I used it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a gel that feels cooling on the skin when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my son once and he thought it was funny because he said it looked like his face was a shade lighter.</li>
            <li>This stuff was Fantastic, It completely changed my skin.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this and knew immediately that I would be buying the full size version, despite the price (this is more than I usually spend on products).  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;ve done your entire face, rinse off and moisturize :)</li>
            <li>and I was really amazed of the results!</li>
            <li>*Cleanse/Remove all makeup first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying again, most definitely.</li>
            <li>You will see the result from first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With occasional break outs, mostly on my cheeks or chin when they happen.</li>
            <li>But it confirms it is not fake.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, this stuff is wonderful!</li>
            <li>much more white balls formed</li>
            <li>At first, I was like, \\&quot;Oh,</li>
            <li>/&gt;What isn&#x27;t overhyped is the seller, ppali beauty, very recommended!</li>
            <li>One pump is more than enough for your face.</li>
            <li>Using it as instructed, I did notice the balls forming on my skin, however, the fact that these balls remained white when my skin is brown let me know this product is nothing more than snake oil.</li>
            <li>It has become a regular part of my weekly regimen and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>First I got this because of a youtube person.</li>
            <li>This gel does exactly what it declares.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother with it!</li>
            <li>When I first stumbled upon this product I was leery to try it and was tempted to use my sister as the official guinea pig (that&#x27;s what family is for,</li>
            <li>My face was so soft and smooth after the first use that I was literally standing there with my mouth agape in shock.</li>
            <li>and I will continue purchasing this product after I finish my first one.</li>
            <li>This stuff Really works!  </li>
            <li>i have had something like this, but it was in different country, and in America i haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like this.</li>
            <li>In each instance I could see and feel the top layer of the skin come off into tiny particles.  </li>
            <li>First of all I have combination/normal skin and</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I read reviews on Google, Amazon, &amp; most definitely YouTube before purchasing .</li>
            <li>After using this routinely twice a week for several weeks now, I can&#x27;t say definitively say that my skin is smoother or more youthful in appearance.</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I can 100% say that the microneedling device DOES work, as it damages the top layer of skin just enough for repair and collagen induction to take place</li>
            <li>I use this 3 times a week after first cleansing with Cetaphil.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product and after the first use it completely cleared all of the dry/flaky skin off of my face!</li>
            <li>The size is pretty substantial and I will continue using it but will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li>I need to actually commit to it, so I can see better results.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time tonight. . .</li>
            <li>If you saw this product on a shelf without researching it first, you would have no idea what it does.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pumped some into my hand and rubbed it on my face; it&#x27;s unremarkable at first.</li>
            <li>The gritty feeling intensifies, and begins to feel more like i&#x27;m massaging rice into my face, and upon leaning closer into the mirror, I have to keep myself from screaming.</li>
            <li>I literally JUST used this for the first time in the shower.</li>
            <li>No way did I expect to feel or see a difference the first time.</li>
            <li>I just received this today and used for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I did in fact have soft, smooth skin with no redness or irritation.</li>
            <li>My skin always looks better the next day.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather buy American and be able to ask questions and deal with locals.</li>
            <li>wherever, and after you are finished and rinsed off, your skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After all for the first time using, I noticed that my skin tone looks brighter.</li>
            <li>but it really does!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about Cure was that the gel is quite watery.</li>
            <li>Both products make your skin clump similarly, but I think Cure dries a bit faster because it&#x27;s more liquid-y, so it might be easier to work in sections</li>
            <li>The more your rub the more dead skin will slough off!</li>
            <li>but I know for sure its going to be gone soon enough.</li>
            <li>First time trying it</li>
            <li>but when you&#x27;re done your face is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>first time I tried it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was really after the second and third use that I began to notice how great my skin felt (and looked).</li>
            <li>To my surprise, this exfoliator works magically and differently from what I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft &amp; smooth after I use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer, brighter and healthier looking, plus the products that I use with this instantly work 110% better than without exfoliating with it.</li>
            <li>Her skin was softer, brighter and so much clearer that she had found the confidence to not wear any makeup at all to work!</li>
            <li>One thing I learned about ordering from amazon is to read 3 stars and below first.</li>
            <li>I almost thought is wasn&#x27;t going to do anything at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin feel really clean without becoming dry.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is just a gel and not a scrub but definitely works like a charm!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>First time writing a review on a product.</li>
            <li>And since it exfoliates so well, my acne scars have healed and faded SOO fast!</li>
            <li>The patch looks better than it has in a year and looks like it might actually heal up.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bottle of cure around six months ago and all I can say is the results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li>well I got my first one and turned around and bought another before I put a dent in the first bottle.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft now and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I really like to see the skin peeling off!</li>
            <li>and I will continue purchasing this product after I finish my first one.</li>
            <li>After using this product it really makes your skin feel cleaner and not just on your face !</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin to begin with, but I just like knowing all my dead skin is gone...</li>
            <li>Afterwards, your skin becomes soft and baby smooth.</li>
            <li>I was weary of it at first</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s in her early 30s with fantastic skin.  </li>
            <li>Waste of good money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neat being able to see all the dead skin coming off your face, leaving your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Each time I use it, my skin feels very soft and clean after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Turn Again Peeling Gel 28.3, available on this site, to gently remove the dry top layer as it is ready to come off.  </li>
            <li>Make sure your face is freshly washed and pat dry before you use Cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering i did the Free super saving shipping and handling (I didn&#x27;t pay for it only just the product)</li>
            <li>All of my products seems to be absorbed better without all the dry skin.</li>
            <li>Bottomline is you can find or make a good exfoliator for dry and sensitive skin for a fraction of the price compare to this.</li>
            <li>My face looks really rejuvenated after washing off all the build up, whatever it is, and feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I know I am not being very helpful, but right now the jury is out.  </li>
            <li>No exaggeration, it really rolls right off.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week to keep my skin free if clogged pores, I follow up with an Aztec Indian healing clay mask a/ raw apple cider vinegar and this combination has kept my skin glowy, plump, bump free, acne free.</li>
            <li>Very clean feel, I need this for regular peeling &amp; depend on this much now!</li>
            <li>I think this is worth the investment because it makes my skin feel baby soft after using it for the very FIRST time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gently on my already super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve experienced even BETTER results, as I see a softening of the harsh, deep (the width of a nickel) stretch marks.</li>
            <li>This made all the dry skin come right off, better than any scrubber ever did.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic, pure and simple!!</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean and soft after using this and moisturizers and other products apply a lot better after use.</li>
            <li>Amazing exfoliator - but be careful and don&#x27;t overdo!</li>
            <li>it does a dicent job, but i don&#x27;t see how amazing it is from other reviews.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it in the long run if you think about how much you spend on cheaper products that you end up tossing after one use  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I do not experience sensitivity or even dryness after using this product...just soft, fresh, glowing skin!</li>
            <li>There seems to be NO irritants in the product (like in other exfoliates) which I really liked.</li>
            <li>There is, however, a very heavy scent, and although it is pleasant, I&#x27;d prefer no scent as fragrances can irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Strangely effective, but hard to accurately explain the usefulness of this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this item after reading all the positive reviews, and was super excited when receiving it the next day!!!</li>
            <li>Holy cow, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>and my Nerium is back to making my skin bright again as it&#x27;s penetrating deep into my pores.</li>
            <li>silly as my review may sound to you, I am completely happy with this product.</li>
            <li>great considering if you&#x27;re not so serious about ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Subtle exfoliation adds a great glow.  </li>
            <li>The product exfoliates the skin gently, leaving the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>it did make my lips super smooth and dead skin free.</li>
            <li>The best part is I&#x27;ve had this for nearly one year and still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li>It makes my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It removed about 70% of the dry skin from my face and left it smooth, if kind of smelly.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>my face felt soft after and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, squeaky clean and baby skin after.</li>
            <li>I am still in disbelief that this gentle, pleasant product can deliver the same results with several uses that a chemical peel can, with NO irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Once rinseing my face my skin looked lighter, clean and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin feeling so soft, supple, clean,  &amp; glowing without drying it</li>
            <li>a top product is that it is not only gentle, but it WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>You rub gently over your face and within 15 seconds, sure enough, the epidermis starts to flake or \\&quot;ball\\&quot; off!    </li>
            <li>I think if I even use it more frequently, that I would not have any problems or be sensitive with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not irritating for me, so sometimes I can use it more, but if I use it too often, I&#x27;ll notice that none of the white forms, meaning no skin is coming off.</li>
            <li>Now I only use it on my neck and the back of my hands every 1-2 weeks, then apply good quality lotion.</li>
            <li>I tried this several times and read more reviews by people who think it works, but it really doesnt.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything, my regular acne gel is way better, I have no idea how the reviews are high!?</li>
            <li>This gel is extremely gentle on the skin, isn&#x27;t harsh at all YET it honestly removes dead skin better than many top-end exfoliators I have used.  </li>
            <li>It took them all off and left me with silky smooth skin that absorbed my serums easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a top product is that it is not only gentle, but it WORKS.</li>
            <li>Yes, it gives good exfoliation while remaining gentle on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>good product really works well to remove dead skin cells just dont use it too often</li>
            <li>I would say Cure Natural Aqua Gel is good for very sensitive skin and as a rotating option with a scrub but not the only way of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>am very pleased with the packaging of the product to ensure no damage during travels, and came with a thank you note and little gifts as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most unique exfoliator because unlike normal exfoliator which are beads that are rough on the skin</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is dry before using and rub very gently.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle, very gentle, exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is black magic!</li>
            <li>I woke up this morning with my face feeling super soft!</li>
            <li>You have to make sure your skin and hands are completely dry first or this won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>So I was sold on all the positive reviews, before buying... and that&#x27;s why I bought this.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% positive about the effectiveness and authenticity of this product.</li>
            <li>I am 99% positive you will like it.  </li>
            <li>I work with skincare and ordered to try since I heard positive review.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of positive comments &amp; people</li>
            <li>After reading the all the positive feedback, I decided to try this product out</li>
            <li>Granted I choose to go with the positive reviews of this product over the negatives, and boy did I HOPE it would be some sort of holy grail.</li>
            <li>Cure Natural Aqua Gel exfoliates away the dead skin cells very effectively.</li>
            <li>So when I came across Cure Natural Aqua Gel on a Youtuber&#x27;s Channel and found it was really inexpensive, with positive reviews, I was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing and it&#x27;s helping in fading dark spots on my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li>This is a product I like so much and want everyone to try and like just as much as me!</li>
            <li>This product is great, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews claiming the product itself is actually</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li>after first use, my skin feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I have tried other beaded or brush exfoliators and don&#x27;t find them as effective or gentle as this product.</li>
            <li>I first tried it, my skin wasn&#x27;t peeling, so I wasn&#x27;t really</li>
            <li>Pretty gentle.</li>
            <li>I pretty much always have blackheads on and around my nose and on my chin.</li>
            <li>I noticed this after about a week of use, I just wasn&#x27;t getting as much gray gunk off my face as the first day.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like this product- easy to use and seems like it refreshes my skin and is steadily reducing some acne scarring.  </li>
            <li>This is the first exfoliating product that really worked, but did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Many products (I&#x27;m passionate about my skin care)</li>
            <li>If you really feel the need to get directions before using check those out first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After this comparison, I am very confident that the product is indeed getting rid of the dead skins.</li>
            <li>I use it 2/3 a week in the morning or before bed (which ever) after the first week I seen real results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin and really makes my skin feel smooth and</li>
            <li>Really good exfoliator, removes a layer of dead skin and leaves skin feeling fresh and soft and revitalized.</li>
            <li>Actually does what it claims and exfoliates well, leaving clean, fresh skin.</li>
            <li>For instance, if my skin is peeling a bit on the side of my nose, I notice that more of that white stuff appears in that particular area when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, efficient, and mild enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty much just pure alcohol</li>
            <li>I mean it was amazing!</li>
            <li>After washing your face you feel like a little baby SOO SMOOTH!!</li>
            <li>I personally think all the hype for this product is true!</li>
            <li>I obviously bought this after reading the rave reviews, but I never expected it to be as amazing as it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than harsher products I&#x27;ve used at removing dry skin--even calluses.</li>
            <li>I was completely surprised on how quickly the product arrived.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that reacts to everything.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m super surprised that it would do so well</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure that it&#x27;s stripping the dry skin off like paint the way it seems to be--</li>
            <li>I use it couple times a week especially in the summer when my oily prone skin gets clog too easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to do and while it leaves my skin pretty soft</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because it was making my face really dry and also making my face break out more.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hands are dry and apply this all over your face.  </li>
            <li>But it didn&#x27;t make my skin &#x27;baby soft&#x27; or &#x27;extraordinary&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Washing my face then patting dry then exfoliating then patting dry takes up precious minutes when I could be sleeping more.</li>
            <li>The instructions are all in Japanese, but it&#x27;s easy to just look them up online.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clean :) it really helps for my clogged pores &amp; dead skin</li>
            <li>But for someone like myself who&#x27;s on a strong exfoliating medication, it will work well, but possibly leave some flakes.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll notice the pure softness and smoothness of your skin and it&#x27;ll soon become a part of your skin regimen.     </li>
            <li>but I am certain it is not removing visible layers of skin.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores.</li>
            <li>I purchased a bottle of pure nothingness.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels great after rinsing--- very nourished, not dry and tight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried my share of exfoliators and while the pilling off of dead skin beads is a cool effect this doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling as clean or as smooth as a normal BHA or AHA exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a while, and it seemed to work great the first few times, but after working it back into my skin care routine after not using it, it caused reddening on my skin and a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>It kind of makes a mess when you use it, so I use it standing in the shower before I turn the water on.</li>
            <li>The first time brought off the most, by far, but this stuff still does its job even a month later.</li>
            <li>I use one pump of this and all the dead cells goes with it and leaves my skin looking much better!</li>
            <li>Moment you apply cream you  can feel the dead skin peeling off your face.. Like MAGIC !</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll know that you are getting those dead skin out for sure!</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, but works better than any other exfoliant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I tend to lean on the cautious side, so to make sure all of the product has been removed, I wash with a gentle cleanser immediately afterwards, pat dry, and apply lotion.</li>
            <li>It really does what it claims (removes 0.01mm of skin) and makes my skin super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my eczema started feeling less itchy and as I predicted, moisturizing cream and meds get absorbed much better.</li>
            <li>It cleans very thoroughly yet is very mild at the same time.</li>
            <li>I would also suggest moisturizing right after you use it to quench your newly revealed skin&#x27;s thirst.</li>
            <li>Erased my fine facial lines and creepiness in conjunction with Watts retinol.</li>
            <li>gentle for skin and remove the dead cells easily and leave the skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>You seriously do NOT know what exfolating of you have not tried this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously not the #1 seller for no reason!</li>
            <li>how much you have already supposedly rubbed off a certain spot.</li>
            <li>When you put it on your face, the gel attaches to the oils on the skin and balls up into little pieces which can then be washed away with warm water.</li>
            <li>What it does do is it forms little balls of it&#x27;s own product</li>
            <li>they are super dry and cracked, and this stuff started working on removing all the dead skin, since it is super dry and cracked, I am going to have to do a few more applications, but it working wonderfully, on all the areas of my skin that needs attention.  </li>
            <li>It is a great exfoliator with none of the harsh side effects of traditional exfoliators.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice alternative to more expensive water activated skin exfoliators.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if scrubs and brushes are too harsh on your skin or cause your skin to become red-</li>
            <li>The negative reviews saying it&#x27;s a lie or a scam don&#x27;t take into account how smooth, healthy and GLOWING</li>
            <li>Amazing to think your face is exfoliated and then use a product like this and see all the pieces of dead skin being rubbed off when applied.</li>
            <li>I found Cure on a beauty blog, and after reading through quite a few reviews online I decided to give it a try, and wow--it&#x27;s a really amazing product.</li>
            <li>I think it may have left a film on my skin that clogged my pores (which are huge</li>
            <li>Works great on my skin, does what it says it will so and removes the dead skin, it definitely smooths my skin</li>
            <li>I used another exfoliator and my skin went baby smooth, but that one wasn&#x27;t gentle enough for every day use.</li>
            <li>The dead skin just comes off, it&#x27;s so amazing, and it leaves my cheeks feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product that sloughs off dead skin ..never seen anything like it.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing to see the dead skin cells gather on my face.  </li>
            <li>vey gentle and exfoliates like crazy.....worth the money</li>
            <li>This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle and along with my soy based foaming cleanser have re-hydrated, brighten and cleared up mu skin.</li>
            <li>When I do use it, my skin feels really soft afterwards and its really fun to use because of the clumps.</li>
            <li>Gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li>no idea if it really is exfolliating..</li>
            <li>It really does take off a layer of your skin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much my skin has improved</li>
            <li>Product was very runny and smelled of straight rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon for my refund.</li>
            <li>It really works very well-</li>
            <li>, works well yet gentle to skin.</li>
            <li>whatever it is) but its very watery, VERY watery.</li>
            <li>Now, before I purchased, I read some people saying that if this was really your skin, that you&#x27;d be suffering from burns on your face.  </li>
            <li>I WAS VERY DOUBTFULl...  </li>
            <li>Gently exfoliates and</li>
            <li>When I put the product on some parts of my body, nothing much happens.  </li>
            <li>With this product, my family and boyfriend said my skin looked so much</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>order arrived in 4 days with free shipping and the bottle was rapped properly and neatly in a bubble rap.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for me.  </li>
            <li>But I have to say that I have not broken out from it whenever I use it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t get your face or hands wet before you use it.  </li>
            <li>It arrived really fast and with no problems.</li>
            <li>but all you really need as proof, is the feel of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have lived with acne my whole life like a lot of people, and I did my research, bought this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different types of exfoliators (Vive per Lei Facial Peeling, ect) and this product is the one that has always gives me the best results without fail.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li>It was gentle and works so well on my face.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m someone whose really touchy about any blemish on my skin, and unfortunatly I was genetically blessed with oily skin prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to skin of all types!</li>
            <li>Damn,  was I hesitant to spend so much on an exfoliation product from Japan.</li>
            <li>so it is really gentle,</li>
            <li>It arrived here really fast</li>
            <li>but it gets very dray &amp; kinda sticky</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference in my skin though.</li>
            <li>Works gently and exfoliate very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and will probably order again</li>
            <li>but I also feel like this is way too gentle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>

            <li>Delivery was fast from Japan and the product was well protected.  </li>

            <li>after using it for 2 weeks, i dont really see any difference/ improvement on my face.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the debris comes off after you apply it</li>
            <li>This really worked for me with my acne.</li>
            <li>it does not smell, it is gentle on my skin, and I have no reaction to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li>u really on need</li>
            <li>You really do have to try this.  </li>
            <li>It does leave your skin much smoother</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very liquidy and glides across your skin, you don&#x27;t need to rub hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the type I have always wanted, very good，</li>
            <li>Way too much alcohol.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very watery</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the exfoliating department.</li>

            <li>I have very youthful skin and this Aqua Gel</li>
            <li>The ingredients used, aren&#x27;t so $$, so I didn&#x27;t really understand why the steep price.  ???</li>

            <li>really recommend  this product.</li>
            <li>Eh i can see the deadskin after scrubbing but besides that it doesn&#x27;t do much for my acne nor my darkspots.</li>
            <li>However, not convinced I see real results in exfoliation.</li>
            <li>really works!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it as recommended, twice a week and really see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>this is gentle to use unlike a burning glycolic acid product...</li>
            <li>This exfoliator really works.</li>
            <li>During the washing process, it&#x27;s very gooey</li>
            <li>The thorough exfoliation helps to keep breakouts to a minimal and helps heal acne marks more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I used to not care much about a beauty routine, but now my skin is glowing</li>
            <li>This has a water like consistency and my face really looks brighter after using it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and no perfume smell.</li>
            <li>So I proceed on applying it on my whole face.</li>
            <li>I really like the product,</li>
            <li>wait a moment then gently &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; off with fingers and be amazed.</li>
            <li>Have to use too much of this product...</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a light facial lotion afterwards like Cetaphil or Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>It will work much slower than laser treatment from a dermatologist, of course, but you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>but it works really well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of problems with my skin and will have to start Accutane soon, but this gel has really helped keep some problems at bay.</li>
            <li>The skin around my nose and cheeks had been really messed up..</li>
            <li>One of the side effects of this ointment is that it makes my skin really dry/sensitive before I get acclimated to the treatment.</li>
            <li>and they will be much smoother after one use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast service well packaged to protect the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>They really care about their skin just that much.</li>
            <li>Really like this exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>Who wants acne at 35</li>
            <li>Cure Natural Aqua Gel leaves my skin smooth and soft, with absolutely zero irritation.</li>
            <li>but I really like it</li>
            <li>It does seem to get rid of a layer of skin in a gentle way.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This was the only thing that could get my skin feeling smooth again.</li>
            <li>but my pump bottle was not a gel it was already liquid and did not exfoliate very well.  </li>
            <li>If those were your skin cells shedding, your skin would certainly be very irritated after each use.</li>
            <li>I really like the results.  </li>
            <li>It really exfoliates the skin and isn&#x27;t abrasive at all.</li>
            <li>Lotions, creams, and serums are able to work better because the dead skin cells are removed on the upper layer.</li>
            <li>and it does leave the skin much softer and nicer.</li>
            <li>Bought this product because i wanted gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Well, this stuff is gentle, but too gentle for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it besides sort of garlicy, and it lingered on my hands for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get decently smooth skin initially, followed by acneic eruptions.  </li>
            <li>and they have been all very impress.</li>
            <li>and it left him with baby smooth hands.</li>
            <li>product is very watery, you are supposed to apply it on your face, let it sit, then massage.</li>
            <li>and this is extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>I used my tretinoin the night before and I moisturized my face intensely before applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>This really helps in not looking cakey wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product so much.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how the product can be so gentle yet thoroughly cleanse my skin.</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions, it really works.  </li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t really do anything to reduce the size of your pores.</li>
            <li>or so, then rub in gently with fingers.  </li>
            <li>It is so gentle on your face.  </li>
            <li>and I may as get real about it.  </li>
            <li>My sister has very sensitive/acne prone skin</li>
            <li>You have to use a lot in my opinion to cover your whole face</li>
            <li>This totally changes my face because when in just one try, I can feel that my face becomes so smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, but be careful not to overuse -- it damaged my skin barrier &amp; broke me out.</li>
            <li>My bikini area doesn&#x27;t get ingrown hairs as much as it used to.</li>
            <li>I would recommend not using it very often..</li>
            <li>Product works really well.  </li>
            <li>Another thing is that I don&#x27;t have time to really use it on the weekdays as I just wash my face, slap on some lotion and go to work.</li>
            <li>but it is gentle</li>
            <li>I massage the gel in circles on my face, suddenly that smooth feeling under my fingers starts to get a bit...</li>
            <li>Just be ready to be grossed out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really does &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t expect to really exfoliate as how you would get from scrubs.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it really does remove impurities.</li>
            <li>I believe it is part of the product to really get the dirt outta your face (or leftover makeup).</li>
            <li>if anyone who speaks Japanese can translate the label, that would be fabulous.</li>
            <li>This product really helps remove those skin flakes.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like Cure -</li>
            <li>They had a promo recently and I was supposed to get a free cosmetic bag - it didn&#x27;t come with my order.  </li>
            <li>This product is like a gel alcohol, so much so that you might as well put alcohol on your face.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a real reviewer, not a paid shill).</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to skin care products.</li>
            <li>But this product is so awesome it totally deserves the next few minutes of my life because it has changed mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective and all that dead skin that was making me break out is removed gently every day.</li>
            <li>Really seems to tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li>It gives a gentle exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I would give 5 star but the price is too much for what you get.</li>
            <li>Then when you rub your skin, the friction causes the skin cells to clump together and leaves your face with a newer layer of skin (it&#x27;s basically a chemical peel, but much much gentler?).</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin is being ripped apart.</li>
            <li>It is sort of distressing to realize how much needs to be removed.</li>
            <li>But this product has changed that so much.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, all her acne scars were gone (she never realized they were just scars and thought she just had a lot of acne all this time), revealing a much clearer skin than she thought.</li>
            <li>The results were immediate and it so gentle.</li>
            <li>It does have an unusual texture.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel much of a difference from using this product.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really expect it to replace my lotion.</li>
            <li>I did it back to back a couple of times to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just product buildup and after about 3 times I didn&#x27;t get any more of the white beads on my face.</li>
            <li>I have added it to my skin care routine (using 1-2 times a week since it is gentle).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it is gentle and makes my face feel a tad bit smoother</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference in your face.</li>
            <li>This works well to gently exfoliate off the peeling skin.</li>
            <li>Just spread it on your skin and gently massage in a circular motion, no need to scrub.</li>
            <li>and after you wash it off, you are left with BABY SMOOTH SKIN.</li>
            <li>And fast shipping...</li>
            <li>and this product has never broken me out or cause dryness.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product really does get up all that gunk that has been shedding on your skin, and</li>
            <li>In addition to my face I&#x27;ve found an unusual use: I have a palm-sized patch of eczema on my ankle.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle and has no exfoiliaters or microbeads on it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin (no &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; or walnut shell chips).</li>
            <li>I felt almost like water, so I was doubting at beginning if it will really work for me or not.</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone and the products that I use to keep the pimples at bay can be drying.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t seem to help much</li>
            <li>and this has helped SO much.</li>
            <li>Buy it and know if you share it you will be looking for it because everyone wants it.</li>
            <li>your death cells really gently...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This thing really takes care of that.</li>
            <li>I wish I had spent my money on something more tailored to my needs...</li>
            <li>It really does.  </li>
            <li>Left my face really smooth.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating is so gentle that I can use this twice a day, before bed and work.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I am really happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t no if It&#x27;s really working....</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says.</li>
            <li>This exfoliator is an absolute must-have in every skincare routine.</li>
            <li>: I recommend this to everyone regardless of skin type as exfoliating is an important part of proper skincare and Cure</li>
            <li>I REALLY like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it anywhere but my face, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works for the body.</li>
            <li>Rather unusual treatment product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update this post after I&#x27;ve used Cure for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m really loving it so</li>
            <li>I waited a long time, debating about purchasing it, and I&#x27;m very glad I finally decided to make the purchase.</li>
            <li>The product is as gentle as you want it to be( if your not gentle with your skin you can scar it even more</li>
            <li>But if I wasn&#x27;t using that, I was honestly scratching dead skin off my face with my nails.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it on my hands, toes, knees, elbows and more all with the same result!</li>
            <li>My dead skin starts rubbing off like dried glue, and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>dead skin effectively</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and would be able to use it daily if I chose to do so,but  because I am a beauty junkie</li>
            <li>I try to stick to natural products as much as possible and I love that</li>
            <li>is much more gentle in comparison to \\&quot;physical\\&quot; exfoliating products like St. Ives that rely on gritty bits which can be off-putting to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Love this gel, just like professional facial at the salon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Noticed that someone voted down this review, so I wanted to elaborate on exactly why this didn&#x27;t work for</li>
            <li>and I could tell right away that this product is not abrasive or irritating as most of the products for acne available in the market.</li>
            <li>I will try to use it for my whole body if I can&#x27;t find any other product that can do my body skin such a good favor as this gel can</li>
            <li>Sure, life is hard &amp; full of suffering &amp; desires unfulfilled, but at least I will LOOK good as I am toiling, over worked &amp; under appreciated ^____^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She commented that it was the first effective exfoliator she&#x27;d ever used that left her face soft, smooth with no &amp;#34;down time&amp;#34; dealing with redness and sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how it works so well without harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I felt that thickness of this gel is super light, not greasy at all, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive dry skin at all.</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a good exfoliation product that could remove flaky/dry facial skin (due to using the Obagi Nuderm system).  </li>
            <li>Is much more gentle on the skin than other exfoliators that have scrubbing beads.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, rubbed it aroud and had little white globs come off that I easily washed away, leaving no burning/redness/tenderness, just smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Main concerns are large pores and wrinkle prevention.  </li>
            <li>As a kid, growing up, in the bath or shower, I would often scratch or rub my arms or legs to really give myself a deep clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin does feel squeaky clean after I use it, and I don&#x27;t think that this is healthy to use more then once every other week (at least for me).</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first about buying this product but after using this product for the first time I have to say that it is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>This product helps my other products work even better.</li>
            <li>So, I would say there&#x27;s no need to use it more than every other day and</li>
            <li>This may not work for everyone, but I think more people should consider not washing their face every morning with anything other than water.</li>
            <li>prob a lil more due to the rate exchange.</li>
            <li>well today felt better than any other time ive washed my face.</li>
            <li>Before using this gel exfoliator, I was only familiar with exfoliating face washes containing beads/etc.</li>
            <li>I have other products that work as well or better than this product.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any decrease in the appearance of scars though.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the physical exfoliator I had been using, I did not get much white balls off my cheeks the first time, but I did get more on the chin and forehead.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product that I used it for about 4 days out of the week, and I learned that moderation is key with this product.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers I saw this product on budzbeauty on youtube.</li>
            <li>Better than any other exfoliating product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It blows so many other enzymatic exfoliators out of the water.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product when I was deployed to Afghanistan and it helped keep my skin clear without dying it out!</li>
            <li>the 2nd times I purchased this item, I was excited to get them</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer, my skin has a light glow to it, my acne is already getting better after only 24 hours, and my skin is producing less oil.</li>
            <li>so it looks like skin sloughing off, gives you a smooth soft finish after the face wash (due to glycerin content) and does make your face feel quite clean.  </li>
            <li>reality and with these, I draw my &amp;#34;real expectations&amp;#34; because having realistic expectations in mind really help to appreciate any product and understand it&#x27;s value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get the skin clean of impurities, I notice it helps make my pores smaller, but the price is way up there.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if it really works</li>
            <li>I never leave reviews mainly because I just dont have time but after spending way to much money for this product I had to say something.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my skin feel after using it, definitely feels clean.</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave my skin dry or itchy at all, its easy to apply and wash off afterwards.</li>
            <li>Overall, my face feels clean after use.</li>
            <li>After drying my face, it looked like I just took off a mask; my face was clear, vibrant, soft, and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy it after reading some really convincing reviews, even though this is WAY over the price I usually spend on one product its totally WORTH</li>
            <li>People say this is pretty gross, but I find it really fun to use haha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is definitely now a contender because it gives an immediate clean, rosy glow to skin and a noticeable smoothness&lt;br</li>
            <li>This past month consumed my time with back-to-back birthdays and BBQs (quite a good summer), but by early Aug. the effects were beginning to show on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved THAT product, but the price was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a nice generously sized bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Great for removing old dead skin gently and still leaving your sensitive skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My face showed improvements immediately and it is very soft and smooth that it does not irritate a person with soft or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very large bottle and after the first couple of times you&#x27;ll only need 1 or 2 pumps to cover your whole face and probably won&#x27;t have to use it</li>
            <li>I use it at night after Clarisonic/Neutrogena soap, followed by Afirm 3x (very strong retinol), and take breaks when the exfoliating&#x27;s too harsh.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product I have used that does a great job removing dead skin cells and other yucky things, but also does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I could be tempted to use this everyday, but i am going to follow the directions because even though it is very gentle, it is VERY strong, and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product is a keeper.ould be tempted to use this everyday, but i am going to follow the directions because even though it is very gentle, it is VERY strong, and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Cure was wonderful it took off all the dead skin and left my skin silky smooth and wasn&#x27;t the least bit irritated.</li>
            <li>Its very gentle and my skin feels really soft after using it.</li>
            <li>I break out when I have had too much dairy, food high in sugar and stress.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross to see all the dead skin coming off your face, but oddly satisfying at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and my skin feels incredibly soft and supple afterwards.</li>
            <li>this has been described as creepy but effective, and its true!</li>
            <li>The first use, my face actually had that sweeky (did I speel that right?)</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a very simple person and has never went for any special facials.</li>
            <li>But, heed this warning: if you use it and don&#x27;t think it has exfoliated enough, DO NOT use it again right away!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this gel as an add-in to your skin-care routine, as I have noticed a significant difference in texture tone and clarity after only 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>and its gentle for sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>and was thrilled to find that there was very little sloughing.  </li>
            <li>It seem to remove my dead skin which is great and my skin does not feel dry.</li>
            <li>Got it super fast, it was well wrapped and came with English instructions.</li>
            <li>I really think of it more as the mildest chemical peel I&#x27;ve ever had rather than the scrubbing of a typical exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Super gentle yet effective enough to get out the dry spots that even my physical scrubs can&#x27;t help with.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t sloughed off much as compared to a video I watched, but I do use mild scrubs on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since I started using it, and I am consistently using it every other day.</li>
            <li>I have patches of rough skin on my lower cheek area and after using this, my skin is the smoothest it has ever been (I have had many professional facials also)!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review with how it affects my skin after a few weeks of use, but so far I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I was expecting my face to dry out, but it was fine.</li>
            <li>After one use of the trial packet, I&#x27;m definitely sold and will be buying the full product.</li>
            <li>I was left with smooth and soft sandal ready skin.  </li>
            <li>I used to spend almost $40 on another brand that has a similar exfoliating technique (PTR) for a smaller bottle and thicker formula; I felt like I didn&#x27;t get as many uses out of it due to the thickness and needing to dispense more product than with Cure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what kind of voodoo this is</li>
            <li>I have some kind of dermatitis, not sure what, around my nose.</li>
            <li>I have uber sensitive skin and tried it on a patch of my hand first.</li>
            <li>started to make my own exfoliator using brown sugar and olive oil and find that it works just as well, if not better, than this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than a gritty, granules based exfoliating face wash although using it daily is really impacting the volume of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have pretty soft skin to start out with too.</li>
            <li>If only it were true.</li>
            <li>effectively remove dead skin!</li>
            <li>and it looks likes its going to last me for a time especially if your are having the same skin problem as I am and just looking to try a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>First off, my skin type: acne prone, sensitive, combination, and dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first use I noticed my skin to be really soft.</li>
            <li>I mentioned earlier, it is not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li>Same product - not bad ingredients.</li>
            <li>It gently peels the dead skin and make your soft smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>and then I just gently massage my skin, no hard rubbing needed.  </li>
            <li>[...]    Be sure to shake the bottle well, (alittle might run down your wrist).  </li>
            <li>As soon as I save up and finish all my other products I am sooo buying this! :)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin a little pink afterwards, but in the morning my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably never want to live without it!</li>
            <li>Use it every other day, gets rid of dead skin cells like magic. :)</li>
            <li>To test this, I put some of the product on the top of a flat clean black palette and rubbed it in circles with a latex glove...</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the Cure, as well as all of my other products if you want clear, bright, and even skin.</li>
            <li>This exfoliator really does live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>This is probably the best and safest exfoliate product you can find in the market because it is super gentle that my HYPER-sensitive face skin was exfoliated 3 times in a row within 2 hours but felt no invasive feeling or any kind of cruel rubbing feelings like other products did on my skin.</li>
            <li>so many good reviews and Sakura Silk (http://www.amazon.com/Sakura-Silk-Gel-Face-Body/dp/B0052XYYQQ) has bad ones.</li>
            <li>I even tested to see if the same balls would form after using it consecutively and as I continued to use it, there were less balls forming and it became more white, not to mention that my skin felt insanely smooth!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, just makes it feel smooth and even-textured.</li>
            <li>for some people, I&#x27;m sure even less than that.</li>
            <li>other then a clean face wash!  </li>
            <li>The more you use it, the less &amp;#34;balling up&amp;#34; you will have because you will be keeping up with the exfoliation process.  </li>
            <li>Normally, when I exfoliate, even if I put on moisturizer immediately afterwards, I wind up developing newer dry skin pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my horribly dry hands, primarily.</li>
            <li>I squirted a half pump on my finger and massaged into my cheeks/forehead/nose/chin/neck applying a bit more where needed.  </li>
            <li>It is a decent exfoliation but not for the price.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that could exfoliate the dead skin gently, and this fit the bill!</li>
            <li>It has only being 2 weeks, and  My acne is still there, but it has tremendously dwindled.</li>
            <li>And this last purchase came with directions in English (most do not).  </li>
            <li>I have not used the product much to see real result, but I have noticed that my skin after gets really soft afterwards .</li>
            <li>My face feels clean without being dry thanks to this exfoliator.</li>
            <li>and it was decent at that</li>
            <li>Clears face up quickly with regular use!</li>
            <li>and I do feel it is probably better than physical exfoliation-granules and such.  </li>
            <li>will definitely be purchasing more, and likely gifting it to others as well.</li>
            <li>Being a fan of monthly home facials with the girls - we have tried ultra expensive (sample) products and have never been impressed enough to buy them.</li>
            <li>It removed all my dead skins as it says leaving my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>However, I find it unfair that we have to pay more so much more money than people in Japan.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be left with soft and smooth skin and nobody will call you a beet face.</li>
            <li>As a result I have not been able to use my regular products and thought I&#x27;d try this one based on several posative testimonies.</li>
            <li>it is sooo smooth and baby soft, I just can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li>So after 4 months of using various products and returning everything, I finally repurchased and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a counterfeit bottle :-/</li>
            <li>My skin is refreshed, several hyperpigmentation marks have lessened from this gentle but powerful gel.  </li>
            <li>awhile I have noticed that my skin is starting to even out as I have many acne scar that are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>my T-zone has been breaking out, particularly with blackheads on my nose.  </li>
            <li>Yes, some dead skin sloughs off, most of it is product most likely, my skin is soft but it&#x27;s soft after I exfoliate regardless.</li>
            <li>As someone who has been using the Earthen instant peel, i absolutely love that product but felt there had to be something cheaper out there that could do the same thing.</li>
            <li>My pores are so much smaller, my lines are lessened (because the outer dead/dry layer is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still planning to use this again later tonight, but I am so pleased with this.</li>
            <li>It took them all off and left me with smooth, silky ALIVE skin.</li>
            <li>so this is definitely one of the thing I would make sure keep to prevent future outbreak and or to help with scarring.</li>
            <li>I definitely think it helps my serum absorb quickly, and my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li>I let it sit for 30 seconds to do its magic to lift my dead skin away before I start gently massaging.</li>
            <li>The beading mainly came from the areas that I missed like the area close to my hair line.</li>
            <li>I have quite a bit of red marks left from blemishes and have noticed they have gone away a lot more since started using it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very much particular about the products that I use.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this product and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li>However, after using as directef, my skin is smooth and feels as if I&#x27;ve had a professional facial.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, acne prone skin that also happens to be very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to pay special attention to around your nose for those white heads.if you follow with skincare it will absorb better into your skin after all  your dead surface are gone.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel really soft too!</li>
            <li>extremely gentle and soft!</li>
            <li>I use PCA cleanser first, then the exfoliate, and lastly Clinique gel moisturizer and so far, rarely any breakouts.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin I&#x27;d say this is a good bet but not necessarily worth the cult following.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>its weirdly powerful in dissolving dead skin and yet so gentle it leaves your skin petal soft and baby smooth.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>The product is effortless to use, and it works completely the first time leaving very soft skin.</li>
            <li>Price is a bit high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone and will def be buying this again.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest buying this in place of a clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I must warn you, however, I did not have a highly problematic skin to begin with.</li>
            <li>Highly over priced and over hyped.</li>
            <li>This is a product I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>us how it soothes out the skin and makes it very smooth no revelation regarding the dead cells</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend.&lt;br /&gt;****An</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too high maintenance for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Came highly recommended by a friend, and I&#x27;ve never stopped using it.</li>
            <li>I have high acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>But the price is too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>second thing is, exfoliation with this product is so biological that I could genuinely feel that my skin was breathing more than ever after a ton of dead old skin cells accumulated on my face were removed off.</li>
            <li>I learned of this product by a beauty blogger you tube just because I like clean my face and remove all the dead cells leaving my skin clean and soft</li>
            <li>Keep you skin clean long time</li>
            <li>Exfoliators help to remove this dead skin layer, but many are full of harsh ingreients or microbeads that can actually irritate your skin even more.</li>
            <li>This does a great job of removing excess skin and debris, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and clear and even seems to help with excess oil where needed-without being too harsh for the dry areas.  </li>
            <li>After you wash your face as normal pat dry then use two full pumps and swiftly apply to your whole face.</li>
            <li>because at the end of the day... my skin is clear, smooth and absent any dry flakey skin... and wasn&#x27;t that the whole point???</li>
            <li>Remember, if it actually was strong enough to make your skin peel as fast as some described, it would require a prescription from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>: I have sensitive skin, and certain chemical laden product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on your face  and it  really does clean out dead skin.</li>
            <li>and it did get a little bit more clumpy</li>
            <li>Once all of the moisture is gone and the little balls begin to stick to my face more I rinse.</li>
            <li>and it is a little bit freaky, but it is magic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so simple yet exactly what I need!</li>
            <li>I then massaged the gel still on my face in a circular motion and noticed the little clumps many people describe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, and those irritated my sensitive skin, but not this one!!</li>
            <li>And I was right - this product is simply amazing &amp; removes the dead skin from my face that my usual facial scrub does (and more)</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how clean and soft it left my face.  </li>
            <li>A high end cosmetic store in Las Vegas demonstrated a chemical exfoliant that worked great on me but was about $100 for a tiny little container, so I decided to see if I could find something similar online and came across Cure.  </li>
            <li>The added dry air makes that exfoliant not so skin friendly.</li>
            <li>The Cure Natural Aqua Gel is very gentle for even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer to wash my face and then apply one full pump of this product onto my clean, dried hands first, and then onto my dry face, in a quick circular motion (to prevent the product from drying too fast), then continue rubbing the facial skin back and forth or in circular motions until you sense that most of the &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; or dry skin has flaked off of the face.</li>
            <li>My face is super soft and glowing and I can see a dramatic improvement - blemishes are almost completely gone, pores are looking smaller, and the texture is greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by how gentle this was, and how watery.  </li>
            <li>Works really well if your skin is sensitive to the abrasive exfoliating products.</li>
            <li>Cure works so well and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but you DO have to use it on dry, clean skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and natural so that was a plus for me</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>its gentle, all natural, no grains, and exfoliates wonders.  </li>
            <li>2 pumps on a clean dry face</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle, you can&#x27;t harm your skin by over scrubbing since there are no harsh exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li>Oh how I feel completely duped for buying this, not so much on the raved reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very oily, acne-prone young lady.</li>
            <li>It is really gentle and when you are done your face is soft like baby skin</li>
            <li>It works very well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When i was massaging my face with it, i saw the white clumps of dead skin cells and i was happy because i knew it was actually working!</li>
            <li>Natural Aqua Gel really does all it claims to do.</li>
            <li>This exfoliates my skin in a gentle manner, but clearly does the job well.  </li>
            <li>and wow, I had never seen so much skin come off</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and I KNOW that it&#x27;s working and sloughing off dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth the money; I&#x27;ve had my bottle for almost three months and have only used about 1/6 of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It gently and painlessly removes any dead skin and leaves you feeling as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the dead skins come.</li>
            <li>it was magical that it removed all the dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li>I thought of doing one more experiment where I reapplied cure again on the washed face immediately just to see that its not the products which was producing a dead skin like substance...and result ...</li>
            <li>Besides, elbows are a joint where skin accumulates, thus more dead cells.</li>
            <li>Works like magic to take off that dead layer if skin.  </li>
            <li>It is so satisfying seeing the dead skin ball up and come off of your face.</li>
            <li>This will last me a long time for sure.  </li>
            <li>the dead skins cells are removed and my skin feels cleaner and more lighter ^^</li>
            <li>This product and the many like it do not crumble up your dead skin as soon you apply the product.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used The Cure on my legs only the first time and it didn&#x27;t only produced the white sort of pills that most people refer to.</li>
            <li>it sure isn&#x27;t my dead skin cells...</li>
            <li>For me every 2-3 days one application a day, and after 3-4 applications total (~1.5 weeks worth)</li>
            <li>Most exfoliators SHOULD fade scars because the point of it is to shed dead skin and reveal newer, fresher looking skin, however, lots of exfoliators don&#x27;t dothis because of their harsh, grainy formula that can tear skin and cause more</li>
            <li>So one bottle that I use almost everyday lasted me more than a year.</li>
            <li>I hop in the shower and rinse my face and then wash my face with my normal face wash.</li>
            <li>But the result is much better since the dead skin literally just falls off by itself.</li>
            <li>It removes quite a lot of dead skin cells, and leaves your skin better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has cleared many of my break outs and dead skin.</li>
            <li>I have used similar product that I bought in Thailand long ago, it was more like ticker gel</li>
            <li>Did not know I have been living this many years under a dense layer of dead cells.</li>
            <li>I love how you literally see the dead skin come off and makes your cheeks feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>and it flakes not just in the winter like many, but I have trouble throughout the year.</li>
            <li>Since then, my face has become soft and silky, free of blemishes entirely, and has started to clear up blackheads as well.</li>
            <li>do I normally use?</li>
            <li>Their peel is a few dollars more</li>
            <li>i recieved this product a few days agao and used it in the shower yesterday and it was like magic.</li>
            <li>(because you exfoliated most of the dead skin off).</li>
            <li>My skin are: Olive tan, normal to combination to oily side, with pimples, cystic acne and acne</li>
            <li>It felt like more dead skin was coming off</li>
            <li>make sure you leave it on for a few min before before you start to rub off</li>
            <li>I washed my face and exfoliated it with the skin care products that I normally use</li>
            <li>as you normally do.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will last for long time.</li>
            <li>softness after each use  with no negative effect.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift and although I was a bit skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve found it does a good job.</li>
            <li>It is good, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li>I just got the cute half hour ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to use and write it!</li>
            <li>and I have other cheaper product I bought which is fine, but nothing like this.</li>
            <li>Although it does actually do a pretty good job at taking away my dead skin cells, it&#x27;s pretty equal in terms of other gel based exfoliators.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that this bottle will last a very long time.     </li>
            <li>My product was easy to apply since it came with English instructions on the back.</li>
            <li>Definitely make sure your hands and face are dry when you apply the gel.</li>
            <li>keeping in mind to exfoliate less around the eye area than the rest of the face because it is more sensitive with thinner skin.</li>
            <li>This product removes all of my dry skin and leaves my skin soft and smooth-- with no burning whatsoever.</li>
            <li>, your skin may still be dry after using it, but maybe that&#x27;s because your moisturizer isn&#x27;t potent enough.</li>
            <li>Left my skin incredibly smooth and silky, not dry at all.</li>
            <li>, this product got me right back on track.</li>
            <li>Rinse face with warm water, let skin air dry but not completely dry, then with 2-3 pumps, I applied to face and rubbed away, starting from my nose and working outwards and away towards my ears.  </li>
            <li>So, a lot of dark can be easily put on my face.</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed right away was that I really did feel and see skin debris on my face (gently rub) I was astonished BC I have never seen this with any other exfloliant I&#x27;ve use before.  </li>
            <li>But this made my skin feel less itchy and tight and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: Fantastic product, but use judgement and treat it as you would any other exfoliant.</li>
            <li>The second round produced even more &amp;#34;skin rice&amp;#34; than the first time</li>
            <li>The clumps forming on my legs were no doubt dead skin (pretty gross but oddly satisfying).  </li>
            <li>I live in AZ and the climate was taking a toll on my skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>I feel like a bonafide GURU when people hang onto my every word as they admire my new skin.  </li>
            <li>I used to live in Japan</li>
            <li>Received in 18 days with Christmas and New Year in between.</li>
            <li>I use this when my clairisonic needs a new brush head.</li>
            <li>I will be repurchasing this as soon as I need a new one.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>and I have not had new breakouts</li>
            <li>I even use the exfoliator on my hands because I live in South Florida</li>
            <li>If you have sweaty palms or live in a humid area</li>
            <li>I live in Japan and saw this exfoliating gel everywhere.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to look for a new exfoliating face scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To begin with, I live in Okinawa Japan</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to love this product, because I don&#x27;t want to scrub my face with hard things anymore.</li>
            <li>Much more effective than products that burn and cause ugly redness</li>
            <li>The amount of white balls is always amazing, there hasn&#x27;t been any decrease in them which seems odd since I use this so frequently.</li>
            <li>I am African American with oily, acne prone, huge pored skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but this product seems amazing.  </li>
            <li>I definitely felt the texture of the dead skin cells coming off, but afterwards I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing difference.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot more money on products that were one third the size and didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>My normally oily skin has begun playing tricks on me where my face was becoming so dry on the outside.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like it exfoliated much, but left a layer of moisturizing stickiness.</li>
            <li>but so far has been safe enough for me to use every day in Las Vegas’ dry weather.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and although my t-zone is oily, it&#x27;s been super dry.</li>
            <li>you need a quick fix for dry blotches of skin, use this.</li>
            <li>but I think it will take a few more uses for that to clear up too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gritty, and creates a kind of a paste which dead skin seems to adhere to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Around 10 mins after using Cure, my skin would start to feel super dry</li>
            <li>but it does a vey good job of exfoliating...if it was less expensive I think I could love it...</li>
            <li>I have a few microdermabrasion systems, and not one of them works like this simple gel, while using your own fingers instead of a machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne-proned skin, so I&#x27;m always cautious when trying new products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as effective as it is disturbing, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to get real results with an exfoliating product.</li>
            <li>but it does look a little more healthy and not so dull.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin type, but after i use this, my skin become smoother and even brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am age 60 and have very sensitive skin and allergies.  </li>
            <li>Also, it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This does make skin very soft.</li>
            <li>If I scrub off the dry skin with a washcloth and immediately apply the thickest moisturizer I have, I still will have dry skin pretty quickly (and I have very oily skin--</li>
            <li>Got very soft skin with it.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>acne-prone snd very sensitive skin type).</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and I have recommended it to a couple people already.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much so this bottle should last you a little while, but don&#x27;t forget most cosmetics have a shelf life</li>
            <li>As obsessed as I am about exfoliating, this product has outdone it, and what I love even more about it is that I don&#x27;t need to use a beauty tool such a loofa to help.  </li>
            <li>This works very well or me simply because its gentle, no color/fragrance, and contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use it all over to keep my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li>It only works (and works REALLY well!)</li>
            <li>1-WEEK UPDATE: If you wear a plastic glove while applying, you may need to rub with significantly more pressure because the plastic is slick and there&#x27;s no friction to rub the surface epidermis away.</li>
            <li>And it looked brighter,younger &amp; so soft!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>The bump under the scar tissue has significantly gotten smaller and I have smaller but fewer breakouts since.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, an entire layer of skin was gone and revealed maybe five whiteheads I&#x27;ve never seen before</li>
            <li>If I do not exfoliate my skin will start feeling rough like sand paper yet most exfoliants will turn my sensitive skin beet red.  </li>
            <li>I like how this has not caused any sensitivity reaction to my skin and leaves it soft for days!</li>
            <li>And they put &#x27;cure natural aqua gel&#x27; sticker on it!</li>
            <li>After this, the old exfoliaters went in the trash!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I rinsed and did a second treatment because I could feel the difference in skin texture and knew there were a couple of areas I had not focused on the first time.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt completely different after the first time, a lot softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>First things first: it arrived on time and the instructions were translated in English on the back (</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old with normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li>first I didn&#x27;t feel the product was working, I don&#x27;t read Japanese.</li>
            <li>Last night I applied The Cure to my arms and legs and let it sit while I let my tub fill with hot water for a bath -- so about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m on my second bottle, which is a year after I used the first.</li>
            <li>I like it and use it when I am not lazy.</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old woman that tries to take great care in her appearance and am trying to &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; slow the aging process.</li>
            <li>My pores look small and my skin is smooth!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, hallelujah!</li>
            <li>My skin literally looked the exact same before and after.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, the scars actually look like they are fading.</li>
            <li>Afterward my face feels soft like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>I actually tried it first on my nose—like JUST my nose area.</li>
            <li>The other thing I like is that there are no microbeads that could possibly tear the skin and cause more hyperpigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li>The first run through, I saw rolls of skin, which I knew were skin because it didn&#x27;t look white.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>The product was def not abrasive at all, and yet it removed more dead skin cells that my $100 scrubbing tool!  </li>
            <li>Or mix a larger amount in a pretty container and leave on your counter for convenience.</li>
            <li>Or mix a larger amount in a pretty container and leave on your counter for convenience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how I found this here at Amazon, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Oh, and my face felt so soft!  </li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse thoroughly and rinse other body parts which may come in contact with it such as hands and arms.</li>
            <li>First time I have ever actually observed an exfoliator working.</li>
            <li>After the first day, I looked at my skin the next morning and still, no flakes</li>
            <li>Secondly, the performance is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I was amazed and surprised!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve read you should only use it a few times a week, but the first week I ended up using it every other night because I loved the results.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling really soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>I know so many things are much much smaller and more expensive in Japan.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel baby soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I usually use it every time I shower so it can be used more than once a week.  </li>
            <li>and this adds more gentle exfoliating to my daily cleansing routine with Cure gel few times a week.</li>
            <li>I am one of the lucky who suffer from combination oily, dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>: You apply this cure gel to your clean face and let it sit for like 30 seconds and then just gently rub and all this dead skin with slough off your face</li>
            <li>Do not let the price discourage you, you need less than a 1/4 tsp of product to clean your whole face, so on the long run it is very unexpensive and totally worth the initial investment.</li>
            <li>Apply it, wait a moment while it changes from clear to slightly white,  and then very gently massage ~</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very good,gentle and effective,my skin is sensitive and prone to Rosacea,and this suits me,I recommend it to similar skin.</li>
            <li>I use the Beauty Facial Extreme Vitamin C cleanser because it got five star reviews and begin to love this product along with this Cure Natural Aqua Gel.</li>
            <li>if you apply it to a clean dry face!!!    </li>
            <li>Those patches are gone since I started using Cure - not just softer skin, there is brand new clear skin under where the patches used to be.  </li>
            <li>Great for exfoliating, but not sure if it&#x27;s the product itself or how much of my dead skin it is sloughing off.  </li>
            <li>2 pumps on dry freshly washed skin, let sit for a minute or two, then massage and rinse.</li>
            <li>while I haven&#x27;t had the same amount of dead skin sloughing off my face as the first time, there&#x27;s always a good bit, and it&#x27;s always slightly unnerving.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gets dead skin off of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it just sloughs off any dead skin easily.  </li>
            <li>At first I was kind of skeptical because it gas the consistency of water.</li>
            <li>(I know, gross and cool at the same time), then just rinse.</li>
            <li>A bb cream would be well enough coverage, and full application of foundation is not necessary.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t this magical skin soften so personally its not worth the price.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overly strong and it does take some time rubbing it over your fact before the dead skin starts to come off, but it works well.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it is definitely worth the price!!!  </li>
            <li>I use it every other day right before I shower!</li>
            <li>, it peals a little, enough to give you a feel of a fresh face, but it doesn&#x27;t enhance cleaning, if you want a clean clear skin do that before applying the peel</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- leaves skin very soft and clear afterwards</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, mature skin.</li>
            <li>Make up never looked good on me, and all the oil build-up and dead skin felt like it was weighing my face down.</li>
            <li>Bright with less buildup of dead</li>
            <li>Country &amp; Stream Facial Peeling is less costly and works way better.</li>
            <li>have seen similar products out there that cost less, but I am glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li>I used about half of the bottle then discontinued use because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product was actually exfoliating my skin or if it was the product itself that was drying up.</li>
            <li>I looked up similar items and they sell for significantly more $$ for much less product.  </li>
            <li>Very mild but completely removed the dead skin on my face leaving it like a baby&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>Next I tried to put it on my face twice, and sure enough it did not clump up (because the first time all dead skin were already removed).</li>
            <li>I put it on in the shower anyway, rubbed it in circles as though it were a beaded wash and....felt the dry skin coming right off.</li>
            <li>It absolutely rids your face of dulling dead skin, revealing fresh new skin underneath.</li>
            <li>You start massaging it on dry skin, and soon you witness your old dead skin cells leaving your face like snowflakes, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re done, you rinse/wipe off the balled up dry skin (gross) and you can continue on your merry skin care way with soft and smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe not as strong, so maybe it&#x27;s similar to a 7% TCA peel, but the sensation is definitely the same.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- only takes a certain amount of skin off with each application.</li>
            <li>but if you see a discoloration of the product (like if it turns beige instead of pure white)</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m on my second bottle) and it is certainly one of the reasons for my improved skin.</li>
            <li>; whatever you call them, the actual skin cells do not shed off after you use it on a certain spot which tells you that it works.</li>
            <li>I heard that this product does not contain alcohol (as the ingredients are in Japanese, I can&#x27;t read it), but it certainly smelled like it did, so if your skin has problems with alcohol, you may want to avoid this product.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll discover it only balls in certain places on your body.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very good for delicate or hard to scrub areas like the face or</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to use very much, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I usually use it 2x/week because I don&#x27;t want to overdo it, but it&#x27;s always a treat to use because I feel so ridiculously clean after!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my older brother try it (who never uses any skin products and just washes his face in the shower every night with regular soap) and huge amounts came off but in a dark gray color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: After reading more reviews of Cure on here, I&#x27;ve noticed that some people are saying that the little white or grey-ish (whatever color) beads that show up on your face after rubbing the product in, are just product build up.</li>
            <li>I put a little on the glass counter top on my vanity to see if I would get the same balling effect.  </li>
            <li>The only exfoliation you will get is from your skin rubbing against the little balls (you could buy an inexpensive scrub that works much better).</li>
            <li>I also make the mistake (as many do) to scrub too hard with exfoliants.</li>
            <li>The consistency is extremely watery… and when I rub it on my skin, it feels like alcohol and evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>The consistency is extremely watery and when I rub it on my skin, it feels like alcohol and evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>I saw this product on a you tube video (highly recommended by Melodee Morita) and it performed exactly as demonstrated and expected.  </li>
            <li>I have battled these embarrassing marks since my early teens due to a quick growth spurt.</li>
            <li>Cure doesn&#x27;t break me out and is great at removing dull, dead skin.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s not coming off the way its supposed to (in little balls as you rub in a circular motion) just apply a little more and it will come right off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very heavy, but someone with a sensitive nose can&#x27;t miss it!</li>
            <li>and I never felt my skin that much clear,</li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear and even fades my freckles and age spots (I&#x27;m 64).</li>
            <li>I would get out of the shower and have clear signs of trauma, but it was either that or peel 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It come out as a clear gel and you won&#x27;t think that this product will do anything in your hand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to use hydrocortisone 1% cream to try and clear the rash.</li>
            <li>Just wash my face with Shiseido cleanser, rince, and then rub this clear, lightweight, odorless solution all over my face before rinsing again.  </li>
            <li>I also think it has been helping to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>It’s clearly plastic &amp; in my opinion the product itself once it dries off.</li>
            <li>The flaky patches I had on my cheeks are gone and my skin is clear and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works, however, do not expect it to clear your pores, acnes, and scars in one or two uses.</li>
            <li>Using it once a week, it helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear liquid gel appearing to have no added fragrance or color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel that doesn&#x27;t burn, or smell.</li>
            <li>I wanted a gentle exfoliator since I have sensitive skin, and I felt like gritty exfoliators</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for extremely sensitive skin like mine, but tougher than an MMA fight to get that gunk off the face.</li>
            <li>You guys, i&#x27;ve used this only four times and my acne scars are already light pink instead of red/brown.</li>
            <li>But the one I received wasn&#x27;t clear gel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how really, but ever since I started using it my &#x27;acne beard&#x27; as I put it grossly</li>
            <li>It is far too wasteful to use it that way.</li>
            <li>Oh wow.</li>
            <li>I also applied it on my dad (who had just scrubed the heck out of his face with a loofah), and no dead skin balls formed.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and hands and could not believe how soft my face and hands felt after using this.</li>
            <li>If you have acne prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Gentle enough that I can exfoliate my 10 year olds face that was peeling from a sunburn!</li>
            <li>but I am very encouraged by this initial try.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle enough yet efficient in what it does --- exfoliate!!!</li>
            <li>There is a chance that if you apply it the second time, you can actually cause your acne to bleed, so do be careful because it is potent.</li>
            <li>my skib become really soft after I use it</li>
            <li>After washing my face the skin was so soft, no irritation, no bumps, so soothing just like a baby skin.</li>
            <li>no dead skin at all.</li>
            <li>This reveals soft, supple, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft against my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>my face tone lightened up immediately and my skin just feels sooo soft.</li>
            <li>I was kinda worried because the delivery status didn&#x27;t show since it was coming directly from Japan  </li>
            <li>so far, I&#x27;m noticing my skin</li>
            <li>I have never been sensitive to these types of things before</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft for days after I use this.</li>
            <li>My skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I have turned my 60 yr old parents onto this.</li>
            <li>some areas may feel sensitive after exfoliation (be mindful of your choices)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cleans your skin, face feels so soft after rinse.</li>
            <li>I finally found it on here for a reasonable price compared to 45 dollars at a store we have in hawaii.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over all sastifed and let me tell you after using it your skin is so soft</li>
            <li>/burn a bit by the final application indicating I may be doing it to much.</li>
            <li>I can say my face feels extremely soft after use</li>
            <li>Not harsh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice some fading in old acne scars.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>This will make your face ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li>It worked really well, I used micro dermabrazen and it left my face inflamed and irritated.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;skin feels soft and supple after use</li>
            <li>but I like how leaves my skin soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I know that it actually is working because my skin can get very peely and flaky</li>
            <li>30 something for a face wash is too much for me, but this bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li>I have used it in the shower and can&#x27;t imagine that it would rinse off completely at the sink.</li>
            <li>Has helped with blemishes and pigmentation from old acne.</li>
            <li>It says its a natural aqua gel</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it once week because my face is sensitive</li>
            <li>This product does make your face feel soft</li>
            <li>I just lotion up afterwards and my face is soft as a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And soft</li>
            <li>This product makes my 57 year old skin look and feel rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it twice in a row to ensure my skin is completely dead-skin cell cleansed.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 years old and have tried just about every skincare product out there</li>
            <li>but you will be surprised.</li>
            <li>I tried it and boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li>product hasn&#x27;t completely resolved the situation, per se, but it does accomplish two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As one usage doesn&#x27;t really FIX the entire problem, I am giving it four-stars for now.</li>
            <li>but my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had a reaction</li>
            <li>Our pores are smaller and, our skin glows, it really does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a WONDER PRODUCT as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also made a conscious choice to get away from exfoliants that use those micro beads that are clogging our water and getting into our food supply through fish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve foregone the use of a primer because my skin is baby soft</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it once or twice a week in the shower and my face and neck feel incredibly soft and hydrated afterwards.</li>
            <li>It works really well on not just my face, but on any spot of skin that needs some extra exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I guess it was dirt and old skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels extremely soft to the touch without the tightening feeling</li>
            <li>The balls may contain some sort of product, but they also contain dead skin cells as my face feels impeccably smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin, could not tolerate scrub, microdermabrasion or retinol product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will help with acne, wrinkle or pigmentation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>So far I can see some improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Deep cleans my face and neck , it feels much smoother every time ...</li>
            <li>Rub face softly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 20s, asian/filipino, lighter-medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>Of course after frequent use...</li>
            <li>And thankfully, it takes 2 drops of this big bottle to do your whole face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old.  </li>
            <li>Irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After using, I also realized that the balls that come off your skin are just the product, not dead skin.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dead skin.</li>
            <li>I have seriously sensitive skin and have never found an exfoliating product that I could use, until now.</li>
            <li>Natural Aqua Gel ingredients: water, glycerin, acrylates/C10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dicocodimonium chloride, steartrimonium bromide, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, gingko biloba extract , rosmarinus officinalis/rosemary leaf extract, butylene glycol.</li>
            <li>This leaves my face feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin</li>
            <li>I was busy</li>
            <li>I noticed some reviewers saying that they thought they were just rubbing off the solution itself and not dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I could never get my skin to feel baby soft, even with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Only 1 to 2 pumps are needed for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>I completely understand why this is a #1 product.</li>
            <li>It turns out that I was just bring all the deep seated impurities to the surface, and now my skin is exponentially clearer, with breakouts MUCH rarer than ever before.</li>
            <li>My mom tried it and she really looked several years younger because her skin was much brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>When I use it to often, my skin gets sensitive.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels sensitive.</li>
            <li>The flakes are COMPLETELY gone</li>
            <li>Very helpful review and video with English subtitles about how to use Cure:</li>
            <li>It really feels like you have given your face a deep cleansing and polish all in one.</li>
            <li>Sugar is a natural preservative.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Sugar is a natural preservative.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have quite sensitive skin</li>
            <li>caution if you have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Now I must say that if you are someone with sensitive skin then this product will probably work wonders for you, so I think its all about the skin condition with this</li>
            <li>I tried it on my 10 year old son to test his skin which he has a baby face</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t routinely exfoliate and I would say that I my skin is mature (I&#x27;m over 40)</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li>I get so much skin compliments all of a sudden</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not foamy, so don&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li>I have been hearing about this product for a few years so with free 2 day shipping, I figured I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 39 year old guy.  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh like an acid peel, those are indiscriminate and will peel off tender skin too if used too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin really looked years younger after I was done. . .</li>
            <li>I used this several hours ago, several times, and my skin is STILL clear and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>she couldn&#x27;t get rid of and after using this it fixed it.</li>
            <li>Natural&#x27;</li>
            <li>Aqua Gel is a cloudy clear color, and the consistency is that of jello when you take it out of the fridge too early</li>
            <li>Im sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but so far i don&#x27;t see any breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft and &amp;#34;glow-y&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am a extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It felt soft and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li>You just need to follow the instruction, and ot will leave your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>I am 63 yrs old</li>
            <li>it is the product content  not dead skin that beads up</li>
            <li>so, so, soft and it often \\&quot;soften\\</li>
            <li>I found that using this after my cleanser really helped my skin overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used numerous glycolic and fruit acid products and this is a very well performing weekly treatment.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after I use this.</li>
            <li>After a week, her skin was soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive combination skin with some acne and my acne medication leaves patches of dry/flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft until I used this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li>but when I was done they were completely gone.</li>
            <li>but overall I really was blown away.</li>
            <li>but the Asians have completely nailed the beauty market.</li>
            <li>Cure Natural Aqua Gel</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t bring the whole bottle back with me.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for those who have sensitive skin and is looking for a fix on how to achieve a smoother and cleaner face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 containers one for me and one for my mother who is 63 years old.  </li>
            <li>Cure Natural –.</li>
            <li>I use it for my face, hands and even to keep my feet soft.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and never have an issue with this.</li>
            <li>Then rinse it off and your skin should feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>aqua gel is all-natural and free of harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at how efficient it cleans your skin.</li>
            <li>Also it dose leave my skin soft after I remove all the gunk  ..</li>
            <li>and it completely dries and you cannot rub it off</li>
            <li>and I covered it with makeup seamlessly.</li>
            <li>Even when I was young, I couldn’t use them.</li>
            <li>Must admit, I was hopeful that my expectations would be even further surpassed with this product, but it&#x27;s absolute crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My acne scars fade so much faster and my breakouts have subsided enormously!</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 and experiencing hormonal skin, I&#x27;m trying natural products to ease the symptoms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 and biracial with sensitive skin and hormonal acne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear radiant and soft.</li>
            <li>So far they&#x27;re getting lighter</li>
            <li>My skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It really cleans my skin deeply.</li>
            <li>and I use the product rather frequently.</li>
            <li>I feel so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft and smoothe.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft afterwards</li>
            <li>(in my early 40s)</li>
            <li>The stuff balling up is most definitely your dead epidermis.    </li>
            <li>You can see the dead skin rolling off in a similar manner to used eraser rubbing off on your paper...leaves skin feeling silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was actually the dead skin on my face coming off</li>
            <li>I love that it actually works on removeing that ashy dead layer of skin with out any tingling sensation or chemical smell.</li>
            <li>The thing I love about this product is that I can actually SEE my dead skin getting off my face and after I wash my face</li>
            <li>When I went to get a facial I was told I need to exfoliate more often to get rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of this product in removing dead skin cells that I actually can feel and see.</li>
            <li>I love that I only have to use this a few times a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fun to see it work as you gently massage the dead skin cells away.</li>
            <li>Seeing how much dead skin I had left on my face was entertaining and perplexing.</li>
            <li>I wet my face with warm water then out this stuff on it, so much dead skin came off</li>
            <li>It would do nicely for a skin massage and leaves a silky feel behind.  </li>
            <li>although I use it in the mornings before I shower because you have to make sure you really get it off your face, otherwise, it burns and is irritating.</li>
            <li>I have used apricot scrubs with little luck and other harsher exfoliants that have made my skin just go bright red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is gentle and you will feel and see the dead skin cells sluff right off.</li>
            <li>I tried it right away on my morning face &#x3D; no exfoliating since last week + oily t-zone + creams and serums from last night.  </li>
            <li>(Which sounds excessive, but it&#x27;s super gentle and it works for me to use almost</li>
            <li>I washed my face with my normal face wash, then patted the skin dry, then applied Cure to my skin in gentle circular motions.</li>
            <li>Definitely adding this to my normal skincare routine!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m convinced that the balling of skin looks so strange because it is an agglomeration (&#x27;mixture&#x27;) of both your dead skin and the product itself (which isn&#x27;t so far-fetched given that the product isn&#x27;t supposed to necessarily magically disappear!).</li>
            <li>I now know that this &#x27;white stuff&#x27; is definitely my skin, since more comes off on the side of my nose than it does on the other parts of my face that aren&#x27;t peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean I really love this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an acid which can peel live skin or like the rubing of brush or beats that if you are not careful you can irritate your skin.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a deep exfoliation with huge balls of skin rolling off based on how the other reviewers are talking about this item....</li>
            <li>I use it every other week and it has made my skin look fresh, soft and renewed.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the amount of dry skin that was removed on my first try.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash and dry your skin, your hands and face are dry and that you actually rub it into your face.</li>
            <li>Other exfoliation products with beads does not do the job quite effectively and those that has the brush system is too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin in general and started using tretinoin cream 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I love putting it on and gently scrubbing my face with the tips of my fingers, in small gentle circular motions to exfoliate my skin and getting that grainy feeling under my finger tips letting me know my dead skin has been removed.</li>
            <li>Also, my face looks better and is less dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>so I constantly had tissue to my nose causing it to become super dry and began to peel.</li>
            <li>I will certainly swear that it is removing dead skin; I was on a course of Retin-A when I first discovered this</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so the price is okay to me.</li>
            <li>This is one of few instances I don&#x27;t feel the company should be paying me to wax poetic about their product.</li>
            <li>It is not very clear that you should use the gel on DRY, clean skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This actually rubs away dirt and dead skin cells from your face leaving it clean and supple!</li>
            <li>I am very surprised to find that so many people think the white things that come off are actually the dead skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s the gel or my dead skin actually rolling up, but it does make my face feel more clean afterward.</li>
            <li>This does somehow loosen the dead skin so that it balls off when applied by hands on clean skin with circular motions.  </li>
            <li>Like seriously I tried so many times on my hands too repeatedly, first time, second time, third time in one go....</li>
            <li>It give skin a clean feeling and takes off all dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li>I am sure those white balls are not my dead skin!</li>
            <li>First off this product is expensive, but I decided it is better to spend a lot of money on something that does work, than to buy affordable exfoliators that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>First, when I wore a plastic glove and rubbed the gel between my fingers, there was absolutely ZERO balling, even after rubbing 3 minutes until it dried.  </li>
            <li>The product balled up in these white lumps which was the first sign that it was not exfoliating my skin because I don&#x27;t have white skin.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase unless if I see better results in the future after continued use.</li>
            <li>First of all I exfoliate and use my Clairisonic regularly, so when I rubbed this stuff on my cheeks and middle of my forehead</li>
            <li>I finally took the plunge and splurge and I am glad I did usually</li>
            <li>first thing you notice is the big blue ambiguous word on the bottle:</li>
            <li>This exfoliator works good at cleansing the skin and leaving a fresh cleaning feeling behind while at the same time it is not to harsh or abrasive to the sensitive skin of the face.</li>
            <li>So quick (less than a minute) to start exfoliating, no irritation.</li>
            <li>The difference is very noticeable with the first few hours that you try it.  </li>
            <li>The product does not irritate my skin at all, and effectively removes every last bit of dead skin, even patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li>--it was more than I had seen using it in the past, and additional proof that it actually works.</li>
            <li>This is super gentle and seriously makes the skin BABY soft!</li>
            <li>The price is worth it for me (especially since I was spending big bucks on Proactiv, which makes my skin red and doesn&#x27;t completely clear up acne for me - ugh).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those who want to eliminate the use of different products to achieve what this one product can accomplish.</li>
            <li>like that it is a very gentle exfoliator without rough ingredients.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those that need to exfoliate daily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 3 or 4 times, so I&#x27;m not sure about long term results, but it does make my skin look much smoother and better</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend using this prior to using a mask.</li>
            <li>I can attribute the vast improvement in my skin to this product and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone dealing with acne and clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product to slough off the dead skin cells, and I&#x27;m surprised to say that it really gets off most of the dead skin.</li>
            <li>My face is much softer than its before exfoliation state, so perhaps I have already eliminated the couple months worth of dead skin accumulation, and revealed fresh skin with only couple days worth of dead, dry skin cells...</li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t have naturally sensitive skin, I treat my oily, acne-prone skin with salicylic acid, which leaves my face prone to redness from new facial products.</li>
            <li>One kid did loose a little more with the cure</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it right though; use it after your usual makeup removal and cleansing, pat skin gently with a towel and pump this once  or twice and rub onto your skin till your skin are slightly dry or till you can feel the dead skin on your fingers.</li>
            <li>This beauty product totally works, but you can&#x27;t use on super wet skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe Cure will clear up acne, but it works so very well following on a face wash made especially for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>But as you continue to gently massage your face, the dead skin starts rubbing off and you&#x27;d be surprised at just how much comes off.</li>
            <li>When I first got this I was in the peeling/flaking stage and my face was looking rough.</li>
            <li>First of all the product arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Anyway, so yesterday, I went through my normal routine with cleansing my face in the shower with my Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Gel (that I received earlier this week), after drying my face, I applied CURE</li>
            <li>I am a mature woman and exfoliating is extremely important so that your skin care products, that are so expensive, can be readily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>product does work, and it actually does quite a good job at removing my dead skin cells, but about just as equal as my other products do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more exfoliators and really didn&#x27;t know one way or the other if they were actually removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I use AHA&#x27;s on my skin to keep my acne away so my skin gets flaky in certain spots, and i needed something to take away the dry flakes.</li>
            <li>I can always find easy or hard to find items with Amazon.</li>
            <li>other product has made my skin feel so brand new!!!  </li>
            <li>I usually stick to only chemical exfoliants, as most physical ones are too abrasive for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very delicate 72-year old skin and cannot use abrasive exfoliators without removing too many layers.  </li>
            <li>I know I am too lazy to scrub my body every single day and thus my elbows don&#x27;t get such a nice treatment.</li>
            <li>If u r familiar with Moroccan bath you will have the same result but with less effort.</li>
            <li>Yes, as many other reviewers said, I can clearly see my dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much at once or leave it on too long or it will burn!</li>
            <li>I will say this, all of the reviewers who are saying it doesn&#x27;t work, I hope that they are not only using this and expecting for a new face to appear in the mirror before them.    </li>
            <li>I did start using another new product at the same time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m creating a new system for myself since I found out that my Proactiv facial scrub has polyethylene &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; which are accumulating in our water systems and the fish we eat.</li>
            <li>Unlike other exfoliators, this is very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and not like other exfolitor product</li>
            <li>Unlike other products, it&#x27;s also very gentle.</li>
            <li>It broke me out and took alot of nasty skin off, but now my skin is bright and silky smooth!</li>
            <li>I immediately washed my face with a baby soap, pat dry and put one dab of cure on my face gently massaging allover my face.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has blackheads, dry skin, or un-even blemishes.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, flaky skin and no matter how much you exfoliate you&#x27;re still peeling, buy this now.</li>
            <li>You then gently rub in circles and dry skin</li>
            <li>Just apply to dry face, gently scrub, then rinse.  </li>
            <li>However, if you use it too much it can make you look colorless and dry.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, and it does wonders(at least to my face), fast shipping, you name</li>
            <li>It works really well at exfoliating dead skin cells and giving you an opportunity to really fight your acne.</li>
            <li>As with all face products, you absolutely have to use several different products at once.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle to use everyday if you want, and the effects are very noticeable.</li>
            <li>It essentially feels like it sucks up all the oil from your skin so that you can get more friction when you rub your face with your fingers to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>it felt gross and when I rubbed it the title white grains didn&#x27;t really show up.</li>
            <li>I could not bear, one for the price and one for the less powerful exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I used all different kinds of masks, drug store products, Lush products, changed my diet, tried exercising in an effort to clear my skin to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this after reading all the good reviews but it left a weird, sticky residue on my face after using.</li>
            <li>when I used it I got so much skin off the first time it was a little gross!</li>
            <li>Well then how else does it remove less skin if I repeat the process 2-3 times in a row and begin to reveal more shiny, new skin with a slight tingling sensation?!</li>
            <li>know you&#x27;re not supposed to, but I used it every single day for about a month until my skin stopped producing so much of the substance when I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li>that it does not &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; off more dead skin after a certain point - if you test it twice on the same area of skin, there won&#x27;t be dead skin balls because it&#x27;s already gotten that layer off.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Korean massage cream products that does the same exact thing but smells much nicer and allows you to massage your face as well as take off your dead skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is no other exfoliator like CURE.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still amazed and excited to see the dead skin coming off my face!</li>
            <li>I already use a gentle daily exfoliator, but a few times a month, I want a little something more.  </li>
            <li>After the second time, the flakes were completely gone!</li>
            <li>The major drawback is that all info in some language i can&#x27;t decipher, but still 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this to people with sensitive and acne-prone skin!</li>
            <li>the acne that i do get is a lot smaller in size, and my old scars are ALL VANISHING!</li>
            <li>I especially suggest this to who have sensitive skin like me!</li>
            <li>The first use made my skin silky smooth but still left some flakiness behind</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s worth the money, you only need a little bit (maybe like 1 pump) to cover your whole face, this will probably last me a while.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have the major peeling some people get.</li>
            <li>This product exfoliates like no other.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to use on very sensitive or irritated skin as it will make certain areas red.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and I&#x27;m able to remove that gross dead layer of skin that builds up daily (especially when using acne products).</li>
            <li>typically use it right after a shower about twice a week.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and leave it on for a while before massaging the liquid and even though my feels fresh when I wash it off, I don&#x27;t get the same effect I do with other exfoliating scrubs.</li>
            <li>I bought this with a few other products and I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was originally unimpressed after a few weeks of facial use, but I&#x27;ve found it is an A+ body exfoliator as well.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling super soft and not dry or tight.</li>
            <li>Skin Issues; sensitive due to use of Retin-A, glycolic acid, and other fruit acid products for exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Occasional reaction to sulfites which can cause dry patches that are challenging to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went from rough ,dry and slightly dark to being soft , smooth and lighter !</li>
            <li>My chest has been looking older and older and every morning I notice the wrinkles on my chest and it takes half the day for them to disappear.</li>
            <li>Still smooth skin, but the overall level of &#x27;brightening&#x27; wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this point, I&#x27;ll move to figuring out how often is right for me (likely every other day or so, to keep the acne at</li>
            <li>Since I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very skeptical when buying some new products, which most of the new products irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done using it, my skin feels so smooth, BUT it does get at least somewhat dryer.</li>
            <li>I use this twice a week for general cleaning and to help promote pealing for some existing acne</li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week to clear sebacious filaments from my noise and inner cheek instead of biore strips or mask.</li>
            <li>As of late I have had issues with my skin becoming red and sensative.</li>
            <li>(initially it applies clear).  </li>
            <li>only recommendation I would have is some clear instruction on its use.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for about a week, but the results are clear.</li>
            <li>Not for those with sensitive skin though, as my friend used this and it made her face red and irritated all day.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m a 37-year old fair-skinned Asian-American male.  </li>
            <li>I have had a facial skincare routine every day of my life since I turned 30 years old.  </li>
            <li>For 5 years, as far as cleansing goes, I was always using Stridex daily, and 2x a month using an acid exfoliator (the Olay serum/scrub kit).  </li>
            <li>I only know that what I experience is removal of old skin cells.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I thought it was gimmick as well but after trying it out, wow</li>
            <li>The consistency is very watery, so be careful with applying it, as it will drip.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin extremely soft after each use and lasted for several days.</li>
            <li>The whole big shibang about this product is it&#x27;s claims to help gently exfoliate by causing the dead skin to roll up in balls.</li>
            <li>I am asian-american, japanese descent, I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Apparently, as I suspected, it doesn&#x27;t, the reason it pills up on skin like that is because something in the product clumps around oil, not skin.</li>
            <li>It was a complete &amp; total bust!</li>
            <li>I did and it hurt so much :( be careful.  </li>
            <li>Skin sloughs off and pills in your hand when particularly applied to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Follow up with a gentle face wash or just wet cloth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 54 year old female.  </li>
            <li>Natural Aqua Gel is very similar to what I used to have</li>
            <li>My skin was not really lighter, but much brighter, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]</li>
            <li>then I massaged it in and here came the white balls and WOW ....</li>
            <li>My skin is back to when I was young.</li>
            <li>However, the next morning, all of my developing breakouts were completely gone.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t use a lot of skincare products or my face will get red.  </li>
            <li>Only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I received the Cure Natural Aqua in the mail last week.</li>
            <li>I am currently using a microneedle (dermaroller) device for the stretch marks on my breasts (which are hideous and have left me very self-conscious my entire life).</li>
            <li>people made a comment that the white part that comes out from rubbing your face is not dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>Even though she exfoliates regularly, she said she hasn&#x27;t felt her skin so soft in years.</li>
            <li>It left my skin soo soft</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my skin is baby skin soft and it lets my toner and serum soak deep into my skin, keeping it hydrated.</li>
            <li>I paired it with the Hada Labo lotion and Haba Labo moisturizer, and found my skin still completely soft and supple the next morning.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the feeling using my bare hands.</li>
            <li>I waited for 3 weeks for my skin to completely heal then use it again and again, it left my skin softer than a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s when I realized that there&#x27;s simply no dead skin on the back of my hand since I wash and scrub my hands so often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft without making pores big.</li>
            <li>Once you see white stuff start appearing on your face, gently rub in circles, creating gross white balls of skin and</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, apparently.</li>
            <li>I used Cure Natural Aqua Gel from last two weeks.</li>
            <li>because after you use it the first time, there really is no need to put on a second time.</li>
            <li>Of course, I declined her kind offer and moved on with my life, and then I randomly discovered Cure on amazon and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it too often because i find that irritating to my skin and causes more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Dead skin is gone and my serum was really absorbed.</li>
            <li>the top of the bottle was broken when it arrived even though it was in a plastic ......</li>
            <li>This exfoliator is kind of weird because it doesn&#x27;t have any beads or anything</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became a true believe when this past weekend, I had a spur of the moment business dinner meeting.</li>
            <li>(more like made it worse)</li>
            <li>It gets most dry skin off after a few minutes, but it smells weird, takes a long time to ship, a bit pricey and isn&#x27;t as effective</li>
            <li>The price go up and down the first time I brought it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for other skin types, it might be a little different.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no lather, no cooling or warming sensation, and no little gritty bits scratching your face, as there is in exfoliating scrubs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>These oil products from Japan for break out prone skin were so tempting because of being part Japanese but on my face, I will regularly wake up with a new blemish.</li>
            <li>It is very useful to shed dead skin cells from problem areas like nose and chin, you can definitely see and feel the skin sloughing off, but it won&#x27;t clear every single impurity for those with imperfect skin.</li>
            <li>i am asian- 39 yrs of age; i havent been using this product long enough to give a good review and to see any dramatic changes or changes in my skin however as for the exfloxiating as it claim, it does do that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t contribute all of the success to this product as I have also changed my face wash to one without fragrances and other harsh chemicals (I currently use Simple foaming cleanser, as I don&#x27;t feel it is smart to spend so much on something that is temporarily going to be on your face), and have increased my exercise regimen, and I currently use Clinique Dramatically Different moisturizing lotion/gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As you massage it in, you can see all if the dead skin coming right off.</li>
            <li>The dead skin just rolls right off of your face.</li>
            <li>After the first use, i noticed the oxidation of the black heads on my nose was gone, making it almost seem as if they&#x27;d disappeared (they hadn&#x27;t of course, but still.)  </li>
            <li>and I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>two days after I use it I always have dry, flaky skin that my normal exfoliation doesn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li>Odd feeling at first because you don&#x27;t know what to expect but leaves your skin silky without over drying it.</li>
            <li>I have tried other exfoliators of this type, but this is the first one that actually works for me.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day on my lips and face so far and no negative effects.</li>
            <li>I would compare two applications of this product to a mild chemical peel or a month of using retinoids, but without their harsh effects!</li>
            <li>I only rubbed for a minute or 2 because I got nervous that even with gentle rubbing, I might loose my face.</li>
            <li>so I tried it on my feet and it took the rough dry cracked skin right off.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle enough to use on my twins knees when they are very dry.....</li>
            <li>Due to all the reviews, I had high hopes for this product!</li>
            <li>gently exfoliates and doesn&#x27;t cause the inflammation after some exfoliation processes take due to abrasion and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time yesterday (03-15-2014), and I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li>I am African American with normal deep chocolate colored skin.</li>
            <li>Okay product, exfoliates by forming little gel beads that lift away dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>One thing make sure that when you apply this product on your skin, you should wait a little few seconds to turn whiter, and start rub it.</li>
            <li>My skin felt very smooth after, and it was fun \\&quot;rubbing off the skin the product attaches itself to like glue\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure that all of those little balls were really dead skin.  </li>
            <li>These skin food products are far superior to American made, sorry to say, and they do not cause other problems to deal with.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so smooth, seriously.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take some months for me to see a dramatic difference, but I&#x27;m on the road to better looking breasts.</li>
            <li>I am an Asian Indian 30 year old housewife with a flacky, dry, combination and really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that such a soft and gentle exfoliator could have such an enormous effect, so I checked the product to see if it had any hidden balls within it but found none.</li>
            <li>So, I tested this applying to the back of my hand in several applications in a row, each time the amount of &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; became less and less until nothing more came off.</li>
            <li>It gently removes surface dead skin cells, revealing soft baby skin.</li>
            <li>I am not so sure that the white ball stuff are dead skin cells, but I have gotten into a routine of using the product twice a week and there are considerably less balls than in the begining.</li>
            <li>and they can all be harsh depending on the one you try; they are NO WHERE near as gentle as this and NO</li>
            <li>It really takes off all the dead skin and my face feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Most exfoliators end up causing me to break out by irritating my skin further - but not The Cure!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I think my skin&#x27;s gotten good enough of a cleaning, I rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super simple to use and only takes a few mins to do.</li>
            <li>No dry feeling or burning.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out the skin and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals which irritate the skin</li>
            <li>thought my cleanser properly disposed of my dead skin cells, but this product proves that it wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>, I realized then they are scabs and not dry patches.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product did not sting or dry my face.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>After first week, I had 6-8 breakouts(pulled out deep down acne?).</li>
            <li>My skin is usually oily acne prone, large pored, and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly, and noticed the little beads.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of medication including antibiotics, various strengths of benzoyl peroxide, and birth control, but nothing made a major difference.</li>
            <li>First, a little background to give you perspective.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a major pimple since starting to use it and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li>It has watery texture, when you rub it gently into the skin, the dead skin (the very superficial layer) falls gently forming small balls.</li>
            <li>You will begin to feel and see the dead skin bead up on your face when done simply rinse and dry and you will have glowing clean skin ready to apply your other skin care</li>
            <li>I can simply rub over it a few times with a wash cloth and it peels right off.</li>
            <li>and after using this product only a few times (I got it right before  Xmas</li>
            <li>Love this peel, just rub in circular motions all over your face and watch all the dead skin turn into white little lint sized balls on your face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little gross to see all your dead skin, but I love that it&#x27;s non-abrasive.</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re in the shower you need to first towel dry your face first then apply or it will have a rough time to see or feel that white beads that claims its your skin not real sure about that??</li>
            <li>The product itself rolled slightly like glue, but was completely clear, very sticky, and overall looked nothing like the white stuff that forms when I rub it on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really strived to reduce my acne scars, with not much success</li>
            <li>, all of the information on the bottle is in Japanese, but apparently you can find tutorials on how to apply it on Youtube or on beauty blogs.</li>
            <li>youre exfoliating first tho, or you will just be using it to remove a layer of dirt as opposed to dead skin.</li>
            <li>First evening, I had a lot of dead skin.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well at removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>The first few times I had to repeat the procedure twice because my skin needed it.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says, removing the dead skin cells from the skin.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just the gel sloughing off my face to give the appearing that my flaky, dried skin was coming off.</li>
            <li>when you first apply it you think it doesn&#x27;t do anything, but after a couple of secs you see your dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>First, I spread it all over my face, wait for a few seconds, and rub in circular motions all around my face.</li>
            <li>will say that it is relatively expensive, but the bottle is a fair size and I&#x27;ve been using it a lot (as I said, probably every other day on avg.)</li>
            <li>My skin is always SO amazingly soft after one pump of this gel exfoliator, its a little on the pricey side but since one pump is enough for your whole face, and you&#x27;d only use this product once a week</li>
            <li>All you do is rub hands on face or body part in soft light circular motions and instantly, you get tons of dead skin (grainy, little, beads) rolling around on your skin.  </li>
            <li>All you do is rub hands on face or body part in soft light circular motions and instantly, you get tons of dead skin (grainy, little, beads) rolling around on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I applied a dime size amount to my hand and rubbed it all over my face and my nose and was shocked to see how clean and smooth my face was.</li>
            <li>To really appreciate a product I write down my expectations VS.</li>
            <li>It kept my peeling down to a minimum while I was out and about and removed SO much skin before I applied my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(the cystic has calmed down since, thanks to prescription intervention)</li>
            <li>I have very dry, very sensitive skin with rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is also very dry in the cheek and chin area, and oily in the t-zone.</li>
            <li>reviews are right on point-very gentle cleanser, wait a few seconds and the dead skin starts to come</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my teenage nieces after I first discovered this in a store in Little Tokyo.</li>
            <li>With this little exfoliator I&#x27;m able to remove the layer of dead skin cells and reveal a brighter face!</li>
            <li>I use a lot of other skin products so my skin is in decent shape</li>
            <li>I use it every other day because I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>so I know it is very gentle, apparently it only affects dead skin.</li>
            <li>Its like rubbing water or gel on your face rather than most exfoliators which are rocky and rough which may leave your face even worse off, especially if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>Small circular motions make a layer of my skin come right off.</li>
            <li>And it leaves skin feeling so smooth; I have a hard time keeping my hands away from my face!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to other buyers.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes on this product based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>This will gently dissolve them and then you can softly sponge your dead skin off and continue with the reigning to heal your face!</li>
            <li>I usually apply this after I finish my morning shower (use it on dry, clean face).</li>
            <li>Rub it onto you dry, clean face and watch the dead skin start to pill up!</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have excessively sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin and can&#x27;t tolerate Cetaphil cleanser, Purpose cleanser, or exfoliating every 6 days</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin and had stopped using my Clarisonic Mia because it was causing dry patches</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had extremely dry, flaky spots on the crease of my nose, my forehead, and near my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>That being said, I also suffer from dry skin and bouts of adult acne.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, I thought &amp;#34;Yea, but do these people have dry, sensitive, temperamental skin?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Watch for lower prices and buy when it&#x27;s less than $30 and its a real bargain.</li>
            <li>I bought this exfoliant for my daughter because she has acne rosacea and severe dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I did used it after washing my face and completely towel dry.</li>
            <li>I put this to the test and the dry skin came completely off it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried exfoliating back to back and while the first time there was a lot of dead skin, the second time there was barely any</li>
            <li>This is because it&#x27;s actually ridding your face of dead skin cells the first time.</li>
            <li>got this mainly because I had a few breakouts which left scars on my face since early Aug</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I thought &amp;#34;there is no way that this stuff is going to work-it feels like nothing&amp;#34; but I massaged it on my skin and all this dead skin starting coming off!</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had as much dead skin come off as the first or second time I used this stuff...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra for quality and this definitely is!</li>
            <li>did not hate it, since it actually cleansed my face but its not that my pores decreased, and the softness of skin I can get with other products I have for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>I thought it would help with acne too, it does get the swelling down, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent future breakouts, so it makes me wonder just how much dirt and oil</li>
            <li>I have eczema including having it on my face in the past, but my facial skin is still sensitive and this is really gentle.</li>
            <li>I definitely will keep using Cure Natural Aqua Gel in my beauty regime, I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find/hear about it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using it two times in a row (back to back) and the second time, barely any beads form at all.</li>
            <li>After reading several positive reviews across multiple websites, I threw thirty dollars into the internet and received the product less than two days later, presumably delivered via techno-wizardry.</li>
            <li>In fact, it seems to clear up some of her existing scars and definitely removes any dry, flaking skin.</li>
            <li>Yet it always seems to be less likely to react after a gentle peel.  </li>
            <li>it again two days later, and noticed some recent acne scars already lightening (recent as in earlier in the week) but no real impact yet on some older darker spots, but will give it some time.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that seem to break out or turn red at every single thing i use on it.</li>
            <li>I only use it twice a week and its super gentle on my sensitive skin so no more exfoliating with other harsh and grainy products..</li>
            <li>I was almost certain it was a scam and that I had wasted my money.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>When I ordered this product, I had previously done a whole research on Asian skin care products and found out that most of them were really expensive and sometimes didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>Put on rubber or latex free gloves, place a small amount of product on one gloved hand and rub with the other glove hand, you&#x27;ll see the same bits form, no skin</li>
            <li>He likes it so much because he can SEE it&#x27;s working when the little clumps form.</li>
            <li>After much testing and analyzing the product I must say that my skin feels significantly cleaner and smoother after every use, but the small little particles are certainly not my skin.</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t my dead skins be a little light brown or something?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, this product makes me break out in red itchy bumps on large areas of my face and also a few white heads!</li>
            <li>When I exfoliate my body using a scrub, little rolls that are tinted grey start to peel off, this is the exact same thing that happens when I use the cure gel on my face.</li>
            <li>I am convinced my large pores are less noticeable now that I&#x27;m not scrubbing with an exfoliater!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for a deep cleanse that does not leave your skin feeling dry, tight or sensitive.</li>
            <li>while so many other expensive products don&#x27;t live up to their name, this does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on legs as my legs are quite dry, and I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t provide as much moisture as my other products.</li>
            <li>My skin has been very sensitive due to sun exposure, I couldn&#x27;t use physical exfoliators like microbeads or facial brushes, etc.</li>
            <li>Good seller but bad product</li>
            <li>This stuff is crazy and works amazing.</li>
            <li>I do not have bad acne or any facial problems but was looking for a good exfoliate/cleaner product.</li>

            <li> Best exfoliator I have ever tried :)</li>
            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful exfoliator but it may be better for the body than the face.</li>
            <li> Wonderful satin smooth skin!</li>
            <li> so it may not be very suitable for me.</li>
            <li> So happy it came so soon :) !</li>
            <li> very good product, love it.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing on my face and exfoliates it greatly.</li>
            <li> I always try to take good care of my skin</li>
            <li> its good for your skin to remove that).</li>
            <li> Its that good-</li>
            <li> It sounded so good</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get good results and sometimes I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Take incredibly good care of their skin over there.  </li>
            <li> Good value as it&#x27;s priced fairly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One applicantion made my mom&#x27;s leg keratosis look so good.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a good cartoons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been envious of how wonderful skin products are readily available in Asia but not in the states</li>
            <li> Asia knows what&#x27;s up with good skin.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> For me, I like to use it fairly often to manage the flaky skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still kept buying it, because it was that good.  </li>
            <li> I brought this based on the good reviews</li>
            <li> absolutly freaky how good this stuff is and how well it works.</li>
            <li> My husband even tried it and loved t.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of good reviews here in amazon</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li> realized it was no where close as good as the version I had &#x3D; 1 dime of the product works all over face and neck.  </li>
            <li> realized it was no where close as good as the version I had &#x3D; 1 dime of the product works all over face and neck.  </li>
            <li> This is a good exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> It is a good exfoliator for weekly usage.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> SO GOOD PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> not so good, ruff on skin.</li>
            <li> but soon it turned into something good for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rate this 5 stars because it is a good product but nothing like a HOLY GRAIL product for me</li>
            <li> but nevertheless it is a good purchase if you ever decide to give it a try.</li>
            <li> (in a good way).  </li>
            <li> But i would reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a good exfoliator, though it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> The gel worked good.</li>
            <li> because that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a bubzbeauty youtube review, saw the good and so-so reviews on amazon, but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and in good shape.  </li>
            <li> This stuff I tried for weeks and nothing good happened.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good product for others that&#x27;s why I purchased, however this does not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> When I intially bought this I loved it and told all my friends to get it</li>
            <li> Good product, this is my 5th bottle already, thx</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard that it was supposed to be good for exfoliating your face.</li>
            <li> Feels good after rinsing.</li>
            <li> My mom - who is in her 50&#x27;s - reluctantly tried some one evening and was delighted by the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but a good investment.</li>
            <li> and i heard lots ppl saying this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use it as part of my routine, but I am hopeful for good results.</li>
            <li> Apply a fair amount of Cure to your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty good at exfoliating, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> It worked good</li>
            <li> But this one was good size for this</li>
            <li> I bought another one for my sister and recommend it to all my good friends and family.</li>
            <li> I will say you need a good moisturizer after using Cure.</li>
            <li> It is a really good product，clean</li>
            <li> but it never gave me as good results as this one.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product</li>
            <li> I use it at night and slather on a good night cream</li>
            <li> I loved it ! :-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a true believer in Cure!!!</li>
            <li> And remember that it works best if you use some lotion after, just like you have to oil leather after you clean it.</li>
            <li> True to reviews, this was a great buy!  </li>
            <li> Awesome product.. really cool to see the beads form.</li>
            <li> This one product has changed her life, boost her confidence and made her more beautiful.</li>
            <li> Cure is more runny, and seems to spread more evenly and exfoliate with the best of them.</li>
            <li> My skin was nice and smooth and it looked great!</li>
            <li> Finally, I can say that this is indeed the best selling and the best exfoliator around in this period.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, mild cleanser.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and in great condition!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliator out there - gentle, yet very effective.</li>
            <li> I have never tried anything like it, and trust me, I have tried many many many beauty products!!!  </li>
            <li> There, I came across a bubzbeauty (very cool and adorable gal) channel and learned that CURE was Japan&#x27;s best selling exfoliater.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SUPER CLOSE TO GETTING IT!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SUPER CLOSE TO GETTING IT!!!  </li>
            <li> skin feels very, very smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my very favorite products.  </li>
            <li> shes amazing and in her videos she gives really good explanations of why she is using the products she does</li>
            <li> I buy it just to use on my feet sometimes, tho is great for many places.</li>
            <li> I have not notice any great improvement in how my skin looks though so I&#x27;m wondering if exfoliation is important after all!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best exfoliating scrub out there; my St. Ives apricot exfoliating scrub would leave my combination skin feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Fun to use and it works great!</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> And feeling beautiful naturally is a feeling that is priceless for any woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews about how great this product was, I tried it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and after using for almost 6 months</li>
            <li> for the Aqua gel, I am very pleased with the results, will be buying back-up soon.</li>
            <li> glad I found out about this product great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel once a week for a couple of weeks now and have been very pleased with how it&#x27;s been working.</li>
            <li> Is amazing how good is this product .</li>
            <li> i used it one/twice a week and very pleased</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for lips, too, and I love to give myself a luxurious lip exfoliation when I&#x27;m feeling chapped.</li>
            <li> Very glad I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> gave it three stars to indicate a good face wash but not as an effective exfoliating agent.</li>
            <li> Amazing wonderful sexy fabulous gorgeous  </li>
            <li> I switched to Paula&#x27;s Choice (their BHA exfoliant is light years better for my skin than this product), and my skin is the best it has looked in years.</li>
            <li> so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I have the best performance wth this product the first time.</li>
            <li> SO glad I gave it a shot!  </li>

            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing</li>
            <li> I purchased Cure after reading the reviews and it is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing compared to anything else that I tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> My face feels so great and smooth after every time using Cure.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This products is so amazing</li>
            <li> I believe that the product is balling up itself and that the lumps created are not skin, but my skin feels amazing after using.  </li>
            <li> And I can also vouch for this being an AMAZING exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> And I had thought I was rather nicely exfoliated to begin</li>
            <li> Effective.</li>
            <li> and I really do consider this the best exfoliate without harming your skin.</li>
            <li> ( Thank you for being so kind) on the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(3) Extremely effective.  </li>
            <li> Works like an eraser to pull out sebaceous residue from pores and remove any residue of any kind on skin surface.</li>
            <li> so I kind of just gave up.</li>
            <li> I thought this was some kind of gimmick also.</li>
            <li> Hope they buy their own.</li>
            <li> I have tried also doing the top and bottom eyelid areas as well, with good results...</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best skin exfoliator ever.</li>
            <li> I can see why its so popular.  </li>
            <li> There are effective exfoliation products on the market</li>
            <li> This has no effect, its basically water with some kind of foaming agent....</li>
            <li> Exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li> Cure works effectively and you do not have to worry about burning your skin etc.</li>
            <li> I can see why it is a most loved product in Japan.  </li>
            <li> As mentioned, once makeup is applied, you may still notice dryness depending on severity of your own face&#x27;s condition--but texturally speaking, it does make your skin feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of them combine don&#x27;t work as effectively as this stuff.</li>
            <li> Now I want to make my OWN demo video!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What comes off is its own product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it never makes contact with your skin because it builds its own barrier.</li>
            <li> nice surprise</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my face anymore, but on my body, where it still is nice to see clumps of formula/dead skin cells come off every so often.</li>
            <li> The nice shop assistant gave me a sample to take home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i could honestly do without it</li>
            <li> I wish this company would start their own website for us USA citizens already.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still buy it in the states for the price because it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
            <li> and I do see the &amp;#34;rolls of skin&amp;#34; forming, but honestly it cannot be skin.</li>
            <li> Aqua Gel is absolutely THE BEST you can get.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to have the directions, ingredients, and any warnings translated and enclosed with the package purchase.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to try a product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought this product because I&#x27;d seen so many good reviews on it, and boy does it meet expectations.</li>
            <li> How I ordered this product was because I heard it was the number 1 selling exfoliating product in Japan, being so popular that it doesn&#x27;t even need to advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even now I still can&#x27;t believe how nice my face feels.</li>
            <li> and my skin is just so nice and silky now.</li>
            <li> ~three times a week, it is really effective.</li>
            <li> but honestly it doesn&#x27;t matter to me either way.</li>
            <li> * MAKE YOUR OWN EXFOLIANT:</li>
            <li> * MAKE YOUR OWN EXFOLIANT:</li>
            <li> Best gentle exfoliate ever.</li>
            <li> Product dries on it own.</li>
            <li> it is unbelievably effective and will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> This is kind of like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> and you think does this do more harm then good, but this products feels like jelly water.</li>
            <li> I rinsed off with warm water</li>
            <li> rinse your face with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the product really nice after just one use.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I got ripped off because when I think of an exfoliating I assume it&#x27;s always a scrub</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product and I am so happy that I stumbled upon it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is looks like a foggy kind of water and its rather runny when you put it on your hands.</li>
            <li> my skin looks and feels so nice</li>
            <li> Works great - love how smooth it makes my skin!</li>
            <li> also it kind of smells like bleach</li>
            <li> so I have yet to observe what good this exfoliator will do more for my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a nonabrasive, nonirritating exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy this in the US because it is simply astounding</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I use this gel, and it works spectacularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved having smooth skin and thankfully I have good genes from my mother</li>
            <li> Nice touch.</li>
            <li> honestly, I don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> However even though my skin feels very good right now</li>
            <li> Working good, and fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is not that great, but the results are definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to see the difference in time!!</li>
            <li> My face may feel &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s probably because of the alcohol in the product that gives your face the squeaky clean feel, but after using this item for a month, I do NOT see any great results.</li>
            <li> Great way to clean and exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator ive used so far!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many cleansing product including some very famous one but none of them could satisfies me as this one does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty freaking incredible.</li>
            <li> clean!!</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new scrub and decided to give this one a try because I saw that it was a best seller.</li>
            <li> When I do get good results my skin is smooth and it gives it a nice hint of brightness and glow to it.</li>
            <li> Your face will feel amazing and baby soft and perfect to absorb your skin care</li>
            <li> After hearing so many good things about this product, I decided to splurge and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> There are so many good products with better price out there.</li>
            <li> Package came really quickly and I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed that I decided I really had to write a review immediately :).&lt;br</li>

            <li> :) love it!</li>

            <li> My skin feels to smooth and clean after using it!!!</li>
            <li> maybe i did a very good job on cleaning my face, so this thing did not show too much effect.</li>

            <li> I kind of fear there is something in it we do not allow, although I cannot identify it and do not want to know, because I am IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing products I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to apply this with something, instead of direct contact with your hands.  </li>
            <li> The most amazing exfoliant I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;- somewhat pricey, you might be able to make your own with some blended rosemary/ginkgo/aloe (but I have not tried)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best exfoliator I have ever used!  </li>

            <li> have to admit, it makes a seriously great demo watching it happen, so compelling it makes it a best-selling product.</li>
            <li> it is by far the best product when it comes to exfoliation.</li>
            <li> The Hankook product is much more effective for my skin and with just using it a couple of times per week.  </li>
            <li> Both gentler and more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

            <li> great gentle exfoliator and the bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Keeps face bright and other products working at their best.</li>
            <li> its too good to be true</li>
            <li> not bad, but not so good as i was told.</li>
            <li> Too good to be true</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product, innovative formula and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This works, but it is waterier than it should be, and you have to be very accurate with the timing and the amount of friction used.</li>
            <li> very important thing is that it does not contain parabens and alcohol.</li>
            <li> This is really great thing!I love it very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave your skin feeling very smooth, and feels like it has silicone in it.</li>
            <li> The result will be very smooth skin.</li>
            <li> as a week, my skin is brighter and very smooth; and my pores are tighter.</li>
            <li> I have very fair, very sensitive skin and this product used sparingly works wonders.</li>
            <li> Face is very smooth, appears brighter.</li>
            <li> Yeah, your skin will feel very smooth after.  </li>
            <li> It is very important to follow the instructions!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have acne-prone skin, so it&#x27;s very important that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to rubbing your own skin off :D</li>
            <li> I tried the mildedst ones but none of them worked just as easily and effectively as Aqua Cure Gel.</li>
            <li> feels very smooth with a brighter and more even tone.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the smoother and clean feeling</li>
            <li> I am a 51 year old woman with combination skin and a very fair complexion.  </li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I can see why it was a huge hit in Japan!</li>
            <li> OMG, Love this product.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t appealing at all.</li>
            <li> They are ok.</li>

            <li> I love this gel.  </li>
            <li> They love it also.  </li>
            <li> Cure Gel, how do I love thee, let me count the ways...</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Parabens is a type of preservative (which is found in many skin care products)</li>
            <li> * The picture is of the Cure bottle and another one of my favorite products, Bior&amp;eacute;</li>
            <li> UV protection $11. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Guys, I am in love.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than home acid peels for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I believe you will love it.</li>
            <li> Safe.</li>

            <li> and I think I purchased this at the perfect time, allowing me to take extra care of my skin as I age.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t express how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go more than 2 days without using it.</li>
            <li> make sure to never run out.</li>
            <li> , I would be in smooth &amp; silky heaven!</li>
            <li> I really love how it doesn&#x27;t foam or soap up..</li>
            <li> I love the gel like feel.. then..</li>
            <li> This is one product that I will continue to purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> This is more watery than some liquid cleansers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it works on any skin type too.</li>
            <li> This products are well known to many beauty guru on Youtube, and it was the reason why I decided to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and will for sure buy again :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Its an OK cleanser (or</li>
            <li> most affects me--around my nostrils, and under my chin.    </li>
            <li> If you decide to apply this 2-3 times in a row, you may exfoliate all your epidermis, and you better cover up with an SPF lotion.    </li>
            <li> I am sure about this bc</li>
            <li> I thought for sure nothing would come off my face.  </li>
            <li> My foundation settles better on my skin and my skin seems a bit glowy if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> Ever since then I use it twice a week, along with Egyptian Magic to moisturize.</li>
            <li> The love it too.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> you could find much better exfoliator in Sephora.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s where I need exfoliation the most.  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s &amp;#34;balling&amp;#34; and I can say for sure, that&#x27;s incorrect.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> If you watch the video, the person talking says that it&#x27;s okay to apply the product twice, in a way</li>
            <li> From a cleansing point of view, it is just ok.  </li>
            <li> I also felt like my skin broke out more after using it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I</li>
            <li> my cure was wrapped safely in a bubble wrap too.  </li>
            <li> The Cure Aqua Gel is okay.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love that it is from Japan.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, exfoliates, better than anything else</li>
            <li> and I know many factors could have influenced the answers</li>
            <li> A cleanser- use any of your preference, i haven&#x27;t found a favorite yet.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> This is only my opinion and my craziness :D</li>
            <li> I love Asian skin care products; they are the best!  </li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> The skin is noticeably lighter, softer, and more healthy/alive looking after the product is used, which basically means that you are *</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Okay..</li>
            <li> Would not recommend, more watery than anything.  </li>
            <li> Like it, don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this !</li>
            <li> Light but effective exfoliate product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks flawless, oil free, soft, and glowing without any shine when I use this product.</li>
            <li> BEST FACIAL PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for any type of skin, because it&#x27;s made up of mostly hydrogen water.</li>
            <li> I love it, after using, my skin feel like baby skin.</li>
            <li> love this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so satisfying seeing all the gunk that comes off your skin.</li>
            <li> A great exfoliant that is gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not supposed to do it more than twice a week (which, even that seems like a lot for chemical peels).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the beads are skin cells or not, but I do know that while I was using it, I noticed no change in my skin except more redness, more dryness, and more tenderness.</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth!</li>
            <li> However, make sure to wash it off at night, because it can clog pores leading to breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re more than three times the price.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night after I get out of the shower and in the morning my skin looks so healthy and glowy.</li>
            <li> it was like magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more and more</li>
            <li> Feel my skin texture is much more smoother than before.</li>
            <li> (I know - cute),</li>
            <li> that sure if it worked, but as I&#x27;ve been using it (for around 3 months now), I&#x27;ve tried it many times when my skin has been peeling</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been able to witness the effects well.</li>
            <li> Okay I have a clarsonic</li>
            <li> This product has shone me the light!</li>
            <li> Serums work better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and she just fell in love it</li>
            <li> So its ok.</li>
            <li> I even considered applying to be a US distributor myself, just so I could be sure to get it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wish I did more research before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> and there was a top layer of skin that did not want to shed.</li>
            <li> Has completly changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li> ,you can use it everyday,it is safe to you</li>
            <li> It is more a want than need.</li>
            <li> The best I can say is, it hasn&#x27;t done any actual harm to my skin.</li>
            <li> My make-up sits better, and my skin tone is more ever.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> so i think its more of a heat thing, I&#x27;m not too sure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Magical.</li>
            <li> I wish this would have been available to me 40 years ago!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product..</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item after many months of research and reading many reviews.</li>
            <li> Looks like this will be a staple product for me! :)</li>
            <li> When I tried this I immediately fell in love</li>
            <li> like I said I love this I do reccomend it</li>
            <li> It goes without saying that foundation goes on better, too.</li>
            <li> That said, by the time I set with powder, I still notice some dryness about 50-60% of the time--but it&#x27;s MUCH better than without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some more googling went on</li>
            <li> I do use this way more</li>
            <li> I use jasmine water Bb cream for foundation and my skin looks better now</li>
            <li> my friend was visiting me and she love it.</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite exfoliant ever.</li>
            <li> , I ordered two more.</li>
            <li> I like it,I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it every now again, until I can find something better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I gambled and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a much better deal for your money</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be sure you get the translated directions and make sure you know how to use</li>
            <li> but this gel is much more diluted.</li>
            <li> I think it helps masks and moisturizers to better penetrate my skin.</li>
            <li> i love this product work like wonders</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> For me, I find that after using Cure, I like to use my favorite mask, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The sulfur mask is nice and light and after using it your skin feels tighter and clearer.</li>
            <li> how many times I put it on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, maybe if it were able to get everything off in 1</li>
            <li> have ordered two more bottles</li>
            <li> my face feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> Overall, i&#x27;m very impressed and will purchase again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This is ok.</li>
            <li> Love this exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> I can use it more than the suggested 2 to 3 times a week; I&#x27;ve used it every day but then breaking from using it for a day or two depending on the dryness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I also love to use this on my elbows and feet.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and seems to retain moisture better as a result.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Even after using my favorite cleanser, I could see bits of makeup stained skin pilling up with the gel balls.  </li>
            <li> Maybe max 2x for more oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is now my can&#x27;t-live-without-it favorite product.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t work with your skin, then maybe pass it on to a friend who might be able to benefit from its magic.</li>
            <li> But after going through 5 sample packets, my skin was significantly better.</li>
            <li> And when I put lotion on after it worked way better than it ever had before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get nearly as many zits or bumps.</li>
            <li> and you should be able to find some.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this.  </li>
            <li> I would love it more if it was slightly more like a gel</li>
            <li> Cleaner than my Clarisonic and more exfoliated than when I use microdermabrasion crystals in my face wash.</li>
            <li> I would not reccommend using it more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> start rubbing it onto your face and watch the magic work.</li>
            <li> Love Amazon...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure many are going to disagree with me.</li>
            <li> I love it for the backs of my legs and arms too.</li>
            <li> Suspicion confirmed - I&#x27;ve been tricked!</li>
            <li> I trust the many reviews that have proven that it works.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and follow with a moisturizing mask and find that my face lotions sink in much better after using this then when I used a grittier exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> so I forgot :)</li>
            <li> does cost more than most exfoliators, but I have noticed it has lasted longer than any of them that I have used.</li>
            <li> I have gotten many friends to switch over to this.</li>
            <li> and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li> I have the confidence to go makeup free any day now!</li>
            <li> In LOVE with this product... item came faster than i excepted</li>
            <li> Love it, I used to pay 60 USD for a trial sized equivalent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> awww nice skin after using.</li>
            <li> I think I have more breakouts now</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the packaging was great.</li>
            <li> this is the best facial product I have ever got.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most off-putting part of this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the result.</li>
            <li> I love it does not have fragrance.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Is &#x27;considered&#x27; safe for use in hair rinse-off products and for use at concentrations of up to 0.25% in leave-on hair products.</li>
            <li> Dermal exposure is &#x27;considered&#x27; safe up to 2%.&lt;br /&gt;-Aloe</li>
            <li> : We all know this one :-)&lt;br /&gt;-Gingko</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right after using this I have noticed that my skin is brighter, plumper, more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Besides that it does all that it promises :)</li>
            <li> I feel like i had better results from apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of minutes I felt the top layer of the skin come off.  </li>
            <li> LIKE :-)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and better.  </li>
            <li> Now, it just looks better, and feels softer.</li>
            <li> so I was expecting greater results upon using product.</li>
            <li> I think I may prefer MyFaceshop product better</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff.  </li>
            <li> But I do wonder what it&#x27;s made of, and if it&#x27;s safe for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned for me it works better if I put it on and let it sit for about a 1/2 min before rubbing.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to read most of the reviews before purchasing this.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> More even skin color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i found this product.</li>
            <li> Give it a try and you will totally love  this.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Interesting chemistry.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> My favorite exfoliator</li>
            <li> Just a heads up :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK in my book.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel nice and smooth after I use it</li>
            <li> but my skin also feels nice and smooth after I use an apricot scrub or an exfoliating face towel.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> The Cure (which is a bit over the top in the name) is really an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking visibly better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no equivalent product in the US, and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries this.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m okay with that trade off.</li>
            <li> Probably will not buy another one :)</li>
            <li> and it felt like healthy baby</li>
            <li> I squeeze a bit more gel on my hands and continue, thinking maybe the gel is coagulating or something.</li>
            <li> I put on some lotion and stared at the bottle of hoodoo magic for a bit before setting it on the counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product but</li>
            <li> LOVE lOVE</li>
            <li> on OpenSky (Molly Sims endorsed it there), ordered their product and found it worked better and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I often find that when in search of an exfoliant for my face, I tend to think that the more abrasive the product, the better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more affordable )around $15.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> There is no nasty drying or stinging</li>
            <li> Skin79&#x27;s gel is more gel-like and thicker, which I think is easier in the application.</li>
            <li> Works just as most of these reviews say, and I can tell a difference in the texture of my skin immediately after cleansing.</li>
            <li> and I feel safe.</li>
            <li> The Korean water peels are a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love the glow and feel of my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li> Now that my skin is looking and feeling better</li>
            <li> Its the perfect fit for overly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I love love love this product I use after cleansing almost every day  </li>
            <li> my lotions and potions all sink in much better</li>
            <li> Exfoliates better than any scrub or even my clarisonic .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a watery consistency</li>
            <li> I found most at-home</li>
            <li> so my skin sheds a bit more</li>
            <li> My skin truly has never looked better than it does now.</li>
            <li> make sure you use sunscreen with this product.</li>
            <li> just so I can be sure I won&#x27;t run out of it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and this item will be an ongoing part of my skin care for many years to come.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> so I cannot use most exfoliating products as they cause my skin to become irritated.</li>
            <li> He is pleased with the results also.  </li>
            <li> I use every day, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Like most of my favorite products I stumbled across this accidentally one day when looking for an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll buy it from you :)</li>
            <li> and I always my skin has gone softer and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Just like water:)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I try to use this twice a week at the most.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It works and satisfyingly so.</li>
            <li> This does a great job, it is not harsh on my face and leaves it looking smooth and bright.</li>
            <li> I say most because even if I go over my skin 3 times with this product, I&#x27;ll sometimes still see flakes around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the feeling of rubbing it on my face and seeing the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34;  come off.  </li>
            <li> I did some research when it was time to get more</li>
            <li> This formula is a bit more watery than you would expect a gel to be.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling refreshing.</li>
            <li> This was just okay for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just okay to me....</li>
            <li> That was OK, sorta.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li> If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I think the problem is that I keep my skin very well exfoliated and fresh with the Holika Holika Egg Soap, Perfect Whip, a pore scrubber, and Wonder Pore Freshner.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m baffled how this brand has</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use more.</li>
            <li> I have literally become a spokesperson for this product because I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> top layer)</li>
            <li> I love Cure.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use the Clarisonic brush for cleansing my face, plus a toner with salicylic acid, so my exfoliation needs are not that many.</li>
            <li> Any moisturizer I put on after that made it hurt even more.</li>
            <li> Japanese products are great!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> It looks more even.</li>
            <li> Love this!❤️</li>
            <li> and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser/exfoliater.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> My complexion always looks better after I exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I feel moisturizers and vitamin C penetrates better with use of product.  </li>
            <li> But the thing is, I love exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> And I tried it on a surface to make sure it doesn&#x27;t just automatically clump up</li>
            <li> I also watched a couple of videos on Youtube to make sure I understood how to use it.  </li>
            <li> My make up goes on better.</li>
            <li> Most of those people didn&#x27;t use it correctly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like rubbing plastic drops on your skin...</li>
            <li> it is not your skin cells for sure.</li>
            <li> Continue with the rest of your skincare routine (cleanser, toner, repairing lotion, treatment, moisturizer, etc.)and keep in mind that if you use a micro-exfoliating cleanser like Proactiv, that you should use is as a more of a 1 minute wash off mask</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial products I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li> Your face will be silky smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li> and makeup go on and look much better.</li>
            <li> There are so many great videos on YouTube showing how to use it, but you really don&#x27;t even need to watch one.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean, my pores diminished and my complexion looks more even after using this product.</li>
            <li> This product has a very unique way of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I originally said this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> i was very excited to purchase this producti.</li>
            <li> I am surprised how good it is!</li>
            <li> My face is so nice and clean after using CURE.  </li>
            <li> My biggest worry was if the bottle would break during its travel and the packaging was good and safe and fast too!</li>
            <li> It was a good exfoliator as it gets the job done very very well, but in terms of softening my skin, it didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Mild, effective and harmless, what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> Japan really has some amazing products !</li>
            <li> Great Japanese beauty cult favorite!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect at first that this would be really good</li>
            <li> I rinse with warm water, then cool water and pat</li>
            <li> it is a reaalllly good gentle exfoliator!</li>
            <li> works pretty good.</li>
            <li> then got my 10 yr old niece to try it (who still has that beautiful baby type skin)</li>
            <li> My Daughter has some skin issues and CURE has cleared her up pretty good.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m noticing some pretty good results.</li>
            <li> This was a knock off rip off of the original!</li>
            <li> and i was so excited!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best applied to dry skin after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> so I was glad to find this one easily on amazon.</li>
            <li> then I was even more ecstatic that it is sold on Amazon &#x3D; Easy acess.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s colorless and scentless, and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a strong moisturizer (I use a moisturizing face mask) after using this.</li>
            <li> It works best after a shower or bath and when skin is completely dry.  </li>
            <li> but I really liked how quickly it worked.  </li>
            <li> I love it and strongly recommend it~</li>
            <li> But to my dismay, this awesome skin care line is now opting for cheaper ingredients, not to mention dry patches and oily clogged pores</li>
            <li> Works best with a dry face and hands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but admire my own new skin &amp; my confidence has skyrocketed!!!!  </li>
            <li> This is literally the single best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I always feel 100% clean when I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> But it does make me feel clean!</li>
            <li> Im sure alot of people will disagree with me and thats fine.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> It rinses clean!</li>
            <li> Rinse with warm water until your face feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> This is very cool.  </li>
            <li> It is a very cool product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like this replaces that, but it makes it more effective because your skin is super clean and prepped for anything.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t know that my skin could ever feel that soft and great.</li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;ve said before, I have sensitive skin and it works great.</li>
            <li> best of all, it leaves my skin super clean and soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best $26 I spent for my skin.</li>
            <li> The store has a tester available and I put a pump on my forearm, massage it into my skin and so many greyish residue come out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great exfoliator, and my skin feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li> Many primers also use silicone because it does give a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> great product leaves the skin so soft  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking healthy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid anti-aging prevention ranger for my own skin for many years now.  </li>
            <li> Japan sure do know their skincare, What I like most is that there are no harsh beads or granulate particles in most exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I mention this because others seem to have gotten tampered bottles filled with rubbing alcohol and that is not the authentic product.</li>
            <li> I can see how my makeup will go on so much more smoothly.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth, and even looks better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made in the US, their ingredients are clearly printed on the label, and their customer service is great.  </li>
            <li> My BB cream glides on my face more smoothly.</li>
            <li> 4 stars...pretty good, but want to know if it&#x27;s really doing what it appears to be doing.</li>
            <li> I do weekly Lactic peels but wanted to make sure that in between I was getting in a gentle exfoliation to make the peel more effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wondered for years why there wasn&#x27;t something like this that could just kind of dissolve the outer layer of skin to leave the fresh underlayer.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have to use it very often to get good results (I use it once every 2-3 weeks).</li>
            <li> but this gentle solution seems to do a good job at exfoliating skin.</li>
            <li> Since it is so mild, I just need to use more every time and more often, like twice a week.</li>
            <li> little miracle; bet exfoliator ever, I use it on my face and body, works like a charm, my skin is beautiful and soft, scalling is gone, I love it !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very effective and also clear my keratosis pilaris on my arm</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sensitive and you just rinse the debris off with warm water and you&#x27;re done!</li>
            <li> Very light weight, gentle gel, was immediately effective in exfoliating my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> After washing the product off, my face felt soft and beautiful and clean.</li>
            <li> Cool product!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this!</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers I would say that this is one of the awesome product you should use for exfoliating for your face.</li>
            <li> Those Asians have some of the coolest and most unique makeup and skincare products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so excited about this exfoliator after trying it out...and have been using it on all my friends :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cool!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to use this MAXIMUM once a week, or once every other week if you use a micro-exfoliating cleanser like Proactiv.</li>
            <li> is one of those products that is actually \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> It has a simple formula also that is free of fragrance which is very good for the skin.</li>
            <li> for best results I found every other day works best (at least for my skin)combined with a nice mask afterwrds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not the prettiest, most charming girl in the world, I&#x27;m just THAT much more confident now because of my baby soft, super smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> That easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it seemed like they&#x27;d be easy to extract at that point.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> But more amazingly, after about a week of use, it has gently removed about 30% of a discoloration caused by a popped pimple.  </li>
            <li> Very mild and no scent.</li>
            <li> The product is great, shipping was a day early which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> but oils are good too if you want a more natural way)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is by far the best exfoliation product around, gentle and effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Product was easy to wash off</li>
            <li> After using this product my face looks more clean and polished.</li>
            <li> I had received Cure as a Christmas present and I was literally filled with Christmas \\&quot;glee;\\&quot; after hearing so many good things about it from beauty gurus such as Bubzbeauty I was about to begin a wonderful exfoliating journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A clean and dry face is recommended for best results before using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to notice this because there will be areas that feel raised as you scrub this product on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;ve never used a chemical exfoliant, go easy my friend.</li>
            <li> but the product was easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li> My skin is now glowing and are so easy to unslough with fingers alone.</li>
            <li> Liquid is easy to apply and massage into skin.</li>
            <li> I read some of the good reviews of this gel and order one, however it doesn&#x27;t work as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> but she said the gel was a bit too strong for her skin.</li>
            <li> I Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt or burn at all, but I still strongly considered consulting a doctor because of the amount of skin that came off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most gentle and effective exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> This make your skin smooth, soft, clean and so touchable and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I am very light skinned, with mild sensitivity to &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> Usually other sites sell these for $40 or more!!!</li>
            <li> I just finished my first two weeks using Cure, and it is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It may be because they have access to some pretty amazing (and often inexpensive) skincare technology.  </li>
            <li> This product, cure natural aqua gel, is amazing!</li>
            <li> just wish it was as effective as the first application.</li>
            <li> This product is suppose to last 3 months so think of it as putting $20 a month for beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Nice and gentle exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Have you ever noticed that Japanese and Korean women have remarkably beautiful skin?</li>
            <li> Skin is nice and soft after it, you can see for sure top layer of the skin is gone</li>
            <li> Face skin feels so clean and smooth after use it. :-)</li>
            <li> But my skin feels nice, clean , and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> Great products, have been using it weeks now (twice a week), feel great, and it really works as lot other customers said.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have had a 100% improvement in my breakouts and fine line reduction since I began using this about 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> Along the jaw line you might need to \\&quot;pluck\\&quot; off some debris from the fine hairs.    </li>
            <li> Best part, it costs way, way, less.  </li>
            <li> Best part, it costs way, way, less.  </li>
            <li> so I figure its fine.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product before, and when I ran out and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to repurchase, even though it was the best exfoliator I ever used.</li>
            <li> Works best on slight damp skin.</li>
            <li> I used about three pumps on my face with each go around and rubbed in light circles until the balls stopped forming easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what is in this product, but I&#x27;ve tried many exfoliators and this one is definitely on my top 10.</li>
            <li> , I use Retin-A on my forehead to keep fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li> is just fine.</li>
            <li> so it was fine.</li>
            <li> The first use was great and seemed promising.</li>
            <li> Package came in quick and neatly bubble wrapped which came with samples!</li>
            <li> good, very natural peeling</li>
            <li> I guess this is good for those with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Probably better used as a gentle exfoliater for those who have pretty good skin</li>
            <li> This is so easy and gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> Good product; didn&#x27;t irritate my skin; my skin felt very soft and smooth after I used it.  </li>
            <li> After my first try, my skin felt very clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> and it is far more better than my expectation!</li>
            <li> Using it again right away exfoliated away my new, happy skin and it hurt.</li>
            <li> I called and they were super nice and sent me the bag right away.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I was a little suspicious, that&#x27;s just my nature, but this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my baby smooth skin after the very first time using this!</li>
            <li> It feels nice to gently massage after a weekend in the sun or a night wearing makeup to leave a smooth surface, but it won&#x27;t fix every problem.  </li>
            <li> the price is accurate as it is also around 30 bucks in Japan</li>
            <li> It really does exfoliate well and leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> So I guess that&#x27;s important to consider--</li>
            <li> Fantastic exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I heard about Cure and decided to order sample packs (you can get free samples from Beauty Carousel or buy them on eBay)</li>
            <li> and i got it scratch free.  </li>
            <li> so it leaves my face smooth</li>
            <li> This exfoliating gel starts working almost as soon as I apply it, and makes my skin feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am waxing for free.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling smooth and glowy.</li>
            <li> No redness after, Just smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> This will make a great present also for anyone that is acne prone.</li>
            <li> I like how smooth it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> My face wasn&#x27;t remarkably smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have used many facial exfoliators in my day and this is by FAR the best.</li>
            <li> (I think) it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> baby-soft, smooth skin with no drying or irritation.</li>
            <li> worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> it definitely is a gentle yet effective exfoliator.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve really noticed an improvment with my skincare routine and people have commented how nice my skin is looking.  </li>
            <li> most deffinatly worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Afterusing it, my skin was smooth, but also dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had used a light chemical peel to remove the skin and that did not work.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin so smooth and silky</li>
            <li> /&gt;we think it&#x27;s a fantastic product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I use a sugar scrub/mask once a week as well, but my akin never feels as smooth as when I use this.</li>
            <li> your toner/moisturizer is also absorbed better on account of using it.</li>
            <li> smooth cause</li>
            <li> Whatever the case is, the end result is skin as smooth as baby&#x27;s butt...</li>
            <li> Face feels smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> Lightly apply to the face and let it sit for a minute, then massage the area.</li>
            <li> Im glad some ppeople have had success with it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s peeling the dead surface of your skin and give you a very bright skin surface!</li>
            <li> TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment -</li>
            <li> so makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> my face felt so smooth...</li>
            <li> but it does get some off because after I wash my face, it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and am very happy with the procedure.  </li>

            <li> My skin has never felt this smooth.</li>
            <li> After you wash off your face you will be able to both feel the tightness of your freshly exfoliated face and see that your skin has gotten whiter/brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What it does do though is leave my skin smooth and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to use:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great quick way to exfoliate without scrubbing and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> :) And to those people who say it&#x27;s just the product balling up, not your skin, lol you&#x27;re wrong :P</li>

            <li> It has truely lives up to its claim and is both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> This is a gentle exfoliant (which makes more sense for facial skin) with a nice touch of moisturizer that feels so nice after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am always trying new products and this is now at the top of my favorite list.  </li>
            <li> minutes made my face feel very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that does best when it is left alone.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any significant changes on my face....</li>
            <li> On the bottle, it says to use it twice a week, but since it&#x27;s so gentle, I&#x27;m able to use it almost everyday with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this product.</li>
            <li> It was the same kind of stinging I get from applying a 15% TCA peel!  </li>
            <li> #1:  This stuff is for real, most definitely.  </li>
            <li> I need to modify my original review.</li>
            <li> love this product so much!</li>
            <li> but this is awesome, It really does get rid of excess skin leaving soft and ready for lotion/mask skin</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t look like the face I had started with, it was significantly brighter.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> What a bargain for such an effective product!</li>
            <li> It is worth every dime!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt that Japanese often come out with the most magical skin care products!</li>
            <li> Simple to use, effective, and does what it claims!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my face and it worked</li>
            <li> excellent exfoliator of dead skin!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Having clear skin is very important to me and this is a life saver!</li>
            <li> You must have!Very useful!</li>
            <li> So excited about this product, I&#x27;m gifting it out to my friends.  </li>
            <li> When I received this item I was extremely excited and used it immediately.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all it smells like alcohol and when you start to rub your skin it burns</li>
            <li> :) This product has really worked miracles for my skin!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it out that I immediately opened it and rubbed two or three pumps onto my face.</li>
            <li> In general, I have found the skin care products made in Korea to be superior to those made elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> This is where I first bought the Hankook product and then order more from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this exfoliator for my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m excited that this product is in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> This product is truly worth the price!</li>
            <li> Originally found this at trade show.</li>
            <li> but well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Love it work very well for exfoliating!</li>
            <li> This is the most gentle exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> With the first use you will notice a fresher, cleaner, more even complexion.</li>
            <li> Love it from the first use</li>
            <li> Overall, this is best exfoliate product so far!</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in 15-20 days of use yet.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth checking out!</li>
            <li> Very good exfoliator,  leaves  skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> Excellent amazing removes all the dead skin like no other product!</li>
            <li> Get all of the skin around the face and rinse off cleanly.</li>
            <li> My face is clean after..</li>
            <li> Finally, after a week of use, I&#x27;ve also discovered that my Ponds pore strips are much more effective now on my pores.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for sloughing off dead skin and giving the face a fresh clean look.</li>
            <li> It did make my skin feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 months and its by far the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used, beating out my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> After I use this on my face, it feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Clean smelling.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean or remove dirt.</li>
            <li> All my skin care products feel more effective, my skin simply RADIATES with sunshine from within.  </li>
            <li> Saying what I have the really big question is do I want to spend that kind of money on a product that I can&#x27;t be sure if it works?</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after I&#x27;m done using it.</li>
            <li> I give a four cause my face still need to feel clean</li>
            <li> Start with a washed clean face and put the product on your face avoiding your eye</li>
            <li> yeah my face is clean and then the so called balls form once the product is rubbed for a min.</li>
            <li> Rub this gel on a clean surface, I used a glass.</li>
            <li> Loved the product, light exfoliator,nice for daily use.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think it will help clean my face.</li>
            <li> squeaky clean after.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face feels clean but not overstripped.</li>
            <li> this is great for people who have dry skin or like me</li>
            <li> After rinsing, your face is soooo smooth and feels fresh and light.</li>
            <li> Cure is Magic in a bottle, best kept secret in Japan.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial wash product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Your face will feel super smooth and clean just after one use.</li>
            <li> I put it on my face twice a week, though your face feels clean</li>
            <li> My skin felt &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; but without any physical or chemical irritation and that it enabled the softening water and moisturizer that I use to penetrate more effectively afterward.  </li>
            <li> ,, it leave your face fealing so clean</li>
            <li> It lit your skin shine and clean</li>
            <li> Works great for exfoliating my face, gets the rough peely skin off and makes my face smooth</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling clean and supple.</li>
            <li> it does make my face feel clean.</li>
            <li> I believe with continuos use I&#x27;ll be pimple and acne scar free very soon :).</li>
            <li> Now my face is clean.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job making your skin feel soft and smooth but no miracle.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize as it contains a dose of glycerin and is good for sensitive skin mainly because it&#x27;s mostly water and unscented, but it smells a bit like chlorine to me.</li>
            <li> After I read many positive reviews, I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is the FIRST exfoliator that is the most gentle, non-irritated product yet exfoliates the most off my face.  </li>
            <li> I have to say how surprised I am to read that there is anyone out there who isn&#x27;t completely in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Its a bit messy, so best to use right before showering.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it could be easily found out online, but it would be much more convenient to have it on the actual bottle.</li>
            <li> gel would probably best fit sensitive or minimally dry skin.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because after I do a good job exfoliating other skin care product and hydrating masks can be absorb more easily&lt;br</li>
            <li> At any rate, I was so impressed that I decided to exfoliate a second time, and this time when I rinsed, it was like i rinsed off my old face and revealed a NEW one!!!!</li>
            <li> It certainly feels as if my face has been exfoliated better than ever, and it also feels gentler than any exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> If you are doubting getting this than stop right there!</li>
            <li> This was right after I had scrubbed my face with a blackhead scrub (baking soda and orange juice)!</li>
            <li> Forever customer right here!</li>
            <li> One great thing about it is that it allows other products like serums or moisturizers to be absorbed more effectively, so it really is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I take very good care of my skin and exfoliate, yet this still found  dead skin... after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> When the bottle arrived I was super excited as I&#x27;ve wanted this for sometime.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this seller, my product was intact when i received it, it was carefully bubble wrapped</li>
            <li> I used to have to be very creative with concealer in order to hide it, now my light foundation is enough.  </li>
            <li> Cure Natural Aqua Gel is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for rough heels, elbows, and knees, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very watery and glides onto the face pretty nicely.</li>
            <li> It is strange and wonderful all at once, and my skin ends up so soft, and the hyper-pigmentation I suffer from seems to lighten each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely hooked on this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It is made up of mostly water and it works great getting all of the dead skin off of your face!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping it would be, a gentle and effective exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Not too many products really do what they say.  </li>
            <li> before I buy the full product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the product so far.  </li>
            <li> This is the most gentle exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product..</li>
            <li> .. cause everything it claims its absolutely true..</li>
            <li> surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t have any blue bead.</li>
            <li> Overall, good buy</li>
            <li> and I love the gentle exfoliating on my can-be-problematic skin.</li>
            <li> I am able to use this exfoliator once every 2 days; that&#x27;s how gentle and nonabrasive</li>
            <li> I believe the maker of the product developed something that does some kind of chemical change producing gobs of something that the masses think is exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> it is wise to use this on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, always see a difference, and people comment on my skin more.</li>
            <li> BUT  everyone loves it and wants more,.</li>
            <li> Good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I began using it as a full body exfoliator just to use it up</li>
            <li> If you buy it with one of the nylon towels, you can exfoliate and then hop in the shower for a full rinse.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a pump that is a good size for extensive use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this is true.</li>
            <li> just knowing it works is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I was drying out my face too much, which was in turn also probably causing more of that flakiness, which I think would trap dirt and oil under my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in the benefits of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It may be the holy grail for many people, but this item just doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this product</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m good for the next three years unless I give them away.</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much.</li>
            <li> so the price was a heck of a lot more reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is the most gentle exfoliator one can buy.</li>
            <li> WHERE near as effective.  </li>
            <li> I think that is true.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this exfoliator. 1.</li>
            <li> my skin is left smooth, even and better able to absorb my skin care products.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it twice a day, but that&#x27;s because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t much to exfoliate off once you&#x27;ve started to maintain your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product earlier this year after hearing good reviews.</li>
            <li> After looking up the ingredients online, I realized this was true - alcohol mixes with plasticizers and balls up on your skin.</li>
            <li> Used about once a month on those areas it keeps those areas nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is way more gentle than using the exfoliates that have the beads in them.  </li>
            <li> So cool and unclogs all dirt out of my skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels super clean, cleaner than using my apricot scrub</li>
            <li> Better products for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Its 90% water which is really cool, and</li>
            <li> It is much more gentle than particle ones and still works well.</li>
            <li> my favorite gentle exfoliant.</li>
            <li> This is a really GENTLE product unlike most.</li>
            <li> product is a FANTASY COME TRUE for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Decide to see if all the hype was true on this product.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I will continue to use this as a way to gently get all the flakies away :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s akin to using a pencil eraser on your face but much more gentle.</li>
            <li> Back to the superior product.</li>
            <li> Speaking off of that this product will last you a good while</li>
            <li> PTR has the similar product works good but pricy.</li>
            <li> This is such a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda smells like a gasoline type smell but not bad at all.</li>
            <li> exfoliation itself was not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation process is super easy and pretty clean:</li>
            <li> but again, nothing special, for an extraordinary price.</li>
            <li> It does not include perfumes or colors or most of any strong chemicals for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive, but it reacts nicely to this brand.</li>
            <li> because of the super fast free shipping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m on the hunt again for my tried and super true exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m on the hunt again for my tried and super true exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> It does everything it&#x27;s said to do and has made a real positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it cause it works well with all the types of skin specially that I have a very sensitive one and till now it works as it described!</li>
            <li> When my face is very clean and pre washed it doesn&#x27;t gel up as much.</li>
            <li> Works great for minimizing pore size, but needed to use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very fair skinned blonde with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After reading good reviews and because my skin tends to like Japanese product better since I used to live there, I decided to try Cure.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feels so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> My face felt so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is the best beauty product I have ever bought for myself.</li>
            <li> Got here quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t observed any extraordinary exfoliation results.  </li>
            <li> In route, I&#x27;ve researched, invested, and tried many, many products from drug stores to $$$ stores and also from different countries.  </li>
            <li> current exfoliater is a bit more grainy than needed, served me better in the summer.  </li>
            <li> :) I will definitely be purchasing more before I run out.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency toward adult acne, joy, and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mild chemical peel in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Using this 2-3 times a week helps to keep my skin looking much more smooth, soft, and radiant than ever before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say much because this product already has a following, but this things is great.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasted almost 3 years, so the value is tremendous.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a gentle, but effective exfoliator-</li>
            <li> But luckily i found a comparable product from natures republic.</li>
            <li> super soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my t zone is super oily and</li>
            <li> my skin has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li> Luckily it was given to me as a trial gift.</li>
            <li> Doesnt do anyting, Super overpriced</li>
            <li> Pretty happy that I have an in-home solution for a problem that has plagued me for a long time.</li>
            <li> ; Most recently I use Acnefree (better than proactiv)</li>
            <li> It takes me awhile for the stuff to works on me though maybe because my skin is super clogged or something I don&#x27;t know because I almost never exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Lotion seems to absorb so much better now, and my make up actually applies on so smooth now!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s skin that everyone keeps claiming I think it turns into a mild exfoliant  ...</li>
            <li> Ten outta ten best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and smooth my skin feels afterwards.  </li>
            <li> sent the item quickly as well.  </li>
            <li> Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> read another reviewer&#x27;s tips, and she&#x27;s right about how the product works better if you gently massage it into your skin in circular motions.</li>
            <li> As soon as you start rubbing this gel on your face it turns into an extremely soft exfoliator -- very unique and extremely effective; it left my face feeling smooth and fresh!  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product - gently exfoliates, not much product needed per use, easy on sensitive</li>
            <li> This is very gentle and can be use everyday after a good makeup off to making sure everything is clean under pores</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; in the dark (LOL)</li>
            <li> From the first use I have had glowing smooth skin</li>
            <li> The product description states that using the product will make your other skin care products more effective.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference from the very first application</li>
            <li> This is an okay product and you must make sure your face is clean and dry before you apply</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too which makes it a good value.</li>
            <li> it perfect new condition in less than 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can see my skin is more clear and clean</li>
            <li> My absolute new favorite beauty product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had laser done on my breasts (three grand!!), which only minimized the marks by maybe 10% and the doctor recommended 3 more packages of 3 sessions (nine extra grand--no way!), so those \\&quot;tiger stripes\\</li>
            <li> and it sure seems to do a great job of exfoliating the dead top layer of skin, especially if you&#x27;re using retinol or Retin-A.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin feel so soft and smooth and CLEAN!</li>
            <li> Nice product, different from all the other, does a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for black heads.  </li>
            <li> Normally, my skin doesn&#x27;t respond all that great to standard exfoliators.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a pretty good size of this stuff for $30 and will last me for months.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased, and would highly recommend Cure!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and is very affective.</li>
            <li> While not ALL of it came off the first time I used it last night, a GOOD portion came off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make a fair judgment on the actual process without consistent biweekly uses.</li>
            <li> She loved it, she said she had a dry patch on her chin</li>
            <li> Gentle, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> First of all, what I love about this scrub is that it has watery consistency, so it&#x27;s extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> Also, my boyfriend (who used to never do much to take care of his skin because skin care products &amp;#34;don&#x27;t do anything&amp;#34;), uses this more than I do.</li>
            <li> was good on m face, didn&#x27;t over dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright not like magical but it does the job and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I feel clean after using the production.that &#x27;s very gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing gentle EXFOLIATOR that gently sloughs off that first layer of skin.</li>
            <li> it can be addicting;)!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a neat idea, but there are better products out there!</li>
            <li> but she was hesitate, after bunch of times asking, my mom finally gave it a try and immediately fell in love with CURE!</li>
            <li> A ton of skin came off of my face first try!</li>
            <li> It left my skin more radiant after I applied my moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Product does exactly what it says and anyone CAN use it!</li>
            <li> so glad it came early!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: Highly Highly Recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well!</li>
            <li> They each ordered their own bottle and bought me a new one since they used so much of mine while they visited on vacation.</li>
            <li> If this gel is available in store near you, I strongly recommend you try the tester to see if it would works for your skin.</li>
            <li> The gel immediately clings to the makeup and pulls it off with the top layer of skin, easy to see when you&#x27;ve cleaned it all because the beads run white again.</li>
            <li> have to think your other skin care products will be able to work much better now that you have truly clean skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant right now</li>
            <li> I was really excited of the fact that cure is made up with 91% of hydrogen water because at this point water was the only thing which was suitable for my skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what this does but no elbow grease needed and nothing to clean.</li>
            <li> The instructions are to clean the face first, so</li>
            <li> My face feels pretty clean after the use.</li>
            <li> I works just as advertised; very easy and gentle on skin while leaving my skin squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li> You know the kind with the dry skin in top that makeup only draws more attention to?</li>
            <li> This product is a great exfoliating and with little effort.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can feel comfortable in my own clear, radiant, soft skin!</li>
            <li> I wonder why US brands haven&#x27;t made a similar product because this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I imagine this would be great to use after a peel as well to help slough off the dead skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels super smooth, clean, and clear after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing product - I&#x27;m a big fan now.  </li>
            <li> After I finish washing my face, it feels incredibly smooth and much like baby skin.</li>
            <li> Simple amazing.</li>
            <li> This is by far much kinder to the skin and has amazing results.</li>
            <li> Gosh where do I begin, this is such an amazing product</li>
            <li> Received fast and secure, thank you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why so many people say that this product is amazing, SO DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I use a Clairsonic a few times a week, which works great, but I&#x27;m always looking for products to help exfoliate my skin since my pores are always getting clogged.</li>
            <li> He even uses moisturizer now, because he wants to keep his skin as smooth as it is after he uses this gel.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason japanese women and men are known for their amazing skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and I will stock up before I move back to the states (because it is cheaper in Japan than on</li>
            <li> and I was breaking out way more than a 30 year old should.</li>
            <li> best kept beauty secret.</li>
            <li> I write for a living and consequently rarely write product reviews.</li>
            <li> I tend to only let myself read the &amp;#34;good reviews&amp;#34; and thought I&#x27;d give this a try after reading so many good reviews, however I have used this many times and I&#x27;m now convinced that it does nothing but roll up into blobs of gook, (which is what everyone else thinks is their dead skin rolling off).  </li>
            <li> The main problem with my skin is that my skin turnover is very quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- leaves skin feeling and smelling fresh</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective exfoliator that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is worth buying it though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fun to use.  </li>
            <li> My face tone has is more even and my skin insanely soft.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER seen such an effective product in my life.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s over priced and just isn&#x27;t worth your time if you&#x27;re just looking for an exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> If you’re looking for a fun toy to play with your skin?</li>
            <li> Well then you decided if it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is an inexpensive purchase for the amount and its effectively.</li>
            <li> I have the kind of skin that burns, stings, gets bumpy, and turns beet red when I use just about anything on it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Toner get to absorbed faster</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m sure those who moderate how much they use could geteven more out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, fun product</li>
            <li> When I used it, I was stunned, utterly stunned at how effective it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I maybe end up using this once a week or so, so definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> I also use face masks to cleanse my skin and this product works really the same as ANY good quality face washing product.</li>
            <li> would be useful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled about the result of this facial wash!</li>
            <li> I have the most frustratingly sensitive,</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so fresh after cleaning and the dirt is all out .</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> and my skin feels so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but for me it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a week now and my skin has never looked and felt so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It works magic on my mid-forties skin, making it dewy and soft.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> real results, real woman, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I think it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I also use my cleanser to be sure I get the gel completely off, and follow up with toner and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when you notice the difference because your skin will have absorbed your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much it has helped clear my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, so once a week is ok</li>
            <li> This exfoliator works fairly well on facial skin; does absolutely nothing for hands, cuticles, etc.  </li>
            <li> I love that it isn&#x27;t a scrub because I feel that scrubs are somewhat damaging and still don&#x27;t completely accomplish the job.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> They were kind enough to include a generous amount of samples and a hand written note thanking me for shopping with them!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 2 times but so far it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> so if I feel it is worth it I will buy it.  </li>
            <li> After that, I rinse it with warm water thoroughly and begin to put my facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> but I bought some for my daughter to try because I think it is worth the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I make sure my face is completely dried.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was TOTALLY worth it.</li>
            <li> definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Which is fun to use</li>
            <li> The price is I know a lil pricy but its worth it</li>
            <li> Skin feel refreshed and baby soft after. :)</li>
            <li> Elementary math leads me to a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> But no feeling any kind different</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every freaking penny.</li>
            <li> overall, This is s great product for sensitive and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels lovely and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for month and liquid is still near the top.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just a fun alternative exfoliant.</li>
            <li> It results in smooth skin and overall better complexion when used semi-frequently.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really worth the money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Cure Natural Aqua Gel.</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter and fresh every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I think that the price of this product is worth every penny....</li>
            <li> and it feels so fresh.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was hesitant to even purchase this, but glad I did.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and smooth after using this and it healed my acne faster than time alone plus prevented and fixed scars, which was way beyond what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> My skin feels super soft and clean!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for a quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Amazing how much dead skin this removes, very exciting to see!  </li>
            <li> but I can say that it really made my skin much smoother and cleaner!!!</li>
            <li> I can see why most people would think spending that much for some kind of magic water is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> if I overused this (around my nose and mouth, for the most part), so I recommend using it every other day at most.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an awesome gel or not, but I feel that I can get similar cleanliness with other products of my Clarisonic</li>
            <li> In its original state, the liquid is clear, non-fragrant, and smooth (so no beads or granules to aid in exfoliation).  </li>
            <li> luckily its not making her breakout but sadly not making any difference in her appearance.</li>
            <li> (Also my seller got it to me super fast, way before Amazon estimated it would come!)</li>
            <li> Let it sit on clean skin for about a minute, then rub, rub, rub and exfoliate GENTLY, revealing super soft clean skin for days!</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit concerned, because it smelled like rubbing alcohol when I applied it to my skin, but it faded quickly.</li>
            <li> Cure is actually super gentle and claims to made up of over 90% water!</li>
            <li> My face, literally, feels squeaky clean when I wash this off as well as leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but for the price my other exfoliators do a good job too.</li>
            <li> price is excellent and I&#x27;m fairly certain this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Appropriate for sensitive skin as it&#x27;s very gentle.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do so, because i don&#x27;t have the right tools, but something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did I do it right?</li>
            <li> Does leave skin baby-smooth right after use.</li>
            <li> I counted the days until arrival and tried this product right away.</li>
            <li> so your skin might get irritated .. so I would advice not to wait and work with the product right away.</li>
            <li> I were trying it out right when I got it.</li>
            <li> I watched a lot of YouTube demos to see if this was the right product for me</li>
            <li> SO this product should of had no problem removing it right??</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the money right now</li>
            <li> They were right.</li>
            <li> But when opening the bottle out of it&#x27;s plastic wrapping the pump tip cracked and fell right off.</li>
            <li> right?).</li>
            <li> it cleanse the blackheads from my nose right off.</li>
            <li> I put the gel on my right face cheek and rubbed it in.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this product a couple of days ago and when I received it I tried it out right away.</li>
            <li> If you start rubbing right after you apply it, you&#x27;ll be rubbing for a while before you get any clumps.</li>
            <li> so I always apply lotion or face mask right after.</li>
            <li> then I used Cure right after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those who buys something and want it to work right There.</li>
            <li> This is just what my skin needs right now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before attending a major special occasion (wedding, dinner, graduation party, etc...), I used to have to stop using the tretinoin cream a few days before so that my skin could be smooth and look great.</li>
            <li> Your skin has a very squeaky clean feel and almost flushed look to it (like a baby), maybe it helps with blood circulation also.</li>
            <li> No rough grains, no stretching, all gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I&#x27;m pretty sure that nothing about this product is natural.</li>
            <li> The results on my skin are wonderful and quickly noticeable after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin clean and buffed and sealed and ready for the day</li>
            <li> Just apply on clean skin and rub gently in circles on your face, body, feet.</li>
            <li> so its not super pleasant to wash your face with</li>
            <li> I really like the way this gel makes my skin feel so clean</li>
            <li> It is very mild and it make my skin very soft</li>
            <li> The Cure is hands down the best exfoliator I have found, and I have tried numerous exfoliators over the years.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, from time to time I have major acne breakouts that require medication which dries out my skin and leaves it flaky and hideous under foundation.</li>
            <li> After several uses my skin was always left bright, calm, &amp; smooth-</li>
            <li> I bought this product for exfoliation of my very sensitive skin based on reviews left by other customers, and was very happy to find that it is as great as other people have said.</li>
            <li> And of course alcohol can severely dry out your skin causing more acne!</li>
            <li> Costco where I live has Avocado Oil in stock, which is another oil that can be used and is quite nice for mature skin :</li>
            <li> Costco where I live has Avocado Oil in stock, which is another oil that can be used and is quite nice for mature skin :</li>
            <li> It really gets that top layer of your skin off, helping for new skin to form.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for everyone since it is a gentle exfoliant by does the job right!  </li>
            <li> when i clean the residue with water my skin was sooo Soft and it looked clean and radiant and it felt refreshed.</li>
            <li> I did not use a washcloth, just my hands for application, but the dead skin still came off as easy as a warm knife going through butter.</li>
            <li> Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]], which acts as an excellent acne treatment after you&#x27;ve shredded a few layers of dead skin with Cure.</li>
            <li> As freelance makeup artist its important to have good skin; especially clear of of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days and my skin looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Great so far, you can clearly see the results after just using it once and leaves your skin feeling all soft.</li>
            <li> This product is great to remove dead skin cells from your face!  </li>
            <li> not sure if you should though lol</li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but exfoliates very well, Not a bad investment to add into my skincare routine</li>
            <li> Definitely fell in love with this product since the very first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li> really recommend this if you have sensitive skin and are looking for an exfoliator! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel even after the very first use.  </li>
            <li> Very loved it removes dead skin efficiently but for why became the product does not ship directly to Saudi Arabia?</li>
            <li> There are a lot of really amazing reviews about this product but from my personal experience and expectations I didn&#x27;t find it as amazing as other customers.</li>
            <li> After rubbing it into my skin for less than 30 seconds (and seeing the white bits that accumulate) and rinsing, my skin immediately felt incredibly baby soft, smooth, silky, and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle and effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that once I complete my lactic acid peels, I won&#x27;t see as much skin</li>
            <li> * Be sure you&#x27;re applying to a clean, completely dry face.  </li>
            <li> I bought two but am going to order a few more to share with family and to make sure that I never run out.</li>
            <li> I personally this its worth it. :]</li>
            <li> I had outstanding results with just three pumps on dry, clean skin.  </li>
            <li> With the earthen instant peel, you can tell it works great because once you use it, you cannot use it again on the same spot.</li>
            <li> After putting it on entire face and leaving for three minutes or so, I experienced no tingling or burning (Which I don&#x27;t necessarily oppose if the product works).</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and it made my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless of how much came off , etc all three of us were left with squeaky clean skin that looked better.</li>
            <li> its so soft and easy to apply</li>
            <li> sensitive skin, skin is gorgeous when I keep up with regular glycolic peels and facials.</li>
            <li> this really does do a great job at exfoliating dead skin off your face.</li>
            <li> My face looks fresh, clean and clear!</li>
            <li> But it was amazing, my skin never felt so clean and light despite the much harsher exfoliants I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> used it once and right after my skin felt incredibly smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This just exfoliate you skin very gently.</li>
            <li> It was very gentle on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very gentle exfoliator</li>
            <li> very gentle, doesn&#x27;t feel like it is working if you don&#x27;t look at it</li>
            <li> It exfoliates so very gently...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very unusual feeling (the clumps)</li>
            <li> I then moisturize with Rohto Hadalabo Gokuyn Hyaluronic Acid Cream -- it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> it is a very gentle exfoliator but directions</li>
            <li> This one is very gentle and I have never had irritation using this.</li>
            <li> My acne is disappearing and the leftover hyper-pigmentation marks are improving very fast as well.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, and did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> And the price is very reasonable considering the amount of product you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very gentle and exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and not abrasive.</li>
            <li> Very gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Retail is still pricey but totally worth it, I do highly recommend it to anyone who wants a deeper clean feeling.</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews got it right.</li>
            <li> simple, smooth onto clean face...</li>
            <li> I was definitely not expecting it to go away so quickly and easily with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin blemishes and mild acne</li>
            <li> After applying either my shiseido mattifying moisturizer, or any of my other moisturizers desired at the moment, my already smooth face felt and looked more smooth and soft than I could have ever imagined.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff dissolves skin like other reviewers think, but after I use it my face feels very smooth, clean and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> Before, my skin was peeling heavily from retinol use and now it&#x27;s smooth, bright, and clear.</li>
            <li> But if I had to pick one, this gentle one would be it!</li>
            <li> but I am not 100% sure that it is actual skin and not the product itself.</li>
            <li> The regular St Ives scrub seems to do a better job in doing deeper pore cleaning and skin exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Not a perfect system but perfect for in between pedis.  </li>
            <li> According to another reviewer, the bottle lasts for 6 months so if it lasts me two to three months, it would be worth every penny and really reasonable and affordable.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t even have a chance to let it sit on my skin first -</li>
            <li> Yet my skin is soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> If you think that you have soft and smooth skin now, just try Cure once</li>
            <li> I will totally recommend this product to my friends :)</li>
            <li> 2 days later I bought 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED CURE 1 1/2 WEEKS LATER :)  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAZIMG, FOLLOW DIRECTIONS EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s gentle!</li>
            <li> I bought my first cure aqua gel in Japan.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to those who are interested in buying this product. :)</li>
            <li> Thanks Cure!</li>
            <li> it really does work!</li>
            <li> ,i use it once one week.it make me skin soft smooth</li>
            <li> nothing like it really!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel gritty and sandpapery like most exfoliatiors.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff very regularly and love the results.</li>
            <li> Will most definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth skin and cleaner pores are the result.</li>
            <li> ;D)</li>
            <li> so I should love my skin the way it is even though I look like a Mexican version of a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sidenote: This product definitely is not &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;scam.&amp;#34; I sincerely doubt the reviewers who say so.</li>
            <li> Have bought for several ppl now, who also love it.</li>
            <li> It arrived so fast!  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> The next morning my face is now more evenly textured and silky.</li>
            <li> and I was trying to use more asian products to see if it would help my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels pretty soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> most products leave my face very red.</li>
            <li> very bad,don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> When I used it, the first thing I noticed was that it smelled like alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice in the last week, just since receiving it, and it makes my skin sooo smooth!</li>
            <li> reminds me of the Pretty Feet &amp; Hands sloughing lotion (anyone remember that stuff??).</li>
            <li> Will be back again! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I can google it or something, but don&#x27;t care enough to...</li>
            <li> After doing more research I was sold and bought a bottle the same day.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> So much skin came off!</li>
            <li> does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit at first I got a bit over-enthusiastic and used it every 2-3 days but found it was too drying so, for me, twice a week is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really thought that its worth it</li>
            <li> The first time I used this it removed those patches.</li>
            <li> Like many things, using it aggressively for more days is not necessarily better and won&#x27;t fix this dryness issue I&#x27;m experiencing.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it is a no go</li>
            <li> Sadly, it is a no go</li>
            <li> but sadly, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I also bought another one for back up :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a smooth clear gel with no grit.</li>
            <li> Just be aware of the lag time and order in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just finished my first two weeks with it</li>
            <li> You get a very exfoliated and fresh face after using.</li>
            <li> I had bought one of those facial brushes w/ scrub gel you need to keep buying to exfoliate my skin, but this product works even better.</li>
            <li> the first time I used it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a gel that feels cooling on the skin when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I even tried it on my son once and he thought it was funny because he said it looked like his face was a shade lighter.</li>
            <li> This stuff was Fantastic, It completely changed my skin.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this and knew immediately that I would be buying the full size version, despite the price (this is more than I usually spend on products).  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve done your entire face, rinse off and moisturize :)</li>
            <li> and I was really amazed of the results!</li>
            <li> *Cleanse/Remove all makeup first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying again, most definitely.</li>
            <li> You will see the result from first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With occasional break outs, mostly on my cheeks or chin when they happen.</li>
            <li> But it confirms it is not fake.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this stuff is wonderful!</li>
            <li> much more white balls formed</li>
            <li> At first, I was like, \\&quot;Oh,</li>
            <li> /&gt;What isn&#x27;t overhyped is the seller, ppali beauty, very recommended!</li>
            <li> One pump is more than enough for your face.</li>
            <li> Using it as instructed, I did notice the balls forming on my skin, however, the fact that these balls remained white when my skin is brown let me know this product is nothing more than snake oil.</li>
            <li> It has become a regular part of my weekly regimen and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> First I got this because of a youtube person.</li>
            <li> This gel does exactly what it declares.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother with it!</li>
            <li> When I first stumbled upon this product I was leery to try it and was tempted to use my sister as the official guinea pig (that&#x27;s what family is for,</li>
            <li> My face was so soft and smooth after the first use that I was literally standing there with my mouth agape in shock.</li>
            <li> and I will continue purchasing this product after I finish my first one.</li>
            <li> This stuff Really works!  </li>
            <li> i have had something like this, but it was in different country, and in America i haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like this.</li>
            <li> In each instance I could see and feel the top layer of the skin come off into tiny particles.  </li>
            <li> First of all I have combination/normal skin and</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I read reviews on Google, Amazon, &amp; most definitely YouTube before purchasing .</li>
            <li> After using this routinely twice a week for several weeks now, I can&#x27;t say definitively say that my skin is smoother or more youthful in appearance.</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I can 100% say that the microneedling device DOES work, as it damages the top layer of skin just enough for repair and collagen induction to take place</li>
            <li> I use this 3 times a week after first cleansing with Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product and after the first use it completely cleared all of the dry/flaky skin off of my face!</li>
            <li> The size is pretty substantial and I will continue using it but will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I need to actually commit to it, so I can see better results.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time tonight. . .</li>
            <li> If you saw this product on a shelf without researching it first, you would have no idea what it does.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pumped some into my hand and rubbed it on my face; it&#x27;s unremarkable at first.</li>
            <li> The gritty feeling intensifies, and begins to feel more like i&#x27;m massaging rice into my face, and upon leaning closer into the mirror, I have to keep myself from screaming.</li>
            <li> I literally JUST used this for the first time in the shower.</li>
            <li> No way did I expect to feel or see a difference the first time.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and used for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I did in fact have soft, smooth skin with no redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> My skin always looks better the next day.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather buy American and be able to ask questions and deal with locals.</li>
            <li> wherever, and after you are finished and rinsed off, your skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommended!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all for the first time using, I noticed that my skin tone looks brighter.</li>
            <li> but it really does!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about Cure was that the gel is quite watery.</li>
            <li> Both products make your skin clump similarly, but I think Cure dries a bit faster because it&#x27;s more liquid-y, so it might be easier to work in sections</li>
            <li> The more your rub the more dead skin will slough off!</li>
            <li> but I know for sure its going to be gone soon enough.</li>
            <li> First time trying it</li>
            <li> but when you&#x27;re done your face is smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> first time I tried it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was really after the second and third use that I began to notice how great my skin felt (and looked).</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this exfoliator works magically and differently from what I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft &amp; smooth after I use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer, brighter and healthier looking, plus the products that I use with this instantly work 110% better than without exfoliating with it.</li>
            <li> Her skin was softer, brighter and so much clearer that she had found the confidence to not wear any makeup at all to work!</li>
            <li> One thing I learned about ordering from amazon is to read 3 stars and below first.</li>
            <li> I almost thought is wasn&#x27;t going to do anything at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin feel really clean without becoming dry.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is just a gel and not a scrub but definitely works like a charm!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> First time writing a review on a product.</li>
            <li> And since it exfoliates so well, my acne scars have healed and faded SOO fast!</li>
            <li> The patch looks better than it has in a year and looks like it might actually heal up.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle of cure around six months ago and all I can say is the results speak for themselves.</li>
            <li> well I got my first one and turned around and bought another before I put a dent in the first bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft now and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> I really like to see the skin peeling off!</li>
            <li> and I will continue purchasing this product after I finish my first one.</li>
            <li> After using this product it really makes your skin feel cleaner and not just on your face !</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin to begin with, but I just like knowing all my dead skin is gone...</li>
            <li> Afterwards, your skin becomes soft and baby smooth.</li>
            <li> I was weary of it at first</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s in her early 30s with fantastic skin.  </li>
            <li> Waste of good money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neat being able to see all the dead skin coming off your face, leaving your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Each time I use it, my skin feels very soft and clean after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Turn Again Peeling Gel 28.3, available on this site, to gently remove the dry top layer as it is ready to come off.  </li>
            <li> Make sure your face is freshly washed and pat dry before you use Cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering i did the Free super saving shipping and handling (I didn&#x27;t pay for it only just the product)</li>
            <li> All of my products seems to be absorbed better without all the dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bottomline is you can find or make a good exfoliator for dry and sensitive skin for a fraction of the price compare to this.</li>
            <li> My face looks really rejuvenated after washing off all the build up, whatever it is, and feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I know I am not being very helpful, but right now the jury is out.  </li>
            <li> No exaggeration, it really rolls right off.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week to keep my skin free if clogged pores, I follow up with an Aztec Indian healing clay mask a/ raw apple cider vinegar and this combination has kept my skin glowy, plump, bump free, acne free.</li>
            <li> Very clean feel, I need this for regular peeling &amp; depend on this much now!</li>
            <li> I think this is worth the investment because it makes my skin feel baby soft after using it for the very FIRST time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gently on my already super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve experienced even BETTER results, as I see a softening of the harsh, deep (the width of a nickel) stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This made all the dry skin come right off, better than any scrubber ever did.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic, pure and simple!!</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean and soft after using this and moisturizers and other products apply a lot better after use.</li>
            <li> Amazing exfoliator - but be careful and don&#x27;t overdo!</li>
            <li> it does a dicent job, but i don&#x27;t see how amazing it is from other reviews.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth it in the long run if you think about how much you spend on cheaper products that you end up tossing after one use  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I do not experience sensitivity or even dryness after using this product...just soft, fresh, glowing skin!</li>
            <li> There seems to be NO irritants in the product (like in other exfoliates) which I really liked.</li>
            <li> There is, however, a very heavy scent, and although it is pleasant, I&#x27;d prefer no scent as fragrances can irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Strangely effective, but hard to accurately explain the usefulness of this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this item after reading all the positive reviews, and was super excited when receiving it the next day!!!</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> and my Nerium is back to making my skin bright again as it&#x27;s penetrating deep into my pores.</li>
            <li> silly as my review may sound to you, I am completely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> great considering if you&#x27;re not so serious about ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Subtle exfoliation adds a great glow.  </li>
            <li> The product exfoliates the skin gently, leaving the skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> it did make my lips super smooth and dead skin free.</li>
            <li> The best part is I&#x27;ve had this for nearly one year and still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> It makes my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It removed about 70% of the dry skin from my face and left it smooth, if kind of smelly.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> my face felt soft after and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, squeaky clean and baby skin after.</li>
            <li> I am still in disbelief that this gentle, pleasant product can deliver the same results with several uses that a chemical peel can, with NO irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Once rinseing my face my skin looked lighter, clean and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin feeling so soft, supple, clean,  &amp; glowing without drying it</li>
            <li> a top product is that it is not only gentle, but it WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> You rub gently over your face and within 15 seconds, sure enough, the epidermis starts to flake or \\&quot;ball\\&quot; off!    </li>
            <li> I think if I even use it more frequently, that I would not have any problems or be sensitive with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not irritating for me, so sometimes I can use it more, but if I use it too often, I&#x27;ll notice that none of the white forms, meaning no skin is coming off.</li>
            <li> Now I only use it on my neck and the back of my hands every 1-2 weeks, then apply good quality lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried this several times and read more reviews by people who think it works, but it really doesnt.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything, my regular acne gel is way better, I have no idea how the reviews are high!?</li>
            <li> This gel is extremely gentle on the skin, isn&#x27;t harsh at all YET it honestly removes dead skin better than many top-end exfoliators I have used.  </li>
            <li> It took them all off and left me with silky smooth skin that absorbed my serums easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a top product is that it is not only gentle, but it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Yes, it gives good exfoliation while remaining gentle on my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> good product really works well to remove dead skin cells just dont use it too often</li>
            <li> I would say Cure Natural Aqua Gel is good for very sensitive skin and as a rotating option with a scrub but not the only way of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> am very pleased with the packaging of the product to ensure no damage during travels, and came with a thank you note and little gifts as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the most unique exfoliator because unlike normal exfoliator which are beads that are rough on the skin</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is dry before using and rub very gently.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle, very gentle, exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is black magic!</li>
            <li> I woke up this morning with my face feeling super soft!</li>
            <li> You have to make sure your skin and hands are completely dry first or this won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> So I was sold on all the positive reviews, before buying... and that&#x27;s why I bought this.  </li>
            <li> I am 100% positive about the effectiveness and authenticity of this product.</li>
            <li> I am 99% positive you will like it.  </li>
            <li> I work with skincare and ordered to try since I heard positive review.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of positive comments &amp; people</li>
            <li> After reading the all the positive feedback, I decided to try this product out</li>
            <li> Granted I choose to go with the positive reviews of this product over the negatives, and boy did I HOPE it would be some sort of holy grail.</li>
            <li> Cure Natural Aqua Gel exfoliates away the dead skin cells very effectively.</li>
            <li> So when I came across Cure Natural Aqua Gel on a Youtuber&#x27;s Channel and found it was really inexpensive, with positive reviews, I was really excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing and it&#x27;s helping in fading dark spots on my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> This is a product I like so much and want everyone to try and like just as much as me!</li>
            <li> This product is great, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews claiming the product itself is actually</li>
            <li> Shipping was pretty fast</li>
            <li> after first use, my skin feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I have tried other beaded or brush exfoliators and don&#x27;t find them as effective or gentle as this product.</li>
            <li> I first tried it, my skin wasn&#x27;t peeling, so I wasn&#x27;t really</li>
            <li> Pretty gentle.</li>
            <li> I pretty much always have blackheads on and around my nose and on my chin.</li>
            <li> I noticed this after about a week of use, I just wasn&#x27;t getting as much gray gunk off my face as the first day.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like this product- easy to use and seems like it refreshes my skin and is steadily reducing some acne scarring.  </li>
            <li> This is the first exfoliating product that really worked, but did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Many products (I&#x27;m passionate about my skin care)</li>
            <li> If you really feel the need to get directions before using check those out first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After this comparison, I am very confident that the product is indeed getting rid of the dead skins.</li>
            <li> I use it 2/3 a week in the morning or before bed (which ever) after the first week I seen real results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin and really makes my skin feel smooth and</li>
            <li> Really good exfoliator, removes a layer of dead skin and leaves skin feeling fresh and soft and revitalized.</li>
            <li> Actually does what it claims and exfoliates well, leaving clean, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> For instance, if my skin is peeling a bit on the side of my nose, I notice that more of that white stuff appears in that particular area when I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, efficient, and mild enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty much just pure alcohol</li>
            <li> I mean it was amazing!</li>
            <li> After washing your face you feel like a little baby SOO SMOOTH!!</li>
            <li> I personally think all the hype for this product is true!</li>
            <li> I obviously bought this after reading the rave reviews, but I never expected it to be as amazing as it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than harsher products I&#x27;ve used at removing dry skin--even calluses.</li>
            <li> I was completely surprised on how quickly the product arrived.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that reacts to everything.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m super surprised that it would do so well</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not so sure that it&#x27;s stripping the dry skin off like paint the way it seems to be--</li>
            <li> I use it couple times a week especially in the summer when my oily prone skin gets clog too easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to do and while it leaves my skin pretty soft</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because it was making my face really dry and also making my face break out more.</li>
            <li> Make sure your hands are dry and apply this all over your face.  </li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t make my skin &#x27;baby soft&#x27; or &#x27;extraordinary&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Washing my face then patting dry then exfoliating then patting dry takes up precious minutes when I could be sleeping more.</li>
            <li> The instructions are all in Japanese, but it&#x27;s easy to just look them up online.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clean :) it really helps for my clogged pores &amp; dead skin</li>
            <li> But for someone like myself who&#x27;s on a strong exfoliating medication, it will work well, but possibly leave some flakes.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll notice the pure softness and smoothness of your skin and it&#x27;ll soon become a part of your skin regimen.     </li>
            <li> but I am certain it is not removing visible layers of skin.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of pure nothingness.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels great after rinsing--- very nourished, not dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried my share of exfoliators and while the pilling off of dead skin beads is a cool effect this doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling as clean or as smooth as a normal BHA or AHA exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while, and it seemed to work great the first few times, but after working it back into my skin care routine after not using it, it caused reddening on my skin and a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> It kind of makes a mess when you use it, so I use it standing in the shower before I turn the water on.</li>
            <li> The first time brought off the most, by far, but this stuff still does its job even a month later.</li>
            <li> I use one pump of this and all the dead cells goes with it and leaves my skin looking much better!</li>
            <li> Moment you apply cream you  can feel the dead skin peeling off your face.. Like MAGIC !</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll know that you are getting those dead skin out for sure!</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, but works better than any other exfoliant I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I tend to lean on the cautious side, so to make sure all of the product has been removed, I wash with a gentle cleanser immediately afterwards, pat dry, and apply lotion.</li>
            <li> It really does what it claims (removes 0.01mm of skin) and makes my skin super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my eczema started feeling less itchy and as I predicted, moisturizing cream and meds get absorbed much better.</li>
            <li> It cleans very thoroughly yet is very mild at the same time.</li>
            <li> I would also suggest moisturizing right after you use it to quench your newly revealed skin&#x27;s thirst.</li>
            <li> Erased my fine facial lines and creepiness in conjunction with Watts retinol.</li>
            <li> gentle for skin and remove the dead cells easily and leave the skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> You seriously do NOT know what exfolating of you have not tried this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously not the #1 seller for no reason!</li>
            <li> how much you have already supposedly rubbed off a certain spot.</li>
            <li> When you put it on your face, the gel attaches to the oils on the skin and balls up into little pieces which can then be washed away with warm water.</li>
            <li> What it does do is it forms little balls of it&#x27;s own product</li>
            <li> they are super dry and cracked, and this stuff started working on removing all the dead skin, since it is super dry and cracked, I am going to have to do a few more applications, but it working wonderfully, on all the areas of my skin that needs attention.  </li>
            <li> It is a great exfoliator with none of the harsh side effects of traditional exfoliators.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice alternative to more expensive water activated skin exfoliators.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if scrubs and brushes are too harsh on your skin or cause your skin to become red-</li>
            <li> The negative reviews saying it&#x27;s a lie or a scam don&#x27;t take into account how smooth, healthy and GLOWING</li>
            <li> Amazing to think your face is exfoliated and then use a product like this and see all the pieces of dead skin being rubbed off when applied.</li>
            <li> I found Cure on a beauty blog, and after reading through quite a few reviews online I decided to give it a try, and wow--it&#x27;s a really amazing product.</li>
            <li> I think it may have left a film on my skin that clogged my pores (which are huge</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin, does what it says it will so and removes the dead skin, it definitely smooths my skin</li>
            <li> I used another exfoliator and my skin went baby smooth, but that one wasn&#x27;t gentle enough for every day use.</li>
            <li> The dead skin just comes off, it&#x27;s so amazing, and it leaves my cheeks feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that sloughs off dead skin ..never seen anything like it.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing to see the dead skin cells gather on my face.  </li>
            <li> vey gentle and exfoliates like crazy.....worth the money</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle and along with my soy based foaming cleanser have re-hydrated, brighten and cleared up mu skin.</li>
            <li> When I do use it, my skin feels really soft afterwards and its really fun to use because of the clumps.</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle</li>
            <li> no idea if it really is exfolliating..</li>
            <li> It really does take off a layer of your skin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much my skin has improved</li>
            <li> Product was very runny and smelled of straight rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon for my refund.</li>
            <li> It really works very well-</li>
            <li> , works well yet gentle to skin.</li>
            <li> whatever it is) but its very watery, VERY watery.</li>
            <li> Now, before I purchased, I read some people saying that if this was really your skin, that you&#x27;d be suffering from burns on your face.  </li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DOUBTFULl...  </li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates and</li>
            <li> When I put the product on some parts of my body, nothing much happens.  </li>
            <li> With this product, my family and boyfriend said my skin looked so much</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> order arrived in 4 days with free shipping and the bottle was rapped properly and neatly in a bubble rap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for me.  </li>
            <li> But I have to say that I have not broken out from it whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t get your face or hands wet before you use it.  </li>
            <li> It arrived really fast and with no problems.</li>
            <li> but all you really need as proof, is the feel of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have lived with acne my whole life like a lot of people, and I did my research, bought this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different types of exfoliators (Vive per Lei Facial Peeling, ect) and this product is the one that has always gives me the best results without fail.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> It was gentle and works so well on my face.  </li>
            <li> extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone whose really touchy about any blemish on my skin, and unfortunatly I was genetically blessed with oily skin prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to skin of all types!</li>
            <li> Damn,  was I hesitant to spend so much on an exfoliation product from Japan.</li>
            <li> so it is really gentle,</li>
            <li> It arrived here really fast</li>
            <li> but it gets very dray &amp; kinda sticky</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference in my skin though.</li>
            <li> Works gently and exfoliate very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will probably order again</li>
            <li> but I also feel like this is way too gentle.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> gentle exfoliant, not as abrasive as the mechanical formulations&lt;</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast from Japan and the product was well protected.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t like how much I had to massage/</li>
            <li> after using it for 2 weeks, i dont really see any difference/ improvement on my face.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the debris comes off after you apply it</li>
            <li> This really worked for me with my acne.</li>
            <li> it does not smell, it is gentle on my skin, and I have no reaction to it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> u really on need</li>
            <li> You really do have to try this.  </li>
            <li> It does leave your skin much smoother</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very liquidy and glides across your skin, you don&#x27;t need to rub hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the type I have always wanted, very good，</li>
            <li> Way too much alcohol.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very watery</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the exfoliating department.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really is gentle</li>
            <li> My face did feel much smoother after using.</li>
            <li> Item as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, if you have sensitive skin and only want the most gentle exfoliation, then this may be for you</li>
            <li> I use it 2x a week and rub GENTLY (like it says in the instructions).  </li>
            <li> I have very youthful skin and this Aqua Gel</li>
            <li> The ingredients used, aren&#x27;t so $$, so I didn&#x27;t really understand why the steep price.  ???</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was fast, 2 days, with prime membership.  </li>
            <li> My face and skin was not that much softer or exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really wanted this CURE product workout.</li>
            <li> My face and skin was not that much softer or exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really wanted this CURE product workout.</li>
            <li> Really takes off deadskin cells.</li>
            <li> Gentle.</li>
            <li> and I desperately missed all the wonderful skin care products there.</li>
            <li> It works so well while being gentle.</li>
            <li> Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really does anything beyond entertain me for a bit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This really works....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Brilliant product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So much so, it scared me.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans everything off your of your face.  </li>
            <li> It is nice that you get enough to do your whole body several times.</li>
            <li> start to evenly and gently rub your skin in circular motion.</li>
            <li> really recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> Eh i can see the deadskin after scrubbing but besides that it doesn&#x27;t do much for my acne nor my darkspots.</li>
            <li> However, not convinced I see real results in exfoliation.</li>
            <li> really works!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it as recommended, twice a week and really see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> this is gentle to use unlike a burning glycolic acid product...</li>
            <li> This exfoliator really works.</li>
            <li> During the washing process, it&#x27;s very gooey</li>
            <li> The thorough exfoliation helps to keep breakouts to a minimal and helps heal acne marks more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I used to not care much about a beauty routine, but now my skin is glowing</li>
            <li> This has a water like consistency and my face really looks brighter after using it.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and no perfume smell.</li>
            <li> So I proceed on applying it on my whole face.</li>
            <li> I really like the product,</li>
            <li> wait a moment then gently &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; off with fingers and be amazed.</li>
            <li> Have to use too much of this product...</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a light facial lotion afterwards like Cetaphil or Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> It will work much slower than laser treatment from a dermatologist, of course, but you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> but it works really well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with my skin and will have to start Accutane soon, but this gel has really helped keep some problems at bay.</li>
            <li> The skin around my nose and cheeks had been really messed up..</li>
            <li> One of the side effects of this ointment is that it makes my skin really dry/sensitive before I get acclimated to the treatment.</li>
            <li> and they will be much smoother after one use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast service well packaged to protect the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> They really care about their skin just that much.</li>
            <li> Really like this exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> Who wants acne at 35</li>
            <li> Cure Natural Aqua Gel leaves my skin smooth and soft, with absolutely zero irritation.</li>
            <li> but I really like it</li>
            <li> It does seem to get rid of a layer of skin in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This was the only thing that could get my skin feeling smooth again.</li>
            <li> but my pump bottle was not a gel it was already liquid and did not exfoliate very well.  </li>
            <li> If those were your skin cells shedding, your skin would certainly be very irritated after each use.</li>
            <li> I really like the results.  </li>
            <li> It really exfoliates the skin and isn&#x27;t abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> Lotions, creams, and serums are able to work better because the dead skin cells are removed on the upper layer.</li>
            <li> and it does leave the skin much softer and nicer.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because i wanted gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Well, this stuff is gentle, but too gentle for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it besides sort of garlicy, and it lingered on my hands for days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get decently smooth skin initially, followed by acneic eruptions.  </li>
            <li> and they have been all very impress.</li>
            <li> and it left him with baby smooth hands.</li>
            <li> product is very watery, you are supposed to apply it on your face, let it sit, then massage.</li>
            <li> and this is extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> I used my tretinoin the night before and I moisturized my face intensely before applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> This really helps in not looking cakey wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product so much.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how the product can be so gentle yet thoroughly cleanse my skin.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions, it really works.  </li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t really do anything to reduce the size of your pores.</li>
            <li> or so, then rub in gently with fingers.  </li>
            <li> It is so gentle on your face.  </li>
            <li> and I may as get real about it.  </li>
            <li> My sister has very sensitive/acne prone skin</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot in my opinion to cover your whole face</li>
            <li> This totally changes my face because when in just one try, I can feel that my face becomes so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but be careful not to overuse -- it damaged my skin barrier &amp; broke me out.</li>
            <li> My bikini area doesn&#x27;t get ingrown hairs as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> I would recommend not using it very often..</li>
            <li> Product works really well.  </li>
            <li> Another thing is that I don&#x27;t have time to really use it on the weekdays as I just wash my face, slap on some lotion and go to work.</li>
            <li> but it is gentle</li>
            <li> I massage the gel in circles on my face, suddenly that smooth feeling under my fingers starts to get a bit...</li>
            <li> Just be ready to be grossed out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really does &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t expect to really exfoliate as how you would get from scrubs.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it really does remove impurities.</li>
            <li> I believe it is part of the product to really get the dirt outta your face (or leftover makeup).</li>
            <li> if anyone who speaks Japanese can translate the label, that would be fabulous.</li>
            <li> This product really helps remove those skin flakes.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like Cure -</li>
            <li> They had a promo recently and I was supposed to get a free cosmetic bag - it didn&#x27;t come with my order.  </li>
            <li> This product is like a gel alcohol, so much so that you might as well put alcohol on your face.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a real reviewer, not a paid shill).</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to skin care products.</li>
            <li> But this product is so awesome it totally deserves the next few minutes of my life because it has changed mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and effective and all that dead skin that was making me break out is removed gently every day.</li>
            <li> Really seems to tighten the skin.  </li>
            <li> It gives a gentle exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I would give 5 star but the price is too much for what you get.</li>
            <li> Then when you rub your skin, the friction causes the skin cells to clump together and leaves your face with a newer layer of skin (it&#x27;s basically a chemical peel, but much much gentler?).</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin is being ripped apart.</li>
            <li> It is sort of distressing to realize how much needs to be removed.</li>
            <li> But this product has changed that so much.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, all her acne scars were gone (she never realized they were just scars and thought she just had a lot of acne all this time), revealing a much clearer skin than she thought.</li>
            <li> The results were immediate and it so gentle.</li>
            <li> It does have an unusual texture.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel much of a difference from using this product.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really expect it to replace my lotion.</li>
            <li> I did it back to back a couple of times to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just product buildup and after about 3 times I didn&#x27;t get any more of the white beads on my face.</li>
            <li> I have added it to my skin care routine (using 1-2 times a week since it is gentle).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it is gentle and makes my face feel a tad bit smoother</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference in your face.</li>
            <li> This works well to gently exfoliate off the peeling skin.</li>
            <li> Just spread it on your skin and gently massage in a circular motion, no need to scrub.</li>
            <li> and after you wash it off, you are left with BABY SMOOTH SKIN.</li>
            <li> And fast shipping...</li>
            <li> and this product has never broken me out or cause dryness.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product really does get up all that gunk that has been shedding on your skin, and</li>
            <li> In addition to my face I&#x27;ve found an unusual use: I have a palm-sized patch of eczema on my ankle.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle and has no exfoiliaters or microbeads on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin (no &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; or walnut shell chips).</li>
            <li> I felt almost like water, so I was doubting at beginning if it will really work for me or not.</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone and the products that I use to keep the pimples at bay can be drying.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t seem to help much</li>
            <li> and this has helped SO much.</li>
            <li> Buy it and know if you share it you will be looking for it because everyone wants it.</li>
            <li> your death cells really gently...</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> This thing really takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I wish I had spent my money on something more tailored to my needs...</li>
            <li> It really does.  </li>
            <li> Left my face really smooth.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating is so gentle that I can use this twice a day, before bed and work.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I am really happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t no if It&#x27;s really working....</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is an absolute must-have in every skincare routine.</li>
            <li> : I recommend this to everyone regardless of skin type as exfoliating is an important part of proper skincare and Cure</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use it anywhere but my face, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works for the body.</li>
            <li> Rather unusual treatment product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this post after I&#x27;ve used Cure for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m really loving it so</li>
            <li> I waited a long time, debating about purchasing it, and I&#x27;m very glad I finally decided to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> The product is as gentle as you want it to be( if your not gentle with your skin you can scar it even more</li>
            <li> But if I wasn&#x27;t using that, I was honestly scratching dead skin off my face with my nails.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it on my hands, toes, knees, elbows and more all with the same result!</li>
            <li> My dead skin starts rubbing off like dried glue, and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> dead skin effectively</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and would be able to use it daily if I chose to do so,but  because I am a beauty junkie</li>
            <li> I try to stick to natural products as much as possible and I love that</li>
            <li> is much more gentle in comparison to \\&quot;physical\\&quot; exfoliating products like St. Ives that rely on gritty bits which can be off-putting to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this gel, just like professional facial at the salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noticed that someone voted down this review, so I wanted to elaborate on exactly why this didn&#x27;t work for</li>
            <li> and I could tell right away that this product is not abrasive or irritating as most of the products for acne available in the market.</li>
            <li> I will try to use it for my whole body if I can&#x27;t find any other product that can do my body skin such a good favor as this gel can</li>
            <li> Sure, life is hard &amp; full of suffering &amp; desires unfulfilled, but at least I will LOOK good as I am toiling, over worked &amp; under appreciated ^____^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She commented that it was the first effective exfoliator she&#x27;d ever used that left her face soft, smooth with no &amp;#34;down time&amp;#34; dealing with redness and sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how it works so well without harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I felt that thickness of this gel is super light, not greasy at all, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive dry skin at all.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a good exfoliation product that could remove flaky/dry facial skin (due to using the Obagi Nuderm system).  </li>
            <li> Is much more gentle on the skin than other exfoliators that have scrubbing beads.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, rubbed it aroud and had little white globs come off that I easily washed away, leaving no burning/redness/tenderness, just smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Main concerns are large pores and wrinkle prevention.  </li>
            <li> As a kid, growing up, in the bath or shower, I would often scratch or rub my arms or legs to really give myself a deep clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin does feel squeaky clean after I use it, and I don&#x27;t think that this is healthy to use more then once every other week (at least for me).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about buying this product but after using this product for the first time I have to say that it is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> This product helps my other products work even better.</li>
            <li> So, I would say there&#x27;s no need to use it more than every other day and</li>
            <li> This may not work for everyone, but I think more people should consider not washing their face every morning with anything other than water.</li>
            <li> prob a lil more due to the rate exchange.</li>
            <li> well today felt better than any other time ive washed my face.</li>
            <li> Before using this gel exfoliator, I was only familiar with exfoliating face washes containing beads/etc.</li>
            <li> I have other products that work as well or better than this product.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any decrease in the appearance of scars though.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the physical exfoliator I had been using, I did not get much white balls off my cheeks the first time, but I did get more on the chin and forehead.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product that I used it for about 4 days out of the week, and I learned that moderation is key with this product.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers I saw this product on budzbeauty on youtube.</li>
            <li> Better than any other exfoliating product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It blows so many other enzymatic exfoliators out of the water.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product when I was deployed to Afghanistan and it helped keep my skin clear without dying it out!</li>
            <li> the 2nd times I purchased this item, I was excited to get them</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer, my skin has a light glow to it, my acne is already getting better after only 24 hours, and my skin is producing less oil.</li>
            <li> so it looks like skin sloughing off, gives you a smooth soft finish after the face wash (due to glycerin content) and does make your face feel quite clean.  </li>
            <li> reality and with these, I draw my &amp;#34;real expectations&amp;#34; because having realistic expectations in mind really help to appreciate any product and understand it&#x27;s value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does get the skin clean of impurities, I notice it helps make my pores smaller, but the price is way up there.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if it really works</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews mainly because I just dont have time but after spending way to much money for this product I had to say something.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel after using it, definitely feels clean.</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave my skin dry or itchy at all, its easy to apply and wash off afterwards.</li>
            <li> Overall, my face feels clean after use.</li>
            <li> After drying my face, it looked like I just took off a mask; my face was clear, vibrant, soft, and squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy it after reading some really convincing reviews, even though this is WAY over the price I usually spend on one product its totally WORTH</li>
            <li> People say this is pretty gross, but I find it really fun to use haha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is definitely now a contender because it gives an immediate clean, rosy glow to skin and a noticeable smoothness&lt;br</li>
            <li> This past month consumed my time with back-to-back birthdays and BBQs (quite a good summer), but by early Aug. the effects were beginning to show on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved THAT product, but the price was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a nice generously sized bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great for removing old dead skin gently and still leaving your sensitive skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My face showed improvements immediately and it is very soft and smooth that it does not irritate a person with soft or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a very large bottle and after the first couple of times you&#x27;ll only need 1 or 2 pumps to cover your whole face and probably won&#x27;t have to use it</li>
            <li> I use it at night after Clarisonic/Neutrogena soap, followed by Afirm 3x (very strong retinol), and take breaks when the exfoliating&#x27;s too harsh.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product I have used that does a great job removing dead skin cells and other yucky things, but also does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I could be tempted to use this everyday, but i am going to follow the directions because even though it is very gentle, it is VERY strong, and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product is a keeper.ould be tempted to use this everyday, but i am going to follow the directions because even though it is very gentle, it is VERY strong, and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Cure was wonderful it took off all the dead skin and left my skin silky smooth and wasn&#x27;t the least bit irritated.</li>
            <li> Its very gentle and my skin feels really soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I break out when I have had too much dairy, food high in sugar and stress.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross to see all the dead skin coming off your face, but oddly satisfying at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and my skin feels incredibly soft and supple afterwards.</li>
            <li> this has been described as creepy but effective, and its true!</li>
            <li> The first use, my face actually had that sweeky (did I speel that right?)</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a very simple person and has never went for any special facials.</li>
            <li> But, heed this warning: if you use it and don&#x27;t think it has exfoliated enough, DO NOT use it again right away!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this gel as an add-in to your skin-care routine, as I have noticed a significant difference in texture tone and clarity after only 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> and its gentle for sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> and was thrilled to find that there was very little sloughing.  </li>
            <li> It seem to remove my dead skin which is great and my skin does not feel dry.</li>
            <li> Got it super fast, it was well wrapped and came with English instructions.</li>
            <li> I really think of it more as the mildest chemical peel I&#x27;ve ever had rather than the scrubbing of a typical exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Super gentle yet effective enough to get out the dry spots that even my physical scrubs can&#x27;t help with.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t sloughed off much as compared to a video I watched, but I do use mild scrubs on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since I started using it, and I am consistently using it every other day.</li>
            <li> I have patches of rough skin on my lower cheek area and after using this, my skin is the smoothest it has ever been (I have had many professional facials also)!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review with how it affects my skin after a few weeks of use, but so far I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I was expecting my face to dry out, but it was fine.</li>
            <li> After one use of the trial packet, I&#x27;m definitely sold and will be buying the full product.</li>
            <li> I was left with smooth and soft sandal ready skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to spend almost $40 on another brand that has a similar exfoliating technique (PTR) for a smaller bottle and thicker formula; I felt like I didn&#x27;t get as many uses out of it due to the thickness and needing to dispense more product than with Cure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of voodoo this is</li>
            <li> I have some kind of dermatitis, not sure what, around my nose.</li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive skin and tried it on a patch of my hand first.</li>
            <li> started to make my own exfoliator using brown sugar and olive oil and find that it works just as well, if not better, than this product.</li>
            <li> Much better than a gritty, granules based exfoliating face wash although using it daily is really impacting the volume of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have pretty soft skin to start out with too.</li>
            <li> If only it were true.</li>
            <li> effectively remove dead skin!</li>
            <li> and it looks likes its going to last me for a time especially if your are having the same skin problem as I am and just looking to try a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> First off, my skin type: acne prone, sensitive, combination, and dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first use I noticed my skin to be really soft.</li>
            <li> I mentioned earlier, it is not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> Same product - not bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> It gently peels the dead skin and make your soft smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> and then I just gently massage my skin, no hard rubbing needed.  </li>
            <li> [...]    Be sure to shake the bottle well, (alittle might run down your wrist).  </li>
            <li> As soon as I save up and finish all my other products I am sooo buying this! :)</li>
            <li> It makes my skin a little pink afterwards, but in the morning my skin feels and looks great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably never want to live without it!</li>
            <li> Use it every other day, gets rid of dead skin cells like magic. :)</li>
            <li> To test this, I put some of the product on the top of a flat clean black palette and rubbed it in circles with a latex glove...</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the Cure, as well as all of my other products if you want clear, bright, and even skin.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator really does live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best and safest exfoliate product you can find in the market because it is super gentle that my HYPER-sensitive face skin was exfoliated 3 times in a row within 2 hours but felt no invasive feeling or any kind of cruel rubbing feelings like other products did on my skin.</li>
            <li> so many good reviews and Sakura Silk (http://www.amazon.com/Sakura-Silk-Gel-Face-Body/dp/B0052XYYQQ) has bad ones.</li>
            <li> I even tested to see if the same balls would form after using it consecutively and as I continued to use it, there were less balls forming and it became more white, not to mention that my skin felt insanely smooth!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, just makes it feel smooth and even-textured.</li>
            <li> for some people, I&#x27;m sure even less than that.</li>
            <li> other then a clean face wash!  </li>
            <li> The more you use it, the less &amp;#34;balling up&amp;#34; you will have because you will be keeping up with the exfoliation process.  </li>
            <li> Normally, when I exfoliate, even if I put on moisturizer immediately afterwards, I wind up developing newer dry skin pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my horribly dry hands, primarily.</li>
            <li> I squirted a half pump on my finger and massaged into my cheeks/forehead/nose/chin/neck applying a bit more where needed.  </li>
            <li> It is a decent exfoliation but not for the price.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that could exfoliate the dead skin gently, and this fit the bill!</li>
            <li> It has only being 2 weeks, and  My acne is still there, but it has tremendously dwindled.</li>
            <li> And this last purchase came with directions in English (most do not).  </li>
            <li> I have not used the product much to see real result, but I have noticed that my skin after gets really soft afterwards .</li>
            <li> My face feels clean without being dry thanks to this exfoliator.</li>
            <li> and it was decent at that</li>
            <li> Clears face up quickly with regular use!</li>
            <li> and I do feel it is probably better than physical exfoliation-granules and such.  </li>
            <li> will definitely be purchasing more, and likely gifting it to others as well.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of monthly home facials with the girls - we have tried ultra expensive (sample) products and have never been impressed enough to buy them.</li>
            <li> It removed all my dead skins as it says leaving my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> However, I find it unfair that we have to pay more so much more money than people in Japan.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be left with soft and smooth skin and nobody will call you a beet face.</li>
            <li> As a result I have not been able to use my regular products and thought I&#x27;d try this one based on several posative testimonies.</li>
            <li> it is sooo smooth and baby soft, I just can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> So after 4 months of using various products and returning everything, I finally repurchased and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a counterfeit bottle :-/</li>
            <li> My skin is refreshed, several hyperpigmentation marks have lessened from this gentle but powerful gel.  </li>
            <li> awhile I have noticed that my skin is starting to even out as I have many acne scar that are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> my T-zone has been breaking out, particularly with blackheads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Yes, some dead skin sloughs off, most of it is product most likely, my skin is soft but it&#x27;s soft after I exfoliate regardless.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been using the Earthen instant peel, i absolutely love that product but felt there had to be something cheaper out there that could do the same thing.</li>
            <li> My pores are so much smaller, my lines are lessened (because the outer dead/dry layer is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still planning to use this again later tonight, but I am so pleased with this.</li>
            <li> It took them all off and left me with smooth, silky ALIVE skin.</li>
            <li> so this is definitely one of the thing I would make sure keep to prevent future outbreak and or to help with scarring.</li>
            <li> I definitely think it helps my serum absorb quickly, and my skin feels smoother.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for 30 seconds to do its magic to lift my dead skin away before I start gently massaging.</li>
            <li> The beading mainly came from the areas that I missed like the area close to my hair line.</li>
            <li> I have quite a bit of red marks left from blemishes and have noticed they have gone away a lot more since started using it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very much particular about the products that I use.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this product and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> However, after using as directef, my skin is smooth and feels as if I&#x27;ve had a professional facial.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin that also happens to be very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to pay special attention to around your nose for those white heads.if you follow with skincare it will absorb better into your skin after all  your dead surface are gone.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin feel really soft too!</li>
            <li> extremely gentle and soft!</li>
            <li> I use PCA cleanser first, then the exfoliate, and lastly Clinique gel moisturizer and so far, rarely any breakouts.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin I&#x27;d say this is a good bet but not necessarily worth the cult following.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> its weirdly powerful in dissolving dead skin and yet so gentle it leaves your skin petal soft and baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> The product is effortless to use, and it works completely the first time leaving very soft skin.</li>
            <li> Price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone and will def be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest buying this in place of a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I must warn you, however, I did not have a highly problematic skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> Highly over priced and over hyped.</li>
            <li> This is a product I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> us how it soothes out the skin and makes it very smooth no revelation regarding the dead cells</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend.&lt;br /&gt;****An</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too high maintenance for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Came highly recommended by a friend, and I&#x27;ve never stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have high acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> But the price is too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> second thing is, exfoliation with this product is so biological that I could genuinely feel that my skin was breathing more than ever after a ton of dead old skin cells accumulated on my face were removed off.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product by a beauty blogger you tube just because I like clean my face and remove all the dead cells leaving my skin clean and soft</li>
            <li> Keep you skin clean long time</li>
            <li> Exfoliators help to remove this dead skin layer, but many are full of harsh ingreients or microbeads that can actually irritate your skin even more.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of removing excess skin and debris, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and clear and even seems to help with excess oil where needed-without being too harsh for the dry areas.  </li>
            <li> After you wash your face as normal pat dry then use two full pumps and swiftly apply to your whole face.</li>
            <li> because at the end of the day... my skin is clear, smooth and absent any dry flakey skin... and wasn&#x27;t that the whole point???</li>
            <li> Remember, if it actually was strong enough to make your skin peel as fast as some described, it would require a prescription from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> : I have sensitive skin, and certain chemical laden product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on your face  and it  really does clean out dead skin.</li>
            <li> and it did get a little bit more clumpy</li>
            <li> Once all of the moisture is gone and the little balls begin to stick to my face more I rinse.</li>
            <li> and it is a little bit freaky, but it is magic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so simple yet exactly what I need!</li>
            <li> I then massaged the gel still on my face in a circular motion and noticed the little clumps many people describe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, and those irritated my sensitive skin, but not this one!!</li>
            <li> And I was right - this product is simply amazing &amp; removes the dead skin from my face that my usual facial scrub does (and more)</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how clean and soft it left my face.  </li>
            <li> A high end cosmetic store in Las Vegas demonstrated a chemical exfoliant that worked great on me but was about $100 for a tiny little container, so I decided to see if I could find something similar online and came across Cure.  </li>
            <li> The added dry air makes that exfoliant not so skin friendly.</li>
            <li> The Cure Natural Aqua Gel is very gentle for even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wash my face and then apply one full pump of this product onto my clean, dried hands first, and then onto my dry face, in a quick circular motion (to prevent the product from drying too fast), then continue rubbing the facial skin back and forth or in circular motions until you sense that most of the &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; or dry skin has flaked off of the face.</li>
            <li> My face is super soft and glowing and I can see a dramatic improvement - blemishes are almost completely gone, pores are looking smaller, and the texture is greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by how gentle this was, and how watery.  </li>
            <li> Works really well if your skin is sensitive to the abrasive exfoliating products.</li>
            <li> Cure works so well and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but you DO have to use it on dry, clean skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and natural so that was a plus for me</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> its gentle, all natural, no grains, and exfoliates wonders.  </li>
            <li> 2 pumps on a clean dry face</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle, you can&#x27;t harm your skin by over scrubbing since there are no harsh exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> Oh how I feel completely duped for buying this, not so much on the raved reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very oily, acne-prone young lady.</li>
            <li> It is really gentle and when you are done your face is soft like baby skin</li>
            <li> It works very well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When i was massaging my face with it, i saw the white clumps of dead skin cells and i was happy because i knew it was actually working!</li>
            <li> Natural Aqua Gel really does all it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This exfoliates my skin in a gentle manner, but clearly does the job well.  </li>
            <li> and wow, I had never seen so much skin come off</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and I KNOW that it&#x27;s working and sloughing off dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth the money; I&#x27;ve had my bottle for almost three months and have only used about 1/6 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It gently and painlessly removes any dead skin and leaves you feeling as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the dead skins come.</li>
            <li> it was magical that it removed all the dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li> I thought of doing one more experiment where I reapplied cure again on the washed face immediately just to see that its not the products which was producing a dead skin like substance...and result ...</li>
            <li> Besides, elbows are a joint where skin accumulates, thus more dead cells.</li>
            <li> Works like magic to take off that dead layer if skin.  </li>
            <li> It is so satisfying seeing the dead skin ball up and come off of your face.</li>
            <li> This will last me a long time for sure.  </li>
            <li> the dead skins cells are removed and my skin feels cleaner and more lighter ^^</li>
            <li> This product and the many like it do not crumble up your dead skin as soon you apply the product.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used The Cure on my legs only the first time and it didn&#x27;t only produced the white sort of pills that most people refer to.</li>
            <li> it sure isn&#x27;t my dead skin cells...</li>
            <li> For me every 2-3 days one application a day, and after 3-4 applications total (~1.5 weeks worth)</li>
            <li> Most exfoliators SHOULD fade scars because the point of it is to shed dead skin and reveal newer, fresher looking skin, however, lots of exfoliators don&#x27;t dothis because of their harsh, grainy formula that can tear skin and cause more</li>
            <li> So one bottle that I use almost everyday lasted me more than a year.</li>
            <li> I hop in the shower and rinse my face and then wash my face with my normal face wash.</li>
            <li> But the result is much better since the dead skin literally just falls off by itself.</li>
            <li> It removes quite a lot of dead skin cells, and leaves your skin better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has cleared many of my break outs and dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have used similar product that I bought in Thailand long ago, it was more like ticker gel</li>
            <li> Did not know I have been living this many years under a dense layer of dead cells.</li>
            <li> I love how you literally see the dead skin come off and makes your cheeks feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> and it flakes not just in the winter like many, but I have trouble throughout the year.</li>
            <li> Since then, my face has become soft and silky, free of blemishes entirely, and has started to clear up blackheads as well.</li>
            <li> do I normally use?</li>
            <li> Their peel is a few dollars more</li>
            <li> i recieved this product a few days agao and used it in the shower yesterday and it was like magic.</li>
            <li> (because you exfoliated most of the dead skin off).</li>
            <li> My skin are: Olive tan, normal to combination to oily side, with pimples, cystic acne and acne</li>
            <li> It felt like more dead skin was coming off</li>
            <li> make sure you leave it on for a few min before before you start to rub off</li>
            <li> I washed my face and exfoliated it with the skin care products that I normally use</li>
            <li> as you normally do.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will last for long time.</li>
            <li> softness after each use  with no negative effect.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and although I was a bit skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve found it does a good job.</li>
            <li> It is good, but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I just got the cute half hour ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to use and write it!</li>
            <li> and I have other cheaper product I bought which is fine, but nothing like this.</li>
            <li> Although it does actually do a pretty good job at taking away my dead skin cells, it&#x27;s pretty equal in terms of other gel based exfoliators.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that this bottle will last a very long time.     </li>
            <li> My product was easy to apply since it came with English instructions on the back.</li>
            <li> Definitely make sure your hands and face are dry when you apply the gel.</li>
            <li> keeping in mind to exfoliate less around the eye area than the rest of the face because it is more sensitive with thinner skin.</li>
            <li> This product removes all of my dry skin and leaves my skin soft and smooth-- with no burning whatsoever.</li>
            <li> , your skin may still be dry after using it, but maybe that&#x27;s because your moisturizer isn&#x27;t potent enough.</li>
            <li> Left my skin incredibly smooth and silky, not dry at all.</li>
            <li> , this product got me right back on track.</li>
            <li> Rinse face with warm water, let skin air dry but not completely dry, then with 2-3 pumps, I applied to face and rubbed away, starting from my nose and working outwards and away towards my ears.  </li>
            <li> So, a lot of dark can be easily put on my face.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed right away was that I really did feel and see skin debris on my face (gently rub) I was astonished BC I have never seen this with any other exfloliant I&#x27;ve use before.  </li>
            <li> But this made my skin feel less itchy and tight and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: Fantastic product, but use judgement and treat it as you would any other exfoliant.</li>
            <li> The second round produced even more &amp;#34;skin rice&amp;#34; than the first time</li>
            <li> The clumps forming on my legs were no doubt dead skin (pretty gross but oddly satisfying).  </li>
            <li> I live in AZ and the climate was taking a toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I feel like a bonafide GURU when people hang onto my every word as they admire my new skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to live in Japan</li>
            <li> Received in 18 days with Christmas and New Year in between.</li>
            <li> I use this when my clairisonic needs a new brush head.</li>
            <li> I will be repurchasing this as soon as I need a new one.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> and I have not had new breakouts</li>
            <li> I even use the exfoliator on my hands because I live in South Florida</li>
            <li> If you have sweaty palms or live in a humid area</li>
            <li> I live in Japan and saw this exfoliating gel everywhere.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to look for a new exfoliating face scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To begin with, I live in Okinawa Japan</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this product, because I don&#x27;t want to scrub my face with hard things anymore.</li>
            <li> Much more effective than products that burn and cause ugly redness</li>
            <li> The amount of white balls is always amazing, there hasn&#x27;t been any decrease in them which seems odd since I use this so frequently.</li>
            <li> I am African American with oily, acne prone, huge pored skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but this product seems amazing.  </li>
            <li> I definitely felt the texture of the dead skin cells coming off, but afterwards I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing difference.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot more money on products that were one third the size and didn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> My normally oily skin has begun playing tricks on me where my face was becoming so dry on the outside.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel like it exfoliated much, but left a layer of moisturizing stickiness.</li>
            <li> but so far has been safe enough for me to use every day in Las Vegas’ dry weather.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and although my t-zone is oily, it&#x27;s been super dry.</li>
            <li> you need a quick fix for dry blotches of skin, use this.</li>
            <li> but I think it will take a few more uses for that to clear up too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gritty, and creates a kind of a paste which dead skin seems to adhere to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Around 10 mins after using Cure, my skin would start to feel super dry</li>
            <li> but it does a vey good job of exfoliating...if it was less expensive I think I could love it...</li>
            <li> I have a few microdermabrasion systems, and not one of them works like this simple gel, while using your own fingers instead of a machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne-proned skin, so I&#x27;m always cautious when trying new products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as effective as it is disturbing, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to get real results with an exfoliating product.</li>
            <li> but it does look a little more healthy and not so dull.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin type, but after i use this, my skin become smoother and even brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am age 60 and have very sensitive skin and allergies.  </li>
            <li> Also, it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This does make skin very soft.</li>
            <li> If I scrub off the dry skin with a washcloth and immediately apply the thickest moisturizer I have, I still will have dry skin pretty quickly (and I have very oily skin--</li>
            <li> Got very soft skin with it.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> acne-prone snd very sensitive skin type).</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and I have recommended it to a couple people already.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much so this bottle should last you a little while, but don&#x27;t forget most cosmetics have a shelf life</li>
            <li> As obsessed as I am about exfoliating, this product has outdone it, and what I love even more about it is that I don&#x27;t need to use a beauty tool such a loofa to help.  </li>
            <li> This works very well or me simply because its gentle, no color/fragrance, and contains natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use it all over to keep my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> It only works (and works REALLY well!)</li>
            <li> 1-WEEK UPDATE: If you wear a plastic glove while applying, you may need to rub with significantly more pressure because the plastic is slick and there&#x27;s no friction to rub the surface epidermis away.</li>
            <li> And it looked brighter,younger &amp; so soft!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> The bump under the scar tissue has significantly gotten smaller and I have smaller but fewer breakouts since.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, an entire layer of skin was gone and revealed maybe five whiteheads I&#x27;ve never seen before</li>
            <li> If I do not exfoliate my skin will start feeling rough like sand paper yet most exfoliants will turn my sensitive skin beet red.  </li>
            <li> I like how this has not caused any sensitivity reaction to my skin and leaves it soft for days!</li>
            <li> And they put &#x27;cure natural aqua gel&#x27; sticker on it!</li>
            <li> After this, the old exfoliaters went in the trash!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I rinsed and did a second treatment because I could feel the difference in skin texture and knew there were a couple of areas I had not focused on the first time.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt completely different after the first time, a lot softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> First things first: it arrived on time and the instructions were translated in English on the back (</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old with normal to oily skin.  </li>
            <li> first I didn&#x27;t feel the product was working, I don&#x27;t read Japanese.</li>
            <li> Last night I applied The Cure to my arms and legs and let it sit while I let my tub fill with hot water for a bath -- so about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m on my second bottle, which is a year after I used the first.</li>
            <li> I like it and use it when I am not lazy.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old woman that tries to take great care in her appearance and am trying to &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; slow the aging process.</li>
            <li> My pores look small and my skin is smooth!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, hallelujah!</li>
            <li> My skin literally looked the exact same before and after.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, the scars actually look like they are fading.</li>
            <li> Afterward my face feels soft like a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I actually tried it first on my nose—like JUST my nose area.</li>
            <li> The other thing I like is that there are no microbeads that could possibly tear the skin and cause more hyperpigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li> The first run through, I saw rolls of skin, which I knew were skin because it didn&#x27;t look white.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> The product was def not abrasive at all, and yet it removed more dead skin cells that my $100 scrubbing tool!  </li>
            <li> Or mix a larger amount in a pretty container and leave on your counter for convenience.</li>
            <li> Or mix a larger amount in a pretty container and leave on your counter for convenience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I found this here at Amazon, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Oh, and my face felt so soft!  </li>
            <li> Make sure to rinse thoroughly and rinse other body parts which may come in contact with it such as hands and arms.</li>
            <li> First time I have ever actually observed an exfoliator working.</li>
            <li> After the first day, I looked at my skin the next morning and still, no flakes</li>
            <li> Secondly, the performance is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I was amazed and surprised!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve read you should only use it a few times a week, but the first week I ended up using it every other night because I loved the results.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling really soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> I know so many things are much much smaller and more expensive in Japan.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel baby soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I usually use it every time I shower so it can be used more than once a week.  </li>
            <li> and this adds more gentle exfoliating to my daily cleansing routine with Cure gel few times a week.</li>
            <li> I am one of the lucky who suffer from combination oily, dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> : You apply this cure gel to your clean face and let it sit for like 30 seconds and then just gently rub and all this dead skin with slough off your face</li>
            <li> Do not let the price discourage you, you need less than a 1/4 tsp of product to clean your whole face, so on the long run it is very unexpensive and totally worth the initial investment.</li>
            <li> Apply it, wait a moment while it changes from clear to slightly white,  and then very gently massage ~</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very good,gentle and effective,my skin is sensitive and prone to Rosacea,and this suits me,I recommend it to similar skin.</li>
            <li> I use the Beauty Facial Extreme Vitamin C cleanser because it got five star reviews and begin to love this product along with this Cure Natural Aqua Gel.</li>
            <li> if you apply it to a clean dry face!!!    </li>
            <li> Those patches are gone since I started using Cure - not just softer skin, there is brand new clear skin under where the patches used to be.  </li>
            <li> Great for exfoliating, but not sure if it&#x27;s the product itself or how much of my dead skin it is sloughing off.  </li>
            <li> 2 pumps on dry freshly washed skin, let sit for a minute or two, then massage and rinse.</li>
            <li> while I haven&#x27;t had the same amount of dead skin sloughing off my face as the first time, there&#x27;s always a good bit, and it&#x27;s always slightly unnerving.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gets dead skin off of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it just sloughs off any dead skin easily.  </li>
            <li> At first I was kind of skeptical because it gas the consistency of water.</li>
            <li> (I know, gross and cool at the same time), then just rinse.</li>
            <li> A bb cream would be well enough coverage, and full application of foundation is not necessary.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t this magical skin soften so personally its not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overly strong and it does take some time rubbing it over your fact before the dead skin starts to come off, but it works well.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it is definitely worth the price!!!  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day right before I shower!</li>
            <li> , it peals a little, enough to give you a feel of a fresh face, but it doesn&#x27;t enhance cleaning, if you want a clean clear skin do that before applying the peel</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- leaves skin very soft and clear afterwards</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, mature skin.</li>
            <li> Make up never looked good on me, and all the oil build-up and dead skin felt like it was weighing my face down.</li>
            <li> Bright with less buildup of dead</li>
            <li> Country &amp; Stream Facial Peeling is less costly and works way better.</li>
            <li> have seen similar products out there that cost less, but I am glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li> I used about half of the bottle then discontinued use because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product was actually exfoliating my skin or if it was the product itself that was drying up.</li>
            <li> I looked up similar items and they sell for significantly more $$ for much less product.  </li>
            <li> Very mild but completely removed the dead skin on my face leaving it like a baby&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> Next I tried to put it on my face twice, and sure enough it did not clump up (because the first time all dead skin were already removed).</li>
            <li> I put it on in the shower anyway, rubbed it in circles as though it were a beaded wash and....felt the dry skin coming right off.</li>
            <li> It absolutely rids your face of dulling dead skin, revealing fresh new skin underneath.</li>
            <li> You start massaging it on dry skin, and soon you witness your old dead skin cells leaving your face like snowflakes, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re done, you rinse/wipe off the balled up dry skin (gross) and you can continue on your merry skin care way with soft and smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe not as strong, so maybe it&#x27;s similar to a 7% TCA peel, but the sensation is definitely the same.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- only takes a certain amount of skin off with each application.</li>
            <li> but if you see a discoloration of the product (like if it turns beige instead of pure white)</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m on my second bottle) and it is certainly one of the reasons for my improved skin.</li>
            <li> ; whatever you call them, the actual skin cells do not shed off after you use it on a certain spot which tells you that it works.</li>
            <li> I heard that this product does not contain alcohol (as the ingredients are in Japanese, I can&#x27;t read it), but it certainly smelled like it did, so if your skin has problems with alcohol, you may want to avoid this product.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll discover it only balls in certain places on your body.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- very good for delicate or hard to scrub areas like the face or</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to use very much, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually use it 2x/week because I don&#x27;t want to overdo it, but it&#x27;s always a treat to use because I feel so ridiculously clean after!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my older brother try it (who never uses any skin products and just washes his face in the shower every night with regular soap) and huge amounts came off but in a dark gray color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: After reading more reviews of Cure on here, I&#x27;ve noticed that some people are saying that the little white or grey-ish (whatever color) beads that show up on your face after rubbing the product in, are just product build up.</li>
            <li> I put a little on the glass counter top on my vanity to see if I would get the same balling effect.  </li>
            <li> The only exfoliation you will get is from your skin rubbing against the little balls (you could buy an inexpensive scrub that works much better).</li>
            <li> I also make the mistake (as many do) to scrub too hard with exfoliants.</li>
            <li> The consistency is extremely watery… and when I rub it on my skin, it feels like alcohol and evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li> The consistency is extremely watery and when I rub it on my skin, it feels like alcohol and evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a you tube video (highly recommended by Melodee Morita) and it performed exactly as demonstrated and expected.  </li>
            <li> I have battled these embarrassing marks since my early teens due to a quick growth spurt.</li>
            <li> Cure doesn&#x27;t break me out and is great at removing dull, dead skin.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not coming off the way its supposed to (in little balls as you rub in a circular motion) just apply a little more and it will come right off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very heavy, but someone with a sensitive nose can&#x27;t miss it!</li>
            <li> and I never felt my skin that much clear,</li>
            <li> Keeps skin clear and even fades my freckles and age spots (I&#x27;m 64).</li>
            <li> I would get out of the shower and have clear signs of trauma, but it was either that or peel 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It come out as a clear gel and you won&#x27;t think that this product will do anything in your hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use hydrocortisone 1% cream to try and clear the rash.</li>
            <li> Just wash my face with Shiseido cleanser, rince, and then rub this clear, lightweight, odorless solution all over my face before rinsing again.  </li>
            <li> I also think it has been helping to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> It’s clearly plastic &amp; in my opinion the product itself once it dries off.</li>
            <li> The flaky patches I had on my cheeks are gone and my skin is clear and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works, however, do not expect it to clear your pores, acnes, and scars in one or two uses.</li>
            <li> Using it once a week, it helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear liquid gel appearing to have no added fragrance or color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel that doesn&#x27;t burn, or smell.</li>
            <li> I wanted a gentle exfoliator since I have sensitive skin, and I felt like gritty exfoliators</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for extremely sensitive skin like mine, but tougher than an MMA fight to get that gunk off the face.</li>
            <li> You guys, i&#x27;ve used this only four times and my acne scars are already light pink instead of red/brown.</li>
            <li> But the one I received wasn&#x27;t clear gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how really, but ever since I started using it my &#x27;acne beard&#x27; as I put it grossly</li>
            <li> It is far too wasteful to use it that way.</li>
            <li> Oh wow.</li>
            <li> I also applied it on my dad (who had just scrubed the heck out of his face with a loofah), and no dead skin balls formed.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and hands and could not believe how soft my face and hands felt after using this.</li>
            <li> If you have acne prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Gentle enough that I can exfoliate my 10 year olds face that was peeling from a sunburn!</li>
            <li> but I am very encouraged by this initial try.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough yet efficient in what it does --- exfoliate!!!</li>
            <li> There is a chance that if you apply it the second time, you can actually cause your acne to bleed, so do be careful because it is potent.</li>
            <li> my skib become really soft after I use it</li>
            <li> After washing my face the skin was so soft, no irritation, no bumps, so soothing just like a baby skin.</li>
            <li> no dead skin at all.</li>
            <li> This reveals soft, supple, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft against my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> my face tone lightened up immediately and my skin just feels sooo soft.</li>
            <li> I was kinda worried because the delivery status didn&#x27;t show since it was coming directly from Japan  </li>
            <li> so far, I&#x27;m noticing my skin</li>
            <li> I have never been sensitive to these types of things before</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft for days after I use this.</li>
            <li> My skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I have turned my 60 yr old parents onto this.</li>
            <li> some areas may feel sensitive after exfoliation (be mindful of your choices)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans your skin, face feels so soft after rinse.</li>
            <li> I finally found it on here for a reasonable price compared to 45 dollars at a store we have in hawaii.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over all sastifed and let me tell you after using it your skin is so soft</li>
            <li> /burn a bit by the final application indicating I may be doing it to much.</li>
            <li> I can say my face feels extremely soft after use</li>
            <li> Not harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice some fading in old acne scars.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> This will make your face ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li> It worked really well, I used micro dermabrazen and it left my face inflamed and irritated.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;skin feels soft and supple after use</li>
            <li> but I like how leaves my skin soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I know that it actually is working because my skin can get very peely and flaky</li>
            <li> 30 something for a face wash is too much for me, but this bottle will last a while.</li>
            <li> I have used it in the shower and can&#x27;t imagine that it would rinse off completely at the sink.</li>
            <li> Has helped with blemishes and pigmentation from old acne.</li>
            <li> It says its a natural aqua gel</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use it once week because my face is sensitive</li>
            <li> This product does make your face feel soft</li>
            <li> I just lotion up afterwards and my face is soft as a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And soft</li>
            <li> This product makes my 57 year old skin look and feel rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it twice in a row to ensure my skin is completely dead-skin cell cleansed.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years old and have tried just about every skincare product out there</li>
            <li> but you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> I tried it and boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li> product hasn&#x27;t completely resolved the situation, per se, but it does accomplish two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As one usage doesn&#x27;t really FIX the entire problem, I am giving it four-stars for now.</li>
            <li> but my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had a reaction</li>
            <li> Our pores are smaller and, our skin glows, it really does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a WONDER PRODUCT as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also made a conscious choice to get away from exfoliants that use those micro beads that are clogging our water and getting into our food supply through fish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve foregone the use of a primer because my skin is baby soft</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice a week in the shower and my face and neck feel incredibly soft and hydrated afterwards.</li>
            <li> It works really well on not just my face, but on any spot of skin that needs some extra exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I guess it was dirt and old skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels extremely soft to the touch without the tightening feeling</li>
            <li> The balls may contain some sort of product, but they also contain dead skin cells as my face feels impeccably smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin, could not tolerate scrub, microdermabrasion or retinol product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will help with acne, wrinkle or pigmentation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> So far I can see some improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Deep cleans my face and neck , it feels much smoother every time ...</li>
            <li> Rub face softly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20s, asian/filipino, lighter-medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> Of course after frequent use...</li>
            <li> And thankfully, it takes 2 drops of this big bottle to do your whole face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old.  </li>
            <li> Irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After using, I also realized that the balls that come off your skin are just the product, not dead skin.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have seriously sensitive skin and have never found an exfoliating product that I could use, until now.</li>
            <li> Natural Aqua Gel ingredients: water, glycerin, acrylates/C10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dicocodimonium chloride, steartrimonium bromide, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, gingko biloba extract , rosmarinus officinalis/rosemary leaf extract, butylene glycol.</li>
            <li> This leaves my face feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> I was busy</li>
            <li> I noticed some reviewers saying that they thought they were just rubbing off the solution itself and not dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I could never get my skin to feel baby soft, even with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Only 1 to 2 pumps are needed for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I completely understand why this is a #1 product.</li>
            <li> It turns out that I was just bring all the deep seated impurities to the surface, and now my skin is exponentially clearer, with breakouts MUCH rarer than ever before.</li>
            <li> My mom tried it and she really looked several years younger because her skin was much brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> When I use it to often, my skin gets sensitive.  </li>
            <li> and my skin feels sensitive.</li>
            <li> The flakes are COMPLETELY gone</li>
            <li> Very helpful review and video with English subtitles about how to use Cure:</li>
            <li> It really feels like you have given your face a deep cleansing and polish all in one.</li>
            <li> Sugar is a natural preservative.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Sugar is a natural preservative.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have quite sensitive skin</li>
            <li> caution if you have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Now I must say that if you are someone with sensitive skin then this product will probably work wonders for you, so I think its all about the skin condition with this</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 10 year old son to test his skin which he has a baby face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t routinely exfoliate and I would say that I my skin is mature (I&#x27;m over 40)</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft.</li>
            <li> I get so much skin compliments all of a sudden</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not foamy, so don&#x27;t be surprised.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing about this product for a few years so with free 2 day shipping, I figured I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 39 year old guy.  </li>
            <li> It is not harsh like an acid peel, those are indiscriminate and will peel off tender skin too if used too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin really looked years younger after I was done. . .</li>
            <li> I used this several hours ago, several times, and my skin is STILL clear and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> she couldn&#x27;t get rid of and after using this it fixed it.</li>
            <li> Natural&#x27;</li>
            <li> Aqua Gel is a cloudy clear color, and the consistency is that of jello when you take it out of the fridge too early</li>
            <li> Im sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but so far i don&#x27;t see any breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft and &amp;#34;glow-y&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am a extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It felt soft and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li> You just need to follow the instruction, and ot will leave your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> I am 63 yrs old</li>
            <li> it is the product content  not dead skin that beads up</li>
            <li> so, so, soft and it often \\&quot;soften\\</li>
            <li> I found that using this after my cleanser really helped my skin overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous glycolic and fruit acid products and this is a very well performing weekly treatment.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after I use this.</li>
            <li> After a week, her skin was soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive combination skin with some acne and my acne medication leaves patches of dry/flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft until I used this product.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and radiant.  </li>
            <li> but when I was done they were completely gone.</li>
            <li> but overall I really was blown away.</li>
            <li> but the Asians have completely nailed the beauty market.</li>
            <li> Cure Natural Aqua Gel</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t bring the whole bottle back with me.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for those who have sensitive skin and is looking for a fix on how to achieve a smoother and cleaner face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my face at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 containers one for me and one for my mother who is 63 years old.  </li>
            <li> Cure Natural –.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face, hands and even to keep my feet soft.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and never have an issue with this.</li>
            <li> Then rinse it off and your skin should feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> aqua gel is all-natural and free of harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised at how efficient it cleans your skin.</li>
            <li> Also it dose leave my skin soft after I remove all the gunk  ..</li>
            <li> and it completely dries and you cannot rub it off</li>
            <li> and I covered it with makeup seamlessly.</li>
            <li> Even when I was young, I couldn’t use them.</li>
            <li> Must admit, I was hopeful that my expectations would be even further surpassed with this product, but it&#x27;s absolute crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My acne scars fade so much faster and my breakouts have subsided enormously!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and experiencing hormonal skin, I&#x27;m trying natural products to ease the symptoms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 and biracial with sensitive skin and hormonal acne</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear radiant and soft.</li>
            <li> So far they&#x27;re getting lighter</li>
            <li> My skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It really cleans my skin deeply.</li>
            <li> and I use the product rather frequently.</li>
            <li> I feel so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft and smoothe.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft afterwards</li>
            <li> (in my early 40s)</li>
            <li> The stuff balling up is most definitely your dead epidermis.    </li>
            <li> You can see the dead skin rolling off in a similar manner to used eraser rubbing off on your paper...leaves skin feeling silky smooth!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was actually the dead skin on my face coming off</li>
            <li> I love that it actually works on removeing that ashy dead layer of skin with out any tingling sensation or chemical smell.</li>
            <li> The thing I love about this product is that I can actually SEE my dead skin getting off my face and after I wash my face</li>
            <li> When I went to get a facial I was told I need to exfoliate more often to get rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of this product in removing dead skin cells that I actually can feel and see.</li>
            <li> I love that I only have to use this a few times a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fun to see it work as you gently massage the dead skin cells away.</li>
            <li> Seeing how much dead skin I had left on my face was entertaining and perplexing.</li>
            <li> I wet my face with warm water then out this stuff on it, so much dead skin came off</li>
            <li> It would do nicely for a skin massage and leaves a silky feel behind.  </li>
            <li> although I use it in the mornings before I shower because you have to make sure you really get it off your face, otherwise, it burns and is irritating.</li>
            <li> I have used apricot scrubs with little luck and other harsher exfoliants that have made my skin just go bright red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is gentle and you will feel and see the dead skin cells sluff right off.</li>
            <li> I tried it right away on my morning face &#x3D; no exfoliating since last week + oily t-zone + creams and serums from last night.  </li>
            <li> (Which sounds excessive, but it&#x27;s super gentle and it works for me to use almost</li>
            <li> I washed my face with my normal face wash, then patted the skin dry, then applied Cure to my skin in gentle circular motions.</li>
            <li> Definitely adding this to my normal skincare routine!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m convinced that the balling of skin looks so strange because it is an agglomeration (&#x27;mixture&#x27;) of both your dead skin and the product itself (which isn&#x27;t so far-fetched given that the product isn&#x27;t supposed to necessarily magically disappear!).</li>
            <li> I now know that this &#x27;white stuff&#x27; is definitely my skin, since more comes off on the side of my nose than it does on the other parts of my face that aren&#x27;t peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean I really love this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an acid which can peel live skin or like the rubing of brush or beats that if you are not careful you can irritate your skin.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a deep exfoliation with huge balls of skin rolling off based on how the other reviewers are talking about this item....</li>
            <li> I use it every other week and it has made my skin look fresh, soft and renewed.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the amount of dry skin that was removed on my first try.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wash and dry your skin, your hands and face are dry and that you actually rub it into your face.</li>
            <li> Other exfoliation products with beads does not do the job quite effectively and those that has the brush system is too harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin in general and started using tretinoin cream 3 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I love putting it on and gently scrubbing my face with the tips of my fingers, in small gentle circular motions to exfoliate my skin and getting that grainy feeling under my finger tips letting me know my dead skin has been removed.</li>
            <li> Also, my face looks better and is less dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> so I constantly had tissue to my nose causing it to become super dry and began to peel.</li>
            <li> I will certainly swear that it is removing dead skin; I was on a course of Retin-A when I first discovered this</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the price is okay to me.</li>
            <li> This is one of few instances I don&#x27;t feel the company should be paying me to wax poetic about their product.</li>
            <li> It is not very clear that you should use the gel on DRY, clean skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This actually rubs away dirt and dead skin cells from your face leaving it clean and supple!</li>
            <li> I am very surprised to find that so many people think the white things that come off are actually the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the gel or my dead skin actually rolling up, but it does make my face feel more clean afterward.</li>
            <li> This does somehow loosen the dead skin so that it balls off when applied by hands on clean skin with circular motions.  </li>
            <li> Like seriously I tried so many times on my hands too repeatedly, first time, second time, third time in one go....</li>
            <li> It give skin a clean feeling and takes off all dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> I am sure those white balls are not my dead skin!</li>
            <li> First off this product is expensive, but I decided it is better to spend a lot of money on something that does work, than to buy affordable exfoliators that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> First, when I wore a plastic glove and rubbed the gel between my fingers, there was absolutely ZERO balling, even after rubbing 3 minutes until it dried.  </li>
            <li> The product balled up in these white lumps which was the first sign that it was not exfoliating my skin because I don&#x27;t have white skin.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase unless if I see better results in the future after continued use.</li>
            <li> First of all I exfoliate and use my Clairisonic regularly, so when I rubbed this stuff on my cheeks and middle of my forehead</li>
            <li> I finally took the plunge and splurge and I am glad I did usually</li>
            <li> first thing you notice is the big blue ambiguous word on the bottle:</li>
            <li> This exfoliator works good at cleansing the skin and leaving a fresh cleaning feeling behind while at the same time it is not to harsh or abrasive to the sensitive skin of the face.</li>
            <li> So quick (less than a minute) to start exfoliating, no irritation.</li>
            <li> The difference is very noticeable with the first few hours that you try it.  </li>
            <li> The product does not irritate my skin at all, and effectively removes every last bit of dead skin, even patches of dry skin.</li>
            <li> --it was more than I had seen using it in the past, and additional proof that it actually works.</li>
            <li> This is super gentle and seriously makes the skin BABY soft!</li>
            <li> The price is worth it for me (especially since I was spending big bucks on Proactiv, which makes my skin red and doesn&#x27;t completely clear up acne for me - ugh).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those who want to eliminate the use of different products to achieve what this one product can accomplish.</li>
            <li> like that it is a very gentle exfoliator without rough ingredients.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those that need to exfoliate daily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 or 4 times, so I&#x27;m not sure about long term results, but it does make my skin look much smoother and better</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend using this prior to using a mask.</li>
            <li> I can attribute the vast improvement in my skin to this product and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone dealing with acne and clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product to slough off the dead skin cells, and I&#x27;m surprised to say that it really gets off most of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> My face is much softer than its before exfoliation state, so perhaps I have already eliminated the couple months worth of dead skin accumulation, and revealed fresh skin with only couple days worth of dead, dry skin cells...</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t have naturally sensitive skin, I treat my oily, acne-prone skin with salicylic acid, which leaves my face prone to redness from new facial products.</li>
            <li> One kid did loose a little more with the cure</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it right though; use it after your usual makeup removal and cleansing, pat skin gently with a towel and pump this once  or twice and rub onto your skin till your skin are slightly dry or till you can feel the dead skin on your fingers.</li>
            <li> This beauty product totally works, but you can&#x27;t use on super wet skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe Cure will clear up acne, but it works so very well following on a face wash made especially for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> But as you continue to gently massage your face, the dead skin starts rubbing off and you&#x27;d be surprised at just how much comes off.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I was in the peeling/flaking stage and my face was looking rough.</li>
            <li> First of all the product arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Anyway, so yesterday, I went through my normal routine with cleansing my face in the shower with my Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Gel (that I received earlier this week), after drying my face, I applied CURE</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman and exfoliating is extremely important so that your skin care products, that are so expensive, can be readily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> product does work, and it actually does quite a good job at removing my dead skin cells, but about just as equal as my other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more exfoliators and really didn&#x27;t know one way or the other if they were actually removing dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I use AHA&#x27;s on my skin to keep my acne away so my skin gets flaky in certain spots, and i needed something to take away the dry flakes.</li>
            <li> I can always find easy or hard to find items with Amazon.</li>
            <li> other product has made my skin feel so brand new!!!  </li>
            <li> I usually stick to only chemical exfoliants, as most physical ones are too abrasive for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very delicate 72-year old skin and cannot use abrasive exfoliators without removing too many layers.  </li>
            <li> I know I am too lazy to scrub my body every single day and thus my elbows don&#x27;t get such a nice treatment.</li>
            <li> If u r familiar with Moroccan bath you will have the same result but with less effort.</li>
            <li> Yes, as many other reviewers said, I can clearly see my dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much at once or leave it on too long or it will burn!</li>
            <li> I will say this, all of the reviewers who are saying it doesn&#x27;t work, I hope that they are not only using this and expecting for a new face to appear in the mirror before them.    </li>
            <li> I did start using another new product at the same time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m creating a new system for myself since I found out that my Proactiv facial scrub has polyethylene &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; which are accumulating in our water systems and the fish we eat.</li>
            <li> Unlike other exfoliators, this is very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and not like other exfolitor product</li>
            <li> Unlike other products, it&#x27;s also very gentle.</li>
            <li> It broke me out and took alot of nasty skin off, but now my skin is bright and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I immediately washed my face with a baby soap, pat dry and put one dab of cure on my face gently massaging allover my face.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has blackheads, dry skin, or un-even blemishes.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, flaky skin and no matter how much you exfoliate you&#x27;re still peeling, buy this now.</li>
            <li> You then gently rub in circles and dry skin</li>
            <li> Just apply to dry face, gently scrub, then rinse.  </li>
            <li> However, if you use it too much it can make you look colorless and dry.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, and it does wonders(at least to my face), fast shipping, you name</li>
            <li> It works really well at exfoliating dead skin cells and giving you an opportunity to really fight your acne.</li>
            <li> As with all face products, you absolutely have to use several different products at once.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle to use everyday if you want, and the effects are very noticeable.</li>
            <li> It essentially feels like it sucks up all the oil from your skin so that you can get more friction when you rub your face with your fingers to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> it felt gross and when I rubbed it the title white grains didn&#x27;t really show up.</li>
            <li> I could not bear, one for the price and one for the less powerful exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I used all different kinds of masks, drug store products, Lush products, changed my diet, tried exercising in an effort to clear my skin to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this after reading all the good reviews but it left a weird, sticky residue on my face after using.</li>
            <li> when I used it I got so much skin off the first time it was a little gross!</li>
            <li> Well then how else does it remove less skin if I repeat the process 2-3 times in a row and begin to reveal more shiny, new skin with a slight tingling sensation?!</li>
            <li> know you&#x27;re not supposed to, but I used it every single day for about a month until my skin stopped producing so much of the substance when I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> that it does not &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; off more dead skin after a certain point - if you test it twice on the same area of skin, there won&#x27;t be dead skin balls because it&#x27;s already gotten that layer off.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Korean massage cream products that does the same exact thing but smells much nicer and allows you to massage your face as well as take off your dead skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no other exfoliator like CURE.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still amazed and excited to see the dead skin coming off my face!</li>
            <li> I already use a gentle daily exfoliator, but a few times a month, I want a little something more.  </li>
            <li> After the second time, the flakes were completely gone!</li>
            <li> The major drawback is that all info in some language i can&#x27;t decipher, but still 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to people with sensitive and acne-prone skin!</li>
            <li> the acne that i do get is a lot smaller in size, and my old scars are ALL VANISHING!</li>
            <li> I especially suggest this to who have sensitive skin like me!</li>
            <li> The first use made my skin silky smooth but still left some flakiness behind</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s worth the money, you only need a little bit (maybe like 1 pump) to cover your whole face, this will probably last me a while.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have the major peeling some people get.</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates like no other.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to use on very sensitive or irritated skin as it will make certain areas red.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and I&#x27;m able to remove that gross dead layer of skin that builds up daily (especially when using acne products).</li>
            <li> typically use it right after a shower about twice a week.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and leave it on for a while before massaging the liquid and even though my feels fresh when I wash it off, I don&#x27;t get the same effect I do with other exfoliating scrubs.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a few other products and I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was originally unimpressed after a few weeks of facial use, but I&#x27;ve found it is an A+ body exfoliator as well.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling super soft and not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> Skin Issues; sensitive due to use of Retin-A, glycolic acid, and other fruit acid products for exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Occasional reaction to sulfites which can cause dry patches that are challenging to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went from rough ,dry and slightly dark to being soft , smooth and lighter !</li>
            <li> My chest has been looking older and older and every morning I notice the wrinkles on my chest and it takes half the day for them to disappear.</li>
            <li> Still smooth skin, but the overall level of &#x27;brightening&#x27; wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;ll move to figuring out how often is right for me (likely every other day or so, to keep the acne at</li>
            <li> Since I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very skeptical when buying some new products, which most of the new products irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done using it, my skin feels so smooth, BUT it does get at least somewhat dryer.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week for general cleaning and to help promote pealing for some existing acne</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week to clear sebacious filaments from my noise and inner cheek instead of biore strips or mask.</li>
            <li> As of late I have had issues with my skin becoming red and sensative.</li>
            <li> (initially it applies clear).  </li>
            <li> only recommendation I would have is some clear instruction on its use.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for about a week, but the results are clear.</li>
            <li> Not for those with sensitive skin though, as my friend used this and it made her face red and irritated all day.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m a 37-year old fair-skinned Asian-American male.  </li>
            <li> I have had a facial skincare routine every day of my life since I turned 30 years old.  </li>
            <li> For 5 years, as far as cleansing goes, I was always using Stridex daily, and 2x a month using an acid exfoliator (the Olay serum/scrub kit).  </li>
            <li> I only know that what I experience is removal of old skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I thought it was gimmick as well but after trying it out, wow</li>
            <li> The consistency is very watery, so be careful with applying it, as it will drip.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin extremely soft after each use and lasted for several days.</li>
            <li> The whole big shibang about this product is it&#x27;s claims to help gently exfoliate by causing the dead skin to roll up in balls.</li>
            <li> I am asian-american, japanese descent, I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Apparently, as I suspected, it doesn&#x27;t, the reason it pills up on skin like that is because something in the product clumps around oil, not skin.</li>
            <li> It was a complete &amp; total bust!</li>
            <li> I did and it hurt so much :( be careful.  </li>
            <li> Skin sloughs off and pills in your hand when particularly applied to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Follow up with a gentle face wash or just wet cloth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 54 year old female.  </li>
            <li> Natural Aqua Gel is very similar to what I used to have</li>
            <li> My skin was not really lighter, but much brighter, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]</li>
            <li> then I massaged it in and here came the white balls and WOW ....</li>
            <li> My skin is back to when I was young.</li>
            <li> However, the next morning, all of my developing breakouts were completely gone.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t use a lot of skincare products or my face will get red.  </li>
            <li> Only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I received the Cure Natural Aqua in the mail last week.</li>
            <li> I am currently using a microneedle (dermaroller) device for the stretch marks on my breasts (which are hideous and have left me very self-conscious my entire life).</li>
            <li> people made a comment that the white part that comes out from rubbing your face is not dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Even though she exfoliates regularly, she said she hasn&#x27;t felt her skin so soft in years.</li>
            <li> It left my skin soo soft</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my skin is baby skin soft and it lets my toner and serum soak deep into my skin, keeping it hydrated.</li>
            <li> I paired it with the Hada Labo lotion and Haba Labo moisturizer, and found my skin still completely soft and supple the next morning.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the feeling using my bare hands.</li>
            <li> I waited for 3 weeks for my skin to completely heal then use it again and again, it left my skin softer than a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s when I realized that there&#x27;s simply no dead skin on the back of my hand since I wash and scrub my hands so often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft without making pores big.</li>
            <li> Once you see white stuff start appearing on your face, gently rub in circles, creating gross white balls of skin and</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, apparently.</li>
            <li> I used Cure Natural Aqua Gel from last two weeks.</li>
            <li> because after you use it the first time, there really is no need to put on a second time.</li>
            <li> Of course, I declined her kind offer and moved on with my life, and then I randomly discovered Cure on amazon and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it too often because i find that irritating to my skin and causes more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Dead skin is gone and my serum was really absorbed.</li>
            <li> the top of the bottle was broken when it arrived even though it was in a plastic ......</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is kind of weird because it doesn&#x27;t have any beads or anything</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became a true believe when this past weekend, I had a spur of the moment business dinner meeting.</li>
            <li> (more like made it worse)</li>
            <li> It gets most dry skin off after a few minutes, but it smells weird, takes a long time to ship, a bit pricey and isn&#x27;t as effective</li>
            <li> The price go up and down the first time I brought it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for other skin types, it might be a little different.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no lather, no cooling or warming sensation, and no little gritty bits scratching your face, as there is in exfoliating scrubs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> These oil products from Japan for break out prone skin were so tempting because of being part Japanese but on my face, I will regularly wake up with a new blemish.</li>
            <li> It is very useful to shed dead skin cells from problem areas like nose and chin, you can definitely see and feel the skin sloughing off, but it won&#x27;t clear every single impurity for those with imperfect skin.</li>
            <li> i am asian- 39 yrs of age; i havent been using this product long enough to give a good review and to see any dramatic changes or changes in my skin however as for the exfloxiating as it claim, it does do that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t contribute all of the success to this product as I have also changed my face wash to one without fragrances and other harsh chemicals (I currently use Simple foaming cleanser, as I don&#x27;t feel it is smart to spend so much on something that is temporarily going to be on your face), and have increased my exercise regimen, and I currently use Clinique Dramatically Different moisturizing lotion/gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As you massage it in, you can see all if the dead skin coming right off.</li>
            <li> The dead skin just rolls right off of your face.</li>
            <li> After the first use, i noticed the oxidation of the black heads on my nose was gone, making it almost seem as if they&#x27;d disappeared (they hadn&#x27;t of course, but still.)  </li>
            <li> and I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> two days after I use it I always have dry, flaky skin that my normal exfoliation doesn&#x27;t take care of.</li>
            <li> Odd feeling at first because you don&#x27;t know what to expect but leaves your skin silky without over drying it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other exfoliators of this type, but this is the first one that actually works for me.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day on my lips and face so far and no negative effects.</li>
            <li> I would compare two applications of this product to a mild chemical peel or a month of using retinoids, but without their harsh effects!</li>
            <li> I only rubbed for a minute or 2 because I got nervous that even with gentle rubbing, I might loose my face.</li>
            <li> so I tried it on my feet and it took the rough dry cracked skin right off.</li>
            <li> and it is gentle enough to use on my twins knees when they are very dry.....</li>
            <li> Due to all the reviews, I had high hopes for this product!</li>
            <li> gently exfoliates and doesn&#x27;t cause the inflammation after some exfoliation processes take due to abrasion and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time yesterday (03-15-2014), and I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I am African American with normal deep chocolate colored skin.</li>
            <li> Okay product, exfoliates by forming little gel beads that lift away dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> One thing make sure that when you apply this product on your skin, you should wait a little few seconds to turn whiter, and start rub it.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very smooth after, and it was fun \\&quot;rubbing off the skin the product attaches itself to like glue\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure that all of those little balls were really dead skin.  </li>
            <li> These skin food products are far superior to American made, sorry to say, and they do not cause other problems to deal with.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so smooth, seriously.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take some months for me to see a dramatic difference, but I&#x27;m on the road to better looking breasts.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian Indian 30 year old housewife with a flacky, dry, combination and really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that such a soft and gentle exfoliator could have such an enormous effect, so I checked the product to see if it had any hidden balls within it but found none.</li>
            <li> So, I tested this applying to the back of my hand in several applications in a row, each time the amount of &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; became less and less until nothing more came off.</li>
            <li> It gently removes surface dead skin cells, revealing soft baby skin.</li>
            <li> I am not so sure that the white ball stuff are dead skin cells, but I have gotten into a routine of using the product twice a week and there are considerably less balls than in the begining.</li>
            <li> and they can all be harsh depending on the one you try; they are NO WHERE near as gentle as this and NO</li>
            <li> It really takes off all the dead skin and my face feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Most exfoliators end up causing me to break out by irritating my skin further - but not The Cure!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I think my skin&#x27;s gotten good enough of a cleaning, I rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super simple to use and only takes a few mins to do.</li>
            <li> No dry feeling or burning.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out the skin and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals which irritate the skin</li>
            <li> thought my cleanser properly disposed of my dead skin cells, but this product proves that it wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> , I realized then they are scabs and not dry patches.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product did not sting or dry my face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> After first week, I had 6-8 breakouts(pulled out deep down acne?).</li>
            <li> My skin is usually oily acne prone, large pored, and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly, and noticed the little beads.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of medication including antibiotics, various strengths of benzoyl peroxide, and birth control, but nothing made a major difference.</li>
            <li> First, a little background to give you perspective.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a major pimple since starting to use it and that&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> It has watery texture, when you rub it gently into the skin, the dead skin (the very superficial layer) falls gently forming small balls.</li>
            <li> You will begin to feel and see the dead skin bead up on your face when done simply rinse and dry and you will have glowing clean skin ready to apply your other skin care</li>
            <li> I can simply rub over it a few times with a wash cloth and it peels right off.</li>
            <li> and after using this product only a few times (I got it right before  Xmas</li>
            <li> Love this peel, just rub in circular motions all over your face and watch all the dead skin turn into white little lint sized balls on your face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little gross to see all your dead skin, but I love that it&#x27;s non-abrasive.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re in the shower you need to first towel dry your face first then apply or it will have a rough time to see or feel that white beads that claims its your skin not real sure about that??</li>
            <li> The product itself rolled slightly like glue, but was completely clear, very sticky, and overall looked nothing like the white stuff that forms when I rub it on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really strived to reduce my acne scars, with not much success</li>
            <li> , all of the information on the bottle is in Japanese, but apparently you can find tutorials on how to apply it on Youtube or on beauty blogs.</li>
            <li> youre exfoliating first tho, or you will just be using it to remove a layer of dirt as opposed to dead skin.</li>
            <li> First evening, I had a lot of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well at removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> The first few times I had to repeat the procedure twice because my skin needed it.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says, removing the dead skin cells from the skin.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just the gel sloughing off my face to give the appearing that my flaky, dried skin was coming off.</li>
            <li> when you first apply it you think it doesn&#x27;t do anything, but after a couple of secs you see your dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> First, I spread it all over my face, wait for a few seconds, and rub in circular motions all around my face.</li>
            <li> will say that it is relatively expensive, but the bottle is a fair size and I&#x27;ve been using it a lot (as I said, probably every other day on avg.)</li>
            <li> My skin is always SO amazingly soft after one pump of this gel exfoliator, its a little on the pricey side but since one pump is enough for your whole face, and you&#x27;d only use this product once a week</li>
            <li> All you do is rub hands on face or body part in soft light circular motions and instantly, you get tons of dead skin (grainy, little, beads) rolling around on your skin.  </li>
            <li> All you do is rub hands on face or body part in soft light circular motions and instantly, you get tons of dead skin (grainy, little, beads) rolling around on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I applied a dime size amount to my hand and rubbed it all over my face and my nose and was shocked to see how clean and smooth my face was.</li>
            <li> To really appreciate a product I write down my expectations VS.</li>
            <li> It kept my peeling down to a minimum while I was out and about and removed SO much skin before I applied my makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (the cystic has calmed down since, thanks to prescription intervention)</li>
            <li> I have very dry, very sensitive skin with rosacea.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is also very dry in the cheek and chin area, and oily in the t-zone.</li>
            <li> reviews are right on point-very gentle cleanser, wait a few seconds and the dead skin starts to come</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my teenage nieces after I first discovered this in a store in Little Tokyo.</li>
            <li> With this little exfoliator I&#x27;m able to remove the layer of dead skin cells and reveal a brighter face!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of other skin products so my skin is in decent shape</li>
            <li> I use it every other day because I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> so I know it is very gentle, apparently it only affects dead skin.</li>
            <li> Its like rubbing water or gel on your face rather than most exfoliators which are rocky and rough which may leave your face even worse off, especially if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> Small circular motions make a layer of my skin come right off.</li>
            <li> And it leaves skin feeling so smooth; I have a hard time keeping my hands away from my face!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes on this product based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> This will gently dissolve them and then you can softly sponge your dead skin off and continue with the reigning to heal your face!</li>
            <li> I usually apply this after I finish my morning shower (use it on dry, clean face).</li>
            <li> Rub it onto you dry, clean face and watch the dead skin start to pill up!</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have excessively sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin and can&#x27;t tolerate Cetaphil cleanser, Purpose cleanser, or exfoliating every 6 days</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin and had stopped using my Clarisonic Mia because it was causing dry patches</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had extremely dry, flaky spots on the crease of my nose, my forehead, and near my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> That being said, I also suffer from dry skin and bouts of adult acne.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, I thought &amp;#34;Yea, but do these people have dry, sensitive, temperamental skin?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Watch for lower prices and buy when it&#x27;s less than $30 and its a real bargain.</li>
            <li> I bought this exfoliant for my daughter because she has acne rosacea and severe dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I did used it after washing my face and completely towel dry.</li>
            <li> I put this to the test and the dry skin came completely off it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried exfoliating back to back and while the first time there was a lot of dead skin, the second time there was barely any</li>
            <li> This is because it&#x27;s actually ridding your face of dead skin cells the first time.</li>
            <li> got this mainly because I had a few breakouts which left scars on my face since early Aug</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I thought &amp;#34;there is no way that this stuff is going to work-it feels like nothing&amp;#34; but I massaged it on my skin and all this dead skin starting coming off!</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had as much dead skin come off as the first or second time I used this stuff...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra for quality and this definitely is!</li>
            <li> did not hate it, since it actually cleansed my face but its not that my pores decreased, and the softness of skin I can get with other products I have for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I thought it would help with acne too, it does get the swelling down, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent future breakouts, so it makes me wonder just how much dirt and oil</li>
            <li> I have eczema including having it on my face in the past, but my facial skin is still sensitive and this is really gentle.</li>
            <li> I definitely will keep using Cure Natural Aqua Gel in my beauty regime, I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find/hear about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it two times in a row (back to back) and the second time, barely any beads form at all.</li>
            <li> After reading several positive reviews across multiple websites, I threw thirty dollars into the internet and received the product less than two days later, presumably delivered via techno-wizardry.</li>
            <li> In fact, it seems to clear up some of her existing scars and definitely removes any dry, flaking skin.</li>
            <li> Yet it always seems to be less likely to react after a gentle peel.  </li>
            <li> it again two days later, and noticed some recent acne scars already lightening (recent as in earlier in the week) but no real impact yet on some older darker spots, but will give it some time.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that seem to break out or turn red at every single thing i use on it.</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week and its super gentle on my sensitive skin so no more exfoliating with other harsh and grainy products..</li>
            <li> I was almost certain it was a scam and that I had wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, I had previously done a whole research on Asian skin care products and found out that most of them were really expensive and sometimes didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> Put on rubber or latex free gloves, place a small amount of product on one gloved hand and rub with the other glove hand, you&#x27;ll see the same bits form, no skin</li>
            <li> He likes it so much because he can SEE it&#x27;s working when the little clumps form.</li>
            <li> After much testing and analyzing the product I must say that my skin feels significantly cleaner and smoother after every use, but the small little particles are certainly not my skin.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t my dead skins be a little light brown or something?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this product makes me break out in red itchy bumps on large areas of my face and also a few white heads!</li>
            <li> When I exfoliate my body using a scrub, little rolls that are tinted grey start to peel off, this is the exact same thing that happens when I use the cure gel on my face.</li>
            <li> I am convinced my large pores are less noticeable now that I&#x27;m not scrubbing with an exfoliater!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for a deep cleanse that does not leave your skin feeling dry, tight or sensitive.</li>
            <li> while so many other expensive products don&#x27;t live up to their name, this does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on legs as my legs are quite dry, and I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t provide as much moisture as my other products.</li>
            <li> My skin has been very sensitive due to sun exposure, I couldn&#x27;t use physical exfoliators like microbeads or facial brushes, etc.</li>
            <li> Good seller but bad product</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy and works amazing.</li>
            <li> I do not have bad acne or any facial problems but was looking for a good exfoliate/cleaner product.</li>
            <li> The skin of my elbow felt softer but it did takes couple more times to get rid of the thick layer of dead skin of my elbow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive once I use this another time during the week, that I&#x27;ll have way less dry skin than before.</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews say, you rub it into your dry, clean skin and this white substance forms as the dead skin is removed from your pores and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whether you have acne or aged skin, all skin dulls due to dead layers on top.</li>
            <li> While it sits on my face, I rub my hands together to get the dead skin off of my hands first, rinse them, dry them, and then rub my face..</li>
            <li> There are little white pills that appear after applying -  particularly on the fingers of the hand that is applying it.</li>
            <li> Takes time to actually wash my face and DRY it first before I can use this where as other exfoliating products can be applied to wet skin.</li>
            <li> I have near to no wrinkles due to a lifetime of using Retin A and wearing sunscreen as if it were a religious requirement.  </li>
            <li> The reason that I only give it three stars, is that I have broken out fairly significantly every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever scrubbed your skin to deeply exfoliate with a towel or with enough friction with your hands, or have ever rubbed your hands long enough as a child to see the tiny rolls of skin cells ball up...</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used it 3 times because my skin appeared to be so dirty that the white substance (I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s dead skin because it stops coming out if you use the product more than once) kept pouring out</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make skin raw - only clears away cells that are ready to slough.</li>
            <li> Thickeners that when rubbed form little bits/balls with this particular</li>
            <li> In use it  about once a week or week and a half on my whole face, with spot-treatments in between if I have any dry, crusty spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just addicted that I use it once a week to deep clean my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- takes a decent amount of (only) dead skin off of any area applied</li>
            <li> I rub it lightly and so much dead skin just comes off in little balls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s peeling off my skin or if the product just pills on your face after a certain amount of time and physically exfoliates.</li>
            <li> No fragrance, no residue, no tight feeling and no more scrubbing of fresh non-dead skin; this reacts with and removes only the dead surface cells.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and really helps to maintain.</li>
            <li> I use Cure every other day and on my two young girls (7 and 12)once a week.  </li>
            <li> It does not create an overly sensitized skin if used frequently as has been my experience with other exfoliants.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted it because its all natural, unlike the other exfoliator i&#x27;ve used in my life...</li>
            <li> Switch to Cure for twice a week exfoliation and looking at Murad or some other system for a natural exfoliant.</li>
            <li> She has oily, acne prone skin and was always conscious about it though so she tried tons of other products.</li>
            <li> I usually rush to rate things I buy,but I&#x27;ve had this product for about 5 months and finally feel ready to properly rate it.  </li>
            <li> I had thought I was exfoliating enough, but apparently not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cool to see the little beads of dead skin form on your skin as you&#x27;re rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Had a sample and was excited to try this, but it arrived with the dispenser broken.  </li>
            <li> Even though Obagi utilizes it&#x27;s own exfoliation product (Obagi Exfoderm) to enhance the dead skin sloughing, I was getting tired of the long process of getting rid of the unsightliness and decided to hasten the sloughing by buying the Cure product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The white beads of dry skin began, then progressed to little ropes because there was so much to take off.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> The price is a little high..</li>
            <li> The EWG lists warning regarding concentration limits, allergic reactions, and organ system toxicity due to animal studies that showed brain and nervous system effects and skin irritation at moderate doses and broad systematic effects at low doses.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about its watery texture at first, but after using it, your skin feels really refreshed.</li>
            <li> I received my CURE exfoliator this past Wednesday (03-12-2014), but I decided to wait until the weekend where I could do my whole facial routine without rushing to get to work.</li>
            <li> My breakouts are very deep under the skin, so waiting for it to finally surface or reduce can be a long process at times.</li>
            <li> The bottle is big and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Chemicals cause a lot of redness and irritation but even worse, they peel away healthy skin which tends to become scabby, dry, and rough through the healing process.</li>
            <li> However, I started to break out more and patches of my skin that haven&#x27;t even broken out still turned into dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tested this product 3 times in a row to see if white balls, or particles (your dead skin cells) will come out, but after my 2nd time, no white stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the instruction is all in Japanese, it could be difficult on how to use this product, You can google search it and find intructions very easily.</li>
            <li> So, I was also a bit skeptical, as it seems many people on here were at first, but this stuff is serious business.</li>
            <li> Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t blame this product because my skin is pretty hard to manage.</li>
            <li> It made a couple of my small pimples on my forehead open up and bleed not sure whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing depending on the harshness of clean you like.</li>
            <li> this will dry up your skin BIG TIME if you do not use a quality facial moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> I messaged it onto dry skin as directed and saw tiny white particles.</li>
            <li> That may be TMI, but I want you to know how much and what type of dry and dead skin I have.  </li>
            <li> I only use a tiny bit at the sides of my nose, which has dry patches.</li>
            <li> You do need to exfoliate very well on your face with this gel or else your skin will become dry (if you did not get all the dead skin off).</li>
            <li> I can now wear foundation without worrying about it accentuating any dry, cracked dead skin that may be - and now thanks to Cure, is never - on my face.  </li>
            <li> I put this product on my dry face and let it sit for about 15-30 seconds, then rub it gently until I can see and feel the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> only give this 4 stars because later on during the day, I notice that I still get dry, flaky patches on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin type is defined as thin, pale, sensitive, allergic and therefore I usually just wash my face by organic stuffs 2-3 times per week, daily use of normal facial cleanser was still too harsh for my skin, in order to say this product is an amazing discovery to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought this product really skeptical because someone mentioned that the clumps you see aren&#x27;t your dead skin, and It&#x27;s probably true because you do occasionally get this hard glob at the end of the pump.</li>
            <li> Although this product is gentle, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that because it still is a chemical of the sort and your skin will probably be red raw and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just this specific batch, but it was not really much of a gel consistency, it was pretty runny.</li>
            <li> but it really does remove dead skin!</li>
            <li> I wait 3 minutes then gently start rubbing small circles on my face to loosen this product.</li>
            <li> You gently rub a small amount on your face, or neck, or chest-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this really does anything.</li>
            <li> Scrubs have never helped my acne scars that fast, it usually takes a month or so</li>
            <li> Absolutely, then every inch on me would be sloughed of dead skin cells!</li>
            <li> A day later my skin was brighter than it has been in a long time</li>
            <li> Long lasting</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t let it sit on my skin long enough for my skin type (and because I couldn&#x27;t read the instructions).  </li>
            <li> and I anticipate it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It last really long time</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine that, however, I&#x27;m looking forward to it!</li>
            <li> twice if my skin feels like it needs it), so the bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s expected, no rough scrubs ever did that for me</li>
            <li> If you do not have sensitive skin, this product may work great; and from the other reviews it seems like some people with sensitive skin have no problems; but it made my face look really terrible.</li>
            <li> tried a sample in a fun little shop on Sawtelle in Little Osaka after ramen with my husband.</li>
            <li> First impression is probably like other people, I was stared at the mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin that I got.</li>
            <li> I wait for the product to dry some, and the dry skin cells start to become apparent on your face.  </li>
            <li> Works a charm, non irritating, simple, cleasnsed all the tiny blackheads on my nose right off (as nothing else had)</li>
            <li> the only thing this does is make little balls when rubbed into the face and the balls are not dead skin.</li>
            <li> The little white things that comes out are not dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> &gt;  &amp;#34;Since some parts of our bodies have higher or lower concentration of dead cells, if I use the same amount of product on these areas I should get a different amount of dead cells.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s more expensive than any of my other facial products, I will refill as soon as I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> and should last me a decently long time!</li>
            <li> Recommend rinsing face after and following up with a lotion or cream with highest concentration of hyaluronic acid possible (try other Japanese products - lotions or creams).</li>
            <li> Oh, the bottle will last soo long!</li>
            <li> I recommend using a light scrub afterwards due to the residue left behind.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it regularly enough or for very long</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product works gently and does what it says it is going to do without over irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> Now, a note: by the time I rinsed off the third time, my skin was dry and stinging.  </li>
            <li> The only disappointment was the price increase (over $10 more).</li>
            <li> I think that much massage/rubbing causes damage to delicate facial tissue .  </li>
            <li> I use Differin and when my skin gets dry it only takes one use of this</li>
            <li> I took my shower and when my face was completely dry I applied the product and let it set for about 3 minutes ( per someone&#x27;s interpretation of the Japanese directions)  and then rubbed my skin in circles.</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY removes all black pores on and around nose.</li>
            <li> Let as much of it turn milky white as you can, then start to rub in circular motions delicately...</li>
            <li> I apply on dry skin rub for about 30 second to almost a minute.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;inconvenient&amp;#34; I see is that after washing the gel off you need to put moisturizer on IMMEDIATELY afterwards or your skin will end up really dry.</li>
            <li> My wife has a combination of dry but acne prone skin, and since using this product, she&#x27;s seen a massive improvement in her skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it can be very drying</li>
            <li> I constantly have dry patches on my face that prevent optimal makeup application...</li>
            <li> With the aqua gel, I just buff all that dry skin away so that my skin is constantly exfoliated and receptive to the medicines and moisturizers I need.  </li>
            <li> I understand how it would be easy to be skeptical, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product that will help to soften my skin and have been trying different exfoliators but have always gotten the same results or not much at all.</li>
            <li> Some people have written that they believe that the gritty feeling as you are massaging the liquid in actually comes from the product and is not really the skin being exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, I would suggest getting the Juara Rice Facial Scrub for roughly the same price.</li>
            <li> normally use these 2-3 times a week (or depending on how I feel).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Scrub face, dry, apply a little on parts of my face with CURE, rub, splash, then dry.&lt;br /&gt;OR</li>
            <li> I have a few skin conditions and it is very sensitive and it was not irritated at all by this</li>
            <li> , my skin became very soft and it helps narrow the pores.</li>
            <li> I read both positive and negative reviews and decided to go for it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier, but the instructions recommend 3-5 pumps, twice a week, which is really not that much considering how small the pump is so one bottle should last a while.</li>
            <li> I dont think I can live without this exfoliator, especially after being told that my other daily exfoliators have not helped remove the dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li> Since I lived in Asia for a couple of years, I usually look to the Asian market for new products for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I am so addicted that I use it every other day to really deep clean my face.</li>
            <li> I also repeated it several times and it&#x27;s obvious that the balling is truly dead skin because after using it 3 times in a row last night, I had zero balling on the last try.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use everyday and definitely takes off all surface dead skin.</li>
            <li> Only apply on a dry face!    </li>
            <li> It is a little freaky when you first use it because you start out with just a watery product, but as you rub it on your face you start to get little lumps of the exfoliate skin rolling around as you apply this product.</li>
            <li> I also tried this product on may other objects such as my counter, my tile floor, my wooden chair in my kitchen</li>
            <li> I waste so much money and other cleanser</li>
            <li> This stuff does it and SOOO gently, without the irritation (my skin is pale and sensitive and reacts negatively to scrubs, making my skin really red).</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, BUT was expecting for my face to shed a large amount of skin; only little bits of dead skin come off..</li>
            <li> To further test it out, I tried it on my father&#x27;s hands that were very dry from winter weather</li>
            <li> Between Retin-A and central gas heat this winter, my skin is very dry and flaky in spots.  </li>
            <li> The little bits that appear are not dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> No, that&#x27;s not dead skin rolling up in all those little balls.</li>
            <li> I brought the clearsonic Mia and pumpkin exfoliating serum but both of them irritate a little when it&#x27;s applied to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this attaches to my peach fuse and it very tough to remove</li>
            <li> skin feels soft afterwards and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Cheap ones, expensive ones.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Gently rub it in for at least 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I do use Mary Kay and seem to enjoy their products, but the acne comes and goes with what I eat and hormones so did not get rid of my random acne.  </li>
            <li> scaring I have tried expensive to cheap skin care products, nothing worked until I tried this ,  </li>
            <li> Wait about 5-10 seconds and GENTLY massage the product into your skin (while avoiding the delicate eye area).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice that what comes off is no longer clear, because the product collects and removes the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I am African American and do not recommend using it on dark skin.</li>
            <li> It applies as a clear unscented gel that after 30 seconds you begin to rub in which then removes dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 17 year old female with moderate acne (at least I was).  </li>
            <li> I have dark African American skin that is oily to combination.</li>
            <li> you would think by the third time there is no more dirt on your hands so no dead skin should be flaking off</li>
            <li> This product clearly sloughs away dead sells without any</li>
            <li> i  use this twice a week to do a general facial dead skin removing and cleansing.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I had not really read up on it enough to know this</li>
            <li> I repeated again last night and had some exfoliation happening, but not nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> Not smooth and soft...</li>
            <li> but, it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been using it long</li>
            <li> There is no chemical burn if you use it for too long.</li>
            <li> For the amount of money spent, I think I&#x27;ll stick with something local I can pick up immediately.</li>
            <li> but it takes all the dead skin off and leaves your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> but I returned mine because it made my face burn and even after several weeks of not using it and using face moisturizers, my face still has rough patches that peel.  </li>
            <li> Never dries out on me no matter how long I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> Look up a few youtube videos and watch this product in action than place your order.</li>
            <li> foresee long use with each bottle&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I have just started with this product, I can&#x27;t speak about the long term effects yet.  </li>
            <li> Strange stuff.</li>
            <li> If I rubbed it on my remote, would it also exfoliate the same...</li>
            <li> i will be ordering this again and it arrived a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use a harsh manual scrubber because it makes my sensitive skin sting and burn.</li>
            <li> As long as the price does not change, I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> If you rub the product on wet skin it will simply get diluted and will become ineffective.</li>
            <li> a minor criticism of the packaging...</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY removed dead skin in the corners of my nose.</li>
            <li> guess I will be going for a professional to take care of my unwanted dead skin cells nothing works for me except for scrubbing it off which then leave my face irritated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this product is not natural</li>
            <li> Even after cleansing or double cleansing dead skin cells still lurk in your skin and this GENTLY removes it without any harsh exfoliating beads that can cause damage to the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll always have it as long as it&#x27;s sold.</li>
            <li> but this for me was a complete waste of my money and is one of my biggest regret purchases.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for long time I start in a month ago</li>
            <li> All the labels are in Japanese, I am just curious to know what are they.</li>
            <li> First of all, dead skin is not supposed to be white, not that much white at least.</li>
            <li> It also feels like a shot of grey goose on your skin.</li>
            <li> Cure Natural Aqua, Obey Your Body, and Avani Dead Sea Skin Renewal.  </li>
            <li> It seems you can feel the old dead skin just rubbing off..</li>
            <li> Although, I never really figured out what the white balls were or what they were supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> It is a minor miracle.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients naturally remove a layer of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I opened the package, I thought this bottle size is bigger than what I expected.</li>
            <li> but... it kind of disappointed me ... too watery... and it left a film on my face....</li>
            <li> At first she had to rub it on her face for a few rounds to get off all those years of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I have tried all of the gritty scrubs that claim to exfoliate well, but I found them all irritating and they did not work as well or as fast as this product did!  </li>
            <li> My face is pretty sensitive to face products, my face either breaks out or dries out if I use the wrong one.</li>
            <li> am a 30 something african american woman and I have acne prone skin (even though it is slowing down now), but I still do suffer from breakouts (around that time of the month), and I unfortunatley do have scarring on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> However, I do recommended though, you should use the product only 2 twice a week, it does makes your skin very dry!</li>
            <li> There are similar products on the market that do the same thing as this product for much less money.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and on a retinol prescription medication that makes my skin dry and peeling, that a scrub seemed too harsh.</li>
            <li> Beware if you try this they will only give you half  your money back if you do not like it</li>
            <li> Which is why it will &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; less the second use on the same skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suffered from a lot of deep seated black and white heads that caused redness and pain, and it doesnt help that I have a tendency to squeeze zits...</li>
            <li> trying several products in an attempt to even my complexion and perhaps help make my T-zone look less like a russet potato, I stumbled across this Japanese marvel.</li>
            <li> This DOES NOT dry my skin out; the principle function of this gel is to ONLY react with and remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Crazy how much this stuff does help exfoliate dead skin, besides that, it is fun!</li>
            <li> spent the next two or three minutes shouting &#x27;EW&#x27; and &#x27;OH GOD IT&#x27;S SO GROSS&#x27; while continuing to rub my face; by this time it due to morbid fascination rather than desiring even coverage.</li>
            <li> and now I only get one pimple every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little skeptical of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; claim after looking at the ingredients but it sure does work.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to use and look forward to long term results!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> it could be because i regularly use other exfoliating products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other asian peeling products and this one ranks at the bottom.</li>
            <li> Sony and scads of other companies have managed to speak English for years now.  </li>
            <li> Life long user!</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY UPSET because I was on my last bottle.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need any other deep skin cleansing products except maybe a pore brush or biore strips to pull stuff out of your pores.  </li>
            <li> I do use a lot of other products on my face, but this one has definitely earned a permanent place in the line-up.</li>
            <li> I have never exfoliated like this before and will never go back to rubbing rough granules or cloths on my face/body!</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is so different from any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have the instructions in english</li>
            <li> As the gel dries it rolls up into little bits/balls which look like dead skin cells, making you THINK it&#x27;s your skin being gently exfoliated.</li>
            <li> My face is actually getting lighter, as playing tennis and other outdoor activities</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering two (one for myself), along with some other Japanese skin care for my mother&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> You can really see the dead skin coming off with just a little pump.</li>
            <li> I believe that it really is your dead skin that is coming off in those little balls.</li>
            <li> I rub and rub and rub my face, yet only a couple little white pieces come</li>
            <li> Just put a little on your hands, rub it all over your face gently, and leave on for about 30 seconds so it has time to react with your dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> And again this morning (yes, I know I need to slow down before my whole face peels off, but it&#x27;s addictive!)</li>
            <li> bought this on a whim, thinking it would be okay, but not live up to the raves...was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> Afterwards my skin was smoother than it has been in a very very long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I recommend this for people with dry skin, acne, and scars.</li>
            <li> Smooths out dry skin immediately after use.</li>
            <li> And when I massaged my face,I felt my skin really dry.</li>
            <li> FACE MUST BE DRY.</li>
            <li> Need to use alongside a moisturizer because it&#x27;ll dry out your skin, but that isn&#x27;t a con.</li>
            <li> but I recommend using moisturizer after using this product because your face will get really dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- leaves non-oily areas dry, I recommend you moisturize accordingly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the gel, all I know is that there was dry skin flaking off of my face before and after something balled up under my fingers there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> So I used it again, this time I did it longer thinking it will dry</li>
            <li> It does dry a bit</li>
            <li> I washed my face and let it dry for 30 minutes</li>
            <li> Apply it on my dry skin it feels like water</li>
            <li> but it would just dry up.</li>
            <li> but my skin is so dry and flaky I use it every night with my clarisonic mia</li>
            <li> I had continuous patches of dry skin that were just stuck and could not be removed.</li>
            <li> and my face does not feel dry afterward.</li>
            <li> others have noted, you must wait until your face is completely dry, after washing, before using Cure.</li>
            <li> I am dark-skinned woman with extremely dry, cantaloupe-y skin.</li>
            <li> I use it after cleansing on dry skin in the evening.  </li>
            <li> : Use this product on DRY skin after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Combination dry and oily skin.</li>
            <li> pat dry and then use two pumps of the Cure(use dry, no need to add water)</li>
            <li> If your skin is extremely dry and flaky, this product is not going to get rid of your problem.</li>
            <li> pat dry.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t dry up my skin</li>
            <li> My skin felt slightly dry and rubbery after washing with it.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry the skin either, but it also isn&#x27;t too helpful to be used as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know was dry.</li>
            <li> I could see how cakey my makeup looked because of the dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it was just dry to the point my fingers could not</li>
            <li> All the dry skin balls up</li>
            <li> Skin is still flakey and dry with no improvement or change from this product.</li>
            <li> This has helped, but causes the skin to dry and peel.  </li>
            <li> For me, it just feels as if it is the product itself balling up and not my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> No redness or dry patches after use either.</li>
            <li> all the dry skin was just GONE.</li>
            <li> I used it on my dry elbows, too, and all that dry skin came off, as well.  </li>
            <li> you know, the oily skin with the dry outer layer).  </li>
            <li> I had so much dry skin come off, I had to do it twice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t dry my face out.  </li>
            <li> I had two really dry, calloused patches under where my glasses sit on my nose.  </li>
            <li> For 2 weeks, I was suffering from dry patches along my nose bridge and cheek bone.</li>
            <li> I am using tons of hyraluronic acid products, so I should not have dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s with oily skin that sometimes has dry patches and my pores are always congested.</li>
            <li> , keep in mind your face and hands have to be completely dry before using this product or else it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> If u have dry patches from acne or whatever it will not make those go away.</li>
            <li> Dry face</li>
            <li> I put it on my feet and all the dry skin washed off.</li>
            <li> this, if I forget to use this a couple of days my skin gets both flaky dry and greasy</li>
            <li> but it has made covering up the scars with make up easier because it has faded them and also gotten rid of the dry skin that made my makeup patchy.</li>
            <li> pat dry</li>
            <li> but my skin became excessively dry.</li>
            <li> The dry skin therefore gets prone to break out.  </li>
            <li> ; Scub face, cleanser, dry, then use CURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After washing your hands, pump the bottle 2 times into your hands and apply this allover a DRY face.</li>
            <li> Acne scar disappear but more always build up because my skin is suffocating under the layers of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I asked my sons chemistry teacher if we could look at the \\&quot;stuff \\&quot; that is supposed to be dead skin under a microscope and see how much of it was really dead skin.</li>
            <li> When you apply it and start rubbing it you can see the dead skin coming off; still, it isn&#x27;t harsh with the skin, it is not irritating or anything</li>
            <li> But I personally don&#x27;t believe the white stuff coming off are my dead skin.</li>
            <li> Serioulsy, after the second try (in which I massaged longer), when I rinsed the second time, I was literally lighter (which that is not what i am trying to do), because the gel removed all the dead skin</li>
            <li> The  white residue are actual dead skin rubbing off.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see these tiny white or fleshtone balls appear, which is supposed to be a combination of your dead skin and the product itself that have been removed from your face.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it&#x27;s promises.  </li>
            <li> How come i never new about it before??</li>
            <li> Applied it, let it sit then rubbed and barely obtained a little bit of grit.</li>
            <li> and I have not had a single pimple since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after one single use.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice a single change in my skin appearance after using this product.</li>
            <li> I exfoliate with this every single day, sometimes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I used to use exfoliators which contained &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34; microbeads or other little scrubbers which left my skin red and raw (though soft as well).</li>
            <li> dries fast - must rub - not good</li>
            <li> the past I have used glycolic peels to keep my skin clear, with lots of burning and discomfort.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an gentle exfoliant for people who just want to add to their regular routine...for someone who suffers from adult acne, something stronger is recommended...</li>
            <li> This does not work and is an extreme waste of money - it&#x27;s not dead skin coming off - it&#x27;s whatever is in the gel...</li>
            <li> Put this on my face and my dark marks got instantly darker</li>
            <li> I placed it on glass and it still developed the small particles without any skin contact.</li>
            <li> It also reads in small text &#x27;natural aqua gel&#x27;, which makes no sense.</li>
            <li> My hands are much smoother, but after two applications, I can see that I will need to use this at least every other day for a while.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately,I really don&#x27;t know if it because of my skin is &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t have lots of dead skin cells, but whenever I applied this to my face, the dead cells didn&#x27;t appear much as I expected to see it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and thought this product is going to be alright, but it got my skin&#x27;s condition worse and more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I need to exfoliate regularly or my skin literally gets this rough waxy coating that is a mixture of dead skin cells and oil (gross!)</li>
            <li> should have figured it was only going to be down hill from there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to continue to buy Cure and toss outmy other face scrubs!</li>
            <li> But the product lasts a  long time, so maybe!!</li>
            <li> Then, I tried other exfoliating fgels and creams only to find that they were ineffective at removing dead skin, only to dry out my face without exfoliating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my fourth bottle and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> we are aging, our system will slow down inproducing new cells but regular exfoliation will stimulate this reproduction process</li>
            <li> Like a previous pimple that dried up really well from my acne cream, this gel did not magically get that big dry crusty patch off.</li>
            <li> do also agree with other reviewers that not all of the white gunk is actual dead skin, but is in fact a polymer.</li>
            <li> Spending this much money made me feel pretty bad about myself.</li>
            <li> it is the product that is flaking off your skin, that is why you have to put in on dry!</li>
            <li> So I immediately repeated and came away with a lot less \\&quot;crud\\&quot; the second time around.  </li>
            <li> But after 30 seconds of rubbing (which you can gently), these small clumps of dead skin started to form.</li>
            <li> Its a slightly smoky white liquid and odorless.</li>
            <li> Problem is I sent samples to friends  in tiny Ziploc baggies thru the mail, and used half the bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin looked brighter and glowing...and not particularly lighter if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> No more scrubbing and damaging the skin with abrasive exfoliants, this does the job that even the most expensive once can not.</li>
            <li> Skin is left brighter, softer, and with less visible pores.  </li>
            <li> Skin is left brighter, softer, and with less visible pores.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin was rough and dry with months of negligence.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed very simple and weird looking</li>
            <li> I could see all of these rough patches that weren&#x27;t necessarily dry</li>
            <li> until it&#x27;s dry, then lightly wet my fingers and rub my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for two days and its already clearing up half of my acne and making my scars fade away.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday with vitamin C serum and my dark spots have been going away and my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> However either way wet no bead and dry with beads</li>
            <li> and this seemed like a comparable option that cost a tiny bit less.</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;re massaging you&#x27;ll start to feel some tiny bits and those are tiny bits of dead skin!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got a glow to last you half the day.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it my skin did feel raw a little bit with slight redness.  </li>
            <li> Yes there is an ingrediant that causes the gel to pill up and &#x27;look&#x27; like dead skin,  but these little &#x27;gel balls&#x27; are the exact things that attach to the dead skin and remove them from your face.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my husband, who has very sensitive skin, and he didn&#x27;t break out or have any negative reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down in that it&#x27;s not very viscous.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the small white beads it forms are really exfoliated skin, but my skin has finally calmed down and my dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> I was having an issue with my skin this fall/winter where it was very dry</li>
            <li> As a person with very dry skin, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> I went on vacation to the Caribbean and my skin was very dry and tanning.</li>
            <li> I just got my Cure Natural Aqua Gel last week and the first use was not too bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always take it all off, and it takes a few days to get rid of extra dry patches.</li>
            <li> AHA peels and serums too harsh but this is a long-term-use solution with far less redness and recovery time.</li>
            <li> Sugar scrub works enough but everyday I had to use it to remove and ended up having a dry skin....</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first since I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin and figured I could just use store brands (Aveeno) to wash my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m positive that this takes off at least a portion of a person&#x27;s dead skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on the back of my hands (where the skin has seemed to become extra dry and wrinkly lately) and on my neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive, at least for me, that those little white clumps are my dead skin-</li>
            <li> It works by rolling up into little balls and using those balls to very gently physically exfoliate.</li>
            <li> have gone from $400 face creams to using this, followed by cold-pressed extra virgin coconut oil (NO JOKE) and a little Chanel eye cream at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> .. use only a little.</li>
            <li> The box was a little dent, but the actual product was find.</li>
            <li> Because all I see are white little beads coming off.</li>
            <li> I have had these pesky white little bumps on my chin for forever, I&#x27;ve tried nose strips/exfoliating/peels/serums nothing worked</li>
            <li> I do not believe the little white specks are my skin, I think it is the mixture forming them.  </li>
            <li> , The bottle I purchased in Little Tokyo had English instructions and list of ingredients and it recommended using the product within 6 months of opening.</li>
            <li> I think my skln looked a little different.</li>
            <li> (if those little white things came out skin that it claims to be)</li>
            <li> And the suspicious thing was that even if I put the gel on my face three times in a row, those little white micro-beads still come out.</li>
            <li> Also, the product is a little bit pricey for my liking, but I&#x27;m too hooked to not buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> and i can see the white little balls forming.</li>
            <li> and after I rinsed it did sting a little, but nothing that would discourage me from further use.</li>
            <li> and after I rinsed it did sting a little, but nothing that would discourage me from further use.</li>
            <li> Soon you&#x27;ll start to see little beads of white....</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with my skin which never felt clean and clear.</li>
            <li> secondly, if the white things that come off are actually dead skin, my face would be red or at least dry, instead there is no change whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It has taken care of some dry spots I have had for years that other exfoliators did</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, you must use the Cure product on dry skin to feel any effect at all.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other day in the morning after cleaning and patting my face dry.</li>
            <li> When I applied it on my face, slowly and gently massaging it, I felt a bunch of little balls coming off.</li>
            <li> My neck acne has always been hard to treat because  the skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li> :) Was skeptical and wanted to test whether the little &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; that roll up while using the product were actually dead skin or not.</li>
            <li> Your dead skin starts to come off in little white flakes and your face instantly starts to feel a lot smoother.</li>
            <li> The harsh of the weather plus the products I was using created a dull dry uneven  full of blackhead mess.</li>
            <li> They gained popularity because they are less abrasive than walnut shells and other similar exfoliators.</li>
            <li> Because it is watery, you lose extra down your arm, plus since very little skin is removed with one use, I&#x27;ve found I need to apply over and over to get the same effect as Sakura Silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And knowing that there isn&#x27;t any bad chemicals makes it that much better.</li>
            <li> I like it, HOWEVER maybe i.got a bad bottle because its more liquidy then gel like.</li>
            <li> , my ONLY complaint is that the directions are NOT in English (which makes sense considering where its from)</li>
            <li> BUT you must exfoliate the damaged layer of skin after microneedling (wait at least 2-3 days, as skin is sensitive).</li>
            <li> The actual surface of my skin is at least 80% smoother than it was earlier today.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfoliation has been challenging and expensive for me lately.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it, and am pretty much disappointed having spent this much on it.</li>
            <li> Because some negative reviewers think it is not dead skin cells but just something in the gel itself, I applied some to a pesticide-free, wax-free, home grown lemon.  </li>
            <li> After a minute, rub it until you the tiny grit of the dead skin cells on your fingers.</li>
            <li> i properly cleaned my face, pat dried it and then applied the Cure gel.</li>
            <li> I used to use ones like St Ives apricot scrub, but over time, I realized it was too rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> - my skin in those areas feels so much younger, just after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I generously pump product onto my fingertips, smear all over my face, and wait for 30 sec to 1 min.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll know its money well spent.</li>
            <li> Instead, when I used the leftover gel from this 3rd pass attempt on my forearm, well, the dead epidermis started to ball/flake.    </li>
            <li> This gel doesn&#x27;t work at all if you try to apply it to a wet face.  </li>
            <li> This caused zero irritation for me although i did find the alcohol smell to be alarming.</li>
            <li> it works the same exfoliating dead skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was gross how much dead skin came off.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order it, if something can exfoliate your skin in minutes instead of scrubbing with  harsh mico creams &amp; micro cloths &amp; getting red</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a gimmick because I know what dead skin looks like coming off</li>
            <li> Just 2 minutes passed and my face was left with dead skin...</li>
            <li> you can visually see the dead skin cells coming off from your skin    </li>
            <li> I pumped twice and applied it on my elbow which I know has a big concentration of dead cells.</li>
            <li> but then when I see the dead skin or whatever you call that coming out from my face, I suddenly felt refreshed.</li>
            <li> Third round</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews state that the white particles that you see is &#x27;dead skin cell&#x27;, but</li>
            <li> No real visible changes yet,</li>
            <li> I think it is partially this stuff, but it may also be that (pro-tip) I don&#x27;t wash my face every morning with a cleanser anymore.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel dead skin coming off with use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s actually exfoliating my dead skin.......</li>
            <li> If my face is feeling particularly rough, I&#x27;ll give it</li>
            <li> Not really.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really harsh on facial skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m convinced Cure is actually exfoliating all that dead skin</li>
            <li> I actually did it twice in a row and watched all the dead skin come off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never really know unless I travel to Japan and buy this product in person.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never really know unless I travel to Japan and buy this product in person.  </li>
            <li> Received it earlier than promised though the invoice was missing in the box.</li>
            <li> have wondered whether the gel was just reacting with my skin to create the eraser bits or if its ACTUALLY removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> minus the pooh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but alas, it did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I thought this product would actually help take off dead skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and see absolutely no difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I often use a boar hair brush to brush off the dead skin in the shower before actually showering.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t totally buying that the clumps forming were dead skin as I had read or heard.  </li>
            <li> The white bits that form when you use this exfoliator is a combination of the product itself and your dead skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not actually removing dead skin at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is possible that the product does somewhat ball up as it removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> cause me a lot of trouble, especially on my face.</li>
            <li> You can literally see all the dead skin cells roll up into white bits on your face as you massage</li>
            <li> It does take off my dead skin cells and is left on your surface to wash off.  </li>
            <li> You instantly see the dead skins come off.</li>
            <li> I only had to pay a few dollars shipping.</li>
            <li> , so I believe these white balls are actually dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> It also did make my face look cleaner and brighter looking, and yes, they are your dead skin cells coming off, not the actual product balling up.</li>
            <li> Dead skin and oil do not cause acne, bacteria that gets mixed in with it causes acne.</li>
            <li> The product I received has absolutely no fragrance or odor (alcohol or otherwise) and there is no alcohol listed in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It picked up a lot of my dead skin, especially around the nose.  </li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews of your skin almost dissolving onto your fingertips and of course became curious about this product.</li>
            <li> The results are not as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just curious as to what is in this stuff?  </li>
            <li> and I was too curious to wait.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s minus one star for the smell</li>
            <li> Never again will I use an unnatural rough scrub like St. Ives or anything else.</li>
            <li> and I remove with a wet cloth.</li>
            <li> And since you only have to use it every few weeks the bottle lasts you quite a while.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t think this product actually remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> You have to let it sit on your face to react with the skin for 20 sec.</li>
            <li> My routine was to exfoliate with a drug store brand facial exfolaitor a few days after using the device.</li>
            <li> Not much of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t understand how when I was using it and putting it on my finger to place on my face that the actual dead skin cells that I could SEE were not coming off when i used that finger to rub this product on my face.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to overuse, tho.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much dead skin I had on my face even though I use my Clarisonic daily!  </li>
            <li> because I know the feeling, I am addicted to exfoliating my skin haha).</li>
            <li> A few different moisturizers including Neutrogena oil-free with SPF 35.</li>
            <li> I used as a cleanser with my face wet</li>
            <li> (keep in mind this won&#x27;t cure acne, its not really meant to either),</li>
            <li> This exfoliator only removes dead skin, it does not cause peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t think you have dead skin, you will find white skin cells beading up when you use this product!</li>
            <li> and it ends up not really doing anything.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you that it&#x27;s definitely your dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> I have used similar product from Orogold which it a gel formula that removes the dead skin from my face</li>
            <li> I put it on my skin and then begin to rub it off after about 20-30 sec.</li>
            <li> I know there is definitely doubts about it working and whether it&#x27;s the product that balls up as oppose to the dead skin it promises.</li>
            <li> This gel works only on dead skin and has causes no reaction to living skin.  </li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> exfoliates gently leaving no irration or redness behind.</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering this.</li>
            <li> I use Cure basically everyday in the morning after doing my basic face routine and even after washing my face</li>
            <li> You do actually see your dead skin rub off (</li>
            <li> Yes, it does require multiple applications to remove all the dead build-up.</li>
            <li> not really an exfoliator ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s essentially a \\&quot;peeling gel\\&quot;, but don&#x27;t let that deter you from buying the product because that label sounds harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes all sorts of white balls of dead skin forms during the massage</li>
            <li> you actually see the dead skin coming off</li>
            <li> But if you just use it for your face and neck a few times a week, a bottle should last over 3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> She has never been able to use an exfoliant because it&#x27;s too irritating and makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is kind of annoying to pull off pieces afterwards, but that happens with the designer equivalent as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to tell on your face, but if you try rubbing the inside of your wrist with some of the excess white fluid that ends up running down your hands, you&#x27;ll see small grayish rolls of skin coming off.</li>
            <li> The dry patches were peeled off and started bleeding(!!)</li>
            <li> I followed the directions from other consumers and the product never produced the little white balls.  </li>
            <li> and I use a small amount on my entire face (a dry face).  </li>
            <li> There is alcohol in this, which when it evaporates (quickly), leaves behind a dense, gooey substance that can be rolled into small balls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing because it is massively watered down (see previous con).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone to at least give it a try!</li>
            <li> So now whatever other products you use can actually do what they need to do to your living skin cells, instead of trying to resurrect the dead ones.</li>
            <li> It literally removes dead skin in a way that&#x27;s different from any other exfoliant I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used gel exfoliators before from a korean line that worked wonders, but this one was a complete failure.</li>
            <li> Try using the product several times in a row - alleged &amp;#34;skin cells&amp;#34; form every time, meaning the eventually you should be rubbing raw skin...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for my bad English, Spanish is my first language.</li>
            <li> Two things have been happening to my skin over the past few years, one is that I get these white bumps that will not go away and secondly after getting a mirror that magnify&#x27;s by 15 times I have noticed blackheads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> This DOES not work as far as clearing up acne marks on dark skin, and actually made things worse.</li>
            <li> the product will run down my fingers before i even apply it on my face with a single pump.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the skin on your face and hands would be red and raw as this would be over-exfoliation from the size and amount of these particles.  </li>
            <li> so I washed my arm, let it dry and put another pump of gel on my forearm, this time it has much less residue as I massage it.</li>
            <li> Had minor - moderate acne as teenager, started getting cystic acne in late 20s.  </li>
            <li> also used it on my face where I had less of a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My acne is stupidly ridiculous and I needed something to exfoliate my face that won&#x27;t tear my sensitive skin off.  </li>
            <li> Few seconds after massaging the gel on my face all the dry, dead skin started to form tiny residue</li>
            <li> And you only use a little so the bottle lasts!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and pump 2 servings onto my face and it isn&#x27;t leaving it raw or &#x27;too exfoliated&#x27; as other users have stated.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and from my experience of an exhausting amount of exfoliators, I must say I</li>
            <li> After a few regular applications, my slight acne and reddish bumps are gone.  </li>
            <li> Second evening, still dead skin but less.  </li>
            <li> After rubbing a bit o my face it drips like crazy between my fingers and down my arms and most of what i put in my hands for my face gets trapped in between my fingers as it seeps down</li>
            <li> worth the money, get something less expensive without the skin-drying alcohol.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to waste product, you should definitely do one pump at a time or half a pump and apply to one section of your face.</li>
            <li> Exfoliators, as you probably know, work typically work in one of two ways: by chemically loosening dead skin cells with an alpha hydroxy acid or similar chemical.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re religious with your skin care, don&#x27;t think that this will somehow find hidden dead skin you couldn&#x27;t reach with your pore scrubber.</li>
            <li> However, afterwards, my skin felt SO tight and dry, even after I had put moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> Does not leave my face dry or tight.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It recommends using it twice a week but with the other masks and scrubs, I limit it to once a week.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I got the wrong product.</li>
            <li> In other words, I&#x27;m no stranger to what exfoliation feels like.    </li>
            <li> Usually I have to wait months for it to go away, or I use deep exfoliation on it and it gets irritated and sticks around longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that &amp;#34;ball</li>
            <li> I saw this product while looking at other product reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li> and I will not use any other exfoliator unless this product becomes ineffective overtime.</li>
            <li> Rotating every other day.</li>
            <li> You could literally exfoliate other parts of the body too if desired, but I have not tried that.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO complaints here!</li>
            <li> Agree with other posts, the piling is NOT exfoliate skin but the product itself.</li>
            <li> Product seems like what other reviewers described.</li>
            <li> You can burn your skin with this product if you&#x27;re using other products that exfoliate your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see where water or any other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;  ingredients in it will cause your skin to slough off.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because I thought it was just the product</li>
            <li> Pat your face and neck continuously with product on your hands and suddenly you can feel dead skin just sloughing off!  </li>
            <li> I also used it on my feet (it was a long winter in NH and my feet were a wreck) and it took off tons of dead skin.</li>
            <li> so I use other face wash for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use every other day.</li>
            <li> I still try out other peeling gels just so I can compare</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other exfoliant</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m due soon.</li>
            <li> not sure what the grainy stuff that is left on my face is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;$30 is a bargain for the size of the bottle, and a little goes a long way to get desired results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not interested in skin care or beauty supplies.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night and my wrinkles are diminishing.  </li>
            <li> Works like other reviews say it does.</li>
            <li> However, this product is not exactly a miracle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought and used this since about five months ago if that provides any other additional information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I probably will not repurchase due to the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every 2-3 days for the past month in conjunction with a daily moisturizer and BP acne wash</li>
            <li> Works extremely well</li>
            <li> Not sure yet cause I just start using it only 1week now.</li>
            <li> and I use that every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely please with this product</li>
            <li> every other night on my face.</li>
            <li> I now use it every other day.</li>
            <li> It blows every other exfoliator out of the water.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, after receiving Cure, I decided to try it instead of the other exfoliator on my decollete and breasts.</li>
            <li> There are other peeling gels out there</li>
            <li> but after using it for several months I&#x27;m not actually sure it does anything for my face.</li>
            <li> This exfoliater actually left small chemical burns on each of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the items within it since it&#x27;s in Japanese..</li>
            <li> keeping it clean, fresh and breath is something not too hard, complicated or expensive to do.</li>
            <li> like you can have with other  Exfoliaters.  </li>
            <li> This was a pretty expensive purchase for me</li>
            <li> so I decided to research other exfoliators that act like this one.</li>
            <li> The texture of it is very similar to water, so I had to repeatedly use a small amount and immediately apply to my skin.</li>
            <li> but I went to the questions and answer section, and other customers explained.  </li>
            <li> and I was hesitant and skeptical when I first tried it because if you have experience with exfoliators you know that sometimes its just the product building up on your skin</li>
            <li> Also, it might be pretty expensive</li>
            <li> I have other favorites and so I rotate between them.&lt;br /&gt;This  </li>
            <li> (Some products like this claim that the “balls” are actually the dead skin cells but that’s not true.)</li>
            <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t need extreme exfoliation, I can see this working miracles.</li>
            <li> I use it ever other day now after I shower.</li>
            <li> but when I apply the product to other surface it does do that.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation or dryness as with other exfoliating products.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference between skin and other things.</li>
            <li> Other users have posted comments saying particles that result are skin being exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> Do you mean to tell me that when I use this product, all of the sudden my dead skin turns white?</li>
            <li> I voted it down because I&#x27;ve used other products half the price of Cure that removed dry skin</li>
            <li> Yes, you CAN actually see and feel the dead skin sloughing off into little &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.....</li>
            <li> Third evening, just a little bit of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> You will start seeing white little balls forming on your skin -&gt; dead skin cells being exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> You will feel and see little white balls, which is the dead skin dulling the complexion.</li>
            <li> It was gentle on my skin yet tough at removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> and I had tough times trying to get it off my face because the peeds stuck on my tiny facial hair.</li>
            <li> You need to be very careful using this product.</li>
            <li> Also, you get at least twice the amount of product for roughly the same price compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> and I still had my dry patches of dead skin.</li>
            <li> which is probably why people think it actually takes off the dead skin, but in reality it&#x27;s either the residue from the ingredients or it just dried the skin out.</li>
            <li> is getting smoother and less rough.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and get all the dead skin cells off.</li>
            <li> Use a DRY cloth to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; off accumulated dead skin balls.  </li>
            <li> The results will be your dead skin pilling up in white round ball.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the active ingredients are and I have never used a product like this.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction to any of the active</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin, doesnt dry it out, and is odorless.</li>
            <li> A few times a week I put it on my dry, cleansed skin.</li>
            <li> You just apply on skin after cleansing (but be careful for the skin not to be wet) and wait a few minutes.</li>
            <li> After years of dried skin issues I had to use this four times in a row before the dried skin stopped forming into clumps that could be brushed off.</li>
            <li> All of the dry, flaky, dead skin was gone.</li>
            <li> this product imitates dead skin but does not remove dead skin you can use it on you face 10 times a day with the same results</li>
            <li> use it probably on average every other day.</li>
            <li> - I suspected something was wrong when Cure Natural Agua Gel &amp;#34;produced&amp;#34; pearly white beads...over my dark Ebony complexion instead of &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; beads.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money... no better than plain water.</li>
            <li> not sure what other claims since i havent been using it that long.</li>
            <li> removes every single dead skin cell and dirt while leaving behind skin&#x27;s natural moisture.</li>
            <li> Less redness and irritation that other cleansers have caused.</li>
            <li> I hardly get redness, but when the blemish begins to surface then it get slightly red.</li>
            <li> You get these little white balls of dead skin!</li>
            <li> was not very much more than I was paying for a tiny 50ml tube, and a little goes</li>
            <li> and I have a hard time finding exfoliants, both physical and chemical</li>
            <li> so at first I was a little bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend to others, including those who have sensitivity and redness issues, as this does not aggravate the condition, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Maybe like 2-3 tiny things that were hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I became disappointed until I saw the little balls between my fingers appearing without me even touching there -</li>
            <li> On my 3rd time during the week, very little dead skin cells came off, so it was just wasting the product.  </li>
            <li> They sold me a fake one, it wasn&#x27;t real soap, it was like hand sanitizer .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark elbow .. and started using it for 10 days in combination with a whitening cream..</li>
            <li> Not worth trying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> i have to use at least 2-3 pumps to get enough amount to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen exfoliators from different countries (that includes U.S, Japan and Korea)</li>
            <li> I thought there would be no way that a clear and thin liquid would exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> Nah not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> the only complaint I have is that it takes 2 1/2 weeks for the order to arrive as it does come from japan......</li>
            <li> small balls of dead skin came off and revealed smoother, younger and glowing skin.  </li>
            <li> I use an exfoliating cloth every day and did not expect much of a change,,I was wrong..  </li>
            <li> There are no instructions at all, at least none in English.</li>
            <li> It’s a over-hyped product and so not worth the price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s NOT worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> thing I dont like about Cure is that both face and hands must be completely dry for it to work, but it is so runny after applying that it makes a mess if not used in the shower, where it&#x27;s hard to have completely dry face and hands...</li>
            <li> Also, I went tanning 3 days after using it and my face was red and irritated in the spots where I would apply the gel for at least a day.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it</li>
            <li> Between this and the clay mask I&#x27;ve even seen some lightening of dark spots (acne scars) on my face as well.</li>
            <li> I always had dark areas (around my mouth and nose).</li>
            <li> I also have like 3 dark acne scars.</li>
            <li> but lately i noticed that my skin was feeling thick, coarse and that just cleaning it was not enough.</li>
            <li> Hate that I can&#x27;t read the instructions, LOvE thyou product.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no idea if this beading is dead skin.</li>
            <li> but it does not clean out my pores so I am using walnut complexion scrub from Ole Henriksen the other days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hitting my 30&#x27;s, my skin has gone down hill.</li>
            <li> Another really annoying detail about these particular breakout were that although it was mainly scar tissue, I still felt the bump from the clogged pore underneath</li>
            <li> Consistency was like watered down jello.  </li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> and thats becuase its a watered down version.</li>
            <li> I eventually couldn&#x27;t stand the feeling of all the shedded skin on my face and hands anymore, so I leaned down to the sink and washed up.</li>
            <li> i also like how they give a thing that if you were to press down on the pump it won&#x27;t go down</li>
            <li> So watery that it runs down your hand and arm while you&#x27;re attempting to rub it on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is watered down.</li>
            <li> I dropped down to once a week</li>
            <li> hands down.</li>
            <li> But hell now I&#x27;ll be spending $30 on foreign skincare the rest of my life, this product is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;ve thrown out every other exfoliating product I had!</li>
            <li> Maybe this is TMI, but for any ladies looking improve other areas in addition to the face, this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I had a small patch of dry skin that I always get in the winter.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too thin, it will dry before you can really rub a lot of the skin off, and if it&#x27;s too thick, it&#x27;ll waste product and be quite messy.</li>
            <li> I first used this product I was completely shocked, as I scrubbed my face, I actually felt the places where dead skin cell build-up accumulated.</li>
            <li> Removes dead skin like none other.</li>
            <li> then I should, sometimes everyday, or every other day</li>
            <li> difference between cure and other exfoliating methods is that cure react with already dead skin.</li>
            <li> very helpful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to order this given the occasional bad review saying it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cure for less than a week</li>
            <li> there is a slight alcohol scent..</li>
            <li> When I placed the order, the estimate arrival date was between a month- a month and a half.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a slight improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> for this I use half Apple cider vinegar and half water because i don&#x27;t like the idea of rubbing any alcohol product on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a slight shade of the scar, but I have to get close to the mirror to see it.  </li>
            <li> Made my face only a bit angry (will do once a month maybe) but there were no lasting horrors once rinsed and</li>
            <li> You just take a small amount and rub on a dry face and BAM!</li>
            <li> I got my package on a Tuesday after ordering it the previous Saturday.</li>
            <li> After using this every 2-3 days (recommended is twice/week, FYI) for a week and a half, my skin feels smoother than I ever remember it feeling...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 2014, seriously, why can&#x27;t we have English instructions and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> My friends and I had seen this in a previous store and read how it was sold every 20 seconds in Japan.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin had less breakouts</li>
            <li> Which I love because I hate wearing heavy face makeup in humid, steamy, Houston summerweather.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews of this product, I was excited to purchase it but am extremely disappointed in it now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the bottle does not have instructions in English, just Japanese.  </li>
            <li> I am a black woman with problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Although I still applied my typical moisturizer, my skin did not feel like it even needed it.</li>
            <li> I did put some on my lips which were flaky and slightly chapped</li>
            <li> thing, this is a slightly milky gel with no scent - no alcohol smell at all.</li>
            <li> And for half the price as well.</li>
            <li> After one use my skin was tighter and less spotty.</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week as it is serious exfoliation.</li>
            <li> cuz there&#x27;s less than that</li>
            <li> HOLY COW!  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews of this product and watching videos on YouTube, I was excited to purchase it but am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I even rubbed it on my husband&#x27;s back, which was in serious need of an exfoliation, and I couldn&#x27;t tell a thing had been done.</li>
            <li> (like do the bottom half of your face and then your forehead).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m breaking out a lot less often</li>
            <li> What I do after using this product is to rinse my face with slightly cols water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is when I found the cure on Amazon and decided I needed to buy it after reading about half of the 800 reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again as soon as its half gone.</li>
            <li> Previously a plastic piece clipped onto the neck of the sprayer to keep the pusher from releasing the lotion.</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates like no other product I&#x27;ve used and it does so without irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> Thank god for Amazon or it&#x27;d be impossible to get such high quality beauty items here.</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard.....</li>
            <li> and I have hardly made a dent in the bottle it lasts a long time</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding something that doesn&#x27;t over-dry me or make me feel greasy in the long run.</li>
            <li> I figured it was just because it was dry due to all the heater action I&#x27;ve been having to endure this cold winter.</li>
            <li> Considering that you get 250ml for a mere $36, this, hands down, is my new go-to bottle.    </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> After my disappointment I did some research about it online to figure out exactly HOW water was supposed to be used as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, but at least it&#x27;s boring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I think the &amp;#34;Skin peeling off&amp;#34; thing is a gimmick because i tried putting it on a plastic surface and mess around with it a bit</li>
            <li> I used this on my skin and soo much of my dead skin cells rubbed off, it was disgusting and satisfying at the same time.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not true in my experience.</li>
            <li> Then this morning I had a little, but much less than yesterday.  </li>
            <li> I did notice the little skin balls lightening up and less in amount with each use, but</li>
            <li> It takes about a minute or a little less to turn milky</li>
            <li> Less dead skin cells means less stuff clogging pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to apply it in the shower, where the dead skin, dirt and oil can wash away down the drain.</li>
            <li> but you start massaging and all dead skin falls down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now down to a few breakouts instead of</li>
            <li> Because of this, I very rarely can exfoliate because any other store-bought exfoliator makes my skin burn and irritates the crap out of everything.</li>
            <li> Cure does not make my skin feel tight or</li>
            <li> does not leave my skin tight.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is god for the delicate facial skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely less dead skin cells upon using this and</li>
            <li> My legs were smoother than when I use sugar scrubs, plus this product is way less messy.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating helps minimize acne, as there is less dead skin clogging up your pores.</li>
            <li> and a small amount does go a long way, jus do a small area at a time.</li>
            <li> My face always felt rough, even though I have tried to exfoliate with other facial scrubs--it has a very unhealthy texture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is doing what the other review say</li>
            <li> I did a little test that I saw another reviewer had done.  </li>
            <li> it massage some dark residue!</li>
            <li> , it balled up into little bits that were meant to be your skin coming off.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s drying or when you rub it around it causes those little balls...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to let it sit on your face till it gets milky to use it and get the little skin rice things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> So I tried this stuff again - tons of little beads, but still my skin was flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 2 months now and it has lighten my hyperpigmentation and lessen the amount of little bumps I get on my face.</li>
            <li> I am thinking that it ends up being the little glue balls end up exfoliating your skin</li>
            <li> tell you a little story.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was made in Singapore, but they had a US distributor, and at $20 for a 2 oz tube, it was a little pricey, but I gave it a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, now that I am 30, I do notice my skim in a little dryer.</li>
            <li> its just the product that forms little balls when rubbed</li>
            <li> Dead/dry skin will look like little white/nude mushy beads.  </li>
            <li> Dead/dry skin will look like little white/nude mushy beads.  </li>
            <li> It felt a little ruff to me.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> Essentially this stuff is a weak chemical peal.</li>
            <li> used already 3 times and whatever little balls is forming....</li>
            <li> Thought the little balls might be the gel drying...</li>
            <li> a couple days after I use it I break out a little and get congested pores.</li>
            <li> It came with two little samples.</li>
            <li> You can easily do a little experiment:</li>
            <li> Mix a little olive oil and sugar and use to exfoliate face and body.</li>
            <li> Mix a little olive oil and sugar and use to exfoliate face and body.</li>
            <li> a little</li>
            <li> people will try to tell you the little balls of stuff are not skin</li>
            <li> The little balls that come off</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s working when you feel little balls forming</li>
            <li> I found this miracle skin care product in Little Tokyo in California</li>
            <li> As I rub, it starts to ball up into greyish little balls of &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin feel a little bit smoother.</li>
            <li> Too little product does not work well, so don&#x27;t be stingy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It freaks me out a little but does the trick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten these pesky blackheads and little bumps all over.</li>
            <li> bottle comes with a little plastic part that prevents the bottle from accidentally squeezing out content.</li>
            <li> it is just try washing your face a couple of times and see the reduction of little skin balls appearing until it eventually stops.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts me a little over two months, but I just don&#x27;t apply it to my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new exfoliator, as my dermatologist told me that the one I&#x27;m currently using is really bad for my skin.    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical prior to ordering, but once i tried this product on my severely dry lips, I became a convert.</li>
            <li> I should start off by saying that my skin has been so dry and uncomfortably flakey--like big, noticeable flakes of dead skin on my face despite using my softener and lotion.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a lot of dramatic eraser shavings to come flying off my face, but I barely got anything at all.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little dull and the texture is not really even.</li>
            <li> I know that dead skin cells are one of the factor that makes one&#x27;s facial skin sag down due to the gravity, it happens to every area on your face, especially your eyes, and they block your skin from breathing oxygen, makes your skin weak or unable to absorb nutrion from skincare application.</li>
            <li> A few little clumps formed, and I realized it was exfoliating the skin from my finger tip.</li>
            <li> So the little balls are your dead skin cells, not the gel clumping by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once it touches your face and you massage it into your skin, the dead skin begins to flake off into little balls.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t feel beads or anything in it, after 1 minute of rubbing it in you Can feel the little balls of dead skin</li>
            <li> My husband, who is caucasian, has a tendency to have ingrown hairs when he shaves, and this seems to help a little by removing the dead skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I rubbed it on my face and those little balls of oil &amp; dead skin cells started forming, I knew this was the stuff.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel little balls of oil &amp; dead skin forming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This gel soaks up all the impurities and as your rub, forms little clumps of dead skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was nothing happen like it did on my face, so that means the little balls came off on my face were dead skin, probably.</li>
            <li> Once the alcohol (yes, alcohol which dries skin) evaporates or dries, it forms the little globs that you think is dead skin being exfoliated.</li>
            <li> little balls of dead skin start to appear.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is a little tricky to work with if you immediately pump a few pumps of the product into your fingers.</li>
            <li> Yeah, you will see the little beads of dead skin (supposedly) form.  </li>
            <li> The little balls are NOT YOUR DEAD SKIN CELLS.</li>
            <li> the dead skin just rolls up into little balls and there is no abrasion at all.  </li>
            <li> The little &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; are definitely dead skin--all you have to do is rub the gel on another part of your body</li>
            <li> You can see the dead skin clumping up into little balls and then you just rinse them away.</li>
            <li> Because our skin has a tough time shedding the dead skin, so if you&#x27;ve got a layer of dead skin mixed in with oil and dirt, your pores will get clogged.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as expensive as the products that you&#x27;d find at beauty stores here since you are getting a huge bottle of product for $34, whereas you could get a mere few ounces for that price.</li>
            <li> Cure Aqua Gel works, it is crazy how much skin I get with each use.</li>
            <li> I have had some serious issues with my dry sking through this Minnesota winter.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;white balls&amp;#34; that form are definitely dead skin because the gel is not goopy (it&#x27;s rather liquidy) and it does not congeal.</li>
            <li> No mixing or brushes to buy....just pump out and rub in circular motion and wash off the dead skin balls.  </li>
            <li> but it does get rid of the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> and this gets all of the dead skin off</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just making my skin tone look uneven.</li>
            <li> After switching from Proactiv face wash to bio sulfur soap, I needed something to slough away the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> When I use it once per week, a lot of dead skin cells come off.</li>
            <li> I never thought it was going to work but holy moly, there were dead skin cells everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and it can be messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an exfoliant, so don&#x27;t use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I apply this to my face and wait around 10 seconds to let the product reacts to the dead cells, then I massage my face, let it sit for 3minutes and wash it away.</li>
            <li> It polishes the dead skin away.  </li>
            <li> Gets dead skin off without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> Its not cheap but after trying it</li>
            <li> It would produce these \\&quot;strands\\&quot; of dead epidermis.  </li>
            <li> each time I apply this \\&quot;CURE\\&quot; gel, I squirt 4 pumps into my hands, and cover my face with it, and it appears to take off somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 of (the dead stratum corneum layer of)</li>

            <li> It is the product and some dead skin.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>

            <li> harsh at all.</li>
            <li> It does not have any scent, and feels just like water but removes dead skins without hurting my skin.  </li>
            <li> and you just rub it on your face and dead skin comes off.</li>
            <li> On myself and on a friend, we had areas that could not be scrubbed or rubbed, but this product managed to painlessly remove dead skin from the area</li>
            <li> My hands and face have never been softer; who knew there was so much dead skin on either?</li>

            <li> I saw lots of dead skin being sloughed off.</li>
            <li> dried.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> it says in the bottle to leave the product for few min then scrub it out, emmm</li>
            <li> Then for those who think the exfoliation is to harsh...</li>
            <li> again it&#x27;s suppose to get rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> It seems harsh</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t know if the beads that form are really dead skin cells</li>
            <li> I started to use it on my feet so not to waste it.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> and it removed a TON of dead skin that had been built up on my face for ages.</li>
            <li> but I still had flakiness in the morning, and that&#x27;s even after applying a moisture serum and heavy firming cream.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> I find it a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They let you believe that it gets rid of dead skin cells, but it&#x27;s just a chemical reaction...</li>
            <li> Just a waste of money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement in the quality of my skin after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too abrasive for everyday use.</li>

            <li> It literally takes off all your dead skin without irritation.</li>
            <li> I could feel the dead skin rolling off my face as I was massaging this product in.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has used an exfoliating glove or had a massage at a Korean Spa knows what rolls of dead skin look like.</li>
            <li> It is messy to use, and I will do the lower portion of my face, rinse, and do another area.</li>
            <li> We were all surprise of all the dead cells we had.</li>
            <li> Gets all off the dead junk off of your skin.</li>
            <li> do not buy this is a waste of money it did nothing for my face</li>
            <li> The dead skin pills up -  </li>
            <li> If you are looking to rid yourself of dead skin cells this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> I use to use the clarisonic mia everyday, a wash cloth at night to remove make up, plus peter thomas Roth aha/bha clearing gel.</li>
            <li> You leave it on for a few minutes</li>
            <li> ---it didn&#x27;t even remove the uneven spots from the spray tanning that start to show 3 or 4 days post spray tanning.  </li>
            <li> you can see the dead skin coming off of your face</li>
            <li> dead skin just rolls off.</li>
            <li> And I was too embarrassed to take pictures of the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I guess because all of the dead skin wasn&#x27;t covering mu Sort of like how you can change the brightness of your cell phone</li>
            <li> You immediately feel the dead skin begin to ball up and drop off under your fingertips.</li>
            <li> It does not remove dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Use the gel, rub it in, keep rubbing and your dead skin falls away.</li>
            <li> dont waste you rmoney.  </li>
            <li> then you know your dead skin is in there.</li>
            <li> This product also helps loosen the dead skin</li>
            <li> I know it truly works because I used it on a healing cut that had some visible dead skin on the sides of it</li>
            <li> Too harsh.</li>
            <li> It does remove the dead skin cells from my face.</li>
            <li> but since I started using Cure, I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen everyday without an issue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money people.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> After using this a few times I found a noticeable difference in the appearance of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> The&amp;#34;peeling result&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really dried skin.</li>
            <li> A few seconds of massaging the product, there are already &#x27;dead skin cells&#x27; coming off.</li>
            <li> A lot of people said it was nothing but water and a chemical that makes it look like its shedding dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Just like everywhere else on your body there can be a build up of dead skin</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look like its dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li> It may be dead skin cells and it may be dried up gel product.</li>
            <li> However, if you are truly looking to slough off dead skin, keep researching because this will not give you any type of removal</li>
            <li> It did peel off some dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> which is your dead skin.</li>
            <li> I use it two or three times per week and the dead skin just balls up and washes off.  </li>
            <li> Became addicted while in Japan last year.</li>
            <li> what a waste..its as amzing as everyone says, but just wish wasn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
            <li> I believe some of the dead skin cells are from the product itself, and it takes forever to remove them all.</li>
            <li> But WAIT... were those really dead skin, I wonder...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel too harsh and isn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice a week for 3 weeks now, and it rubs away dead skin 5 seconds from applying it.</li>
            <li> so I let a few friends try it</li>
            <li> Arrived here in few days</li>
            <li> What I do think is that with continued use, your skin will not have as much dead skin to remove.  </li>
            <li> May have happened during the shipping process, however, with it broken the process of getting the actual gel out</li>
            <li> ended up being a really messy process.</li>
            <li> My skin as of late has been feeling really rough</li>
            <li> There is no beads, no nut shells, nothing harsh about this.</li>
            <li> It is a gel that when you apply it to your face and run in circular motions all the dead skin is is rubbed off as well.</li>
            <li> You squirt out 2 pumps of the gel, massage it all over your face, and see your dead skin cells roll off your skin.</li>
            <li> -does not seem to be harsh or chemically at all.  </li>
            <li> I can get rid of all my dead skin cells after I work out</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin which I do not, maybe this is the one for you, but not for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and it does seem to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> However the bits are NOT your dead skin cells, they are formed by the product.</li>
            <li> To my amazement dead skin started to bead up and fall off of my face.</li>
            <li> a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I can never get dead skin off without upsetting my acne or drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> This product does remove the dead skin cells off of your face.</li>
            <li> And the dead skin just sloughs off.  </li>
            <li> Used it on my face and could not believe the amount of dead skin that came off.</li>
            <li> I can feel the dead skin ball up whenever I use it.  </li>
            <li> but you can see all the dirt and dead skin it picks up.</li>
            <li> You can see all the dead skin come off.</li>
            <li> This is a total game changer</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t dead skin cells</li>
            <li> so people think it&#x27;s dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> I try to use it every few days.</li>
            <li> the dead skin just rolls off.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates your skin without harsh chemicals and</li>
            <li> (Stop being so impatient).</li>
            <li> I felt like a cicada shedding it&#x27;s exoskeleton; there was balls of dead skin covering every inch of my face and hands.</li>
            <li> It bring the dead skin up</li>
            <li> I tried to use this everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not yet determined if this is all dead skin or if the gel has a tendency to do this.</li>
            <li> When I ordered from this merchant, I had the product in just a few days.</li>
            <li> This is not a cure for acne but the number one thing you can do to help get rid of acne is exfoliate the dead skin cells that are clogging your pores and this product does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any dead skin after rubbing this product on my face.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not recommended for everyday use anyways, use once or twice a week at one pump</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product will not make your dead skin ball up.</li>
            <li> I use it one to two times a week, and it sloughs off every bit of dead skin and even blackheads.</li>
            <li> , I know I should stop and wait for a few days to redo it again for optimal</li>
            <li> and it was already clumping dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> and it loosens dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> never did the trick or were too harsh.</li>
            <li> The product needs a bit of time to start working, and you can see parts of dead skin turning whitish when you let the product sit on it.</li>
            <li> The dead skin cells just roll up.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even use it twice before all the dead skin seems to be gone.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t remove my dead skin cells, it doesn&#x27;t take any effects on my skin.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product I saw some reviewers debating because some reviewers felt that the \\&quot;balls\\&quot; were dead skin cells, where others felt that it was the product itself.</li>
            <li> I am going to tell you that based on the fact that my acne scabs were lifted to the point that the area of one scab was bleeding, I am going to HAVE to agree with those that state that the \\&quot;balls\\&quot; are DEAD skin cells.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste the gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a skin care regimen at all, but I wanted to start getting into something and bought a few things to try.</li>
            <li> I think are dead skin.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re your dead skin).</li>
            <li> but then it started sloughing off dead skin.</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;re done, wash off dead skin and remaining gel.</li>
            <li> I know that some people think that the beading is from the product itself and not from the dead skin cells</li>
            <li> but it was too harsh and over peald some areas, but this one is wonder i like it</li>
            <li> It lifts away my dead skins</li>
            <li> but I have a few acne scars</li>
            <li> Dead skins start to ball up within seconds.</li>
            <li> Or by mechanically removing dead skin cells with an abrasive particle like a walnut shell or a polyethylene bead.</li>
            <li> After few seconds it will start to ball up as the gel interacts with the skin cells.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how well this gets dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I follow the exfoliation with a heavy moisturizing cream and cotton gloves as I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> balls of dead skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am hoping it is indeed dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s always a lot of dead skin there.</li>
            <li> I was thinking the dead skin might interfere with medication and moisturizers, so I used Cure on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove much dead skin at all.</li>
            <li> it took all the dead skin off my face.</li>
            <li> and I literally see the dead skin melting away at my face...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d already exfoliated all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> It was missing and now I cannot travel with it.</li>
            <li> And for the people saying this isn&#x27;t your dead skin balling up</li>
            <li> you can see the dead skin cell pop up in the surface while you are massaging your face.</li>
            <li> After a few seconds the dead skin cells start sloughing off.  </li>
            <li> They get off some of the dead skin, but stubborn, flaky just stick there.</li>
            <li> It removes dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Once applied, all the dead skin just peels off your face when you&#x27;re rubbing the product in.</li>
            <li> harsh brushes, just the tips of your fingers is all you need.  </li>
            <li> moisturizing dead,</li>
            <li> Just apply a couple of pumps of gel to the face or wherever you want to slough off the dead skin,....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews that say to put a thin layer on for a few minutes-then once it starts turning white, massage, and rinse.</li>
            <li> I had been using St. Ives Green Tea exfoliator prior to using this, and that has decreased the acnes already.</li>
            <li> Using Cure twice a week and St. Ives Green Tea exfoliator once a week, my skin has gotten softer and the amount of acnes I get has further decreased.</li>
            <li> All exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried have been to harsh and left me worse off then before</li>
            <li> it works just as well if not better than other scrubs on the market!  </li>
            <li> I find this gel very harsh, it is definitely not a very good option for someone whose skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> No more whiteheads and black heads</li>
            <li> Even small wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple of months ago and use it about two to three times a week and am half way through the bottle - so you get a lot of value for your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 and due to stress and hormonal changes my skin has started to look dull.</li>
            <li> So, that basically eliminated all these claims in these negative 1-star reviews that it was due to coagulation of the gel.    </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not amazing as other reviewers claim.  </li>
            <li> I have thee worst chapped lips that produce huge layers of dead dry skin, so I rubbed this stuff on them...and</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price and overall mediocre.  </li>
            <li> My self tanner completely came off wherever I rubbed this stuff, not only that, but the &amp;#34;balls of skin&amp;#34; that came up were darker looking, like dirty skin!  </li>
            <li> so I tried it on my feet to see if it worked and immediately, instead of white beads, they were grey and dirty.</li>
            <li> It does have a very slight alcohol type smell</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the product creates these little clumps, if it&#x27;s skin or the product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the little sand-like skin flake looking thing comes from when you use it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really not sure if its just the liquid rolling itself into little balls as it dries up.</li>
            <li> Hate the fact that I can only get it online but can live it</li>
            <li> It helps to remove the remnants of make-up Very little removes dead skin</li>
            <li> You can double up application in troubled areas (like the T zone if you have black</li>
            <li> I had some doubts too but really really enjoy  rubbing it off, then one day I woke up with a dry nasty pimple.</li>
            <li> No redness or tight feeling at all!</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have given it a poor rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think the small balls are dead skin cells</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried Retin-A in the past, but always found it too harsh and drying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it gets ALL the dead skin cells off</li>
            <li> /&gt;**TRUE EXFOLIATION can be achieved either mechanically by scrubbing/massaging the skin with a liquid containing small, hard particles (scrubs), also chemically by applying products containing active ingredients with a peeling effect (e.g. alpha-hydroxy acids, beta-hydroxy acids and others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this is my dead skin....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but it seemed to help with my oily face as well since all the dead skin is gone and not clogging up my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that in The USA all you can really get is crap that makes your skin look leathery, old and broken out.  </li>
            <li> may be skeptical that the little white balls of stuff are from the gel clumping together.</li>
            <li> After you rinse, your face feels freaking RAW.</li>
            <li> I always wear my bra very tight because I need the support</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to rub too hard!</li>
            <li> Also, I used this several days in a row on my forehead after getting a sunburn that left me peeling horribly bad on vacation.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about this item is that all the writing is in japanese/ chinese.</li>
            <li> have had pretty bad acne for the past two years</li>
            <li> If this stuff doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin, it surely sloughs away a disgusting amount of and oil.</li>
            <li> But I read the translated directions, used as directed and was shocked to see the amount of dead skin that was gently removed from my face.</li>
            <li> It is actually quite disturbing to see all of the dead skin that flakes off of your body when using this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was one of those people that was skeptical this was actually removing dead skin from my face, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to do it twice.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it too, and he has dry, thin skin.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of all the harsh products that never really helped.</li>
            <li> When i went to wash it off, i can feel all the little balls that were not there when i applied the product!</li>
            <li> does it mean this old already or fake?</li>
            <li> Even if I have oily skin, I moisturize my skin(I think is very important but can&#x27;t tell if it will make it worst for others or not)</li>
            <li> VERY LITTLE elbow grease is needed.  </li>
            <li> VERY LITTLE elbow grease is needed.  </li>
            <li> but it does very little exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase any other exfoliator again!!!  </li>
            <li> It kinda reminds me of Dead Sea scrub but in no way shape or form is as hard on the skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t scrub too hard, just a firm pressure will do.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It has no flowery/perfume smell that I hate and it very gently allows you to exfoliate the dead skin on your face with very little pressure.</li>
            <li> I got very little beading and was not sure if what beading I got was deal skin or the product thats why I am leaving a 4 star rating,  </li>
            <li> I count on it to rid my skin of dead cells before cleaning at least 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not convinced, I think you can get some small packets of it to try out-</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will order again although I do like the way it goes on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use Cure no more than twice a week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money, but I had to try it for myself!</li>
            <li> Takes of so much dead skin!</li>
            <li> (I usually have to wait every 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> So, as I like to think, I conducted a small experiment that goes as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is not sold in the US.</li>
            <li> If there is a LOT of dead skin, then expect to have to use it 2-3 times in that area (e.g. on my nose, cheeks, and feet, one application was not enough)&lt;br /&gt;- clumps of dead skin are somewhat awkward to wash/rinse off, if you are not thorough it can be gross to find some on yourself later&lt;</li>
            <li> I was completely skeptical that you could actually feel you skin balling up under your fingers where it was coming off.</li>
            <li> No more flaking.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, after using it, I didn&#x27;t feel like it had actually done anything.</li>
            <li> My only problem about this item is that it is too expensive for me to afford.</li>
            <li> I am not sure yetif</li>
            <li> This product makes you think that you are removing dead skin cells but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Dead skin practically falls off your face!</li>
            <li> the first few uses cause it&#x27;s trying to get rid of all the crap on your face.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i usually use 2-3 pumps per use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is.  </li>
            <li> Also, I think I&#x27;ve been applying an excessive amount each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known this product for the past 2 years ever since Bubbz made a review about it.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve gotten peels in the past (after having skin cleaned of course)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years, but be warned!  </li>
            <li> not sure what all the hype is about.</li>
            <li> No more rubbing microscopic beads without results.</li>
            <li> I took some in a small travel bottle for a trip because I could not imagine going a week without using this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how well</li>
            <li> At one point, I thought I must&#x27;ve started off wrong, I tried it on my neck, chest, under arms... and the results were all the same.  </li>
            <li> At one point, I thought I must&#x27;ve started off wrong, I tried it on my neck, chest, under arms... and the results were all the same.  </li>
            <li> The amount of brown skin -- not white pills - that rubbed and peeled off my arms and legs was disturbing.  </li>
            <li> Actually, it was pretty disgusting.  </li>
            <li> This will be part of my everyday routine forever more..love it!</li>
            <li> I must admit I was skeptical,  especially after she told me to just pat it on and not scrub.</li>
            <li> Wet face, apply a thin layer, wait about 1-3 min and then rub.</li>
            <li> Also, I usually break out when I use sunscreen</li>
            <li> I DO NOT like abrasion type exfoliators, they don&#x27;t even work, plus they&#x27;re harsh!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s your dead skin cells! :</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t breakout or have acne, but I might get an under-the-skin pimple or small papules on the sides of my face every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> This past week, my entire face has had a scaly texture that made it difficult to cover even with makeup.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if it&#x27;s my skin rubbing off or just the gel in the product.  </li>
            <li> The product is actually not that expensive as you get quite a bit of product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure, but I&#x27;ve heard this product expires six months after opening.</li>
            <li> And then I made a small test by rubbing this gel on a plastic surface (I used the water bottle) and wrap my finger with a plastic bag (to prevent if any skin cell came off from my fingers when rubbing) and guess what?</li>
            <li> If you guys still don&#x27;t believe those are your dead skin, well, do some test for yourself!</li>
            <li> and you can see the dead skin coming off!</li>
            <li> I used it a few times (prob 3x) and I think that was too much, at least for my skin.</li>
            <li> My usual exfoliator, a sugar scrub that&#x27;s thirty-two dollars, didn&#x27;t do the trick.</li>
            <li> I only used one of them and it totally removed these annoying dead skin on my nose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually found in hair products.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever gotten a Korean body scrub, then you know that a LOT of dead skin can come off!</li>
            <li> Every website has a risk of selling fake beauty products if it&#x27;s not an actual certified beauty store or website!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works</li>
            <li> .. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month.</li>
            <li> Rub it on for 1 minute and watch the dead skin just roll off!</li>
            <li> have used it every two or three days for the past month;</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s prevent breakouts</li>
            <li> no more...</li>
            <li> So when i received it i checked to see if they lazily packaged it</li>
            <li> Use small pumps when applying it to your face so that it doesn&#x27;t drip through your fingers.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> have used this for a few weeks now and it works!</li>
            <li> but without the harsh ingredients!</li>
            <li> so I usually start with my forehead, then my cheeks/nose then my chin because it kinda dries after a minute.</li>
            <li> i was not sure if this could work out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they do it</li>
            <li> They are just skeptical on how a product like this could actually work like it says it does.</li>
            <li> No more harsh exfoliating experience!</li>
            <li> Like others said it, I take small amount and rub in my face with circular motion, one area of my face at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this hocus-pocus</li>
            <li> Not sure what the craze is about...</li>
            <li> Not appealing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i would buy it again because of the price.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s all dead skin than you have my business for life!</li>
            <li> I still slough off soooo much dead skin!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is doing anything, may be it is</li>
            <li> (do not rub it in like you usually would, but let it \\&quot;rest on the skin\\&quot; so that you still get the acne fighting goodness).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few people hooked on it too!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if it was just balls of goo OR really my dead dry skin being removed, so I put it to the test.</li>
            <li> and there are very few products I can use or my skin freaks</li>
            <li> Price is in line (or actually less!!)</li>
            <li> and my face wasn&#x27;t the least bit raw or sore afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to know that even the thinnest skin area around my eyes needed to be exfoliated and after 3 times being exfoliated, dead skin cells kept coming off (WOW).</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;ve started using this, my face has not only broken out, but my cheeks have what appear to be broken blood vessels underneath the skin.  </li>
            <li> Even after using makeup remover, cleanser, and my Mia clarisonic tool, this gel still removes a bunch of dead skin off my face that all the other stuff had failed to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Regular face wash/exfoliator products and even some lotions make my skin sting really bad due to the tretinoin.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed since it did absolutely nothing for my flaky skin</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a long time, so it is not an expensive product to add to your skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Alas, i was let down.</li>
            <li> In terms of these gummy sort of exfoliants, I prefer the Ettusais Peeling Milk in the turquoise bottle, it had a very dramatic effect the last time I used it, and had a dewy aftereffect that this does not provide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try it if your skin is itchy, dry, or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit confused by the previous reviews that mention an \\&quot;alcohol smell\\&quot;</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if because when it was delivered it was extremely cold outside</li>
            <li> But I would have to rub those areas really hard.    </li>
            <li> like I did when I exfoliated with sugar and rubbed so hard on my skin).</li>
            <li> I found the product difficult to work with, and no better than other exfoliators I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> If it dries on the skin, the balls are hard to get off, so beware of that.</li>
            <li> I told her the dull skin was lifted away, thus her skin was brighter and glowing.</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2x a week or whenever my skin looks dull.</li>
            <li> I hardly use the Mia and abandoned the pumpkin serum now</li>
            <li> My skin used to be dull.</li>
            <li> also found it hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to use scrubs.</li>
            <li> ( I learned the hard way).</li>
            <li> dull skin,</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with a bad breakout and this stuff got all the bumps almost completely gone after just 3 uses.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my skin is just sensitive to this, or because I am also using AHA/BHA exfoliants and it reacted badly.</li>
            <li> I believe everyone should at least try this once.</li>
            <li> At least in my experience.</li>
            <li> Well, if there is a part of the body people clean(or at least within my family) it&#x27;s the face.</li>
            <li> I just got my bottle in after I seen the 5 star reviews, so I tried it last night and it was really crazy because it&#x27;s just a gel</li>
            <li> At least it worked for me, so can&#x27;t hurt to try for others I suppose...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling flakiness from aggressive exfoliaters lately</li>
            <li> BUT the manufacture should at least provide the directions on a sheet of paper or something.</li>
            <li> After about 1 minute of doing this just rinse thoroughly for at least 7 splash.</li>
            <li> Did it on my neck and the skin balls were dirty colored (gross, I know).</li>
            <li> I have had this gel for quite some time and recommended it to at least 20 people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, because I&#x27;m afraid to use it</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that eliminates flakey skin during the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> Not in a bad or painful way at all, just your skin is as smooth as plastic!</li>
            <li> always feels icky .</li>
            <li> It slowly disappears as time goes by.</li>
            <li> and so I was looking for a product that will get rid of the dead skin cells without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> After I&#x27;ve covered my face and neck, I slowly start rubbing, then rinse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a thick water.</li>
            <li> The product is very \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; since it is water base.</li>
            <li> I am slowly increasing the tretinoin applications</li>
            <li> I also have some acne scarring that has slowly faded, it&#x27;s not something that will get rid of it</li>
            <li> Item arrived with nozzle broken off and missing, but product still dispenses correctly.  </li>
            <li> This is a liquid gel – not too thick and not too runny.  </li>
            <li> But if I use too much, then I&#x27;ll end up with bloody lesions.</li>
            <li> I try using it every day, maybe missing a day or two here and there and have never experienced redness or even the slightest bit of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really mean it too.</li>
            <li> Nothing &amp; I mean nothing did what this did in minutes.  </li>
            <li> It will help your skin absorb all the benefits from other expensive skin</li>
            <li> Other harsher exfoliators have made my skin just look angry and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But no more!</li>
            <li> I mean any irritation.  </li>
            <li> And I mean without irritation.</li>
            <li> I mean seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the science behind the gel</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it twice because it&#x27;s just too annoying to mess with.</li>
            <li> So i ordered this product and i am very impatient, but this came overnight!</li>
            <li> seriously do yourself a favor and buy it.</li>
            <li> I am seriously amazed.  </li>
            <li> When I read the reviews, I was hesitant because I was afraid this product would make me break out, I don&#x27;t want whitening products, and if they said the skin really did show that it was removed, I was afraid by how much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will seriously change your skin.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m noticing less random breakouts despite sweating from the blazing Texas summer heat.</li>
            <li> I have serious acne prone skin, hyper pigmentation and cystic acne</li>
            <li> it was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I was just in serious need of exfoliation</li>
            <li> I got my brother to use it, and it seriously worked.</li>
            <li> update: after a couple of nights of Tretinoin treatment followed by vitamin C serum, my 53-year-old skin needs serious exfoliation.</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> Seriously, try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> I wish it was less expensive?</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that a semi-watery goo could exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive but will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t lose it in case you have a pet or child that likes to swallow or put random little things in their mouth.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I tried this is because I could not find one bad review on this stuff on Google.</li>
            <li> water  and  not  good  as  water</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> No Good.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product for me.  </li>
            <li> 1 hour of tedious blending and setting goes to waste.</li>
            <li> Frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t read  ingredients or instructions because they&#x27;re in Chinese.</li>
            <li> Was no good.</li>
            <li> It was disgusting, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still skeptical on whether that is really dead skin rubbing off my face.</li>
            <li> Sadly though, this one is just too harsh, even to use once a week.  </li>
            <li> but when I felt all that dead skin coming off I couldn&#x27;t believe how dramatic my skin changed !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure if there&#x27;s something weird in the formulation that makes the product ball up or what.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this a fake or what</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin in the least!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone and everyone to at least try!</li>
            <li> It causes my face to peel horribly and when it doesn&#x27;t peel horribly, it&#x27;s dry and you can see dry patches of skin under makeup.</li>
            <li> Even though it is #1 in Japan I am not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I hate to waste, but I poured this down the drain and hoped it didn&#x27;t cause a gooey clog.</li>
            <li> I have very delicate acne-prone type 1 skin</li>
            <li> I mean if God himself needed an exfoliater this would be his go to!</li>
            <li> When I got the product my face had terrible brown patches belows my jowels from a build up of dead skin cells which the current products I was using just decided not to work anymore.</li>
            <li> , so I confusedly thought it was a chemical exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no scientist, but if we think about it this is the concept behind peels and microdermabrasion.  </li>
            <li> I had what the dermatologist called a broken blood vessel on my  cheek.  </li>
            <li> Some peels sting, burn or worse yet,  do nothing.  </li>
            <li> and that was too irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost disgusting how much comes off, and painlessly too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are always disappointed but not surprised when we find out a product does nothing for us.</li>
            <li> I have already ordered another bottle and I pray anyone who is not happy with their skin regiment to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any redness, itching, or discomfort post-use.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is now addicted...</li>
            <li> I now have my sister and mom addicted to it as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused with this.</li>
            <li> It does a poor job with peeling and reeks of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t read closely on how this product worked and was confused when it came and there was no &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; particles.  </li>
            <li> Put on a thin layer all over face (and neck if you like)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy how much dead skin comes off of your face.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the nozzle was broken.</li>
            <li> dispenser tip came broken</li>
            <li> So sorry about my late review.</li>
            <li> I rated the product with 3 stars because when I received it, the nozzle was broken.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of days ago and hollllly smokes I&#x27;m so addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I apply a thin layer of this gel on my face after cleansing and drying off.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything to get rid of the flakiness (which looks even worse when I wear makeup).  </li>
            <li> next， not happy with that</li>
            <li> Also I think it&#x27;s clogging my sink because it&#x27;s so gluey.</li>
            <li> Unless it&#x27;s a total piece of crap product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if I end up in the poor house because of this product.  </li>
            <li> Nasty, I know, but this product REALLY works.</li>
            <li> So just because YOU may have gotten a fake doesn&#x27;t mean this stuff does not</li>
            <li> Seriously, someone must tell me how this water gel thing works!</li>
            <li> I have used this all the way down my chest when i have had really bad break outs.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You would think that, given the amount of \\&quot;skin\\&quot; that comes off, this product is equivalent to a VI peel or something, but the results aren&#x27;t THAT dramatic.  </li>
            <li> the results are so dramatic I don&#x27;t understand how it wouldn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> It just is a so-so treatment for getting loose skin off the face, as with Retin-A. Doesnt sting or irritate but it leaves an annoying film on the skin that has to be washed off.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old that has combination skin and every now and again I get terrible acne for no reason, hormones.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Not worth Purchasing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Every time I attempt to use this I break out horribly (this last time it was worse</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little disappointed by this stuff.</li>
            <li> All I can say is weird</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try after having a woman in a Vegas skincare shop</li>
            <li> Basically, it&#x27;s like the world&#x27;s gentlest microderm treatment without being exorbitantly expensive.</li>
            <li> I then rub my face with two fingers until the (disgusting) white balls appear (I try to do this over the bathroom sink).</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing behind and in front of the camera!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird way of testing it out</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Weird but works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s over priced for a mediocre job.</li>
            <li> Literally they just rubbed the dead crap away painlessly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Also, it is quite expensive for an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an expensive gimmick.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the all caps, but I&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A country of exfoliators can&#x27;t be wrong.  </li>
            <li> An awfully expensive and embarrassing purchase frankly.</li>
            <li> Not impressed</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and not easily impressed.  </li>
            <li> Wrong</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical buying a product with a label I couldn&#x27;t read</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t tell what in it so it can be scary.</li>
            <li> tired of being ripped off!</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about this product I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but the lady loves it.</li>
            <li> To me it doesn&#x27;t smell weird</li>
            <li> I know some people are skeptical about this product</li>
            <li> I think this is a fake version.</li>
            <li> But once you look into the science of it--all fake.</li>
            <li> and it is way to expensive to put some glue and alcolhol on my face.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after one use of this so-called exfoliant, those expectations have been dashed.  </li>
            <li> I do acknowledge that all those reviews can&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li> I think the one I bought in China is a fake one.</li>
            <li> I am unlikely to purchase this again but will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> It is scary how well this exfoliator works.  </li>
            <li> I have the same disgusted fascination with it that I get when I use those nose pore strips.  </li>
            <li> was I wrong,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit complicated to use</li>
            <li> even my usually angry &amp; sentlsitive skin tolerates This like its water.</li>
            <li> , I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Having had troubled skin for over 13 years, I was hesitant of yet ANOTHER exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this item</li>
            <li> Although i did smell the scent of rubbing alcohol which was weird</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> And for those that think it&#x27;s fake or that it&#x27;s the product and not your skin that is clumping up, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> useless fake</li>
            <li> It has a weird sea salt/ocean water/alcohol smell to the liquid.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product working but after reading all the reviews, I figured all those people can&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li> kinda expensive too</li>
            <li> Unfortunate, because it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this.</li>
            <li> which makes the product then useless.</li>
            <li> Plus, it was difficult to get any product out of the container.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> expensive thou</li>
            <li> This one seems like a fake one.</li>
            <li> Either the it&#x27; fake or expired product.</li>
            <li> Sounds scary, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt or damage your skin at all</li>
            <li> I was wasting expensive creams/serums etc.</li>
            <li> the packaging protection is very poor.</li>
            <li> so i guess the price isnt Terrible for how long it lasts</li>
            <li> There is a very faint scent of alcohol but it isn&#x27;t noticeable or irritating.</li>
            <li> I really hated using a loofa because I hated knowing that I had dead skin stuck in it and to reuse the loofa with the dead skin</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t terrible, it&#x27;s got a little bit of a chemical scent to it, but it&#x27;s nothing that would deter me from wanting to use it.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t be afraid to be generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That sounds crazy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy and I have no idea how it works.</li>
            <li> I googled for it desperately.  </li>
            <li> I was so desperate, I searched on youtube.  </li>
            <li> Freaking crazy how well this works.  </li>
            <li> The amount of dead skin that comes off is shocking.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the packaging was disappointing.</li>
            <li> No stinging or crazy smell.  </li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this, not wanting to waist money on yet another disappointing product.  </li>
            <li> I had a cold non stop runny nose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s why I buy all of my face cleansing products from Asia and all of my moisturizers from cold, Nordic countries.  </li>
            <li> She suffers from rosacea, but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate her or cause her to break out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopeful again, I tested it out on my nose, which has been peeling and flaky after I caught the cold.</li>
            <li> nothing crazy though.</li>
            <li> All his dirty pores got cleaned</li>
            <li> This product is a fake!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for 8-10 oz of product!</li>
            <li> A mere 50ml for a whopping $100!  </li>
            <li> this DOES NOT work for you, it&#x27;s probably a FAKE!</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that the smell is rather unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I felt very sad to vote this as 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Like the product - hate their lame packaging.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very faint and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all .</li>
            <li> Sounds disgusting, but the stuff gets the job done and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or irritate me in the least.</li>
            <li> The ingredients aren&#x27;t too bad as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad product.</li>
            <li> and I woke up today and my irritation isn&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> The people who gave this bad reviews must already use something that keeps their skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about almost a year now, and I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction from it.</li>
            <li> but Ishould have went with my gut when i saw the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have acne and some bad</li>
            <li> , my skin burned bad (but i recovered quick)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work with mine.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> I got a really bad breakout after beginning to use this product.</li>
            <li> --does what it is supposed to and does NOT cause any bad reactions.</li>
            <li> Bad cycle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews deter you.</li>
            <li> and I was shocked.</li>
            <li> And I have two responses: (1)</li>
            <li> But in some ways, it disappointed me.</li>
            <li> buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Plus, i havent had any crazy pimple pop out since i used it!</li>
            <li> I found myself questioning how I could be so stupid to fall for this one.</li>
            <li> So stupid.</li>
            <li> I moved to Japan and saw that it was all the rage around the beauty stores, and stupidly picked one up.</li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s bull crap.</li>
            <li> Save your money - this is crap.</li>
            <li> As for this piece of crap, you use it and it keeps balling up no matter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all made with filler crap that dries out the skin.  </li>
            <li> Holy crap, this stuff is now my holy grail.</li>
            <li> Bad decision!</li>
            <li> I was shocked!  </li>
            <li> Why did you have to break you stupid bottle! :(</li>
            <li> My skin got worst. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have always been a secretly vain person, but now, I am UBER vain!!!!  </li>
            <li> ( I know it sounds really disgusting but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s insane!</li>
            <li> It bring all the sirt and grim to the surface</li>
            <li> It breaks me out every time I use it and does a horrible job with peeling.</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is insane.</li>
            <li> My skin got drier and drier and looked awful!  </li>
            <li> so I tried it on my feet ad legs and face and arms and holy crap!</li>
            <li> No stinging, just oodles of disgusting skin.</li>
            <li> It was horrible for a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The skin flakes look awful under makeup at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> Silly my guess, IT DOES WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible cycle.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of horrible chemicals put into it !</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was skeptical about this exfoliator when I saw the overwhelming amount of 5-star reviews, but after receiving my order yesterday and trying it out, I can attest to its effectiveness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hitting my 30&#x27;s, my skin has gone down hill. My face always felt rough, even though I have tried to exfoliate with other facial scrubs--it has a very unhealthy texture and I was breaking out way more than a 30 year old should. After just one use of Cure, I immediately felt a difference in texture and appearance. The &amp;#34;white balls&amp;#34; that form are definitely dead skin because the gel is not goopy (it&#x27;s rather liquidy) and it does not congeal. It&#x27;s pricier, but the instructions recommend 3-5 pumps, twice a week, which is really not that much considering how small the pump is so one bottle should last a while. Definitely adding this to my normal skincare routine!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  Use it every other day, gets rid of dead skin cells like magic. :)</li>
            <li> OMG, Love this product. My absolute new favorite beauty product! As obsessed as I am about exfoliating, this product has outdone it, and what I love even more about it is that I don&#x27;t need to use a beauty tool such a loofa to help.  I really hated using a loofa because I hated knowing that I had dead skin stuck in it and to reuse the loofa with the dead skin wasn&#x27;t appealing at all. This is a product I like so much and want everyone to try and like just as much as me!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING seriously do yourself a favor and buy it.</li>
            <li> The best exfoliator I have ever used.</li>
            <li> They are ok. I don&#x27;t see any significant changes on my face....</li>
            <li> This is a pretty great exfoliator. It works by rolling up into little balls and using those balls to very gently physically exfoliate. When I bought this product, I had not really read up on it enough to know this, so I confusedly thought it was a chemical exfoliant. So I guess that&#x27;s important to consider-- this is NOT a chemical exfoliant! I usually stick to only chemical exfoliants, as most physical ones are too abrasive for my sensitive skin. But if I had to pick one, this gentle one would be it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic exfoliator. Works extremely well. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the bomb!!!!!!!!!!! I have been battling some health issues so my skin is freaking out most of the time....I use this on my hands arms and face and it is gentle enough to use on my twins knees when they are very dry.....luv it.....vey gentle and exfoliates like crazy.....worth the money</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work and smells just like rubbing alcohol. Label is all in Japanese so no way of knowing ingredients.</li>
            <li> Even though it is #1 in Japan I am not very impressed. It does &amp;#34;rolls&amp;#34; on the skin but I am not 100% sure that it is actual skin and not the product itself. The regular St Ives scrub seems to do a better job in doing deeper pore cleaning and skin exfoliation. I would say Cure Natural Aqua Gel is good for very sensitive skin and as a rotating option with a scrub but not the only way of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I am 38 Asian female and a smoker.  I love this gel.  Out of all the exfoliators including the Microdermabrasion &amp; Peel System, this does it all but easier. No mixing or brushes to buy....just pump out and rub in circular motion and wash off the dead skin balls.  That easy.  I have also used it on my feet.  Not a perfect system but perfect for in between pedis.  I use Cure every other day and on my two young girls (7 and 12)once a week.  They love it also.  According to another reviewer, the bottle lasts for 6 months so if it lasts me two to three months, it would be worth every penny and really reasonable and affordable.  I am hoping this will help prevent occasional zits from forming.</li>
            <li> Does as it claims! Really good exfoliator, removes a layer of dead skin and leaves skin feeling fresh and soft and revitalized. Not for those with sensitive skin though, as my friend used this and it made her face red and irritated all day.</li>
            <li> Not too many products really do what they say.  This product is amazing; just love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Country &amp; Stream Facial Peeling is less costly and works way better.</li>
            <li> All I can say is weird but it does get rid of the dead skin.  I&#x27;m no scientist, but if we think about it this is the concept behind peels and microdermabrasion.  I don&#x27;t feel like this replaces that, but it makes it more effective because your skin is super clean and prepped for anything.  So now whatever other products you use can actually do what they need to do to your living skin cells, instead of trying to resurrect the dead ones.</li>
            <li> You would think that, given the amount of \\&quot;skin\\&quot; that comes off, this product is equivalent to a VI peel or something, but the results aren&#x27;t THAT dramatic.  I&#x27;m still not sure if there&#x27;s something weird in the formulation that makes the product ball up or what.  I use it at night after Clarisonic/Neutrogena soap, followed by Afirm 3x (very strong retinol), and take breaks when the exfoliating&#x27;s too harsh.  4 stars...pretty good, but want to know if it&#x27;s really doing what it appears to be doing.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to look up instructions on use online, since all the text on the bottle is in Japanese.</li>
            <li> Cure Gel, how do I love thee, let me count the ways...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was skeptical, but decided to give it a try after having a woman in a Vegas skincare shop try to sell me on a similar exfoliating gel that cost $200 (yes, you read that correctly!)  Of course, I declined her kind offer and moved on with my life, and then I randomly discovered Cure on amazon and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I did!  The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t even have a chance to let it sit on my skin first - it started balling upon immediate contact with my face!  And I had thought I was rather nicely exfoliated to begin with - guess not.  So I immediately repeated and came away with a lot less \\&quot;crud\\&quot; the second time around.  I repeated again last night and had some exfoliation happening, but not nearly as much.  And again this morning (yes, I know I need to slow down before my whole face peels off, but it&#x27;s addictive!) and was thrilled to find that there was very little sloughing.  So now I know I&#x27;m thoroughly exfoliated!  At this point, I&#x27;ll move to figuring out how often is right for me (likely every other day or so, to keep the acne at bay.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my skin, my face looks amazing!  I have been struggling with a bad breakout and this stuff got all the bumps almost completely gone after just 3 uses.  My face is super soft and glowing and I can see a dramatic improvement - blemishes are almost completely gone, pores are looking smaller, and the texture is greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this post after I&#x27;ve used Cure for a few weeks, but I&#x27;m really loving it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and PS - I&#x27;ve also been using it on my hands and it works great.  I can see improvement already.  I also repeated it several times and it&#x27;s obvious that the balling is truly dead skin because after using it 3 times in a row last night, I had zero balling on the last try.  Then this morning I had a little, but much less than yesterday.  This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li> You seriously do NOT know what exfolating of you have not tried this! The first use, my face actually had that sweeky (did I speel that right?) clean!! Not smooth and soft...actually CLEAN!&lt;br /&gt;I followed this with toner and collagen cream. My skin has never felt smoother! There is a reason why this is one of the best!!!</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and the climate was taking a toll on my skin. The harsh of the weather plus the products I was using created a dull dry uneven  full of blackhead mess. This product is gentle and along with my soy based foaming cleanser have re-hydrated, brighten and cleared up mu skin. Hate the fact that I can only get it online but can live it that</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought this product really skeptical because someone mentioned that the clumps you see aren&#x27;t your dead skin, and It&#x27;s probably true because you do occasionally get this hard glob at the end of the pump. Regardless, it works. I don&#x27;t know how really, but ever since I started using it my &#x27;acne beard&#x27; as I put it grossly (I&#x27;m a girl) has gone away. When I do use it, my skin feels really soft afterwards and its really fun to use because of the clumps.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel. I have oily skin and this gets all of the dead skin off that&#x27;s just making my skin tone look uneven. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible, it&#x27;s got a little bit of a chemical scent to it, but it&#x27;s nothing that would deter me from wanting to use it. It recommends using it twice a week but with the other masks and scrubs, I limit it to once a week. You don&#x27;t need to use much so this bottle should last you a little while, but don&#x27;t forget most cosmetics have a shelf life so don&#x27;t be afraid to be generous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use it, just add two pumps to your fingertips and apply all over the face. After a minute, rub it until you the tiny grit of the dead skin cells on your fingers. Get all of the skin around the face and rinse off cleanly. Apply toner and continue with the rest of your skincare routine.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator really does live up to the hype. I count on it to rid my skin of dead cells before cleaning at least 2-3 times a week. However, I have relatively hardy skin, and I disagree with the claim that it can be used daily. It is far too wasteful to use it that way. It also is possible to over exfoliate with this product, though it doesn&#x27;t hurt or sting like a physical or stronger chemical exfoliator will. I noticed my skin getting a bit irritated (bumpy) and oily if I overused this (around my nose and mouth, for the most part), so I recommend using it every other day at most. It can also be a bit drying if you don&#x27;t continue with the rest of your skincare routine soon after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Fantastic product, but use judgement and treat it as you would any other exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely impressed with this exfoliator! Since I have been using it I can tell a big difference. I have oily/dry acne prone skin. This works very well or me simply because its gentle, no color/fragrance, and contains natural ingredients. The price is a little high but, it lasts for a long time. You only need about 1-2 squats per time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water (activated hydrogen water, non-acidic and purified), glycerin, acrylates/C10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dicocodimonium, chloride, steartrimonium bromide, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, gingko biloba extract, rosmarinus officinalis/rosemary leaf extract, butylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very important thing is that it does not contain parabens and alcohol. Parabens is a type of preservative (which is found in many skin care products) try to avoid. And of course alcohol can severely dry out your skin causing more acne! ** The picture is of the Cure bottle and another one of my favorite products, Bior&amp;eacute; UV protection $11. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I will repurchase!</li>
            <li> This is miraculous stuff- I use it a couple of times a week and it sure seems to do a great job of exfoliating the dead top layer of skin, especially if you&#x27;re using retinol or Retin-A. If you&#x27;re not convinced, I think you can get some small packets of it to try out- you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is one of a kind product! It is truly the best thing you can get for your skin,it does just what it says,you will be amazed at what beautiful skin that is under ready to be awakened, I use it on my legs also!</li>
            <li> works great! skin feels very, very smooth!</li>
            <li> I am hooked for life on this stuff. It is a great exfoliator with none of the harsh side effects of traditional exfoliators. Its a bit messy, so best to use right before showering.</li>
            <li> Guys, I am in love. This product is amazing. Not only does it leave my skin feeling like a baby, but the fact that not only can I feel but actually see it&#x27;s effect, well, I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates like no other product I&#x27;ve used and it does so without irritating your skin. It&#x27;s better than home acid peels for exfoliation. It&#x27;s effects are immediate and painless.  I love it. It works. A friend tried mine today and immediately placed an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it daily without irritation on my face, neck, lips and feet! This is the only exfoliator you need.  It&#x27;s better than harsher products I&#x27;ve used at removing dry skin--even calluses. Yet my skin is soft and smooth after using it. Much more effective than products that burn and cause ugly redness and so gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just try it. I believe you will love it. I let a friend try mine today and she placed an order for herself immediately. She commented that it was the first effective exfoliator she&#x27;d ever used that left her face soft, smooth with no &amp;#34;down time&amp;#34; dealing with redness and sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how it works so well without harsh chemicals but I am grateful that amazon had it. I&#x27;ll reorder.  It&#x27;s one of my very favorite products.  Effective. Easy to use. Gentle. Safe.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feels so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of a miracle. I have been searching for a product that will help to soften my skin and have been trying different exfoliators but have always gotten the same results or not much at all. I heard about Cure and decided to order sample packs (you can get free samples from Beauty Carousel or buy them on eBay) before I buy the full product. After one use of the trial packet, I&#x27;m definitely sold and will be buying the full product. It isn&#x27;t as expensive as the products that you&#x27;d find at beauty stores here since you are getting a huge bottle of product for $34, whereas you could get a mere few ounces for that price. I&#x27;m sure that this bottle will last a very long time.     After rubbing it into my skin for less than 30 seconds (and seeing the white bits that accumulate) and rinsing, my skin immediately felt incredibly baby soft, smooth, silky, and clean. I really mean it too. I also didn&#x27;t know that my skin could ever feel that soft and great. If you think that you have soft and smooth skin now, just try Cure once and you&#x27;ll notice the pure softness and smoothness of your skin and it&#x27;ll soon become a part of your skin regimen.     I now know why this is considered to be Japan&#x27;s best kept beauty secret. It is a wonderful product and exactly what every woman needs for silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the gel or my dead skin actually rolling up, but it does make my face feel more clean afterward. Also, it definitely clears up my blocked pores on my chin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about buying this product but after using this product for the first time I have to say that it is absolutely amazing! I have very sensitive skin and this product did not sting or dry my face. It also did everything it said it would do!</li>
            <li> Love this aqua gel. Use it twice a week. My skin turns clean and smooth after using it. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I always try to take good care of my skin but lately i noticed that my skin was feeling thick, coarse and that just cleaning it was not enough. So i saw a YOUTUBE video from Bubzbeauty shes amazing and in her videos she gives really good explanations of why she is using the products she does so i decided to try cure and im SOOO GLAD I DID!! I received my Cure order yesterday. I ordered from ppali beauty. I am happy with this seller, my product was intact when i received it, it was carefully bubble wrapped and i got it scratch free.  Now the product itself is AMAZING!! i properly cleaned my face, pat dried it and then applied the Cure gel. Few seconds after massaging the gel on my face all the dry, dead skin started to form tiny residue ( I know it sounds really disgusting but its good for your skin to remove that). when i clean the residue with water my skin was sooo Soft and it looked clean and radiant and it felt refreshed. I will totally recommend this product to my friends :)im Really satisfied with it. I will update my review after 3 weeks using cure. I love This Product!!</li>
            <li> Oh wow. Where do I start about this product?? I wish I found it sooner. It&#x27;s not Japan&#x27;s best selling product for no reason! This is simply a gel that you rub into your skin to exfoliate it. Even after using makeup remover, cleanser, and my Mia clarisonic tool, this gel still removes a bunch of dead skin off my face that all the other stuff had failed to get rid of. It&#x27;s been two weeks now since I got CURE and I am so addicted that I use it every other day to really deep clean my face. Not only has this product helped to even and lighten my skin tone (thus fading scars), it also PREVENTS breakouts. Why do we get acne? Because our skin has a tough time shedding the dead skin, so if you&#x27;ve got a layer of dead skin mixed in with oil and dirt, your pores will get clogged. Exfoliators help to remove this dead skin layer, but many are full of harsh ingreients or microbeads that can actually irritate your skin even more. I used to use ones like St Ives apricot scrub, but over time, I realized it was too rough on my skin. Then, I tried other exfoliating fgels and creams only to find that they were ineffective at removing dead skin, only to dry out my face without exfoliating. What makes CURE aqua gel a top product is that it is not only gentle, but it WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be skeptical that the little white balls of stuff are from the gel clumping together. To test this out, I applied it to a plastic surface. A few little clumps formed, and I realized it was exfoliating the skin from my finger tip. Next I tried to put it on my face twice, and sure enough it did not clump up (because the first time all dead skin were already removed). I also applied it on my dad (who had just scrubed the heck out of his face with a loofah), and no dead skin balls formed. So the little balls are your dead skin cells, not the gel clumping by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this for people with dry skin, acne, and scars. Try it and you will love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cure for less than a week and I&#x27;m totally hooked. After switching from Proactiv face wash to bio sulfur soap, I needed something to slough away the dead skin cells. This stuff does it and SOOO gently, without the irritation (my skin is pale and sensitive and reacts negatively to scrubs, making my skin really red). On the bottle, it says to use it twice a week, but since it&#x27;s so gentle, I&#x27;m able to use it almost everyday with wonderful results. My skin is smoother and I&#x27;m able to remove that gross dead layer of skin that builds up daily (especially when using acne products). It&#x27;s definitely cool to see the little beads of dead skin form on your skin as you&#x27;re rubbing it in. I&#x27;ve been using it on the back of my hands (where the skin has seemed to become extra dry and wrinkly lately) and on my neck and it does WONDERS - my skin in those areas feels so much younger, just after a few uses. I&#x27;m 30 and I think I purchased this at the perfect time, allowing me to take extra care of my skin as I age. The price is worth it for me (especially since I was spending big bucks on Proactiv, which makes my skin red and doesn&#x27;t completely clear up acne for me - ugh). I don&#x27;t believe Cure will clear up acne, but it works so very well following on a face wash made especially for acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using Bio Sulfur Soap by Grisi and it&#x27;s great. This stuff will work well on any skin type - in conjunction with any skin care routine. I&#x27;m so happy with this stuff!! Addicted!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After reading more reviews of Cure on here, I&#x27;ve noticed that some people are saying that the little white or grey-ish (whatever color) beads that show up on your face after rubbing the product in, are just product build up. Well, that&#x27;s bull crap. I love this stuff, and I KNOW that it&#x27;s working and sloughing off dead skin cells. How do I know? When I use it once per week, a lot of dead skin cells come off. I&#x27;ve tried using it two times in a row (back to back) and the second time, barely any beads form at all. Sometimes...nothing. It&#x27;ll be just like rubbing water into your skin. This is because it&#x27;s actually ridding your face of dead skin cells the first time. I recommend this exfoliation treatment for anyone. Like I&#x27;ve said before, I have sensitive skin and it works great. No redness. No irritation. Just smoother, exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> so it leaves my face smooth</li>
            <li> I have very dry, very sensitive skin with rosacea. Because of this, I very rarely can exfoliate because any other store-bought exfoliator makes my skin burn and irritates the crap out of everything. This stuff does not do that... It&#x27;s great! Basically, it&#x27;s like the world&#x27;s gentlest microderm treatment without being exorbitantly expensive. It&#x27;s so gentle I can even use it under my nose and around my eyes during allergy season when everything is already sore and inflamed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t express how much I love this product. In use it  about once a week or week and a half on my whole face, with spot-treatments in between if I have any dry, crusty spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the money; I&#x27;ve had my bottle for almost three months and have only used about 1/6 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It works great for my skin. This just exfoliate you skin very gently. It is a little freaky when you first use it because you start out with just a watery product, but as you rub it on your face you start to get little lumps of the exfoliate skin rolling around as you apply this product. I have sensitive skin and this product works gently and does what it says it is going to do without over irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars, I would. Every time I attempt to use this I break out horribly (this last time it was worse than I have in years) for days afterwards. I would not recommend it for acne prone people. You are warned! Please patch test.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product. I have sensitive, acne-prone skin and I use it several times a week. I can&#x27;t go more than 2 days without using it. (Which sounds excessive, but it&#x27;s super gentle and it works for me to use almost daily.)&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clearer, brighter, cleaner and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my elbows and feet sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;I make sure to never run out. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 4 months now and it&#x27;s a must-have item for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the product so far.  I never thought it was going to work but holy moly, there were dead skin cells everywhere.  It was very gentle on my face and I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why some genius has not marketed this to US women. I kind of fear there is something in it we do not allow, although I cannot identify it and do not want to know, because I am IN LOVE with this product. It gently and painlessly removes any dead skin and leaves you feeling as soft and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom! It works anywhere! It is great for peeling and chapped lips!&lt;br /&gt;I have had a 100% improvement in my breakouts and fine line reduction since I began using this about 6 months ago. It is truly remarkable, as I have tried virtually everything else on the market. Most exfoliators end up causing me to break out by irritating my skin further - but not The Cure!&lt;br /&gt;I have gone from $400 face creams to using this, followed by cold-pressed extra virgin coconut oil (NO JOKE) and a little Chanel eye cream at night.&lt;br /&gt;Now if only they made an industrial size cheaper version so I could slather this all over once a week, I would be in smooth &amp; silky heaven!</li>
            <li> Cool product! Smooths out dry skin immediately after use.</li>
            <li> I am sure those white balls are not my dead skin!</li>
            <li> WHat the heck is this stuff..? there is a slight alcohol scent.. but it doesn&#x27;t stop me. I really love how it doesn&#x27;t foam or soap up.. I love the gel like feel.. then.. the weirdest thing - feels like something is coming off my face.. no idea if it really is exfolliating.. but I keep wanting to use it .. My face is clean after.. Go for it. The price is a little high.. but you get alot of product in a pump bottle.. use only a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is doing what the other review say but I haven&#x27;t been using it long so we will see.  My skin feels smoother when I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an awesome gel or not, but I feel that I can get similar cleanliness with other products of my Clarisonic and it can be messy.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this just to see what the hope was about, and I tell you what I wish I had known about this stuff years and years ago. 2 days later I bought 3 more bottles. I keep one at bathroom sink,and one in the shower. I used it on my face and hands and could not believe how soft my face and hands felt after using this. It is now a part of my daily and night facial routine and I use it twice a day on my hands followed by lotion. I believe everyone should at least try this once. It kinda reminds me of Dead Sea scrub but in no way shape or form is as hard on the skin. And knowing that there isn&#x27;t any bad chemicals makes it that much better. This is one product that I will continue to purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is ammmaaazziinnggg for all skin types.  I heard the rumors about this product, read reviews got recommendations and finally tried it for myself last night.  Here&#x27;s what I found out: It&#x27;s best applied to dry skin after cleansing.  It&#x27;s an exfoliant, so don&#x27;t use it everyday.  It&#x27;s great for black heads.  It really does take off a layer of your skin.  You can double up application in troubled areas (like the T zone if you have black heads.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised by how gentle this was, and how watery.  This is more watery than some liquid cleansers I&#x27;ve used.  After the first use, i noticed the oxidation of the black heads on my nose was gone, making it almost seem as if they&#x27;d disappeared (they hadn&#x27;t of course, but still.)  I also noticed that it seemed like they&#x27;d be easy to extract at that point.  I didn&#x27;t do so, because i don&#x27;t have the right tools, but something to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up this morning with noticeably brighter skin.</li>
            <li> very good one, amazingly remove dead skin!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I can&#x27;t believe how much my skin has improved and I love that it works on any skin type too.</li>
            <li> I have the best performance wth this product the first time. From then on it was only so so... I am not sure I will order again although I do like the way it goes on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was as effective as the first application.</li>
            <li> My wife don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> This is very gentle and can be use everyday after a good makeup off to making sure everything is clean under pores</li>
            <li> If you have acne prone, sensitive skin this is a must have! It&#x27;s an amazing gentle EXFOLIATOR that gently sloughs off that first layer of skin. I use it twice a week to keep my skin free if clogged pores, I follow up with an Aztec Indian healing clay mask a/ raw apple cider vinegar and this combination has kept my skin glowy, plump, bump free, acne free. One of my holy grail products of all time. The ingredients aren&#x27;t too bad as well.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I waited a long time, debating about purchasing it, and I&#x27;m very glad I finally decided to make the purchase. I generously pump product onto my fingertips, smear all over my face, and wait for 30 sec to 1 min. I then rub my face with two fingers until the (disgusting) white balls appear (I try to do this over the bathroom sink). When I think my skin&#x27;s gotten good enough of a cleaning, I rinse with cold water. I tend to lean on the cautious side, so to make sure all of the product has been removed, I wash with a gentle cleanser immediately afterwards, pat dry, and apply lotion. I use Cure no more than twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;My bf&#x27;s even tried it out and liked it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 6 star product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it all over to keep my skin feeling soft!</li>
            <li> this is literally the best stuff you can put on your face. I wonder why US brands haven&#x27;t made a similar product because this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I felt very sad to vote this as 3 stars. Everytime I purchased any product and I saw low rated star, I wish I won&#x27;t be one of them, but I did this time. This products are well known to many beauty guru on Youtube, and it was the reason why I decided to purchase this item. When I saw beauty gurus put this product in their hand and show how it works, I thought this product is a form of miracles and such! and I hope this will does wonder to my skin. Unfortunately,I really don&#x27;t know if it because of my skin is &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t have lots of dead skin cells, but whenever I applied this to my face, the dead cells didn&#x27;t appear much as I expected to see it. And when I massaged my face,I felt my skin really dry. Does this happens to anyone else? Please let me know. I apply this to my face and wait around 10 seconds to let the product reacts to the dead cells, then I massage my face, let it sit for 3minutes and wash it away. Did I do it right?</li>
            <li> This exfoliating gel starts working almost as soon as I apply it, and makes my skin feel so smooth.  It polishes the dead skin away.  No burning, no scratching.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the most gentle exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used. There is no chemical burn if you use it for too long. The instructions are in all japanese on the bottle but the seller did give me separate instructions. This is one of the most amazing products I&#x27;ve ever had. Highly recommend this product, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I got the wrong product. It was so watery rather than creamy and didn&#x27;t have the beads I&#x27;ve come to expect from exfoliators. But after 30 seconds of rubbing (which you can gently), these small clumps of dead skin started to form. Rinsing it off after ~3 minutes made my face feel very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Gets dead skin off without being abrasive.</li>
            <li> It is very useful to shed dead skin cells from problem areas like nose and chin, you can definitely see and feel the skin sloughing off, but it won&#x27;t clear every single impurity for those with imperfect skin. I use it a couple times a week to clear sebacious filaments from my noise and inner cheek instead of biore strips or mask. It feels nice to gently massage after a weekend in the sun or a night wearing makeup to leave a smooth surface, but it won&#x27;t fix every problem.  I use it in conjunction with a regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this product. Alas, i was let down. Product was very runny and smelled of straight rubbing alcohol. I used it 3 times and did not even clump up like I&#x27;ve seen on countless youtube videos. I have used gel exfoliators before from a korean line that worked wonders, but this one was a complete failure. Maybe I got a bad product. Thanks amazon for my refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who had read about it.  It really works very well- my heels are thankful.</li>
            <li> This product is soooooo impressive..I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product..its too good to be true.. cause everything it claims its absolutely true..I only use it twice a week and its super gentle on my sensitive skin so no more exfoliating with other harsh and grainy products..best of all, it leaves my skin super clean and soft</li>
            <li> First off this product is expensive, but I decided it is better to spend a lot of money on something that does work, than to buy affordable exfoliators that don&#x27;t work. When I placed the order, the estimate arrival date was between a month- a month and a half. I RECEIVED CURE 1 1/2 WEEKS LATER :)  I was completely surprised on how quickly the product arrived. I was nervous because the order did not have a tracking number but it worked out at the end. The product came in perfect condition. The box was a little dent, but the actual product was find. This product does exactly what it says it does. It gently removes surface dead skin cells, revealing soft baby skin. I have oily and acne prone skin. This product helps my other products work even better. I have only been using Cure for a month and I have seen a slight improvement on my skin. This product is suppose to last 3 months so think of it as putting $20 a month for beautiful skin. I recommend this product and will for sure buy again :)</li>
            <li> This product is a great exfoliating and with little effort.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I just got the cute half hour ago and couldn&#x27;t wait to use and write it! It&#x27;s best $26 I spent for my skin. I just did it and I never felt my skin that much clear, my pores are almost gone. I&#x27;m sure the dead skins come.</li>
            <li> What is this stuff? is it made by wizards? its weirdly powerful in dissolving dead skin and yet so gentle it leaves your skin petal soft and baby smooth. I write for a living and consequently rarely write product reviews. This is one of few instances I don&#x27;t feel the company should be paying me to wax poetic about their product. Its that good- I am waxing for free. Its not cheap but after trying it you&#x27;ll know its money well spent. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use...my skin was very smooth after first use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything amazing for my skin. Made it smoother, but didn&#x27;t do anything for my texture or acne. Probably better used as a gentle exfoliater for those who have pretty good skin</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product!  Easy to use, works well yet gentle to skin.</li>
            <li> THIS IS AMAZIMG, FOLLOW DIRECTIONS EXACTLY. FACE MUST BE DRY. I use twice a week and have noticed a smoother softer facial skin</li>
            <li> This is really great thing!I love it very much.</li>
            <li> I dont think its your skin sloughing off, come on!  Its an OK cleanser (or whatever it is) but its very watery, VERY watery. For the amount of money spent, I think I&#x27;ll stick with something local I can pick up immediately.</li>
            <li> So I was sold on all the positive reviews, before buying... and that&#x27;s why I bought this.  In the back of my mind, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.    Some background: I&#x27;m a 37-year old fair-skinned Asian-American male.  I have had a facial skincare routine every day of my life since I turned 30 years old.  For 5 years, as far as cleansing goes, I was always using Stridex daily, and 2x a month using an acid exfoliator (the Olay serum/scrub kit).  For the last couple years, I have switched to a basic water-based cleanser, and every 6-12 weeks I have applied either a 15% or 25% TCA chemical peel. In other words, I&#x27;m no stranger to what exfoliation feels like.    As a kid, growing up, in the bath or shower, I would often scratch or rub my arms or legs to really give myself a deep clean.  It would produce these \\&quot;strands\\&quot; of dead epidermis.  But I would have to rub those areas really hard.    Well, this \\&quot;CURE\\&quot; gel basically eliminates the need for all that rubbing/scratching.  You rub gently over your face and within 15 seconds, sure enough, the epidermis starts to flake or \\&quot;ball\\&quot; off!    Now, before I purchased, I read some people saying that if this was really your skin, that you&#x27;d be suffering from burns on your face.  And I have two responses: (1) each time I apply this \\&quot;CURE\\&quot; gel, I squirt 4 pumps into my hands, and cover my face with it, and it appears to take off somewhere between 1/3 to 1/2 of (the dead stratum corneum layer of) my epidermis skin layer; and (2) a lot of the skin that is flaking or balling off is actually from your HANDS, not your face!    Of course, you&#x27;ve read the reviews that claim that this product does nothing.    Well, so I ran all the following tests:    (a) First, when I wore a plastic glove and rubbed the gel between my fingers, there was absolutely ZERO balling, even after rubbing 3 minutes until it dried.  So, that basically eliminated all these claims in these negative 1-star reviews that it was due to coagulation of the gel.    (b) Then,I applied the lotion once, rinsed off, applied again, rinsed off, and applied again, rinsed off.  Each of those 3 times I had the balling/flaking results.  3 times!  Now, a note: by the time I rinsed off the third time, my skin was dry and stinging.  It was the same kind of stinging I get from applying a 15% TCA peel!  Maybe not as strong, so maybe it&#x27;s similar to a 7% TCA peel, but the sensation is definitely the same.  And that stinging sensation comes where the TCA peel most affects me--around my nostrils, and under my chin.    (c) My third experiment was on a separate evening, where I applied the lotion with a plastic glove (you can also wear a plastic sandwich bag, like a glove, instead).  This time, on the 3rd pass, I no longer got the balling/flaking results.  Instead, when I used the leftover gel from this 3rd pass attempt on my forearm, well, the dead epidermis started to ball/flake.    (d) My last experiment was to try applying this in the shower.  And it didn&#x27;t work!  This gel doesn&#x27;t work at all if you try to apply it to a wet face.  It only works (and works REALLY well!) if you apply it to a clean dry face!!!    The results are remarkable.  My skin is glowing after using this product.    So after reading all this, what am I trying to tell you?:    #1:  This stuff is for real, most definitely.  The stuff balling up is most definitely your dead epidermis.    #2:  It&#x27;s best to apply this with something, instead of direct contact with your hands.  I will continue using a plastic glove or plastic bag to apply.    #3.  If you decide to apply this 2-3 times in a row, you may exfoliate all your epidermis, and you better cover up with an SPF lotion.    #4.  Only apply on a dry face!    I hope this helps some of you in your usage or purchasing decisions.  Cheers.    1-WEEK UPDATE: If you wear a plastic glove while applying, you may need to rub with significantly more pressure because the plastic is slick and there&#x27;s no friction to rub the surface epidermis away.But more amazingly, after about a week of use, it has gently removed about 30% of a discoloration caused by a popped pimple.  Usually I have to wait months for it to go away, or I use deep exfoliation on it and it gets irritated and sticks around longer. Finally, after a week of use, I&#x27;ve also discovered that my Ponds pore strips are much more effective now on my pores.  Overall, I&#x27;m convinced that the balling of skin looks so strange because it is an agglomeration (&#x27;mixture&#x27;) of both your dead skin and the product itself (which isn&#x27;t so far-fetched given that the product isn&#x27;t supposed to necessarily magically disappear!). I&#x27;m quite happy with the gentleness of this product.</li>
            <li> I tend to only let myself read the &amp;#34;good reviews&amp;#34; and thought I&#x27;d give this a try after reading so many good reviews, however I have used this many times and I&#x27;m now convinced that it does nothing but roll up into blobs of gook, (which is what everyone else thinks is their dead skin rolling off).  I am sure about this bc I use spray tan and anytime I exfoliate it makes the tan come off my face but this does not effect my tan at all so I think it does nothing.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much just pure alcohol</li>
            <li> Love it!!  A must have for cleansing</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DOUBTFULl...  But thought it was inexpensive enough to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34;.  I am 42 and a firm believer in Retin A,  chemical peels, etc..and I exfoliate regularly  (No pain no gain).  I thought for sure nothing would come off my face.  Washed, dryed, put the product on my face, let it set a bit and rubbed... Well, skin &amp;#34;balled up&amp;#34; and rolled off!!  My skin is softer and shines!  SO glad I gave it a shot!  Totally Works yet it&#x27;s gentle! Gentle enough that I can exfoliate my 10 year olds face that was peeling from a sunburn! No stinging or burning!  I am buying more after I write this review!  You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I heard so much great reviews about this product, and it meets about to my expectations! Without a doubt purchasing this again. It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle!!!!</li>
            <li> Reduced scars/red marks.  I had what the dermatologist called a broken blood vessel on my  cheek.  In truth, it looked like a acne scar that simply would not go away (three months it sat there!).  He said he could try to burn it off (no thank you!)....but my bottle of Cure arrived the same day as his diagnosis.  I tried it and after only one treatment the redness and raised look has been reduced by 70 percent.  I used to have to be very creative with concealer in order to hide it, now my light foundation is enough.  I haven&#x27;t used it a second time (waiting before treatments) but I am very encouraged by this initial try.  Note, my skin can not tolerate traditional exfoliants such as scrubs or anything with grit, they cause my face to break out.  This caused zero irritation for me although i did find the alcohol smell to be alarming.</li>
            <li> Excellent for sloughing off dead skin and giving the face a fresh clean look.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake! I was so excited to try this product because I had heard so many good reviews on it. I had patches of dead/dry skin on my face and I knew that if this gel could exfoliate those areas off, that it was legit. I followed all the directions and guess what...it did absolutely nothing to the dead skin on my face. The product balled up in these white lumps which was the first sign that it was not exfoliating my skin because I don&#x27;t have white skin. It was just the product clumping together. After I rinsed my face my skin looked the same and I still had my dry patches of dead skin. It did make my skin feel squeaky clean which is probably why people think it actually takes off the dead skin, but in reality it&#x27;s either the residue from the ingredients or it just dried the skin out. I&#x27;m disappointed! Waste of money, but I had to try it for myself!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought my first cure aqua gel in Japan. it has a blue bead inside. It slowly disappears as time goes by. since its almost finish, i order 1 here in amazon. surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t have any blue bead. does it mean this old already or fake? it works the same exfoliating dead skin.</li>
            <li> Working good, and fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to get my hands on this much-raved product.  I have dry, sensitive skin and so I was looking for a product that will get rid of the dead skin cells without irritating my skin.  After hearing so many good things about this product, I decided to splurge and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  I used it several times and have noticed a difference in the texture and look of my skin.  My foundation settles better on my skin and my skin seems a bit glowy if that makes sense.  My only problem is the cost which is a bit pricey.  Overall, good buy and I would definitely recommend it to those who are interested in buying this product. :)</li>
            <li> I read some of the good reviews of this gel and order one, however it doesn&#x27;t work as good as I expected. There are so many good products with better price out there.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my acne in a few days. Removed dead skin. Need to use alongside a moisturizer because it&#x27;ll dry out your skin, but that isn&#x27;t a con.</li>
            <li> Cure is an AMAZING product! My friend Sam turned me on to it. Ever since then I use it twice a week, along with Egyptian Magic to moisturize. My skin is glowing behind and in front of the camera! I recommend this product for everyone since it is a gentle exfoliant by does the job right!  [...]</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the cure! My co worker had told me about it a year ago, I&#x27;ve used it twice a week ever since. I use my exposed skincare and Cure, and my acne finally cleared up. My skin tone got better too! All of my friends have ordered it to after trying it. The love it too.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that reacts to everything.  Yet it always seems to be less likely to react after a gentle peel.  Some peels sting, burn or worse yet,  do nothing.  This does somehow loosen the dead skin so that it balls off when applied by hands on clean skin with circular motions.  After a few regular applications, my slight acne and reddish bumps are gone.  I also used it on my feet.  It&#x27;s was gross how much dead skin came off.  I was left with smooth and soft sandal ready skin.  I never want to run out of this!</li>
            <li> It is a decent exfoliation but not for the price.  The product turns rubbery and exfoliates your skin.  It is not all dead skin as people seem to think.  It is the product and some dead skin.  There are similar products on the market that do the same thing as this product for much less money.  Save $25 and get another exfoliater.  Freemans makes similar for $5.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  Gently exfoliates and the price is excellent.  The instructions and everything are in Japanese, so, check out how to use it online.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and on a retinol prescription medication that makes my skin dry and peeling, that a scrub seemed too harsh. I was looking for a product that could exfoliate the dead skin gently, and this fit the bill! I imagine this would be great to use after a peel as well to help slough off the dead skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this stuff!!!! My skin feels to smooth and clean after using it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have EVER used to exfoliate my face.  It&#x27;s like a chemical peel but without the chemicals.  Very mild but completely removed the dead skin on my face leaving it like a baby&#x27;s face.  Thanks Cure!</li>
            <li> The finest exfoliater I have used.  It does not create an overly sensitized skin if used frequently as has been my experience with other exfoliants.  It keeps my skin feeling smooth and glowy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it twice a week. It is gentle enough yet efficient in what it does --- exfoliate!!!</li>
            <li> I was sitting at my computer after I just gave myself a TCA peel that takes days of being in when I happen to come across reviews about Cure. I found it on youtube.com too. It sounded so good I decided to order it, if something can exfoliate your skin in minutes instead of scrubbing with  harsh mico creams &amp; micro cloths &amp; getting red I&#x27;m all for it.  I received the item in 2 days! So while my peel was STILL healing I tried it on my hands, arms &amp; neck. Oh My God!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. The skin just rolled off in balls.  And it looked brighter,younger &amp; so soft! No redness after, Just smooth skin.  I wished I didn&#x27;t do the peel &amp; used this instead. You will love it. Nothing &amp; I mean nothing did what this did in minutes.  I&#x27;m buying more &amp; giving them as gifts before people find out about it !! I shouldn&#x27;t even be telling you but I believe in sharing a review about something that actually works. You won&#x27;t waste your money on this one. If you don&#x27;t like it, e mail me &amp; I&#x27;ll buy it from ya... At a discount of course! ha</li>
            <li> you could find much better exfoliator in Sephora. and this one expires after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Does the job! When my face is very clean and pre washed it doesn&#x27;t gel up as much. When my skin hasn&#x27;t been cleaned it accumulates a lot of dirt!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Some people have written that they believe that the gritty feeling as you are massaging the liquid in actually comes from the product and is not really the skin being exfoliated.  I only know that what I experience is removal of old skin cells.  When I put the product on some parts of my body, nothing much happens.  When I use it on my face, neck, and feet, it is remarkable.  That&#x27;s where I need exfoliation the most.  It works on calluses, and even got rid of a red line under my chin by the second application.  Also, my face looks better and is less dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m positive, at least for me, that those little white clumps are my dead skin- Initially, I thought it was gimmick as well but after trying it out, wow it really does work! When I exfoliate my body using a scrub, little rolls that are tinted grey start to peel off, this is the exact same thing that happens when I use the cure gel on my face. I even tested to see if the same balls would form after using it consecutively and as I continued to use it, there were less balls forming and it became more white, not to mention that my skin felt insanely smooth! This is definitely not a gimmick because I know what dead skin looks like coming off and it&#x27;s not just the white beads that the gel automatically forms. It&#x27;s also a very gentle exfoliator so I&#x27;m super surprised that it would do so well</li>
            <li> i like this,i use it once one week.it make me skin soft smooth</li>
            <li> will order a gain soon!</li>
            <li> Takes of so much dead skin! The main problem with my skin is that my skin turnover is very quick. Acne scar disappear but more always build up because my skin is suffocating under the layers of dead skin. With this product, my family and boyfriend said my skin looked so much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Bright with less buildup of dead cells.&lt;br /&gt;2. Removal of scars with exfoliation makes you skin look smoother.&lt;br /&gt;3. Less redness and irritation that other cleansers have caused.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I&#x27;ve seen other reviews claiming the product itself is actually what&#x27;s &amp;#34;balling&amp;#34; and I can say for sure, that&#x27;s incorrect. At least in my experience. I used to spend almost $40 on another brand that has a similar exfoliating technique (PTR) for a smaller bottle and thicker formula; I felt like I didn&#x27;t get as many uses out of it due to the thickness and needing to dispense more product than with Cure. Cure is more runny, and seems to spread more evenly and exfoliate with the best of them. I will absolutely buy this again. Shipping was pretty fast and I love the gentle exfoliating on my can-be-problematic skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;ve only used it for a week but it takes all the dead skin off and leaves your skin baby soft. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I really do consider this the best exfoliate without harming your skin. If you watch the video, the person talking says that it&#x27;s okay to apply the product twice, in a way yes and no because after you use it the first time, there really is no need to put on a second time. There is a chance that if you apply it the second time, you can actually cause your acne to bleed, so do be careful because it is potent. I use it twice a week for two weeks now and I already see a difference in my skin. I use PCA cleanser first, then the exfoliate, and lastly Clinique gel moisturizer and so far, rarely any breakouts. This will make a great present also for anyone that is acne prone.</li>
            <li> my skib become really soft after I use it</li>
            <li> I am an Asian Indian 30 year old housewife with a flacky, dry, combination and really sensitive skin. Believe me!!!!I tried several products from different brands starting from all drugstore products like Neutrogena, aveeno,clean and clear,clearasil, olay....literally all of them....everything irritated my skin. I tried estee lauder, shiseido and clinique products as well and even they caused redness and bumps. I was really disappointed with my skin which never felt clean and clear. I was just using a baby soap. Looking at a video review on you tube about CURE Japan&#x27;s number 1 exfoliater , I got impressed with how it works. So, I thought of giving it a try and thank God I ordered it from an amazing amazon seller \\&quot;ppali\\&quot;...I was really excited of the fact that cure is made up with 91% of hydrogen water because at this point water was the only thing which was suitable for my skin and this is even purest form of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived in 4 days with free shipping and the bottle was rapped properly and neatly in a bubble rap. The bottle came with 2 sample size pouches with it. I know Japanese language and I red \\&quot; yasashisa arigatou ( Thank you for being so kind) on the bottle.I immediately washed my face with a baby soap, pat dry and put one dab of cure on my face gently massaging allover my face. Just 2 minutes passed and my face was left with dead skin...it was magical that it removed all the dead skin from my face. After washing my face the skin was so soft, no irritation, no bumps, so soothing just like a baby skin. Oh my gosh!!!! I am so happy I ordered it....but wait a minute...I thought of doing one more experiment where I reapplied cure again on the washed face immediately just to see that its not the products which was producing a dead skin like substance...and result ...no dead skin at all. I am 100% positive about the effectiveness and authenticity of this product. I will definitely repurchase it and from \\&quot;ppali\\&quot; beauty only ...nowhere else...because they are the best,most genuine, responsible sellers I have ever seen....Thank you for being so kind cure and ppali!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This product has a very unique way of exfoliating. I like how smooth it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> I do not believe the white speckles that form are &amp;#34;skin that is exfoliated&amp;#34;.  Otherwise the skin on your face and hands would be red and raw as this would be over-exfoliation from the size and amount of these particles.  From a cleansing point of view, it is just ok.  The consistency is very watery, so be careful with applying it, as it will drip.  The instructions are in Korean but I googled it and it should be left on for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for me.  I also felt like my skin broke out more after using it.</li>
            <li> what can I say! the Japanese know what they are doing. This amazing product exfoliates immediately. you put it on your face and upon making circular motions you are already collecting dead skin cells. wow! nothing like it really!</li>
            <li> Incredible!!!! I don&#x27;t know how I ended up stumbling upon this product but I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;The reviews are right on point-very gentle cleanser, wait a few seconds and the dead skin starts to come off.&lt;br /&gt;Not harsh at all. Doesn&#x27;t feel gritty and sandpapery like most exfoliatiors. It&#x27;s super gentle and effective.&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and right after my skin felt incredibly smooth and soft. Whether you have acne or aged skin, all skin dulls due to dead layers on top. This reveals soft, supple, glowing skin. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this!</li>
            <li> If this stuff doesn&#x27;t remove dead skin, it surely sloughs away a disgusting amount of and oil. There&#x27;s also no smell to it at all. I like to apply it in the shower, where the dead skin, dirt and oil can wash away down the drain.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this after seeing bubzbeauty rave about it  I tried it out after i received it and works life magic!  you can visually see the dead skin cells coming off from your skin    It&#x27;s so soft against my acne prone skin. No break outs or anything.  my face tone lightened up immediately and my skin just feels sooo soft. just after one use!    Oh, and great seller too!  I was kinda worried because the delivery status didn&#x27;t show since it was coming directly from Japan  It showed up that the delivery would take almost a month.  But guess what. It only took a week (:  my cure was wrapped safely in a bubble wrap too.  I will definitely buy from this seller again when i run out.</li>
            <li> Cure is great and it works as advertised. Each time I use it, my skin feels very soft and clean after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use it right after a shower about twice a week. It&#x27;s working well so far, I&#x27;m noticing my skin is getting smoother and less rough. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The Cure Aqua Gel is okay. I don&#x27;t know if its actually my skin that&#x27;s coming off when I&#x27;m exfoliating or if its just the product itself that&#x27;s coming off. Because all I see are white little beads coming off. Shouldn&#x27;t my dead skins be a little light brown or something? Sometimes I get good results and sometimes I don&#x27;t. When I do get good results my skin is smooth and it gives it a nice hint of brightness and glow to it. But I have to say that I have not broken out from it whenever I use it. With all the hype about this product from Japan I was expecting more. But in some ways, it disappointed me. So I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase unless if I see better results in the future after continued use.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff very regularly and love the results. great gentle exfoliator and the bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that &amp;#34;ball up&amp;#34; skin (Turkish bath mitten, etc.). That&#x27;s exactly what this does but no elbow grease needed and nothing to clean. Amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. So awesome. Will most definitely buy this again</li>
            <li> This is very cool.  Make sure you don&#x27;t get your face or hands wet before you use it.  I did a little test that I saw another reviewer had done.  I put a little on the glass counter top on my vanity to see if I would get the same balling effect.  I did not.  Only when I did it on the back of my hands, neck and face.  I love that it is from Japan.  Take incredibly good care of their skin over there.  I like following in their footsteps.</li>
            <li> PRO&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Appropriate for sensitive skin as it&#x27;s very gentle.  I have excessively sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin and can&#x27;t tolerate Cetaphil cleanser, Purpose cleanser, or exfoliating every 6 days (I usually have to wait every 2 weeks).  I am able to use this exfoliator once every 2 days; that&#x27;s how gentle and nonabrasive it is.&lt;br /&gt;(2) Good value as it&#x27;s priced fairly.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Extremely effective.  My skin feels super smooth, clean, and clear after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;(1) It doesn&#x27;t lather or scrub.  In its original state, the liquid is clear, non-fragrant, and smooth (so no beads or granules to aid in exfoliation).  The consistency is similar to a leave-in conditioner.  Once it touches your face and you massage it into your skin, the dead skin begins to flake off into little balls.</li>
            <li> I wanted this stuff to work but I returned mine because it made my face burn and even after several weeks of not using it and using face moisturizers, my face still has rough patches that peel.  I have never been sensitive to these types of things before but my skin definitely didn&#x27;t like this!</li>
            <li> Works really well if your skin is sensitive to the abrasive exfoliating products. Very mild and no scent.</li>
            <li> This is great product.  It does not have any scent, and feels just like water but removes dead skins without hurting my skin.  I let my daughter tried it and she ended up ordering one for herself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> Good seller but bad product</li>
            <li> Its very gentle and my skin feels really soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I will jump on the band wagon and state that this product WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> Love! LOVE! True to reviews, this was a great buy!  My skin has felt softer and appears smoother just after 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Got here in two days and I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of voodoo this is but it&#x27;s magic. My skin is so soft for days after I use this. I have to keep myself from using it every day.</li>
            <li> Works like an eraser to pull out sebaceous residue from pores and remove any residue of any kind on skin surface. Soft and smooth skin and cleaner pores are the result. I worked for a dermatologist for 4 years. These skin food products are far superior to American made, sorry to say, and they do not cause other problems to deal with. Trust them on what they claim their products will do.</li>
            <li> My face is allergic with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks.  I use it 2 or 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Applied it, let it sit then rubbed and barely obtained a little bit of grit. My face wasn&#x27;t remarkably smooth.  I believe the maker of the product developed something that does some kind of chemical change producing gobs of something that the masses think is exfoliated skin. I feel like a total rube for getting sucked in on this product.</li>
            <li> Junk. If I could give a big fat ZERO I would. This product is a scam!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable. Does what it says, exfoliates, better than anything else I&#x27;ve every tried in my life. Salon quality results. Even though it&#x27;s more expensive than any of my other facial products, I will refill as soon as I&#x27;m out. The bottle is gender neutral so my husband isn&#x27;t ashamed to use it, thank you. His nose and chin problems are gone, and my skin is softer than ever.</li>
            <li> The product is great, shipping was a day early which is fantastic. The product works well but I recommend using moisturizer after using this product because your face will get really dry.</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave it a 4 was because there are no instructions in English.It did exfoliate well but one week i used it several days and that was too irritating to my skin.So i would suggest only 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt; When I ordered this product, I had previously done a whole research on Asian skin care products and found out that most of them were really expensive and sometimes didn&#x27;t even work. So when I came across Cure Natural Aqua Gel on a Youtuber&#x27;s Channel and found it was really inexpensive, with positive reviews, I was really excited to try it out. It arrived really fast and with no problems. My product was easy to apply since it came with English instructions on the back. When I applied it on my face, slowly and gently massaging it, I felt a bunch of little balls coming off. I was surprised that such a soft and gentle exfoliator could have such an enormous effect, so I checked the product to see if it had any hidden balls within it but found none. So, as I like to think, I conducted a small experiment that goes as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;Since some parts of our bodies have higher or lower concentration of dead cells, if I use the same amount of product on these areas I should get a different amount of dead cells. And if I get the same amount of &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; it means it is all within the product. (Making sense? It does in my head XD)&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test two areas: 1) The elbows, 2) The face&lt;br /&gt;Why? Well, if there is a part of the body people clean(or at least within my family) it&#x27;s the face. I know I am too lazy to scrub my body every single day and thus my elbows don&#x27;t get such a nice treatment. Besides, elbows are a joint where skin accumulates, thus more dead cells. ( I am not an expert)&lt;br /&gt;Procedure:&lt;br /&gt;So I pumped twice and applied it on my elbow which I know has a big concentration of dead cells. And as hypothesized( if you like to think of it that way ;D) a big amount of balls formed. Then, I applied the same amount of product to a part of my dad&#x27;s face as equal in surface area as that of my elbows (I had already exfoliated mine so it doesn&#x27;t count). My conclusion was that the product truly works, because the same amount of product generated different amounts of balls, meaning it must have reacted to the skin.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a weird way of testing it out and I know many factors could have influenced the answers but all you really need as proof, is the feel of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt; To really appreciate a product I write down my expectations VS. reality and with these, I draw my &amp;#34;real expectations&amp;#34; because having realistic expectations in mind really help to appreciate any product and understand it&#x27;s value.&lt;br /&gt; For me these were my Expectations Vs Reality&lt;br /&gt;Expectations&lt;br /&gt;Yes, we all have wished our acne would simply disappear, together with the scars and all those skin problems after one application. &amp;#34;My skin will turn to a beautiful and healthy glowing and perfect skin.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Reality&lt;br /&gt;After years of doing nothing to my skin( I am guilty -.-), it won&#x27;t go away magically, and if it does call me. Skin needs time to repair, so I have to be patient. There is no &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; skin so I should love my skin the way it is even though I look like a Mexican version of a vampire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt; The product is as gentle as you want it to be( if your not gentle with your skin you can scar it even more -.- like I did when I exfoliated with sugar and rubbed so hard on my skin). It has only being 2 weeks, and  My acne is still there, but it has tremendously dwindled. I used to have acne all over my cheeks and now I only get one pimple every other day. My skin doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; in the dark (LOL) but it does look a little more healthy and not so dull. The product has caused no &amp;#34;after effects&amp;#34;, it is pleasant to use and has done close to magic for my skin \(^_^)/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVER ALL&lt;br /&gt; I am so happy with this beautiful product sent from heaven. I have lived with acne my whole life like a lot of people, and I did my research, bought this product and now I am happy. It is worth every penny, and it does wonders(at least to my face), fast shipping, you name it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product with my skin care routine which is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;1) A make up remover (if you wear make up, I don&#x27;t so I can&#x27;t recommend any but oils are good too if you want a more natural way)&lt;br /&gt;2) A cleanser- use any of your preference, i haven&#x27;t found a favorite yet.&lt;br /&gt;3) An exfoliator- THIS ONE!&lt;br /&gt;4) A toner- for this I use half Apple cider vinegar and half water because i don&#x27;t like the idea of rubbing any alcohol product on my face.&lt;br /&gt;5)A moisturizer- Even if I have oily skin, I moisturize my skin(I think is very important but can&#x27;t tell if it will make it worst for others or not) I recommend Aveeno&lt;br /&gt;6) Masks- sometimes I use honey for my red scars, or clay masks work too (Indian Clay)&lt;br /&gt;7) A Spray - Avene Thermal Spring water spray is great to keep face moisturize if you don&#x27;t want to apply face cream often, its a lighter feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for my bad English, Spanish is my first language. This is only my opinion and my craziness :D</li>
            <li> Love this! My skin is soooo soft. I used to use exfoliators which contained &amp;#34;abrasive&amp;#34; microbeads or other little scrubbers which left my skin red and raw (though soft as well). Cure works so well and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> just started using, it appears to be assisting my skin care</li>
            <li> I need to modify my original review. I originally said this stuff is amazing.  That&#x27;s not true. It&#x27;s beyond amazing. If I could take a bath in this stuff, I would. It&#x27;s a miracle. My face looks like it did when I was 18.  I use it on my face. I use it on my neck, my arms.  It gives the best pedicure and manicure. I have turned my 60 yr old parents onto this. My dad is bald. He used it on his head. It took off years of skin build up from being exposed to the sun. My dad was amazed. They each ordered their own bottle and bought me a new one since they used so much of mine while they visited on vacation. One applicantion made my mom&#x27;s leg keratosis look so good. This is a staple in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> The most amazing exfoliant I have ever used.  Works like magic to take off that dead layer if skin.  I am seriously amazed.  Not sure why this product is not sold in the US. It would be flying off the shelves!</li>
            <li> I love Asian skin care products; they are the best!  This product lasted me close to a year with twice a week use. It made my skin extremely soft after each use and lasted for several days. Great buy!</li>
            <li> water  and  not  good  as  water</li>
            <li> Love it cause it works well with all the types of skin specially that I have a very sensitive one and till now it works as it described! Plus I didn&#x27;t imagine it that big!</li>
            <li> Works like magic! I&#x27;ve tried many different types of exfoliators (Vive per Lei Facial Peeling, ect) and this product is the one that has always gives me the best results without fail. I use it once a week and you just rub it on your face and dead skin comes off. Its a slightly smoky white liquid and odorless. I love it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- very gentle, doesn&#x27;t feel like it is working if you don&#x27;t look at it happening&lt;br /&gt;- can be used practically anywhere on your body, if you so choose&lt;br /&gt;- leaves skin feeling and smelling fresh (like rosemary)&lt;br /&gt;- takes a decent amount of (only) dead skin off of any area applied&lt;br /&gt;- very good for delicate or hard to scrub areas like the face or hand/feet cuticles&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t aggravate areas with sores/scabs. On myself and on a friend, we had areas that could not be scrubbed or rubbed, but this product managed to painlessly remove dead skin from the area&lt;br /&gt;- leaves skin very soft and clear afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- only takes a certain amount of skin off with each application. If there is a LOT of dead skin, then expect to have to use it 2-3 times in that area (e.g. on my nose, cheeks, and feet, one application was not enough)&lt;br /&gt;- clumps of dead skin are somewhat awkward to wash/rinse off, if you are not thorough it can be gross to find some on yourself later&lt;br /&gt;- somewhat pricey, you might be able to make your own with some blended rosemary/ginkgo/aloe (but I have not tried)&lt;br /&gt;- leaves non-oily areas dry, I recommend you moisturize accordingly&lt;br /&gt;- some areas may feel sensitive after exfoliation (be mindful of your choices)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this product is totally amazing at what it does. My hands and face have never been softer; who knew there was so much dead skin on either? It&#x27;s almost disgusting how much comes off, and painlessly too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: This product definitely is not &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or a &amp;#34;scam.&amp;#34; I sincerely doubt the reviewers who say so. The skin is noticeably lighter, softer, and more healthy/alive looking after the product is used, which basically means that you are *actually* exfoliating it and *actual* skin is coming off during usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. You can accomplish the same effect by just pouring water over your face and scrubbing shortly after..</li>
            <li> Okay..&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice alternative to more expensive water activated skin exfoliators. After use your skin feels  clean and smooth.  However, after being using it for over two months. I haven&#x27;t see any remarkable changes with my skin pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned earlier, it is not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this twice. This product is Awesome. The only disappointment was the price increase (over $10 more).</li>
            <li> This is by far the best exfoliator I have ever used!  You can see the dead skin rolling off in a similar manner to used eraser rubbing off on your paper...leaves skin feeling silky smooth!  Best not to use every day...it can be addicting;)!</li>
            <li> i exfoliate once every two weeks, apply my moisturizers/proceed with my face routine, it&#x27;s lovely! really!&lt;br /&gt;would highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I got this at the local Japanese supermarket for $37.50, comes with a water treatment skin cream (10ml). The store has a tester available and I put a pump on my forearm, massage it into my skin and so many greyish residue come out. I can&#x27;t believe that it was the dead skin so I washed my arm, let it dry and put another pump of gel on my forearm, this time it has much less residue as I massage it. I then put a pump of gel on my elbow and OMG!!! it massage some dark residue! The skin of my elbow felt softer but it did takes couple more times to get rid of the thick layer of dead skin of my elbow. It was gentle and works so well on my face.  If this gel is available in store near you, I strongly recommend you try the tester to see if it would works for your skin. My sister try it as well but she said the gel was a bit too strong for her skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff has to be magic, illegal, or both. It works sooo well. I was completely skeptical that you could actually feel you skin balling up under your fingers where it was coming off. I mean seriously. That sounds crazy. I have some kind of dermatitis, not sure what, around my nose. It basically turns red sometimes, burns, then peels. When I first got this I was in the peeling/flaking stage and my face was looking rough. Literally. I tried this and boy did it ball up under my fingers like it said it would. Afterwards my skin was smoother than it has been in a very very long time. No more flaking. I&#x27;m still a little skeptical of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; claim after looking at the ingredients but it sure does work.  As for the people saying it&#x27;s not your skin balling up under your fingers it&#x27;s the gel, all I know is that there was dry skin flaking off of my face before and after something balled up under my fingers there wasn&#x27;t. Take that as you will.</li>
            <li> They sold me a fake one, it wasn&#x27;t real soap, it was like hand sanitizer .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing. It cleans your skin, face feels so soft after rinse. Doesn&#x27;t damage your skin. I Strongly recommended. A+++++++</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Have bought for several ppl now, who also love it. Very gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> I had heard about this stuff from a beauty guru on YouTube and saw that it was on Amazon so I decided to purchase. I have no idea what is in this stuff but it works!! First of all I exfoliate and use my Clairisonic regularly, so when I rubbed this stuff on my cheeks and middle of my forehead I didn&#x27;t get too much dead skin. HOWEVER, when I started moving towards my chin and outer edges of my faces I saw lots of dead skin being sloughed off. I have never seen my chin smoother even with everything I have tried, including facials. I have had these pesky white little bumps on my chin for forever, I&#x27;ve tried nose strips/exfoliating/peels/serums nothing worked so I kind of just gave up. I was definitely not expecting it to go away so quickly and easily with this stuff. I will definitely repurchase and hope this never goes out of stock!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dark elbow .. and started using it for 10 days in combination with a whitening cream.. my elbow started getting lighter</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  I have seen no change since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> The whole big shibang about this product is it&#x27;s claims to help gently exfoliate by causing the dead skin to roll up in balls. Due to all the reviews, I had high hopes for this product! But unfortunately, after using it, I didn&#x27;t feel like it had actually done anything. The &#x27;skin balls&#x27; didn&#x27;t feel like skin at all. To test this, I put some of the product on the top of a flat clean black palette and rubbed it in circles with a latex glove... Wouldn&#x27;t you know it, it balled up into little bits that were meant to be your skin coming off. So no, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate your skin, all that balls up is the product itself. Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend, more watery than anything.  Didn&#x27;t take me makeup off.</li>
            <li> This does not work and is an extreme waste of money - it&#x27;s not dead skin coming off - it&#x27;s whatever is in the gel...</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase.  It arrived so fast!  I have spent a lot more money on products that were one third the size and didn&#x27;t work as well.  I will definitely be purchasing this again and I will tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> Left skin flaky after a few days, and I have very oily skin.  Does leave skin baby-smooth right after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about cure for a while now and always wanted to try it. I finally found it on here for a reasonable price compared to 45 dollars at a store we have in hawaii. I&#x27;m over all sastifed and let me tell you after using it your skin is so soft it&#x27;s defiantly not the product you see you can tell its your skin!! I only used it 4 times so I&#x27;m excited to see the difference in time!!</li>
            <li> Like it, don&#x27;t love it. I still am not convinced that it isn&#x27;t the product itself that &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; up. My skin does feel squeaky clean after I use it, and I don&#x27;t think that this is healthy to use more then once every other week (at least for me).</li>
            <li> Too expensive for 8-10 oz of product!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this ! Makes my face really smooth!!</li>
            <li> Light but effective exfoliate product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial exfoliators in my day and this is by FAR the best. My only word of advice is MOISTURIZE MOISTURIZE MOISTURIZE. this will dry up your skin BIG TIME if you do not use a quality facial moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and exfoliates really well. Doesn&#x27;t make skin raw - only clears away cells that are ready to slough. I like the product also because (I think) it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Works great for minimizing pore size, but needed to use it every other day. Wish it was in a thicker formula.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how or why but this stuff is magical!!! We have all tried products that we hear is supposed to change our lives. We are always disappointed but not surprised when we find out a product does nothing for us. Not so this time! The only reason why I tried this is because I could not find one bad review on this stuff on Google. I searched long and hard.....not one. So I bit the bullet and I cannot believe something that looks so basic in appearance can transform my skin so dramatically! My skin looks flawless, oil free, soft, and glowing without any shine when I use this product. It lasts all day! I use it daily. I know I don&#x27;t have to but I cannot help it, I am in love!! My pores have vanished and my skin has dropped about ten years in appearance just after one week of use!! I have already ordered another bottle and I pray anyone who is not happy with their skin regiment to give this a try. It works better than products that cost hundreds!! I will keep buying until there is no possible way that I can anymore. BEST FACIAL PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> baby-soft, smooth skin with no drying or irritation. extremely gentle. non-abrasive. no burning or discomfort whatsoever. removes every single dead skin cell and dirt while leaving behind skin&#x27;s natural moisture. you don&#x27;t have to use very much, so it lasts a long time. worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> Amazing never disappointed !</li>
            <li> I just used this product. I thought this was some kind of gimmick also. I used it on my face and yes it looked like smells balls of skin. So I used it on my neck same thing. So I thought, this will happen every time you use it. Because it&#x27;s drying or when you rub it around it causes those little balls...About 5 mins later I re-washed my face and Nothing happened! No balls of skin! Same thing on my hands and neck. So I used it again, this time I did it longer thinking it will dry and you will get those tiny balls of skin...it never happened. My skin was nice and smooth and it looked great! Try it, it works!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Highly recommend once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have used only twice but can already feel the difference in my skin.  Softer &amp; smoother.  I suffer from combination skin, this seems to even it out!</li>
            <li> heard a lot about this product... but... it kind of disappointed me ... too watery... and it left a film on my face.... plus... it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate that well... i quit using it on my face.... but it works great on my body though... wont buy it again...</li>
            <li> Amazing product - I&#x27;m a big fan now.  I use it morning and night.  Keeps skin clear and even fades my freckles and age spots (I&#x27;m 64).</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.. I used it on my face and hands , just for the heck of it, I put it on the bottoms of my feet they are super dry and cracked, and this stuff started working on removing all the dead skin, since it is super dry and cracked, I am going to have to do a few more applications, but it working wonderfully, on all the areas of my skin that needs attention.  I will definitely but this again and again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!! It is so satisfying seeing the dead skin ball up and come off of your face. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was actually the dead skin on my face coming off so I tried it on my feet and it took the rough dry cracked skin right off. I love this stuff!!! I will buy this over and over again!!</li>
            <li> Not worth trying. I read Maskcara&#x27;s blog about how great this product was and I tried it and wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this exfoliator.  It leaves my skin smooth and soft.  It does dry a bit but I apply face lotion after every use.  It&#x27;s my new favorite product.  The order did take a bit to get to me but it was coming from Japan.</li>
            <li> I use this product once a week it make my skin fee softer and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a beat so, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel irritate.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective exfoliator that doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my sensitive skin.  I used it once or twice a week after cleansing and my skin is immediately softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a good cartoons</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers I would say that this is one of the awesome product you should use for exfoliating for your face. I didn&#x27;t expect at first that this would be really good but then when I see the dead skin or whatever you call that coming out from my face, I suddenly felt refreshed. My only problem about this item is that it is too expensive for me to afford. It is worth buying it though but it I could have bought 4 shirts or something. lol. Finally, I can say that this is indeed the best selling and the best exfoliator around in this period.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing...l just had several girlfriends visit, and every one of them ordered this product from Amazon after using mine!</li>
            <li> I saw this product while looking at other product reviews on YouTube. I&#x27;ve always been envious of how wonderful skin products are readily available in Asia but not in the states so I was glad to find this one easily on amazon. I counted the days until arrival and tried this product right away. Of course, I was a little suspicious, that&#x27;s just my nature, but this works wonderfully. My skin feels so clean and smooth after using this and it healed my acne faster than time alone plus prevented and fixed scars, which was way beyond what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews, I was hesitant because I was afraid this product would make me break out, I don&#x27;t want whitening products, and if they said the skin really did show that it was removed, I was afraid by how much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still chose to give it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I break out when I have had too much dairy, food high in sugar and stress.  My breakouts are very deep under the skin, so waiting for it to finally surface or reduce can be a long process at times. I hardly get redness, but when the blemish begins to surface then it get slightly red. This past month consumed my time with back-to-back birthdays and BBQs (quite a good summer), but by early Aug. the effects were beginning to show on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this mainly because I had a few breakouts which left scars on my face since early Aug and I have been aching for them to go away.  I did have an exfoliant (St. Ives) but it wasn&#x27;t doing the job. Another really annoying detail about these particular breakout were that although it was mainly scar tissue, I still felt the bump from the clogged pore underneath (SO ANNOYING).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long review short, I purchased this Aug. 26th.  It was delivered Aug. 28th (Prime).  I used it the same day.  I washed my face and let it dry for 30 minutes and I use a small amount on my entire face (a dry face).  One thing I noticed right away was that I really did feel and see skin debris on my face (gently rub) I was astonished BC I have never seen this with any other exfloliant I&#x27;ve use before.  I only rubbed for a minute or 2 because I got nervous that even with gentle rubbing, I might loose my face. At this same time I remembered that I had not yet tried it on a small portion of my face to test it first.  I rinse with warm water, then cool water and pat dried. I immediately noticed the scar tissue on my breakouts got smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Aug. 30th I have not used the Cure exfoliator since. I have only cleansed and moisturized.  I am not sure yetif it is wise to use this on a daily basis.  Now, I have no visible scar tissue at all. There is a slight shade of the scar, but I have to get close to the mirror to see it.  The bump under the scar tissue has significantly gotten smaller and I have smaller but fewer breakouts since.  I am impressed and I will not use any other exfoliator unless this product becomes ineffective overtime.</li>
            <li> love this product. after first use, my skin feels so much smoother. it definitely is a gentle yet effective exfoliator. love this product so much!</li>
            <li> So, I tested this applying to the back of my hand in several applications in a row, each time the amount of &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; became less and less until nothing more came off. It actually began to tingle/burn a bit by the final application indicating I may be doing it to much. So it would appear actual skin is being sloughed off and it&#x27;s doing what it claims. I can say my face feels extremely soft after use and my Nerium is back to making my skin bright again as it&#x27;s penetrating deep into my pores. Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It renewed my skin and my husband&#x27;s (we are in our 50s/60s). Returning to order a second bottle of Cure to keep on hand. Best return on my beauty dollar investment ever.</li>
            <li> Works very well, always see a difference, and people comment on my skin more. Problem is I sent samples to friends  in tiny Ziploc baggies thru the mail, and used half the bottle. BUT  everyone loves it and wants more,. Hope they buy their own. I &#x27;ve created cure junkies...</li>
            <li> Has done wonders for my skin and it feels renewed and glowing.  I don&#x27;t know if we have anything like this product in U.S. for this price.</li>
            <li> This product makes you think that you are removing dead skin cells but it doesn&#x27;t! It was a waste of money for me. Save your money instead of spending on marketing trick!</li>
            <li> this is realy amazing stuff. I buy it just to use on my feet sometimes, tho is great for many places. I recommend washing whatver body part youre exfoliating first tho, or you will just be using it to remove a layer of dirt as opposed to dead skin.</li>
            <li> I swear, this is the best of its kind.  I&#x27;m someone whose really touchy about any blemish on my skin, and unfortunatly I was genetically blessed with oily skin prone to breakouts.  I&#x27;ve been all over the skincare board (holika holika, baviphat, ect) but this is awesome, It really does get rid of excess skin leaving soft and ready for lotion/mask skin, I&#x27;ve really noticed an improvment with my skincare routine and people have commented how nice my skin is looking.  for best results I found every other day works best (at least for my skin)combined with a nice mask afterwrds. most deffinatly worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Meh it&#x27;s an alright product. I wish it came with English instructions. Trying to explain it to others is such a hassle . It was packed okay.</li>
            <li> Amazing, that&#x27;s the best word I could give to describe this product! I never thought a product like this ever existed! Dead skin practically falls off your face!</li>
            <li> I got the sample of this, but will be buying this one. This stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s for any type of skin, because it&#x27;s made up of mostly hydrogen water. When you start rubbing the product onto your face, you can really see the dead skin cells. After I finish washing my face, it feels incredibly smooth and much like baby skin.</li>
            <li> I just got my bottle in after I seen the 5 star reviews, so I tried it last night and it was really crazy because it&#x27;s just a gel you don&#x27;t feel beads or anything in it, after 1 minute of rubbing it in you Can feel the little balls of dead skin it&#x27;s insane! I have super sensitive skin blemishes and mild acne and there are very few products I can use or my skin freaks out but with this I took a risk to try it and I woke up today and my irritation isn&#x27;t as bad and it made my skin feel so soft and smooth and CLEAN! I&#x27;ve been using shisiedo pureness face wash and ill for sure exfoliate with this 2x a week. Highly recommend this to skin of all types!</li>
            <li> This my very favorite beauty product ever!  It&#x27;s amazing!  It exfoliates so very gently...no irritation or redness at all.  And it leaves skin feeling so smooth; I have a hard time keeping my hands away from my face!  One great thing about it is that it allows other products like serums or moisturizers to be absorbed more effectively, so it really is worth the price.  It&#x27;s also fun to use.  I recommend it to anybody who will listen, and I have given it as a gift several times!  And this last purchase came with directions in English (most do not).  An amazing product!</li>
            <li> I love it, after using, my skin feel like baby skin.</li>
            <li> Damn,  was I hesitant to spend so much on an exfoliation product from Japan. But hell now I&#x27;ll be spending $30 on foreign skincare the rest of my life, this product is a miracle worker! You don&#x27;t have to let it sit on your face till it gets milky to use it and get the little skin rice things but you DO have to use it on dry, clean skin. It does go on a bit watery and smells similar to rubbing alcohol, and it also takes your skin off and collects it into balls of it I was so excited the first night I got it, I went a bit overboard. After the first use, an entire layer of skin was gone and revealed maybe five whiteheads I&#x27;ve never seen before that were lurking under the surface of my skin. The second round produced even more &amp;#34;skin rice&amp;#34; than the first time and I was starting to see my skin transform, it didn&#x27;t look like the face I had started with, it was significantly brighter. Third round and I really strived to reduce my acne scars, with not much success I did a fourth and final washing which left my face burning at the corners of my nose.  That&#x27;s when I stopped and applied my moisturizer. The next morning my face is now more evenly textured and silky. The bottle is a pretty good size of this stuff for $30 and will last me for months.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly!!! My skin feels great!!</li>
            <li> I got my husband and I to use this and it&#x27;s AMAZING! I am asian-american, japanese descent, I have really sensitive skin and I was trying to use more asian products to see if it would help my skin. It&#x27;s great because there isn&#x27;t all the grit that some exfoliator have so it is really gentle, when I used it I got so much skin off the first time it was a little gross! My husband, who is caucasian, has a tendency to have ingrown hairs when he shaves, and this seems to help a little by removing the dead skin. It really makes your skin feel really soft too! It arrived here really fast and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff it is a reaalllly good gentle exfoliator!</li>
            <li> Very light weight, gentle gel, was immediately effective in exfoliating my face and neck.  Pore size was also diminished.  Will continue to use and look forward to long term results!</li>
            <li> Not an actual exfoliator. I&#x27;m not sure of the science behind the gel but I am certain it is not removing visible layers of skin.  It would do nicely for a skin massage and leaves a silky feel behind.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the purchase, however.</li>
            <li> My favorite peeling gel! I&#x27;ve tried many brands. Cheap ones, expensive ones. Cure is my go to brand. Never dries out on me no matter how long I&#x27;ve had it. Also, you get at least twice the amount of product for roughly the same price compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working weekly on my hyperpigmentation and exfoliation is key. The Cure Aqua Gel gives me a leg up on exfoliation. I do weekly Lactic peels but wanted to make sure that in between I was getting in a gentle exfoliation to make the peel more effective. Cure Aqua Gel works, it is crazy how much skin I get with each use. I&#x27;m sure that once I complete my lactic acid peels, I won&#x27;t see as much skin but I will continue to use Cure and keep it in my skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> Works great, just as advertised!</li>
            <li> I have not used the product much to see real result, but I have noticed that my skin after gets really soft afterwards . it says in the bottle to leave the product for few min then scrub it out, emmm but it gets very dray &amp; kinda sticky so your skin might get irritated .. so I would advice not to wait and work with the product right away.</li>
            <li> This is similar to Thomas Roth&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have flaky skin on my forehead and cheeks and this product does a great job of removing my flaky skin! I&#x27;ve used scrubs and the Clarisonic, but they were never that great at removing the flaky skin on my face. The smell of this product is not that great, but the results are definitely worth it! My skin feels pretty soft and smooth afterwards. Would definitely purchase the Cure again if I run out, but the bottle seems like it will last a while even though I use it about 2-3x a week.</li>
            <li> Those who are saying they dont like it cause it&#x27;s  breaking them out umm it&#x27;s suppose to do that in the beginning. That&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s a great product. It bring all the sirt and grim to the surface so yeah ur gonna breakout in the beginning, but you have to go through it. Then for those who think the exfoliation is to harsh... again it&#x27;s suppose to get rid of dead skin. It seems harsh the first few uses cause it&#x27;s trying to get rid of all the crap on your face. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a year. It broke me out and took alot of nasty skin off, but now my skin is bright and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Good enough for me. My face feels clean without being dry thanks to this exfoliator.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazeballs. It&#x27;s a great exfoliator, and my skin feels so soft after using it. I use about 2-3 times a week as part of a Korean skincare regiment and will definitely purchase again. It&#x27;s great if scrubs and brushes are too harsh on your skin or cause your skin to become red- I&#x27;ve never had a harsh reaction from this product and my skin can be very finicky.</li>
            <li> Hate that I can&#x27;t read the instructions, LOvE thyou product. My face tone has is more even and my skin insanely soft. I have had it for 3 months and use it roughy 2x/week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a month now. Rotating every other day. Not harsh. Leaves skin feeling smooth. I&#x27;ve notice some fading in old acne scars.  More even and brighter skin!</li>
            <li> All the positive reviews got it right. This is the best exfoliator out there - gentle, yet very effective.</li>
            <li> Weird but works wonders for my skin. Definitely make sure your hands and face are dry when you apply the gel. Rinse with warm water until your face feels smooth and clean. Done!</li>
            <li> As soon as you start rubbing this gel on your face it turns into an extremely soft exfoliator -- very unique and extremely effective; it left my face feeling smooth and fresh!  I definitely will keep using Cure Natural Aqua Gel in my beauty regime, I can&#x27;t believe it took me this long to find/hear about it!</li>
            <li> Product works as described, I can see the dead skin cells sloughing off. I haven&#x27;t noticed too much difference in my skin though.</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T BELIEVE HOW THIS PRODUCT WORKS! MY SKIN IS SMOOTHER AND CLEARER! THE BEST EVER EXFOLIATOR!! I WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE IN THE FUTURE!!</li>
            <li> Consistency was like watered down jello.  A complete waste of money... no better than plain water.</li>
            <li> Does as it is supposed to! Great result  indeed. Works gently and exfoliate very well. Recommended for every female on the planet! Delivers on time.</li>
            <li> If I do not exfoliate my skin will start feeling rough like sand paper yet most exfoliants will turn my sensitive skin beet red.  I like how this has not caused any sensitivity reaction to my skin and leaves it soft for days!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will probably order again</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle yesterday and just tried it out. My skin has never been so smooth, seriously.  WOW.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a must have, especially if you have oily/ blackhead prone skin. It&#x27;s so satisfying seeing all the gunk that comes off your skin.</li>
            <li> This will make your face ridiculously soft. A great exfoliant that is gentle on your skin. Asia knows what&#x27;s up with good skin. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Does not work. Gel  does not lather . Does not exfoliate. Beware if you try this they will only give you half  your money back if you do not like it</li>
            <li> Really love this product. I have very sensitive, mature skin. After several uses my skin was always left bright, calm, &amp; smooth- most products leave my face very red. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER seen such an effective product in my life. This is the miracle worker of the skin care product world. If you are doubting getting this than stop right there! Look up a few youtube videos and watch this product in action than place your order. You need this even if you don&#x27;t think you do.</li>
            <li> I am African American with normal deep chocolate colored skin. Often times than not, mainstream products here in America aren&#x27;t suited for &#x27;our&#x27; skin. This product surpassed my expectations. It was gentle on my skin yet tough at removing dead skin. For me personally, I used it twice to get the desired results. My skin looked brighter and glowing...and not particularly lighter if that makes sense. I noticed some reviewers said they use it everyday. Although this product is gentle, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that because it still is a chemical of the sort and your skin will probably be red raw and dry. I use it 1-2x a week.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out but I also feel like this is way too gentle. The sloughing skin happened once then I use this once every week and I have not seen any change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried my share of exfoliators and while the pilling off of dead skin beads is a cool effect this doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling as clean or as smooth as a normal BHA or AHA exfoliator. It&#x27;s over priced for a mediocre job. I began using it as a full body exfoliator just to use it up and it was decent at that but again, nothing special, for an extraordinary price. After my disappointment I did some research about it online to figure out exactly HOW water was supposed to be used as an exfoliator. Apparently, as I suspected, it doesn&#x27;t, the reason it pills up on skin like that is because something in the product clumps around oil, not skin. Which is why it will &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; less the second use on the same skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it IS good for is use as a makeup remover! The gel immediately clings to the makeup and pulls it off with the top layer of skin, easy to see when you&#x27;ve cleaned it all because the beads run white again. Also you still have to cleanse after use anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s neat gimmick but it&#x27;s over priced and just isn&#x27;t worth your time if you&#x27;re just looking for an exfoliator.  If you’re looking for a fun toy to play with your skin? Well then you decided if it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Do not worry about the cost - this is the BEST. THING. EVER. I have uber sensitive skin and tried it on a patch of my hand first. My skin is so happy and yes - I do use it everywhere. A little goes a long way and really helps to maintain. If you buy it with one of the nylon towels, you can exfoliate and then hop in the shower for a full rinse.  Made my face only a bit angry (will do once a month maybe) but there were no lasting horrors once rinsed and the result is everything...</li>
            <li> This product is the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used so far. I have tried other beaded or brush exfoliators and don&#x27;t find them as effective or gentle as this product. Other exfoliation products with beads does not do the job quite effectively and those that has the brush system is too harsh on the skin. The Cure Natural Aqua Gel is very gentle for even sensitive skin. It does not include perfumes or colors or most of any strong chemicals for my sensitive skin. You will have to get the instructions online through a search or read reviews of how reviewers have instructed on how to use this, because the instructions on the bottle is not in English. It is very simple to use. I prefer to wash my face and then apply one full pump of this product onto my clean, dried hands first, and then onto my dry face, in a quick circular motion (to prevent the product from drying too fast), then continue rubbing the facial skin back and forth or in circular motions until you sense that most of the &amp;#34;dead&amp;#34; or dry skin has flaked off of the face. You will literally feel and see the dead skin flakes on your face come off. I have tried also doing the top and bottom eyelid areas as well, with good results...keeping in mind to exfoliate less around the eye area than the rest of the face because it is more sensitive with thinner skin. You could literally exfoliate other parts of the body too if desired, but I have not tried that. I have not experienced any redness, itching, or discomfort post-use. It comes in a pump that is a good size for extensive use. I have only used it for a month now and use it on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. I think if I even use it more frequently, that I would not have any problems or be sensitive with it. Overall, it is an inexpensive purchase for the amount and its effectively. I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about for this product. It gets rid of your dead skin but it doesn&#x27;t smell or feel great when you use it. It smells like a hint of chlorex and feels like dense watery liquid. I prefer the Korean massage cream products that does the same exact thing but smells much nicer and allows you to massage your face as well as take off your dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product. Got it super fast, it was well wrapped and came with English instructions. I followed the instructions exactly, and noticed the little beads. However, afterwards, my skin felt SO tight and dry, even after I had put moisturizer on. The next morning, I noticed that my skin was peeling a bit. I figured it was just because it was dry due to all the heater action I&#x27;ve been having to endure this cold winter. So I tried this stuff again - tons of little beads, but still my skin was flaking. Then I did it one morning, and went shopping afterwards. In the dressing room, I noticed that my skin was really, really red - this stuff was acting like a chemical peel, not an exfoliator!!! That&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not supposed to do it more than twice a week (which, even that seems like a lot for chemical peels). I don&#x27;t know whether the beads are skin cells or not, but I do know that while I was using it, I noticed no change in my skin except more redness, more dryness, and more tenderness. Waste of good money.</li>
            <li> I have the kind of skin that burns, stings, gets bumpy, and turns beet red when I use just about anything on it. This product removes all of my dry skin and leaves my skin soft and smooth-- with no burning whatsoever. No redness or tight feeling at all! And I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> very bad,don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best skin exfoliator ever. While it sits on my face, I rub my hands together to get the dead skin off of my hands first, rinse them, dry them, and then rub my face.. Sometimes I even do this twice. Amaaaazing! My face is so smooth!</li>
            <li> My face, literally, feels squeaky clean when I wash this off as well as leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I can see why its so popular.  I can&#x27;t imagine someone not liking this unless maybe they&#x27;re allergic.</li>
            <li> It helps to remove the remnants of make-up Very little removes dead skin you I think that the best results</li>
            <li> This product is way overpriced and overhyped. When I used it, the first thing I noticed was that it smelled like alcohol. I messaged it onto dry skin as directed and saw tiny white particles. A lot of reviews state that the white particles that you see is &#x27;dead skin cell&#x27;, but I don&#x27;t believe that this is true. Afterusing it, my skin was smooth, but also dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to make my own exfoliator using brown sugar and olive oil and find that it works just as well, if not better, than this product. Bottomline is you can find or make a good exfoliator for dry and sensitive skin for a fraction of the price compare to this.</li>
            <li> Crazy how much this stuff does help exfoliate dead skin, besides that, it is fun! Reminds me if peeling glue off my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave your skin feeling very smooth, and feels like it has silicone in it. Many primers also use silicone because it does give a smooth surface. However, make sure to wash it off at night, because it can clog pores leading to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a problem with this product if I only use it every couple of days.</li>
            <li> It was a complete &amp; total bust! If I could give it 0 stars I would! This was a knock off rip off of the original! DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
            <li> This product delivers what it says it will.  Simple amazing.</li>
            <li> It worked really well, I used micro dermabrazen and it left my face inflamed and irritated. Cure was wonderful it took off all the dead skin and left my skin silky smooth and wasn&#x27;t the least bit irritated. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is A-MA-ZING!! I have used it twice in the last week, just since receiving it, and it makes my skin sooo smooth! Yes, you CAN actually see and feel the dead skin sloughing off into little &amp;#34;pills&amp;#34;.....reminds me of the Pretty Feet &amp; Hands sloughing lotion (anyone remember that stuff??). It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, just makes it feel smooth and even-textured. Honestly, I think it exfoliates much better than my $150 Clarisonic! What a bargain for such an effective product! Got here quickly. Bottles were plastic sealed and bubble wrapped. Absolutely NO complaints here! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Package came really quickly and I was happy with the product. I have very sensitive skin but this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. Will be back again! :)</li>
            <li> I use AHA&#x27;s on my skin to keep my acne away so my skin gets flaky in certain spots, and i needed something to take away the dry flakes. I was skeptical if it was just balls of goo OR really my dead dry skin being removed, so I put it to the test. I have thee worst chapped lips that produce huge layers of dead dry skin, so I rubbed this stuff on them...and OH MY GOD! Literally they just rubbed the dead crap away painlessly and effortlessly. I&#x27;m still in awe of this product. Seriously, someone must tell me how this water gel thing works! It is worth every dime! My face is luminous! I will continue buying this and recommend this product to anyone struggling with cell turn-over problems!</li>
            <li> Meh!  I haven&#x27;t observed any extraordinary exfoliation results.  There are effective exfoliation products on the market but they&#x27;re more than three times the price.  Based that you might want to try it.</li>
            <li> gentle exfoliant, not as abrasive as the mechanical formulations&lt;br /&gt;skin feels soft and supple after use&lt;br /&gt;i usually use 2-3 pumps per use. foresee long use with each bottle&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend</li>
            <li> The Cure is hands down the best exfoliator I have found, and I have tried numerous exfoliators over the years.  The product is effortless to use, and it works completely the first time leaving very soft skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This exfoliates and gets rid of my dead skin cells like there is no tomorrow. I use this product at night after I get out of the shower and in the morning my skin looks so healthy and glowy. I&#x27;ve used this about 2 months now and it has lighten my hyperpigmentation and lessen the amount of little bumps I get on my face. It is well worth the price. I wish I had found this sooner and I will keep repurchasing this forever.</li>
            <li> The best thing ever. I got so much dead skin off my face it was like magic. A day later my skin was brighter than it has been in a long time</li>
            <li> Clears face up quickly with regular use!</li>
            <li> I use this three times a week. Don&#x27;t know if the beads that form are really dead skin cells but I like how leaves my skin soft afterwards.  The first time I tried it my skin did feel raw a little bit with slight redness.  It went away the next day and the next time I used it I did not have any discomfort at all. Got this 5/11/15 and I only use two pumps at a time, I still have over 3/4 of it.  This will last me a long time for sure.  Delivery was fast from Japan and the product was well protected.  The listed price changes a lot and I got this when it was $25.  I will repurchase once the price hits that mark again even if I still have some.</li>
            <li> Good product. No real visible changes yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so</li>
            <li> Amazing . If u r familiar with Moroccan bath you will have the same result but with less effort. Apply it on my dry skin it feels like water but you start massaging and all dead skin falls down. I use it on my face and body. I&#x27;m going to buy more and more</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for a quick delivery. Perfect wrapping and Excellent product condition!!</li>
            <li> The directions say to massage product onto skin, not rub it in.  I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is.  I found the product difficult to work with, and no better than other exfoliators I&#x27;ve used.  I also didn&#x27;t like how much I had to massage/rub my skin to get the product to work.  I think that much massage/rubbing causes damage to delicate facial tissue .  I will not be reordering.  I started to use it on my feet so not to waste it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Does exactly what it says!  A great way to get off that Retin A peel!</li>
            <li> The product was water-y and not at all gel like when received. However, I attempted to use the product to see if it&#x27;d work as friction was applied to the face but it would just dry up. I don&#x27;t think that this is truly a Japanese product since my Japanese friend had bought me a similar product from Japan and it was amazing, made my skin really smooth and clean. This was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> i was very excited to purchase this producti. after using it for 2 weeks, i dont really see any difference/ improvement on my face. i have to use at least 2-3 pumps to get enough amount to use. the product will run down my fingers before i even apply it on my face with a single pump.</li>
            <li> Mild, effective and harmless, what more could you ask for? I have tried so many cleansing product including some very famous one but none of them could satisfies me as this one does. You can really feel the debris comes off after you apply it and you can feel your pore breathe after you wash it out. Toner get to absorbed faster and I can describe how good that makes me feel!! I don&#x27;t doubt that Japanese often come out with the most magical skin care products!</li>
            <li> My friend told me this product and I bought this on amazon to try.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good.  Feel my skin texture is much more smoother than before.</li>
            <li> So, I was also a bit skeptical, as it seems many people on here were at first, but this stuff is serious business. I know that it actually is working because my skin can get very peely and flaky (I know - cute), but this stuff literally strips that flaky skin away. It&#x27;s crazy and I have no idea how it works. I&#x27;m sure I can google it or something, but don&#x27;t care enough to...just knowing it works is good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried it, my skin wasn&#x27;t peeling, so I wasn&#x27;t really that sure if it worked, but as I&#x27;ve been using it (for around 3 months now), I&#x27;ve tried it many times when my skin has been peeling so I&#x27;ve been able to witness the effects well. For instance, if my skin is peeling a bit on the side of my nose, I notice that more of that white stuff appears in that particular area when I use this stuff. I now know that this &#x27;white stuff&#x27; is definitely my skin, since more comes off on the side of my nose than it does on the other parts of my face that aren&#x27;t peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m done using it, my skin feels so smooth, BUT it does get at least somewhat dryer. I just use some lotion and I&#x27;m A-OK, so not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it probably on average every other day. It&#x27;s not irritating for me, so sometimes I can use it more, but if I use it too often, I&#x27;ll notice that none of the white forms, meaning no skin is coming off. If no skin is coming off, I don&#x27;t see that there&#x27;s a point. So, I would say there&#x27;s no need to use it more than every other day and for some people, I&#x27;m sure even less than that. For me, I like to use it fairly often to manage the flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is relatively expensive, but the bottle is a fair size and I&#x27;ve been using it a lot (as I said, probably every other day on avg.) and I still have about 1/4 of it left after 3 months. Also, I think I&#x27;ve been applying an excessive amount each time I use it. I tend to overindulge like that. But, I&#x27;m sure those who moderate how much they use could geteven more out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I do get acne sometimes and I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement with the breakouts. I think it is partially this stuff, but it may also be that (pro-tip) I don&#x27;t wash my face every morning with a cleanser anymore. This really worked for me with my acne. I think I was drying out my face too much, which was in turn also probably causing more of that flakiness, which I think would trap dirt and oil under my skin. This may not work for everyone, but I think more people should consider not washing their face every morning with anything other than water. At least it worked for me, so can&#x27;t hurt to try for others I suppose...</li>
            <li> I finally took the plunge and splurge and I am glad I did usually 30 something for a face wash is too much for me, but this bottle will last a while. I started using it once a week, but once I stopped shedding or having the beads formed I switched to once a month. it does not smell, it is gentle on my skin, and I have no reaction to it whatsoever. I do follow up with an actual cleanser every now and again, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin thirsty, like some face wash/exfoliator does when your face start to itch or you feel it getting taunt. I would recommend and buy again once I eventually run out also the price is accurate as it is also around 30 bucks in Japan prob a lil more due to the rate exchange.</li>
            <li> I find this gel very harsh, it is definitely not a very good option for someone whose skin is sensitive. Also, it is quite expensive for an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> They send me a set of 4 rechargeable batteries!!! And they put &#x27;cure natural aqua gel&#x27; sticker on it! What the fxxx!!!</li>
            <li> Okay I have a clarsonic and I believed that I was exfoliating enough (About once a week) I have dry/normal skin and I&#x27;m not prone to breakouts. This product has shone me the light! Simple to use, effective, and does what it claims! I&#x27;m all over this! My holy grail product! You just take a small amount and rub on a dry face and BAM! You get these little white balls of dead skin! It&#x27;s a water based product so it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and get all the dead skin cells off. I&#x27;m pregnant right now and my skin was started to act up, this product got me right back on track. Simple to use,and Works! Highly recommended for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> great product leaves the skin so soft  I use it where the sun damage is on my body and face . It exfoilates great</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing I use it twice a week and it has made a difference in my skins appearance since I started using it it really removes the dead skin and build up my face wash doesn&#x27;t remove, after every usey face feels cleaner and smoother and brighter. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and I have hardly made a dent in the bottle it lasts a long time u really on need 2 pumps each use.</li>
            <li> I came across a YouTube video giving a demonstration and review of the aqua gel. After doing more research I was sold and bought a bottle the same day. I got my package on a Tuesday after ordering it the previous Saturday. This stuff really works! It&#x27;s gentle and natural so that was a plus for me and it removed a TON of dead skin that had been built up on my face for ages. When reading the instructions in English it says use once to twice a week but my skin is so dry and flaky I use it every night with my clarisonic mia and it has helped my skin&#x27;s texture and it has help fade acne scars.</li>
            <li> My Face is so soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;All the dead skins cells are removed and my skin feels cleaner and more lighter ^^</li>
            <li> My skin felt very smooth after, and it was fun \\&quot;rubbing off the skin the product attaches itself to like glue\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure that all of those little balls were really dead skin.  I&#x27;ve been battling flakiness from aggressive exfoliaters lately and I thought this product would fix it (plus I wanted to see what it&#x27;s cult status among beauty bloggers was about) but I still had flakiness in the morning, and that&#x27;s even after applying a moisture serum and heavy firming cream.  Again, fun product but I&#x27;m not so sure that it&#x27;s stripping the dry skin off like paint the way it seems to be-- I am thinking that it ends up being the little glue balls end up exfoliating your skin and you rub them around.  It&#x27;s an expensive gimmick. Don&#x27;t waste you money.</li>
            <li> I will never go without this product!  Erased my fine facial lines and creepiness in conjunction with Watts retinol. I use it 2-3 times per week to give my skin a satin texture. Serums work better. I use it for razor burn and on my feet and it gets where a buffer can&#x27;t.  Even use it around my eyes. Love this stuff.  My boyfriend is now addicted... No blackheads on his nose and fewer breakouts if he&#x27;d use it regularly.  Talk about brighter, clearer skin with even tone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known this product for the past 2 years ever since Bubbz made a review about it. I&#x27;ve always wanted it because its all natural, unlike the other exfoliator i&#x27;ve used in my life... This one is great for people who have sensetive skin like me, and have problesm with il face. I love this this! I can&#x27;t live without it now~ I bought 2 bottle for my mom and I, i made her try mine and she just fell in love it and so she took mien and i had to buy another bottle for me XD Anyways i&#x27;ll be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I am very light skinned, with mild sensitivity to &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; products.  This gel is the best exfoliating product I have ever used, with zero irritation.  You can actually feel dead skin coming off with use.  It leaves my skin looking healthy and smooth.  I use it daily, along with retinol products applied at night.  I now have my sister and mom addicted to it as well.  I will continue to use this as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> Garbage. Agree with other posts, the piling is NOT exfoliate skin but the product itself.</li>
            <li> This has no effect, its basically water with some kind of foaming agent.... Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does get the skin clean of impurities, I notice it helps make my pores smaller, but the price is way up there. I thought it would help with acne too, it does get the swelling down, but it doesn&#x27;t prevent future breakouts, so it makes me wonder just how much dirt and oil it&#x27;s removing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very good,gentle and effective,my skin is sensitive and prone to Rosacea,and this suits me,I recommend it to similar skin.</li>
            <li> You really do have to try this.  There is no product like this sold anywhere in the states, that I know of.  It is quite unique-you&#x27;ll realize that as soon as you apply it.  It feels very watery and whether the white clumps are really my dead skin cells-I don&#x27;t know.  After all the exfoliating I do on a daily basis and even trying (testing)  this multiple times in a row-I still had the white clumps.  It&#x27;s a very unusual feeling (the clumps) BUT that being said-buy this.  I am 99% positive you will like it.  It does leave your skin much smoother and I do feel it is probably better than physical exfoliation-granules and such.  It is a very cool product.  Those Asians have some of the coolest and most unique makeup and skincare products.  I can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t sell it over here.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously not the #1 seller for no reason! After this, the old exfoliaters went in the trash!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I wish I&#x27;d found this sooner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused with this. I&#x27;m not convinced that&#x27;s it&#x27;s actually exfoliating my dead skin.......but hasn&#x27;t broke me out. Pretty gentle. So its ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 4 months and its by far the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve used, beating out my Clarisonic. The initial 2 seconds of applying, you think its not working because you don&#x27;t feel anything. But as you continue to gently massage your face, the dead skin starts rubbing off and you&#x27;d be surprised at just how much comes off. Unlike other exfoliators, this is very gentle on the skin and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a decrease in breakouts. Recommended it to my sisters!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says, but requires quite a lot of rubbing to get the results it claims. Not sure if that is god for the delicate facial skin. I have used it in the shower and can&#x27;t imagine that it would rinse off completely at the sink.</li>
            <li> I got this because of the reviews, and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  When I used it, I was stunned, utterly stunned at how effective it is.&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the best exfoliation product around, gentle and effective.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more, and likely gifting it to others as well.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the all caps, but I&#x27;m so happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;mma tell you a little story.  It&#x27;s long, but at least it&#x27;s boring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 years ago I was googling blackhead remover, hoping to find some tool.  Instead I found this gel stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It was made in Singapore, but they had a US distributor, and at $20 for a 2 oz tube, it was a little pricey, but I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, the price went up to $30, the US distributor decided to stop carrying it so I had to pay shipping from Singapore, the formula changed so it didn&#x27;t work quite as well...I still kept buying it, because it was that good.  I even considered applying to be a US distributor myself, just so I could be sure to get it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple years ago, I used up the last of my big order (to justify the shipping), went to re-order it, and the US price had gone up to $60 for a 2 oz tube.  When I emailed them to see if that was a mistake, my email bounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since, I&#x27;ve tried to find something similar, and had resigned myself to the fact that it was lost to me forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I happened across Cure while browsing skin care stuff on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it immediately, and it came in today (2 days).  As soon as I rubbed it on my face and those little balls of oil &amp; dead skin cells started forming, I knew this was the stuff.  THE STUFF!  :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I paid here for 250ml was not very much more than I was paying for a tiny 50ml tube, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have given it a poor rating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Be sure you&#x27;re applying to a clean, completely dry face.  Clean isn&#x27;t as important as dry.&lt;br /&gt;* Gently rub it in for at least 30 seconds.  It&#x27;s very liquidy and glides across your skin, you don&#x27;t need to rub hard.&lt;br /&gt;* You&#x27;ll feel little balls of oil &amp; dead skin forming.&lt;br /&gt;* Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;* If my face is feeling particularly rough, I&#x27;ll give it another round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have found my stuff!</li>
            <li> the instructions are all in japanese; i had to go online to get instructions in english. i used it about 4 times and have not noticed any difference. it could be because i regularly use other exfoliating products.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me.  I find it a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Does what it says remove all impurities.</li>
            <li> Product seems like what other reviewers described. It doesnt exfoliate skin, its the gel itself that balls up.</li>
            <li> They let you believe that it gets rid of dead skin cells, but it&#x27;s just a chemical reaction... Just a waste of money and I wish I did more research before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I was having an issue with my skin this fall/winter where it was very dry and there was a top layer of skin that did not want to shed. I had used a light chemical peel to remove the skin and that did not work. I had continuous patches of dry skin that were just stuck and could not be removed. I bought CURE based on the numerous reviews and boy, this does not disappoint. I applied and a bunch of flakes came off, I applied, and applied and after 20 minutes my skin has about 80% back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;The skin coloration had lighten and was brighter. This item does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Has completly changed my skin for the better. Has helped with blemishes and pigmentation from old acne. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other asian peeling products and this one ranks at the bottom. It does a poor job with peeling and reeks of alcohol. It says its a natural aqua gel but I can definitely smell alcohol in the product. It breaks me out every time I use it and does a horrible job with peeling. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is the type I have always wanted, very good， I like it,you can use it everyday,it is safe to you</li>
            <li> Whether i want it or need it? Not really. It is more a want than need. It is doing as advertised. I have sensitive skin so it may not be very suitable for me. Price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile now and it&#x27;s amazing.  I have sensitive skin that seem to break out or turn red at every single thing i use on it. But i did not experience any redness or breakout with this exfoliator. It&#x27;s very gentle on your face  and it  really does clean out dead skin. After I use this on my face, it feels clean and refreshed. I&#x27;ve also noticed an improvement in the quality of my skin after a few uses.I highly recommend this to everyone and will def be buying this again. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but it this bottle will last you a while and it&#x27;s worth it in the long run if you think about how much you spend on cheaper products that you end up tossing after one use  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I originally bought it for my face and it worked so well I thought I would try it on the spots I had psoriasis and it is working!! Nothing else I have ever tried has worked but this has almost got it all cleared up!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible!  After using this every 2-3 days (recommended is twice/week, FYI) for a week and a half, my skin feels smoother than I ever remember it feeling... and I used to have regularly-scheduled microdermabrasions!</li>
            <li> Way too much alcohol. Dried out my skin. Use the VIVA Exfoliating Gel instead. Same product - not bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> Skin looks healthier now.  Easy to use. Clean smelling. Exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li> The most incredible product ever!!!!  Lives up to it reputation and would buy again.  Long lasting</li>
            <li> Love this peel, just rub in circular motions all over your face and watch all the dead skin turn into white little lint sized balls on your face.  Especially around the forehead and nose. It leaves your skin so smooth and silky, i use it only once a week as part of my facial regime. It&#x27;s too abrasive for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real. It&#x27;s not even Memorex. This product and the many like it do not crumble up your dead skin as soon you apply the product. The crumbles start beforehand, in your hand. Try it on a porous surface, like an inconspicuous piece of a leather product. Try it on your shoe. You get the same effect. I have brown skin and even my dead skin is tinted brown. When I&#x27;ve gotten peels in the past (after having skin cleaned of course) my dead skin would come off tinted. Do you mean to tell me that when I use this product, all of the sudden my dead skin turns white? C&#x27;mon. I&#x27;ve gotten better peels from Elmer&#x27;s glue!</li>
            <li> I bought it, I tried it, I am totally underwhelmed.  I do not believe the little white specks are my skin, I think it is the mixture forming them.  My skin feels the same and I feel ripped off.  It&#x27;s 2014, seriously, why can&#x27;t we have English instructions and ingredients.  Sony and scads of other companies have managed to speak English for years now.  Don&#x27;t buy this stuff.  The best I can say is, it hasn&#x27;t done any actual harm to my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years, but be warned!  You can burn your skin with this product if you&#x27;re using other products that exfoliate your skin.  I did and it hurt so much :( be careful.  It&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before and it worked completely different. I&#x27;m not sure if this a fake or what but it&#x27;s very watery and it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in the exfoliating department. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works well to remove dead skin--I use twice a week and haven&#x27;t had breakouts in months.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I use it every weekend. .</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not sure if it really works</li>
            <li> I brought this based on the good reviews and I really like it. I use it couple times a week especially in the summer when my oily prone skin gets clog too easily. It&#x27;s really is gentle and my face does not feel dry afterward. I even brought one for my mom. Great product. The price go up and down the first time I brought it it&#x27;s $35.00 and the second time it&#x27;s 28.00.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean but I don&#x27;t see any improvements yet. I use it once week because my face is sensitive</li>
            <li> Very impressed even after the first try. I was a little skeptical that a semi-watery goo could exfoliate.  Where were the beads?  Where was the sandpapery finish and redness that I had come to expect?  In fact, I needed none of those and my skin still came away smoother and cleaner than before.  I can see why this is a bestselling product. A country of exfoliators can&#x27;t be wrong.  Try it and your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I love this product!  Would definitely recommend it to anyone over 60.  It cleaned my skin, and left me feeling polished and refreshed.  I was amazed at how clean and soft it left my face.  Since I have just started with this product, I can&#x27;t speak about the long term effects yet.  Will update if there is anything to report.  So far, I am very pleased, and would highly recommend Cure!</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic, pure and simple!! I use Differin and when my skin gets dry it only takes one use of this and it&#x27;s like a miracle occurred. Now I see why people pay that price! I maybe end up using this once a week or so, so definitely worth the price and should last me a decently long time!</li>
            <li> This product does make your face feel soft but I don&#x27;t think the small balls are dead skin cells I think its just the product drying.. also if you have facial hair or fuzz this will be a pain in the butt to remove.</li>
            <li> There is no other exfoliator like CURE. Hands down. It literally takes off all your dead skin without irritation. I just lotion up afterwards and my face is soft as a baby&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li> A must have for Retin-A users. I use this daily and pump 2 servings onto my face and it isn&#x27;t leaving it raw or &#x27;too exfoliated&#x27; as other users have stated. Before, my skin was peeling heavily from retinol use and now it&#x27;s smooth, bright, and clear. Much better than a gritty, granules based exfoliating face wash although using it daily is really impacting the volume of the bottle. Will need to re order soon.</li>
            <li> Removes dead skin like none other. Skin sloughs off and pills in your hand when particularly applied to dry skin. Nice and gentle exfoliation!</li>
            <li> excellent exfoliator of dead skin!</li>
            <li> absolutly freaky how good this stuff is and how well it works. buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Saw the claims about this product online and thought I would give it a try.  I am always trying new products and this is now at the top of my favorite list.  I could feel the dead skin rolling off my face as I was massaging this product in.  I rinsed and did a second treatment because I could feel the difference in skin texture and knew there were a couple of areas I had not focused on the first time.  Amazing, I think I need to stock up on this stuff  :)</li>
            <li> Magic...makes your skin glow like nothing else.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It really worked to remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> not sure what all the hype is about. I am not noticing any bit of different after a month of using it.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything to help exfoliate my skin.</li>
            <li> First let me say that this is the best product i have ever tried. My skin felt completely different after the first time, a lot softer and smoother. No more scrubbing and damaging the skin with abrasive exfoliants, this does the job that even the most expensive once can not. My husband even tried it and loved t. My make-up sits better, and my skin tone is more ever. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has blackheads, dry skin, or un-even blemishes.</li>
            <li> I just received this and only used once. I followed the directions (in English stuck on bottle). I got very little beading and was not sure if what beading I got was deal skin or the product thats why I am leaving a 4 star rating,  My face did feel much smoother after using. Product was easy to wash off and I had not irritation which was good since I have sensitive skin. Item as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen exfoliators from different countries (that includes U.S, Japan and Korea) prior trial of this product, but I have to say that this is the FIRST exfoliator that is the most gentle, non-irritated product yet exfoliates the most off my face.  As a matter of fact, it worked so well, I let my husband tried. and him, having no experience with exfoliating products, over-rubbed his cheek and turned a bit red.  but we were extremely impressed with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we think it&#x27;s a fantastic product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Its ok. HHaven&#x27;t seen big difference yet</li>
            <li> I use this on days that I feel cloggy or grimy and let me tell you, it does WONDERS. I always feel 100% clean when I&#x27;m done! Although I think the &amp;#34;Skin peeling off&amp;#34; thing is a gimmick because i tried putting it on a plastic surface and mess around with it a bit and it did get a little bit more clumpy so i think its more of a heat thing, I&#x27;m not too sure. But it does make me feel clean!</li>
            <li> So far I really like it. My skin is pretty normal. However, now that I am 30, I do notice my skim in a little dryer. I use a sugar scrub/mask once a week as well, but my akin never feels as smooth as when I use this. It&#x27;s super simple to use and only takes a few mins to do. I use the sugar scrub on Wed and this on Sat. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> First things first: it arrived on time and the instructions were translated in English on the back (very helpful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to order this given the occasional bad review saying it didn&#x27;t work and it was just the product balling up on your face. I had it saved for a while and when it dropped $5 in price, I thought why not try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh. My. God. You guys. If you have dry, flaky skin and no matter how much you exfoliate you&#x27;re still peeling, buy this now. I have horrible skin and I&#x27;ve found the Salux towel for my body but it&#x27;s really harsh on facial skin. But if I wasn&#x27;t using that, I was honestly scratching dead skin off my face with my nails. I would get out of the shower and have clear signs of trauma, but it was either that or peel 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the box arrived, I immediately opened it and ran to the bathroom. So much skin came off! I used it a second time because I figured if it was just the product balling up it wouldn&#x27;t hurt anything. After the second time, my face squeaked! There were also some spots that felt over exfoliated so it was definitely taking skin off. I can&#x27;t wait to use this instead of damaging my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think about it anymore! Buy it!</li>
            <li> It is everything that ppl said on their reviews. I love it. It makes my face soft and clean. Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like it so mutch&lt;br /&gt;And soft</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything whatsover! I work with skincare and ordered to try since I heard positive review. It&#x27;s just a gimmick. I dont&#x27; even want to spend my time to describe how it dosn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly as advertised. No abrasions on your skin. No more rubbing microscopic beads without results. This gel soaks up all the impurities and as your rub, forms little clumps of dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited about this exfoliator after trying it out...and have been using it on all my friends :) My boyfriend loves this!</li>
            <li> A year ago I purchased similar product (Obey Your Body) at Kiosk in Las Vegas.  A mere 50ml for a whopping $100!  I loved THAT product, but the price was ridiculous.  I read comments on this one and decided to give it a try.  Considering that you get 250ml for a mere $36, this, hands down, is my new go-to bottle.    You Tube has several videos on how to use it.  I like the one listed below.  [...]    Be sure to shake the bottle well, (alittle might run down your wrist).  Use a DRY cloth to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; off accumulated dead skin balls.  Follow up with a gentle face wash or just wet cloth.  Along the jaw line you might need to \\&quot;pluck\\&quot; off some debris from the fine hairs.    This product makes my 57 year old skin look and feel rejuvenated.  Sometimes I use it twice in a row to ensure my skin is completely dead-skin cell cleansed.  Ladies of any age should use it..    I then moisturize with Rohto Hadalabo Gokuyn Hyaluronic Acid Cream -- it is very gentle. My skin feel like \\&quot;butter\\&quot; afterwards.</li>
            <li> Since the writing on the bottle is in Japanese and there were no instructions included I have no idea how to use it. I gave it 3 stars as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s a good product so I guess i&#x27;ll goggle for instructions.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my teenage nieces after I first discovered this in a store in Little Tokyo. My friends and I had seen this in a previous store and read how it was sold every 20 seconds in Japan. While that sounded impressive, I wasn&#x27;t about to shell out $40 for it! Then we walked into the next store which had a tester! We proceeded to test it on our hands and were blown away when we saw what was coming off. I decided to splurge and don&#x27;t regret my decision. I am a true believer in the benefits of exfoliation. While I&#x27;m a fan of Paula&#x27;s Choice products and use her 2%BHA liquid as part of my daily routine I had been looking for an additional exfoliating product. I have somewhat sensitive skin and had stopped using my Clarisonic Mia because it was causing dry patches and I&#x27;ve tried Retin-A in the past, but always found it too harsh and drying.  Now, I&#x27;ve found this amazing product and absolutely love it! I use it 2 times a week and I&#x27;m still amazed and excited to see the dead skin coming off my face! I&#x27;ll admit at first I got a bit over-enthusiastic and used it every 2-3 days but found it was too drying so, for me, twice a week is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have noted, you must wait until your face is completely dry, after washing, before using Cure. Then I start applying it to my face, one pump at a time, using a total of 3-5 pumps. After I&#x27;ve covered my face and neck, I slowly start rubbing, then rinse. Your face will feel amazing and baby soft and perfect to absorb your skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do also agree with other reviewers that not all of the white gunk is actual dead skin, but is in fact a polymer. I took some in a small travel bottle for a trip because I could not imagine going a week without using this product. When I got back home, I used up the remaining product, then washed out the bottle only to find a whitish residue inside. That being said, I also believe that it IS exfoliating your skin which mixes with the polymer. It&#x27;s harder to tell on your face, but if you try rubbing the inside of your wrist with some of the excess white fluid that ends up running down your hands, you&#x27;ll see small grayish rolls of skin coming off. Anyone who has used an exfoliating glove or had a massage at a Korean Spa knows what rolls of dead skin look like. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m convinced Cure is actually exfoliating all that dead skin and it just makes my face feel wonderful and clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, The bottle I purchased in Little Tokyo had English instructions and list of ingredients and it recommended using the product within 6 months of opening.</li>
            <li> This is like glue that you can&#x27;t get off your face. The little bits that appear are not dead skin cells. They are solidified product, and they are like bits of glue that stick to your skin. Yuck!  I hate to waste, but I poured this down the drain and hoped it didn&#x27;t cause a gooey clog.</li>
            <li> I learned of this product by a beauty blogger you tube just because I like clean my face and remove all the dead cells leaving my skin clean and soft</li>
            <li> Magical. This is by far one of the best face washes that I ever used. I also use face masks to cleanse my skin and this product works really the same as ANY good quality face washing product. Thank you for helping me and for ensuring delivery. Thank you for ALL you do.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of peels, and all have been troublesome. Cure works effectively and you do not have to worry about burning your skin etc. It is very good to use if you are using retin a or tazorac and have the flakey skin issues. This will remove the flakey skin.</li>
            <li> Have not heard any negatives from the sister-in-law.</li>
            <li> I wish this would have been available to me 40 years ago! I&#x27;m sending some to my daughter in law. She spends a fortune on laser treatments. This is by far much kinder to the skin and has amazing results. Using this along with Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyalurnic Acid Lotion (moist).</li>
            <li> No good. So drying to skin. It doesn&#x27;t even make a lather when I rubbed it on my face. It doesn&#x27;t clean or remove dirt. I don&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, you will be just wasting money like I did. I really thought that its worth it coz I saw a lot of good reviews here in amazon but it&#x27;s not the way it is.</li>
            <li> Exfoliates without irritation. and its gentle for sensitive skin!! I love it. Will be using for life!!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This product works! When I got the product my face had terrible brown patches belows my jowels from a build up of dead skin cells which the current products I was using just decided not to work anymore. The first time I used this it removed those patches. OMG. I am not so sure that the white ball stuff are dead skin cells, but I have gotten into a routine of using the product twice a week and there are considerably less balls than in the begining. It is messy to use, and I will do the lower portion of my face, rinse, and do another area. If it dries on the skin, the balls are hard to get off, so beware of that.</li>
            <li> smells like alcohol...and I&#x27;m not sure how well it exfoliates, I feel like traditional scrubs do the same for less&lt;br /&gt;But, if you have sensitive skin and only want the most gentle exfoliation, then this may be for you</li>
            <li> Love the product.. My daughter n I were trying it out right when I got it. We were all surprise of all the dead cells we had. Good product n I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and I won&#x27;t be using it again. It reeked of alcohol and I don&#x27;t see where water or any other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;  ingredients in it will cause your skin to slough off. I tried to look the product up elsewhere on the internet and all I got was hype blogs from Japan.  An awfully expensive and embarrassing purchase frankly.</li>
            <li> I have an acne prone skin and I always get break out after I use this gel, but it removes the dead skin very well. Now I only use it on my neck and the back of my hands every 1-2 weeks, then apply good quality lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff dissolves skin like other reviewers think, but after I use it my face feels very smooth, clean and exfoliated. Very gentle.</li>
            <li> Strange stuff. It works like a charm. Gets all off the dead junk off of your skin. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother it at all. Works great!  A must have for all humans.</li>
            <li> do not buy this is a waste of money it did nothing for my face the only thing this does is make little balls when rubbed into the face and the balls are not dead skin. its just the product that forms little balls when rubbed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright not like magical but it does the job and leaves your skin very soft. Don&#x27;t use it too often because i find that irritating to my skin and causes more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Amazing exfoliator - but be careful and don&#x27;t overdo! A little goes a long way. Make sure your skin is dry before using and rub very gently. The dead skin pills up -  then you simply rinse off. I have not notice any great improvement in how my skin looks though so I&#x27;m wondering if exfoliation is important after all!</li>
            <li> Okay product, exfoliates by forming little gel beads that lift away dead skin cells. In my opinion, the &amp;#34;white balls&amp;#34; you see forming aren&#x27;t actually the skin cells themselves. Overall, it&#x27;s a neat idea, but there are better products out there!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I&#x27;m 56 years old and have tried just about every skincare product out there and this is the best!  The negative reviews saying it&#x27;s a lie or a scam don&#x27;t take into account how smooth, healthy and GLOWING my skin is after I use this product.  I use it 2x a week and rub GENTLY (like it says in the instructions).  I have very youthful skin and this Aqua Gel helps me keep it that way.</li>
            <li> Cure Natural Aqua Gel is amazing. If you are looking to rid yourself of dead skin cells this is the product to use. It is gentle and you will feel and see the dead skin cells sluff right off. It come out as a clear gel and you won&#x27;t think that this product will do anything in your hand but you will be surprised. Life long user! Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after many months of research and reading many reviews. It may be the holy grail for many people, but this item just doesn&#x27;t do much for my skin. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best exfoliating scrub out there; my St. Ives apricot exfoliating scrub would leave my combination skin feeling fresh. It may have been abrasive to the skin, but the pores on my nose were significantly smaller after using it compared to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are amazed by the way it &amp;#34;melts the face&amp;#34; but I think this is just a gimmick. I followed the instructions and leave it on for a while before massaging the liquid and even though my feels fresh when I wash it off, I don&#x27;t get the same effect I do with other exfoliating scrubs. My face may feel &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s probably because of the alcohol in the product that gives your face the squeaky clean feel, but after using this item for a month, I do NOT see any great results. I&#x27;ve been using it two to three times a week and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, this produce either does not work for my combination skin OR the item is a dupe. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone, I would suggest getting the Juara Rice Facial Scrub for roughly the same price. You will definitely see a difference after a week.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle today. At first I was kind of skeptical because it gas the consistency of water. I tried it and boy was I surprised. I actually did it twice in a row and watched all the dead skin come off. After the second time I decided to wash my face with charcoal soap like I always do..well today felt better than any other time ive washed my face. I dont know how to descibe it but I felt like face has never been cleaner. I truly believe that this stuff sells every 12 seconds in Japan.</li>
            <li> I will never be without this again.  I can see why it is a most loved product in Japan.  One use and I was hooked.</li>
            <li> When I read about this product and reviews in an online article I immediately went to Amazon.com to look for the product and ordered it.  Love! Love! Love!  It works!  The instructions indicate exfoliating twice a week, but I used it 3 nights in a row.  First evening, I had a lot of dead skin.  Second evening, still dead skin but less.  Third evening, just a little bit of dead skin.  Next week I will use it only twice a week. My face felt smooth and clean.  I can see why it was a huge hit in Japan! Looks like this will be a staple product for me! :)</li>
            <li> I had always wanted to try this ever since I watched BubzBeauty&#x27;s face routine video. When I tried this I immediately fell in love, my ONLY complaint is that the directions are NOT in English (which makes sense considering where its from) BUT the manufacture should at least provide the directions on a sheet of paper or something. I mean I really love this product it is a very gentle exfoliator but directions would be useful. If you DONT want to look up the directions each time before using this then I would purchase something else, like I said I love this I do reccomend it but sometimes it can be a hassle to translate.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on Amazon reviews. My normally oily skin has begun playing tricks on me where my face was becoming so dry on the outside. Changing up moisturizers to something heavier was not helping, so I figured I would change exfoliators instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product hasn&#x27;t completely resolved the situation, per se, but it does accomplish two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. There&#x27;s definitely less dead skin cells upon using this and your toner/moisturizer is also absorbed better on account of using it. It goes without saying that foundation goes on better, too. That said, by the time I set with powder, I still notice some dryness about 50-60% of the time--but it&#x27;s MUCH better than without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The way this product makes you skin feel post-usage is quite amazing. Baby butts have nothing on your face after you use this! It&#x27;s soft, silky and not oily at all; your skin has a kind of healthy glow to it after. As mentioned, once makeup is applied, you may still notice dryness depending on severity of your own face&#x27;s condition--but texturally speaking, it does make your skin feel wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying out this product. I use it about every 2 days at this point, and I think that&#x27;s enough. Like many things, using it aggressively for more days is not necessarily better and won&#x27;t fix this dryness issue I&#x27;m experiencing. As one usage doesn&#x27;t really FIX the entire problem, I am giving it four-stars for now. It&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old with normal to oily skin.  Main concerns are large pores and wrinkle prevention.  I&#x27;ve been an avid anti-aging prevention ranger for my own skin for many years now.  In route, I&#x27;ve researched, invested, and tried many, many products from drug stores to $$$ stores and also from different countries.  As the seasons and my age change, so does my skincare and makeup routine.  This winter I replaced my moisturizers, serums, cleansers, and have yet replace the current exfoliater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current exfoliater is a bit more grainy than needed, served me better in the summer.  The added dry air makes that exfoliant not so skin friendly. Turns my face into a big oily melting pot.  No Good.  In times like this, I turn to a Chinese exfoliant- its gentle, all natural, no grains, and exfoliates wonders.  I use it ALL OVER my body.  Face, neck, back, underarms, chest, legs.  I was EXTREMELY UPSET because I was on my last bottle.  The only way for me to get it in bulk is if I wait til summer and buy in bulk from traveling vendors.  I googled for it desperately.  I was so desperate, I searched on youtube.  There, I came across a bubzbeauty (very cool and adorable gal) channel and learned that CURE was Japan&#x27;s best selling exfoliater.  Watching the clip, I realized it works similar to the Chinese exfoliater I was in search of.  Some more googling went on then I was even more ecstatic that it is sold on Amazon &#x3D; Easy acess.  However, the $39 price tag pulled me back a bit.  The ingredients used, aren&#x27;t so $$, so I didn&#x27;t really understand why the steep price.  ??? Even then so, it didn&#x27;t stop me from wanting to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast, 2 days, with prime membership.  I tried it right away on my morning face &#x3D; no exfoliating since last week + oily t-zone + creams and serums from last night.  Rinse face with warm water, let skin air dry but not completely dry, then with 2-3 pumps, I applied to face and rubbed away, starting from my nose and working outwards and away towards my ears.  I had to really rub my skin to slough off any dead skin.  Dead/dry skin will look like little white/nude mushy beads.  At one point, I thought I must&#x27;ve started off wrong, I tried it on my neck, chest, under arms... and the results were all the same.  I continue to use it with no avail.  My face and skin was not that much softer or exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized it was no where close as good as the version I had &#x3D; 1 dime of the product works all over face and neck.  VERY LITTLE elbow grease is needed.  All you do is rub hands on face or body part in soft light circular motions and instantly, you get tons of dead skin (grainy, little, beads) rolling around on your skin.  Skin is left brighter, softer, and with less visible pores.  Best part, it costs way, way, less.  For 80 grams, I pay $5 a pop when I buy in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this CURE product workout. A part of me almost feels like asking, is this a knock off?  It happens a lot when purchasing skin products manufactured from different countries.  I&#x27;ll never really know unless I travel to Japan and buy this product in person.  Sadly, it is a no go and I will not be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the hunt again for my tried and super true exfoliant.  I&#x27;m SUPER CLOSE TO GETTING IT!!!  WISH ME LUCK!!!wards and away towards my ears.  I had to really rub my skin to slough off any dead skin.  Dead/dry skin will look like little white/nude mushy beads.

            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use to use the clarisonic mia everyday, a wash cloth at night to remove make up, plus peter thomas Roth aha/bha clearing gel. All of them combine don&#x27;t work as effectively as this stuff. From the first use I have had glowing smooth skin and I have not had a single pimple since I started using it. Plus I have stopped using the clearing gel and mia. I do use this way more then I should, sometimes everyday, or every other day but my sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t had a reaction so I figure its fine. I use it and so does my husband and both of us find this way more effective then our clarisonics. I highly suggest buying this in place of a clarisonic. The amount of white balls is always amazing, there hasn&#x27;t been any decrease in them which seems odd since I use this so frequently. Our pores are smaller and, our skin glows, it really does. I use jasmine water Bb cream for foundation and my skin looks better now then it did in my 20&#x27;s. Please try it. The people who gave this bad reviews must already use something that keeps their skin smooth cause the results are so dramatic I don&#x27;t understand how it wouldn&#x27;t work for everyone. There is nothing in this that should burn, its 90%water, with glycerin and peroxide, and it shouldn&#x27;t be on you skin longer than a min.</li>
            <li> my friend was visiting me and she love it. She will buy it. It is very gentle and not like other exfolitor product</li>
            <li> I use it every other week and it has made my skin look fresh, soft and renewed. Really takes off deadskin cells. I have combination skin and it does wonders.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will buy it again. Received it earlier than promised though the invoice was missing in the box. I&#x27;m thrilled about the result of this facial wash!</li>
            <li> I think this is worth the investment because it makes my skin feel baby soft after using it for the very FIRST time. It was JUST like in the YouTube video demos.  I watched a lot of YouTube demos to see if this was the right product for me (Melodee Morita&#x27;s skin care routine). Now I want to make my OWN demo video!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to invest for this product. It will help your skin absorb all the benefits from other expensive skin products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wondered whether the gel was just reacting with my skin to create the eraser bits or if its ACTUALLY removing dead skin cells.  If I rubbed it on my remote, would it also exfoliate the same... Whatever the case is, the end result is skin as smooth as baby&#x27;s butt...minus the pooh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No other product has made my skin feel so brand new!!!  I can&#x27;t help but admire my own new skin &amp; my confidence has skyrocketed!!!!  I have always been a secretly vain person, but now, I am UBER vain!!!!  All my skin care products feel more effective, my skin simply RADIATES with sunshine from within.  I&#x27;m still not the prettiest, most charming girl in the world, I&#x27;m just THAT much more confident now because of my baby soft, super smooth skin.  I get a lot of positive comments &amp; people ask me what products I use.  I feel like a bonafide GURU when people hang onto my every word as they admire my new skin.  Sure, life is hard &amp; full of suffering &amp; desires unfulfilled, but at least I will LOOK good as I am toiling, over worked &amp; under appreciated ^____^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen similar products out there that cost less, but I am glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is insane. It&#x27;s a little gross to see all your dead skin, but I love that it&#x27;s non-abrasive. I have very sensitive skin and this is my favorite exfoliant ever. I&#x27;m hooked for life.</li>
            <li> Got this product today.  Washed my face and applied cure. It beaded up as others described. Rinsed my face and applied cure fore the second time, and it beaded up again. I have absolutely no idea if this beading is dead skin. It felt a little ruff to me. I think my skln looked a little different. I know I am not being very helpful, but right now the jury is out.  Outside of taking this stuff to a lab I will probably never know.  Saying what I have the really big question is do I want to spend that kind of money on a product that I can&#x27;t be sure if it works?</li>
            <li> Save your money - this is crap. What comes off is its own product. I&#x27;m guessing it never makes contact with your skin because it builds its own barrier. Then it clogs your pores. I found myself questioning how I could be so stupid to fall for this one. Don&#x27;t be me. Be you.</li>
            <li> This exfoliant works so well, I ordered two more.</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to love this product but alas, it did absolutely nothing for me.  Perhaps my skin is already exfoliated enough?  I plan on taking it to work for a control test on my colleagues! LOL... I hope it works for someone!&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped immediately.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would actually help take off dead skin but I don&#x27;t see how it does at all. You leave it on for a few minutes and it&#x27;s supposed to &#x27;react&#x27; with your skin. Not impressed and I don&#x27;t get the raves.</li>
            <li> This is  great. I like it,I&#x27;m not in love with it. I wanted not just exfoliation but my hyper pigmentation lightened . I&#x27;ll use it every now again, until I can find something better.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Gentle. Water based and exfoliates without scrubbing. My face feels so clean after I&#x27;m done using it. Only drawback is how pricey it is.</li>
            <li> I used to live in Japan and I desperately missed all the wonderful skin care products there. Lo and behold I found Cure (and others) on Amazon and I had to buy it. It works so well while being gentle. My skin feels amazing and it&#x27;s helping in fading dark spots on my cheeks and neck. Buy this! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this.  I hadn&#x27;t read closely on how this product worked and was confused when it came and there was no &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; particles.  Don&#x27;t let that stop you-it works just as well if not better than other scrubs on the market!  I am a product junkie and not easily impressed.  I have the most frustratingly sensitive, acne prone skin at 32. This does a great job of removing excess skin and debris, leaving my skin feeling refreshed and clear and even seems to help with excess oil where needed-without being too harsh for the dry areas.  I&#x27;ve read reviews that say to put a thin layer on for a few minutes-then once it starts turning white, massage, and rinse. Another said to put on fingertips then massage all over until you see the white forming.  The first method has worked best for me.  Put on a thin layer all over face (and neck if you like), wait several minutes for it to work its magic-massage-rinse-voila! Exfoliated happy skin :) I will definitely be purchasing more before I run out.</li>
            <li> Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
            <li> Very good product and I ordered it for two times already. It makes your skin so fresh after cleaning and the dirt is all out . Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Being a fan of monthly home facials with the girls - we have tried ultra expensive (sample) products and have never been impressed enough to buy them. I have always returned back to using &amp;#34;Saint Ive&#x27;s&amp;#34; apricot scrub for exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, everything changed the day that someone shared their bottle of &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; with me. It&#x27;s a WONDER PRODUCT as far as I am concerned. Initially, I was worried because it was completely in Japanese - I&#x27;m glad that I gambled and tried it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are translated instructions floating around the internet somewhere I was told last night - if anyone needs them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on my feet.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my face.  I&#x27;m a 54 year old female.  Sometimes I spray tan---it didn&#x27;t even remove the uneven spots from the spray tanning that start to show 3 or 4 days post spray tanning.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and see absolutely no difference in my skin and I was SO hoping this would be the &#x27;thing&#x27;....but sadly, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Amazing to think your face is exfoliated and then use a product like this and see all the pieces of dead skin being rubbed off when applied. I used to use another product that had the same reaction but was way over priced. This is a much better deal for your money</li>
            <li> while so many other expensive products don&#x27;t live up to their name, this does. you can see the dead skin coming off of your face it&#x27;s amazing. i will be ordering this again and it arrived a day earlier than expected. nice surprise</li>
            <li> It smells a little like rubbing alcohol and I was worried about that because my skin gets rashes whenever alcohol wiped are used on it, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to cause any allergic reaction. However, I&#x27;m pretty sure the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; flaking off when you rub the Cure onto your face is just what&#x27;s left over of the gel once the alcohol in the solution evaporates. It&#x27;s fun to do and while it leaves my skin pretty soft I don&#x27;t think it really does anything beyond entertain me for a bit.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it&#x27;s promises.  I wanted to use it for my feet but it does very little exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this after reading all the good reviews but it left a weird, sticky residue on my face after using. I didn&#x27;t really feel like it exfoliated much, but left a layer of moisturizing stickiness. I don&#x27;t use this on my face anymore, but on my body, where it still is nice to see clumps of formula/dead skin cells come off every so often.</li>
            <li> Very nice exfoliator!  Like others, I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> Face feels smooth after using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this. I use it 2-3 x a week and my skin feels so healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the small white beads it forms are really exfoliated skin, but my skin has finally calmed down and my dark spots are fading.</li>
            <li> This really works.... dead skin just rolls off.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a few other products and I love them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t feel the product was working, I don&#x27;t read Japanese. But I read the translated directions, used as directed and was shocked to see the amount of dead skin that was gently removed from my face. I have a tendency toward adult acne, joy, and have sensitive skin. This is a wonderful product - gently exfoliates, not much product needed per use, easy on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure you get the translated directions and make sure you know how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used to have a gel exfoliator bought from China. It worked so great and but they stopped making it.&lt;br /&gt;Cure Natural Aqua Gel is very similar to what I used to have but this gel is much more diluted. Since it is so mild, I just need to use more every time and more often, like twice a week. After using it, it feels great. No dry feeling or burning. I also bought another one for back up :)</li>
            <li> Very loved it removes dead skin efficiently but for why became the product does not ship directly to Saudi Arabia?</li>
            <li> Excellent amazing removes all the dead skin like no other product! Must try I use twice a week just enough!</li>
            <li> The Cure is amazing! I am dark-skinned woman with extremely dry, cantaloupe-y skin. I often use a boar hair brush to brush off the dead skin in the shower before actually showering. Especially in the winter - it often looks like snow. That may be TMI, but I want you to know how much and what type of dry and dead skin I have.  Anyway, I used The Cure on my legs only the first time and it didn&#x27;t only produced the white sort of pills that most people refer to. That&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t let it sit on my skin long enough for my skin type (and because I couldn&#x27;t read the instructions).  Last night I applied The Cure to my arms and legs and let it sit while I let my tub fill with hot water for a bath -- so about 3 minutes.  I soaked in the tub for about 3 min before rubbing my legs to see if The Cure would actually work this time. Well, it did. So much so, it scared me.  The amount of brown skin -- not white pills - that rubbed and peeled off my arms and legs was disturbing.  It didn&#x27;t hurt or burn at all, but I still strongly considered consulting a doctor because of the amount of skin that came off. Actually, it was pretty disgusting.  And I was too embarrassed to take pictures of the dead skin. I wanted to call my hubby in to show him, but didn&#x27;t want him to have that visual in his memory bank.  My skin was not really lighter, but much brighter, if that makes sense.  I guess because all of the dead skin wasn&#x27;t covering mu Sort of like how you can change the brightness of your cell phone</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  It really cleans everything off your of your face.  It is nice that you get enough to do your whole body several times.</li>
            <li> Before using this gel exfoliator, I was only familiar with exfoliating face washes containing beads/etc. Though I don&#x27;t have naturally sensitive skin, I treat my oily, acne-prone skin with salicylic acid, which leaves my face prone to redness from new facial products. I also make the mistake (as many do) to scrub too hard with exfoliants. There&#x27;s no danger of that when I use this gel. I love that it&#x27;s colorless and scentless, and easy to apply. It&#x27;s kind of gross to see all the dead skin coming off your face, but oddly satisfying at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about almost a year now, and I&#x27;ve never had a bad reaction from it. My skin feels really good afterwards, too—squeaky clean, but not uncomfortably tight. I exfoliate with this gel twice times a week before applying a deep-cleaning clay mask, followed by a moisturizing mask. I think it helps masks and moisturizers to better penetrate my skin.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s discuss this amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a sample in a fun little shop on Sawtelle in Little Osaka after ramen with my husband. The nice shop assistant gave me a sample to take home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;d be amazed at what this product does. It literally removes dead skin in a way that&#x27;s different from any other exfoliant I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a smooth clear gel with no grit. Lightly apply to the face and let it sit for a minute, then massage the area. You immediately feel the dead skin begin to ball up and drop off under your fingertips. You&#x27;ll notice that what comes off is no longer clear, because the product collects and removes the dead skin cells. I really think of it more as the mildest chemical peel I&#x27;ve ever had rather than the scrubbing of a typical exfoliant. I tried it on my husband, who has very sensitive skin, and he didn&#x27;t break out or have any negative reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$20 cheaper than in the shop on Sawtelle, but it took forever to arrive from Japan. Just be aware of the lag time and order in advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also made a conscious choice to get away from exfoliants that use those micro beads that are clogging our water and getting into our food supply through fish. This fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Love this and the price!  I started searching for a product like this after I was in NY and a spa was trying to sell me a similar product for $150.  Very satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is genius.  It&#x27;s a mild chemical peel in a bottle.  It vacuums and shrinks my pores in one process.  I use it after cleansing on dry skin in the evening.  It&#x27;s quick, efficient, and mild enough to use every day.  I don&#x27;t know what the bottle says (it&#x27;s in Japanese!) but it should say \\&quot;this is the best stuff ever - buy me!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> i love this product work like wonders</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the reviews.. mistake!! I never leave reviews mainly because I just dont have time but after spending way to much money for this product I had to say something.  It does not remove dead skin.  It simply dries out my skin . I had a small patch of dry skin that I always get in the winter.  I can simply rub over it a few times with a wash cloth and it peels right off. SO this product should of had no problem removing it right?? Wrong...did nothing! I continued to use as directed for 2 weeks. My skin got drier and drier and looked awful!  I decided to do a experiment with this stuff. I asked my sons chemistry teacher if we could look at the \\&quot;stuff \\&quot; that is supposed to be dead skin under a microscope and see how much of it was really dead skin. I wont bore u with all the details but after 3 people using the product and 3 people simply using a piece of cotton rubbed on there face with water on it ...they both lost the same amount of skin when looked at under a microscope. One kid did loose a little more with the cure but  not enough to talk about.  Save your money.  This product simply clumps togeather when it hits air and then is rubbed it has almost a glue like substance. Im sure alot of people will disagree with me and thats fine. Im glad some ppeople have had success with it but I tthink its way over priced and does not do what it claims!!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and is very affective. After you wash your face as normal pat dry then use two full pumps and swiftly apply to your whole face. It will feel watery and once evenly applied to your entire face wait 5 seconds then start to evenly and gently rub your skin in circular motion. The results will be your dead skin pilling up in white round ball. After about 1 minute of doing this just rinse thoroughly for at least 7 splash. The result will be very smooth skin. Don&#x27;t forget to pay special attention to around your nose for those white heads.if you follow with skincare it will absorb better into your skin after all  your dead surface are gone.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the types of exfoliators with the course stuff already in it.  I thought there would be no way that a clear and thin liquid would exfoliate.  I was shocked!  I have patches of rough skin on my lower cheek area and after using this, my skin is the smoothest it has ever been (I have had many professional facials also)!  Directions for use are in Japanese, so just read the instructions under the question and answer section on here.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It&#x27;s peeling the dead surface of your skin and give you a very bright skin surface!</li>
            <li> I never believed that  an exfoliator can be that good!! I have a very sensitive skin type, but after i use this, my skin become smoother and even brighter.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend  this product. One thing make sure that when you apply this product on your skin, you should wait a little few seconds to turn whiter, and start rub it.</li>
            <li> I will not order again.  I have other products that work as well or better than this product.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Eh i can see the deadskin after scrubbing but besides that it doesn&#x27;t do much for my acne nor my darkspots. Just kinda deep cleans my face and thats it. 35 bucks? Nah not worth it to me. I&#x27;ve had this same bottle since december so i guess the price isnt Terrible for how long it lasts but i could honestly do without it</li>
            <li> Great product. It removed all my dead skins as it says leaving my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product.  You don&#x27;t need any other deep skin cleansing products except maybe a pore brush or biore strips to pull stuff out of your pores.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first two weeks using Cure, and it is absolutely amazing. I just finished my first two weeks with it and I&#x27;m feeling so amazed with the results that I may overshare a bit. I&#x27;ve been looking for a new exfoliator, as my dermatologist told me that the one I&#x27;m currently using is really bad for my skin.    Since I lived in Asia for a couple of years, I usually look to the Asian market for new products for my skin. I found Cure on a beauty blog, and after reading through quite a few reviews online I decided to give it a try, and wow--it&#x27;s a really amazing product. It works really well at exfoliating dead skin cells and giving you an opportunity to really fight your acne. I will say this, all of the reviewers who are saying it doesn&#x27;t work, I hope that they are not only using this and expecting for a new face to appear in the mirror before them.    As with all face products, you absolutely have to use several different products at once. For me, I find that after using Cure, I like to use my favorite mask, [[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]], which acts as an excellent acne treatment after you&#x27;ve shredded a few layers of dead skin with Cure. The sulfur mask is nice and light and after using it your skin feels tighter and clearer. It also seems to be helping out in evening out my complexion. I combine that with my extractor and spot treatment [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]] which also acts as my moisturizer by the way, and it&#x27;s seriously amazing. I definitely recommend the Cure, as well as all of my other products if you want clear, bright, and even skin.</li>
            <li> Whoa!  I was skeptical buying a product with a label I couldn&#x27;t read but hey, isn&#x27;t that is what the internet is for?  I used this on my face after washing at night but I wasn&#x27;t totally buying that the clumps forming were dead skin as I had read or heard.  However, I tried it on my legs before jumping into the shower the next morning to shave and no longer am I a skeptic.... The clumps forming on my legs were no doubt dead skin (pretty gross but oddly satisfying).  My legs were smoother than when I use sugar scrubs, plus this product is way less messy.</li>
            <li> Very effective, moisturize after!!</li>
            <li> Well, I do always see the white beads forming. But that&#x27;s just it, I see it every time no matter how many times I put it on. I don&#x27;t know, maybe if it were able to get everything off in 1 go I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. For now it&#x27;s 4</li>
            <li> Like the product.  However, not convinced I see real results in exfoliation. I will continue to use and perhaps have different opinion once I finish the bottle.  Skin appears &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; after use.</li>
            <li> I have rated this product before. i&#x27;m on my second bottle, which is a year after I used the first. I am African American with oily, acne prone, huge pored skin. i&#x27;m almost 50 and I still get acne.&lt;br /&gt;ever since I used this, my acne breakouts and clogged pores have all but disappeared. now my breakouts still happen, but my skin looks great. I gave some to my cousins and one swears that she&#x27;s a shade lighter! I told her the dull skin was lifted away, thus her skin was brighter and glowing. this product is no joke, believe the hype! I use this twice a week with a masks once a week and I get facials from a spa once a month. have ordered two more bottles so i&#x27;m good for the next three years unless I give them away. the only complaint I have is that it takes 2 1/2 weeks for the order to arrive as it does come from japan......great, great stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> works so well! my face feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> This is a good exfoliator.  It isn&#x27;t overly strong and it does take some time rubbing it over your fact before the dead skin starts to come off, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.. really cool to see the beads form. lol</li>
            <li> Having clear skin is very important to me and this is a life saver! #makeupfreefriday  [...] ThaliaDoesMakeUp  Here is a photo of me without any make up! Though I do make up i preach the importance of taking care of your canvass and this product has made my skin so much better!</li>
            <li> Another 5 star review....It really works!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got this today and I immediately tried it out.... 2 pumps on a clean dry face then I massaged it in and here came the white balls and WOW ....what a difference!  Dead skin is gone and my serum was really absorbed. Best exfoliator I have ever used by far and it arrived in two days! I will always have this!!!!</li>
            <li> Best this I ever bought</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome! I use it as recommended, twice a week and really see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Takes time to actually wash my face and DRY it first before I can use this where as other exfoliating products can be applied to wet skin. I like it and use it when I am not lazy.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. I&#x27;ve neglected my skin and feet for a while so I tried it on my feet ad legs and face and arms and holy crap! No stinging, just oodles of disgusting skin. I had a callus on my toe... GONE!  The pores on my nose...GONE!  My skin is back to when I was young. Freaking crazy how well this works.  I just want to add that to remove the callus was a process. Dabbing the gel and then rubbing. Repeating several times. Arms and legs were done in sections. Simply amazing</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!! You get a very exfoliated and fresh face after using.</li>
            <li> It is one of the best exfoliators I have ever used. No wonder why it is the best seller in Japan. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had to buy this product. I am a 40 year old woman that tries to take great care in her appearance and am trying to &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; slow the aging process. I took my shower and when my face was completely dry I applied the product and let it set for about 3 minutes ( per someone&#x27;s interpretation of the Japanese directions)  and then rubbed my skin in circles. Just as others have said.....small balls of dead skin came off and revealed smoother, younger and glowing skin.  The greatest difference was my chest though. Holy cow! My chest has been looking older and older and every morning I notice the wrinkles on my chest and it takes half the day for them to disappear. After I used this exfoliator it was the smoothest my chest has looked in years! I tried to take a picture to share with my friends because the results were so impressive. I have no idea what the active ingredients are and I have never used a product like this. It&#x27;s kinda smells like a gasoline type smell but not bad at all. Do not let that statement deter you from using this amazing product. That&#x27;s just my opinion. Just something I haven&#x27;t smelled before. Also, I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Gosh where do I begin, this is such an amazing product and I can&#x27;t believe it is not mainstreamed in the US. It really does what it claims (removes 0.01mm of skin) and makes my skin super soft afterwards. I use it once a week (2 pumps) and I anticipate it will last a long time. Everyone who dislike the product or say it doesnt work must not be using it correctly. Look up the instruction on their website. Overall, i&#x27;m very impressed and will purchase again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I had bought one of those facial brushes w/ scrub gel you need to keep buying to exfoliate my skin, but this product works even better. I have noticed a huge difference in my skin since I started using it, and I am consistently using it every other day.</li>
            <li> Use the gel, rub it in, keep rubbing and your dead skin falls away. I suggest using before a show</li>
            <li> As freelance makeup artist its important to have good skin; especially clear of of dead skin. Remarkably, in as&lt;br /&gt;short as a week, my skin is brighter and very smooth; and my pores are tighter. I&#x27;ve foregone the use of a primer because my skin is baby soft so makeup goes on smoothly. I highly recommend this product for those who want to eliminate the use of different products to achieve what this one product can accomplish. Goodbye primers, scrubs and pricey cleansers...CURE is my number one remedy!!!!</li>
            <li> this product does what is promised...the first time I used it my face felt so smooth...I use an exfoliating cloth every day and did not expect much of a change,,I was wrong..  this is gentle to use unlike a burning glycolic acid product... it feels wonderful.  This will be part of my everyday routine forever more..love it!</li>
            <li> This product doesnt work.  dont waste you rmoney.  I tried this several times and read more reviews by people who think it works, but it really doesnt.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff! I use it every other day right before I shower! My pores look small and my skin is smooth! I do have sensitive skin but there were NO issues with theis!</li>
            <li> This exfoliator really works. I&#x27;m not sure if it gets ALL the dead skin cells off but it does get some off because after I wash my face, it&#x27;s smooth. The white bits that form when you use this exfoliator is a combination of the product itself and your dead skin. At first I was skeptical because I thought it was just the product but if you see a discoloration of the product (like if it turns beige instead of pure white) then you know your dead skin is in there. This product also helps loosen the dead skin so you may want to use it twice just to get everything off. I know it truly works because I used it on a healing cut that had some visible dead skin on the sides of it and it came out with the product. Really great!</li>
            <li> Put this on my face and my dark marks got instantly darker so I stopped using it.  I am African American and do not recommend using it on dark skin.</li>
            <li> This is ok. During the washing process, it&#x27;s very gooey and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dust coming off your face like peeling but it does give you that feeling. Plus, it&#x27;s not in English so you can&#x27;t tell what in it so it can be scary.</li>
            <li> It is a good exfoliator for weekly usage. However, I find it unfair that we have to pay more so much more money than people in Japan. I wish this company would start their own website for us USA citizens already.....tired of being ripped off!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works, but it is amazing!  My daughter bought it on the recommendation of a friend and had me try it. I must admit I was skeptical,  especially after she told me to just pat it on and not scrub. There are no instructions at all, at least none in English. Pat your face and neck continuously with product on your hands and suddenly you can feel dead skin just sloughing off!  I use it once or twice a week in the shower and my face and neck feel incredibly soft and hydrated afterwards. Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate, just let it sit on your face for a minute or two, then rub it in circular movements.</li>
            <li> I got this a month ago and so far so good. I noticed my skin had less breakouts and it feels like my skin is glowing after i wash it off. I like that theres no smell.</li>
            <li> Based on the good/length of reviews I thought this would work,but defiantly not for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the good reviews.  A little goes a long way, so the price is okay to me. Only problem is that everytime I used it, my face would erupt in red spots.  The last time I used it, it caused by skin to break out in eczematous rash under my nose.  I&#x27;ve had to use hydrocortisone 1% cream to try and clear the rash. Not a good product for me.  Too harsh.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time I&#x27;ve ever purchased something like this and have to say it is a great product!  I have VERY sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother my skin in the least!  It does exfoliate!  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, hallelujah!</li>
            <li> I love this thing so much. I have very sensitive skin that is also very dry in the cheek and chin area, and oily in the t-zone. I can&#x27;t use a harsh manual scrubber because it makes my sensitive skin sting and burn. This thing however, I can use multiple times in a day if I wanted because it&#x27;s that gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a gel that feels cooling on the skin when you first apply it. You then gently rub in circles and dry skin starts to ball up. Once you&#x27;re done, you rinse/wipe off the balled up dry skin (gross) and you can continue on your merry skin care way with soft and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it for about $23 in Japan so the price was a heck of a lot more reasonable. I&#x27;ll still buy it in the states for the price because it&#x27;s so effective.</li>
            <li> this has been described as creepy but effective, and its true! I love that it actually works on removeing that ashy dead layer of skin with out any tingling sensation or chemical smell. It&#x27;s like a thick water. Brilliant chemist who came up with this! expensive i suppose but it actually works, and thats what makes it valuable to me, i also use it on my body in areas prone to ingrown hairs from waxing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My skin feels 100 times softer after using this!</li>
            <li> SO GOOD PRODUCTS. gentle for skin and remove the dead cells easily and leave the skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> This is going to be a repeat purchase for me. It works really well on not just my face, but on any spot of skin that needs some extra exfoliating. It&#x27;s really gentle to use everyday if you want, and the effects are very noticeable.</li>
            <li> You must have!Very useful!</li>
            <li> It kind of makes a mess when you use it, so I use it standing in the shower before I turn the water on. Fun to use and it works great! And it&#x27;s a nice generously sized bottle that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this exfoliator. Wet face, apply a thin layer, wait about 1-3 min and then rub. The amount of dead skin that comes off is shocking. It works especially well in those areas where my clarisonic can&#x27;t reach. Like the areas around my nose. Essentially this stuff is a weak chemical peal. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to say how surprised I am to read that there is anyone out there who isn&#x27;t completely in love with this product! Using this 2-3 times a week helps to keep my skin looking much more smooth, soft, and radiant than ever before. The thorough exfoliation helps to keep breakouts to a minimal and helps heal acne marks more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that a lot of skeptics say the product is just balling up and it&#x27;s not actually removing dead skin at all. Well then how else does it remove less skin if I repeat the process 2-3 times in a row and begin to reveal more shiny, new skin with a slight tingling sensation?! Also, I used this several days in a row on my forehead after getting a sunburn that left me peeling horribly bad on vacation. It kept my peeling down to a minimum while I was out and about and removed SO much skin before I applied my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is possible that the product does somewhat ball up as it removes dead skin. I don&#x27;t really know. Either way, I know that this product does work and it will improve the appearance of your skin!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does remove the dead skin cells from my face. I also us it on my hands and feet. After using this product my face looks more clean and polished. As long as the price does not change, I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> It really works! My skin is bright and smooth after using it. Only have to use it twice a week. I even tried it on my son once and he thought it was funny because he said it looked like his face was a shade lighter. I guess it was dirt and old skin.  Definitely worth it. And you only use a little so the bottle lasts!</li>
            <li> I will never use grainy exfoliators ever again. This is the most gentle exfoliator one can buy. It doesn&#x27;t have those tiny grains traditional exfoliators contain, so your face doesn&#x27;t get all red after using it. Here&#x27;s how it works: You apply this cure gel to your clean face and let it sit for like 30 seconds and then just gently rub and all this dead skin with slough off your face (I know, gross and cool at the same time), then just rinse. You&#x27;ll be left with soft and smooth skin and nobody will call you a beet face. Love it</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and decided to try this out as a twice a week exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and am very happy with the procedure.  Just wash my face with Shiseido cleanser, rince, and then rub this clear, lightweight, odorless solution all over my face before rinsing again.  My skin feels extremely soft to the touch without the tightening feeling you sometimes get from a lot of exfoliators out there.  That&#x27;s the last thing I want.  Not to mention I&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction to any of the active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent and I&#x27;m fairly certain this bottle will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Glad to try a product that lives up to all the hype! :) Was skeptical and wanted to test whether the little &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; that roll up while using the product were actually dead skin or not. I put on food-safe vinyl gloves and layered some product on my palms, let sit, and then rubbed together. The product itself rolled slightly like glue, but was completely clear, very sticky, and overall looked nothing like the white stuff that forms when I rub it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I was getting 2-3 small breakouts. My skin looked brighter after using it, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away. However, the next morning, all of my developing breakouts were completely gone. Also, I usually break out when I use sunscreen but since I started using Cure, I&#x27;ve been wearing sunscreen everyday without an issue. It is pricey, but for me it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Ummmm.......NO! Doesn&#x27;t work. So stupid. If I could give 0 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars I could but Ishould have went with my gut when i saw the bad reviews.  The white balls are not your skin its the product. My skin literally looked the exact same before and after. Don&#x27;t waste your money people.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliator. It leaves your face feeling like baby skin. Just love it. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Used as directed.  Found it works great.  I can use it more than the suggested 2 to 3 times a week; I&#x27;ve used it every day but then breaking from using it for a day or two depending on the dryness of my skin.  I have eczema including having it on my face in the past, but my facial skin is still sensitive and this is really gentle. Doesn&#x27;t make me react.  I DO NOT like abrasion type exfoliators, they don&#x27;t even work, plus they&#x27;re harsh!  And I&#x27;ve tried acid type exfoliators including fruit acids and they can all be harsh depending on the one you try; they are NO WHERE near as gentle as this and NO WHERE near as effective.  This is so easy and gentle and effective.  Try it, IT WORKS, IT WORKS, IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> This stuff was Fantastic, It completely changed my skin. I now have the softest skin I have ever experienced. I used to not care much about a beauty routine, but now my skin is glowing and I feel so much better. Wonderful for a very Natural Beauty. I recomend this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have sensitive skin, and certain chemical laden product cause me a lot of trouble, especially on my face. No issues with this stuff. Its Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say much because this product already has a following, but this things is great. It has no flowery/perfume smell that I hate and it very gently allows you to exfoliate the dead skin on your face with very little pressure. It essentially feels like it sucks up all the oil from your skin so that you can get more friction when you rub your face with your fingers to exfoliate. It is very gentle and my skin feels incredibly soft and supple afterwards. I usually use it 2x/week because I don&#x27;t want to overdo it, but it&#x27;s always a treat to use because I feel so ridiculously clean after! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I am your biggest skeptic but I just had to try it. It has taken care of some dry spots I have had for years that other exfoliators did&lt;br /&gt;not fix. I have been using this for 7 weeks and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Dont know what all the raves are about with this product. It just is a so-so treatment for getting loose skin off the face, as with Retin-A. Doesnt sting or irritate but it leaves an annoying film on the skin that has to be washed off.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use a strong moisturizer (I use a moisturizing face mask) after using this. I have oily skin, and it does strip away a lot. If I forget to use the moisturizer IMMEDIATELY AFTER, I look like a peeling zombie for the next 2-3 days, so remind yourself of that as you add BOTH to your routine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I am going out of my way this time. This product is by far the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used. For the last 15 years I&#x27;ve used my trusty St.Ives Apricot Scrub, well, not anymore! I&#x27;ve used this product for a week now and my skin has never looked and felt so healthy and soft. I am one of the lucky who suffer from combination oily, dry and sensitive skin and I also have some scarring from years of acne. For the first time in my life, the scars actually look like they are fading. I can hardly believe it. This stuff is amazing, don&#x27;t even think twice about buying it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well at removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking amazing! My skin has never felt this smooth. I&#x27;ve even been bugging everyone I know to &amp;#34;just touch my face!&amp;#34; I cannot believe how great it makes my skin feel. I also think it has been helping to clear up my skin. Actually, it has definitely been clearing up my skin, there is no question about that. I do use a lot of other products on my face, but this one has definitely earned a permanent place in the line-up. My blackheads are even going away! This has never happened before! Do yourself a solid and get this. It will seriously change your skin. It has definitely changed mine!</li>
            <li> I have never exfoliated like this before and will never go back to rubbing rough granules or cloths on my face/body! I apply a few pumps of this to my whole face and begin smoothing and massaging it over my skin. Once all of the moisture is gone and the little balls begin to stick to my face more I rinse. The balls may contain some sort of product, but they also contain dead skin cells as my face feels impeccably smooth after using this product. So far I have used it on my hands, toes, knees, elbows and more all with the same result! This will not leave my beauty regimen unless it becomes unavailable to me online!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I thought &amp;#34;there is no way that this stuff is going to work-it feels like nothing&amp;#34; but I massaged it on my skin and all this dead skin starting coming off! I use it every few days and my skin looks amazing! I also used it on my feet (it was a long winter in NH and my feet were a wreck) and it took off tons of dead skin. I will definitely be keeping this in my skin care regime!&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased Rohto Hadalabo Gokujun Serum 1.1oz (30g) and Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Cream - 50ml and absolutely love them too!</li>
            <li> I like this exfoliate face wash. Don&#x27;t use it everyday. I use twice a week. It seem to remove my dead skin which is great and my skin does not feel dry. I give a four cause my face still need to feel clean so I use other face wash for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use it about twice a week. Great way to clean and exfoliate. Unlike other products, it&#x27;s also very gentle. No stinging during application or afterwards when I apply something else</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this and knew immediately that I would be buying the full size version, despite the price (this is more than I usually spend on products).  My skin feels very clean, my pores diminished and my complexion looks more even after using this product. I also love to use this on my elbows and feet.  I&#x27;ve never used a gritty exfoliator that worked as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I also use it on my feet.</li>
            <li> Like magic! Great product</li>
            <li> You can literally see all the dead skin cells roll up into white bits on your face as you massage it.&lt;br /&gt;And NO it is not some sort of con artist&#x27;s creation as some others may argue. After you wash off your face you will be able to both feel the tightness of your freshly exfoliated face and see that your skin has gotten whiter/brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Use this product on DRY skin after cleansing. If you rub the product on wet skin it will simply get diluted and will become ineffective.</li>
            <li> I think this is one cult beauty item that lives up to the hype. Made a difference at the 1st use. 2 pumps on dry freshly washed skin, let sit for a minute or two, then massage and rinse. I use every other day.</li>
            <li> This is the best! Just be careful not to rub too hard! Don&#x27;t use more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> just simply love it will recommend!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I have a hard time finding exfoliants, both physical and chemical, that works for me. This one is very gentle and I have never had irritation using this. I use this 1-2x a week or whenever my skin looks dull. I still try out other peeling gels just so I can compare and I haven&#x27;t found any that does. This has a water like consistency and my face really looks brighter after using it.</li>
            <li> I had received Cure as a Christmas present and I was literally filled with Christmas \\&quot;glee;\\&quot; after hearing so many good things about it from beauty gurus such as Bubzbeauty I was about to begin a wonderful exfoliating journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As silly as my review may sound to you, I am completely happy with this product. It does take off my dead skin cells and is left on your surface to wash off.  I must warn you, however, I did not have a highly problematic skin to begin with. I am normal/combination skin and this does not do anything to do away with my oily t-zone. What it does do though is leave my skin smooth and happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions to use:&lt;br /&gt;1) Start with a washed clean face and put the product on your face avoiding your eye area.&lt;br /&gt;2) With your two weaker fingers, the middle and your ring finger start moving in an outward circular motion to start the exfoliation process. You will start to see white stuff start to form... That&#x27;s your dead skin cells! :O&lt;br /&gt;3) Once you&#x27;ve done your entire face, rinse off and moisturize :)</li>
            <li> Found this product accidently on Amazon while looking for something else and ordered it after reading the review. Received in 18 days with Christmas and New Year in between. I have sensitive and acne prone skin, could not tolerate scrub, microdermabrasion or retinol product. I could tolerate this product well. After first week, I had 6-8 breakouts(pulled out deep down acne?). I did notice skin became brighter/whiter after two weeks use. Asian women pay attendtion to skin whitening. Skin care products from Japan and South Korea are well made.  It&#x27;s too early to tell if it will help with acne, wrinkle or pigmentation but I will continue to use it and introduced it to friends already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks and I can already see a difference in my skin. I don&#x27;t breakout or have acne, but I might get an under-the-skin pimple or small papules on the sides of my face every once in awhile. I pretty much always have blackheads on and around my nose and on my chin. After using this a few times I found a noticeable difference in the appearance of my blackheads. The product description states that using the product will make your other skin care products more effective. I think that is true. Next I&#x27;m going to go back and try some of the products that didn&#x27;t work quite as they should. I&#x27;m sure this will help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a minor criticism of the packaging... I appreciate that the plastic wrapping had English directions/ingredients, but since it was only on the wrapper, after taking that off I don&#x27;t have directions/ingredients I can read. I saved a picture of it and I&#x27;m sure it could be easily found out online, but it would be much more convenient to have it on the actual bottle.</li>
            <li> I cannot begin to say how amazing Cure is as an exfoliator. I know it&#x27;s a bit pricey but it is definitely worth it. It applies as a clear unscented gel that after 30 seconds you begin to rub in which then removes dead skin cells. It is extremely gentle, you can&#x27;t harm your skin by over scrubbing since there are no harsh exfoliating beads. Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> As of late I have had issues with my skin becoming red and sensative. As a result I have not been able to use my regular products and thought I&#x27;d try this one based on several posative testimonies. It has truely lives up to its claim and is both gentle and effective. My skin feels softer and seems to retain moisture better as a result.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the product creates these little clumps, if it&#x27;s skin or the product. However I do know since using it my skin tone has evened out, my breakouts have lessened and even gone away faster. I tend to break out along my chin and checks and using this I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since using this and that is saying something. I would recommend buying this if you want to even your skin tone or having breakouts. It is gentle on the skin and no perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I have tried this twice now and I do see the &amp;#34;rolls of skin&amp;#34; forming, but honestly it cannot be skin. Has anyone felt it between their fingers? It’s clearly plastic &amp; in my opinion the product itself once it dries off. The instructions are to clean the face first, so yeah my face is clean and then the so called balls form once the product is rubbed for a min. The face feels smooth because of the glycerin in the product and the massaging. I am wheatish in complexion and the balls are milky white. How can it be my skin? I know its gross but I saved the plastic stuff and after washing my hands inspected them closely and they do not feel like skin. It’s a over-hyped product and so not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! You instantly see the dead skins come off. Afterward my face feels soft like a baby&#x27;s bottom! Definitely will repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel soooooo smooth. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> The&amp;#34;peeling result&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t really dried skin. Rub this gel on a clean surface, I used a glass. Wait a minute and the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; will start to appear. It is an illusion that its exfoliating but its just a chemical reaction. Highly over priced and over hyped.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a life-changer.  It&#x27;s crazy how much dead skin comes off of your face.</li>
            <li> I loved it. I just used it tonight and wow, it works the best out of products I&#x27;ve used so far. I tried fo find Korean one but this came up as the best result on my search engine. I highly recommend to other buyers.</li>
            <li> I just tried this last night after washing my face and I was really amazed of the results! I actually tried it first on my nose—like JUST my nose area. A few seconds of massaging the product, there are already &#x27;dead skin cells&#x27; coming off. After that, i rinsed it and feel the difference of the skin on my nose area as compared to others. So I proceed on applying it on my whole face. I might even try using this all over my body one of these days. I have never tried any other exfoliant and I guess I wouldn&#x27;t have. This product is totally a keeper!</li>
            <li> This stuff works.  I will keep using this my skin feels baby smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but the packaging was disappointing. It should have come in a box to preserve the nozzle. Instead, someone just taped a bunch of bubble wrap around the nozzle. Anyway, the nozzle was broken. I thought about returning it, but just broke the nozzle all the way off and tip the bottle to pump out what I want. I really like the product, although I use it in the mornings before I shower because you have to make sure you really get it off your face, otherwise, it burns and is irritating. Like the product - hate their lame packaging.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but exfoliates very well, Not a bad investment to add into my skincare routine &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft afterwards and a little goes a long way. Japan sure do know their skincare, What I like most is that there are no harsh beads or granulate particles in most exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;THE BEST for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A must have product. Peels dead skin fast especially after having exfoliation treatment. So far I can see some improvement on my skin. Will buy this again :)</li>
            <li> This DOES NOT dry my skin out; the principle function of this gel is to ONLY react with and remove dead skin cells. Simply apply a dab and start rubbing in circular motions. COMPLETELY removes all black pores on and around nose. COMPLETELY removed dead skin in the corners of my nose. Says its only for use twice a week but so far has been safe enough for me to use every day in Las Vegas’ dry weather. No fragrance, no residue, no tight feeling and no more scrubbing of fresh non-dead skin; this reacts with and removes only the dead surface cells. Simply rinse with water and apply treatments/moisturizers. **Cleanse/Remove all makeup first</li>
            <li> I already use a gentle daily exfoliator, but a few times a month, I want a little something more.  Cure Aqua Gel is absolutely THE BEST you can get.  It&#x27;s non-irritating and it works to reveal a smooth complexion.  I&#x27;ve tried similar type products, but always come back to &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s great for rough heels, elbows, and knees, too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything for now, maybe it takes time to start working</li>
            <li> This exfoliator literally lifts ALL the city&#x27;s grime and makeup off my face.  Does not leave my face dry or tight.</li>
            <li> So after watching a bubzbeauty tutorial raving about this product I decided to get a sample from a website to check it out. Three words: OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! I don&#x27;t know what the Japanese did, but they are GENIUSES!!! The thing I love about this product is that I can actually SEE my dead skin getting off my face and after I wash my face it is sooo smooth and baby soft, I just can&#x27;t get enough. The other thing I like is that there are no microbeads that could possibly tear the skin and cause more hyperpigmentation on my face. The sample lasted about 4 weeks for me! I wanted to buy it but it is like $40+ for about 8.5 fl oz. I just don&#x27;t have the money right now and I have other cheaper product I bought which is fine, but nothing like this. As soon as I save up and finish all my other products I am sooo buying this! :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s a great quick way to exfoliate without scrubbing and does not dry out my skin. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have previously used this product before, and when I ran out and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money to repurchase, even though it was the best exfoliator I ever used. So after 4 months of using various products and returning everything, I finally repurchased and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything, my regular acne gel is way better, I have no idea how the reviews are high!?</li>
            <li> You can use this anywhere, face or body.&lt;br /&gt;Its great considering if you&#x27;re not so serious about ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It gently exfoliates and doesn&#x27;t cause the inflammation after some exfoliation processes take due to abrasion and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again and again. It does have an expiration date so I&#x27;m due soon.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about this product I was skeptical.  A lot of people said it was nothing but water and a chemical that makes it look like its shedding dead skin.  I strongly disagree!  I found this product to be an amazing and gentle exfoliater.  Yes there is an ingrediant that causes the gel to pill up and &#x27;look&#x27; like dead skin,  but these little &#x27;gel balls&#x27; are the exact things that attach to the dead skin and remove them from your face.  Even after using my favorite cleanser, I could see bits of makeup stained skin pilling up with the gel balls.  I am very pleased with the smoother and clean feeling I get after using this product.</li>
            <li> not so good, ruff on skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! It is my new favorite! My face looks fresh, clean and clear! Just like everywhere else on your body there can be a build up of dead skin and this takes care of that. I bought two but am going to order a few more to share with family and to make sure that I never run out.</li>
            <li> simple, smooth onto clean face...wait a moment then gently &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; off with fingers and be amazed. Recommend rinsing face after and following up with a lotion or cream with highest concentration of hyaluronic acid possible (try other Japanese products - lotions or creams). Once a week for drier skin. Maybe max 2x for more oily skin. I have rosacea and experience no issue using this product once a week or so.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this exfoliator. 1. It works so well, my skin is left smooth, even and better able to absorb my skin care products. 2. One bottle lasted almost 3 years, so the value is tremendous. 3. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. Get this, you will be happy.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to all of my friends, so I hope this seller keeps it in stock! When you put it on your face, the gel attaches to the oils on the skin and balls up into little pieces which can then be washed away with warm water. I sometimes use it twice a day, but that&#x27;s because I love it so much. I&#x27;m sure for other skin types, it might be a little different. My skin is super sensitive, but it reacts nicely to this brand. Wonderful does not begin to cover it! I&#x27;m buying again, most definitely.</li>
            <li> Does not work I have combination skin... it did not irritate my skin but it also didn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job! after using this product myface remained the same....used already 3 times and whatever little balls is forming.... it sure isn&#x27;t my dead skin cells... guess I will be going for a professional to take care of my unwanted dead skin cells nothing works for me except for scrubbing it off which then leave my face irritated and I was praying this would work...</li>
            <li> This is now my can&#x27;t-live-without-it favorite product. It works magic on my mid-forties skin, making it dewy and soft. I make everyone I know try it so they can see how truly amazing it is. Even my beau likes to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Sometimes works. Sometimes doesn&#x27;t. Have to use too much of this product...</li>
            <li> After reading the all the positive feedback, I decided to try this product out and I am glad I did.  It is one of the B-E-S-T facial and body exfoliator I have used.  I thank the person who left instructions on use of the product.  It works best after a shower or bath and when skin is completely dry.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the product.  The first few times I had to repeat the procedure twice because my skin needed it.  This product doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;slimy residue&amp;#34; afterwards.  It rinses clean! The results are amazing!  I am age 60 and have very sensitive skin and allergies.  The product did not cause any side-effects.  I would recommend using a light facial lotion afterwards like Cetaphil or Neutrogena.  I have used the product several times now and notice facial lines are disappearing and skin is clearer.  To the inventor and seller...Thank You!  Arigatou! Thank you! NOTE:  The directions are not in English.  It would be nice to have the directions, ingredients, and any warnings translated and enclosed with the package purchase.  I purchased the product after reading the product review via internet search.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week , and I love it ! Deep cleans my face and neck , it feels much smoother every time ... This is the 2nd one I bought 😀</li>
            <li> Love it! It works and I can see the process.</li>
            <li> You will see the result from first time.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing .</li>
            <li> I LOVE this exfoliator.  I use it almost every morning. Finishing my 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> This works like it claims.  It will work much slower than laser treatment from a dermatologist, of course, but you cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> Loved the product, light exfoliator,nice for daily use.</li>
            <li> This beauty product totally works, but you can&#x27;t use on super wet skin.  Works best on slight damp skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the little sand-like skin flake looking thing comes from when you use it but it doesn&#x27;t look like its dead skin from my face. It might just be the drying product of the gel. I stopped using it because it was making my face really dry and also making my face break out more. I gave it to my sister and luckily its not making her breakout but sadly not making any difference in her appearance.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t come with English use directions, so here&#x27;s what you do:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face&lt;br /&gt;2. Put two pumps of this stuff into your hands, rub over face, avoiding eye and mouth area&lt;br /&gt;3. Let sit 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;3. Rub face softly&lt;br /&gt;4. Rinse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what the grainy stuff that is left on my face is. It may be dead skin cells and it may be dried up gel product. Who knows. What I do know is that after using this stuff, my face is the SOFTEST it&#x27;s ever been. I have pretty soft skin to start out with too. It certainly feels as if my face has been exfoliated better than ever, and it also feels gentler than any exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever used. I have no idea how this works, but it definitely does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any exfoliant, I wouldn&#x27;t use this every day. Maybe one a week!</li>
            <li> This product works well and shows results. A little expensive but will continue to use.</li>
            <li> my skin felt a bit smother but the particles that they say are skin are not. It&#x27;s almost like a plastic residue. I&#x27;m guessing this product is not natural and it&#x27;s NOT worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Subtle exfoliation adds a great glow.  I use it about once a week and the amount of exfoliation varies each time.  I don&#x27;t know whats in this stuff but it works really well on my skin.  Just apply to dry face, gently scrub, then rinse.  Voila.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It truly works. I&#x27;m in my early 20s, asian/filipino, lighter-medium skin tone. Combination dry and oily skin. With occasional break outs, mostly on my cheeks or chin when they happen. And I know that it is skin coming off,not product flaking off. How? Because my skin was rough and dry with months of negligence. The first run through, I saw rolls of skin, which I knew were skin because it didn&#x27;t look white. If you&#x27;ve ever scrubbed your skin to deeply exfoliate with a towel or with enough friction with your hands, or have ever rubbed your hands long enough as a child to see the tiny rolls of skin cells ball up... That&#x27;s what it looks like--kinda gross to describe. But it confirms it is not fake. Of course after frequent use... For me every 2-3 days one application a day, and after 3-4 applications total (~1.5 weeks worth) I did notice the little skin balls lightening up and less in amount with each use, but at the same time... My face is much softer than its before exfoliation state, so perhaps I have already eliminated the couple months worth of dead skin accumulation, and revealed fresh skin with only couple days worth of dead, dry skin cells...so I&#x27;m sure there isn&#x27;t much to exfoliate off once you&#x27;ve started to maintain your skin. After applying either my shiseido mattifying moisturizer, or any of my other moisturizers desired at the moment, my already smooth face felt and looked more smooth and soft than I could have ever imagined. In fact, I&#x27;m noticing less random breakouts despite sweating from the blazing Texas summer heat. Less dead skin cells means less stuff clogging pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel comfortable walking out without foundation. On occasion, I might mix a couple drops of foundation into a pea-dime size amount of moisturizer to apply very sheer coverage. A bb cream would be well enough coverage, and full application of foundation is not necessary. Which I love because I hate wearing heavy face makeup in humid, steamy, Houston summerweather. I end up sweating it off or it feels like it&#x27;s melting off and by a couple of hours in the sun, 1 hour of tedious blending and setting goes to waste. Now, I can feel comfortable in my own clear, radiant, soft skin! And feeling beautiful naturally is a feeling that is priceless for any woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$30 is a bargain for the size of the bottle, and a little goes a long way to get desired results! And I received my product it perfect new condition in less than 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this to anyone to at least give it a try! Each person has different skin conditions. If it doesn&#x27;t work with your skin, then maybe pass it on to a friend who might be able to benefit from its magic.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a good exfoliation product that could remove flaky/dry facial skin (due to using the Obagi Nuderm system).  For those unfamiliar with the Obagi Nuderm products; these are medical grade products that cause immense irration/dryness/flakiness etc for some weeks to eventually reveal &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; skin.  Even though Obagi utilizes it&#x27;s own exfoliation product (Obagi Exfoderm) to enhance the dead skin sloughing, I was getting tired of the long process of getting rid of the unsightliness and decided to hasten the sloughing by buying the Cure product.&lt;br /&gt;I must say that despite it&#x27;s obvious hype, the product does absolutely nothing when it comes to sloughing off dead skin. What it does do is it forms little balls of it&#x27;s own product so it looks like skin sloughing off, gives you a smooth soft finish after the face wash (due to glycerin content) and does make your face feel quite clean.  However, if you are truly looking to slough off dead skin, keep researching because this will not give you any type of removal other then a clean face wash!  I was extremely disappointed since it did absolutely nothing for my flaky skin or it&#x27;s sloughing and given it&#x27;s price - I would have rather purchased a Glytone product.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it three stars to indicate a good face wash but not as an effective exfoliating agent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with my skin and will have to start Accutane soon, but this gel has really helped keep some problems at bay. Also, it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed very simple and weird looking but soon it turned into something good for me. Even after cleansing or double cleansing dead skin cells still lurk in your skin and this GENTLY removes it without any harsh exfoliating beads that can cause damage to the skin. It has a simple formula also that is free of fragrance which is very good for the skin. I don&#x27;t rate this 5 stars because it is a good product but nothing like a HOLY GRAIL product for me but nevertheless it is a good purchase if you ever decide to give it a try.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of really amazing reviews about this product but from my personal experience and expectations I didn&#x27;t find it as amazing as other customers. I&#x27;m not sure if it is just this specific batch, but it was not really much of a gel consistency, it was pretty runny. It did peel off some dead skin cells. I have a few skin conditions and it is very sensitive and it was not irritated at all by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product as a replacement for a similar Korean product. I gave this one 4 stars because I thought the Korean product was more effective.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that this is the most expensive skin/beauty thing that I will EVER buy. Spending this much money made me feel pretty bad about myself. $40 for something to make your skin fall off? Who needs that? But after going through 5 sample packets, my skin was significantly better. The skin around my nose and cheeks had been really messed up.. it had started flaking and cracking and even bled sometimes. This made all the dry skin come right off, better than any scrubber ever did. And when I put lotion on after it worked way better than it ever had before. I know some people have doubts about what the stuff that comes off is, but I&#x27;m not a gullible person and I&#x27;m positive that this takes off at least a portion of a person&#x27;s dead skin. It doesn&#x27;t always take it all off, and it takes a few days to get rid of extra dry patches. But it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not interested in skin care or beauty supplies. I can see why most people would think spending that much for some kind of magic water is ridiculous. But this made my skin feel less itchy and tight and much more comfortable. I don&#x27;t get nearly as many zits or bumps. And when I do, they go away exponentially faster than they used to. And thankfully, it takes 2 drops of this big bottle to do your whole face. I know there&#x27;s a best by date, but it&#x27;s a joke. This still works just as well as the day I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look up &amp;#34;free cure samples&amp;#34; on Google and you should be able to find some. I only had to pay a few dollars shipping. Try it if your skin is itchy, dry, or uncomfortable. And remember that it works best if you use some lotion after, just like you have to oil leather after you clean it.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, decided to try it out. Holy cow! Thought the little balls might be the gel drying...kinda like glue balls, if you will. Did it a couple times and it didn&#x27;t do it anymore. Did it on my neck and the skin balls were dirty colored (gross, I know). Worth the money. I used about three pumps on my face with each go around and rubbed in light circles until the balls stopped forming easily. Rinsed and repeated.</li>
            <li> I bought this product earlier this year after hearing good reviews. I used about half of the bottle then discontinued use because I wasn&#x27;t sure if the product was actually exfoliating my skin or if it was the product itself that was drying up. I was almost certain it was a scam and that I had wasted my money. As of this month, I was prescribed a topical acne cream solution (Tretinoin) by my doctor. One of the side effects of this ointment is that it makes my skin really dry/sensitive before I get acclimated to the treatment. This past week, my entire face has had a scaly texture that made it difficult to cover even with makeup. Regular face wash/exfoliator products and even some lotions make my skin sting really bad due to the tretinoin. I decided to give the Cure exfoliator another try out of desperation. Needless to say, this stuff is wonderful! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a gentle, but effective exfoliator- it does not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Expensive, but the lady loves it.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this.  So excited about this product, I&#x27;m gifting it out to my friends.  This is a product I would highly recommend.  I use it every other night and my wrinkles are diminishing.  Within a week I could see a difference.  I&#x27;m fixing to be going on one month of use as I write this and my before picture, when I place my now picture next to it......WOW!  My skin is smoother, my pores are diminishing, my crows feet are almost non-existent and the lines around my lips are diminishing beautifully.  I&#x27;m 54 years old.  This product will always be a part of my routine.  I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to try a product and it do what it says it will do.  This is a must try for any age.</li>
            <li> This is the one beauty product that I feel does what it claims. I will continue to use this as I travel.</li>
            <li> real results, real woman, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews about how great this product was, I tried it out.  Definitely not worth the price and overall mediocre.  Ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> Works like other reviews say it does. Great at exfoliating the skin. The only down in that it&#x27;s not very viscous. I would love it more if it was slightly more like a gel so it doesn&#x27;t slide on your hands, but I&#x27;m nit picking. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Best face exfoliator ive ever used. Once you put it on your face you can feel all the white stuff coming out which is your dead skin. After washing your face you feel like a little baby SOO SMOOTH!!</li>
            <li> I read on Yahoo this was a must have.  They were right. I use it two or three times per week and the dead skin just balls up and washes off.  Leaves skin incredibly soft...like a microdermabrasion abrasion. I don&#x27;t want to ever be without it.  Lasts a long time too which makes it a good value.</li>
            <li> Still not sure if it&#x27;s my skin rubbing off or just the gel in the product.  I probably will not purchase again</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Became addicted while in Japan last year. Very, very, good!</li>
            <li> Great so far, you can clearly see the results after just using it once and leaves your skin feeling all soft. Been using it for quite a while now and its amazing... Japan really has some amazing products !</li>
            <li> dispenser tip came broken</li>
            <li> It really really good than my expectation!!! Really recommend to u!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with how good it works.  I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra for quality and this definitely is!</li>
            <li> I like it, HOWEVER maybe i.got a bad bottle because its more liquidy then gel like. After rubbing a bit o my face it drips like crazy between my fingers and down my arms and most of what i put in my hands for my face gets trapped in between my fingers as it seeps down so im exfoliating in between my fingers..what a waste..its as amzing as everyone says, but just wish wasn&#x27;t so messy.</li>
            <li> I have oily and acne prone skin. I had been using St. Ives Green Tea exfoliator prior to using this, and that has decreased the acnes already. After reading good reviews and because my skin tends to like Japanese product better since I used to live there, I decided to try Cure. Using Cure twice a week and St. Ives Green Tea exfoliator once a week, my skin has gotten softer and the amount of acnes I get has further decreased. The pores have gotten smaller too. I have not noticed any decrease in the appearance of scars though.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the physical exfoliator I had been using, I did not get much white balls off my cheeks the first time, but I did get more on the chin and forehead. I have also tried this on my neck and back of my hands where I dont exfoliate regularly, and much more white balls formed, so I believe these white balls are actually dead skin cells. Cure does not make my skin feel tight or irritated.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I dont like about Cure is that both face and hands must be completely dry for it to work, but it is so runny after applying that it makes a mess if not used in the shower, where it&#x27;s hard to have completely dry face and hands...&lt;br /&gt;The effect is not miraculous. But then it takes time to get/improve skin so I won&#x27;t complain about that.</li>
            <li> Closer to a cleaner than an exfoliator. Ok.</li>
            <li> Irritated my sensitive skin. Frustrated that I couldn&#x27;t read  ingredients or instructions because they&#x27;re in Chinese. After using, I also realized that the balls that come off your skin are just the product, not dead skin. After looking up the ingredients online, I realized this was true - alcohol mixes with plasticizers and balls up on your skin. I returned this, wishing I had done the research beforehand.</li>
            <li> I give three because I have no doubt it exfoliates my skin. I thought it wasn&#x27;t so used it twice in a row and my face was over exfoliated. I like the way it makes my skin feel after using it, definitely feels clean. Cleaner than my Clarisonic and more exfoliated than when I use microdermabrasion crystals in my face wash. I, for now, have to knock two off because it seems a couple days after I use it I break out a little and get congested pores. I did start using another new product at the same time so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see which one it is.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it at all, and I believed it caused acne for me. I believe some of the dead skin cells are from the product itself, and it takes forever to remove them all. I switched to Paula&#x27;s Choice (their BHA exfoliant is light years better for my skin than this product), and my skin is the best it has looked in years. My acne is disappearing and the leftover hyper-pigmentation marks are improving very fast as well.</li>
            <li> I wished I would have found this product sooner! I have never tried anything like it, and trust me, I have tried many many many beauty products!!!  The product is very \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; since it is water base. I use about 4 pumps for my entire face. At first, I was like, \\&quot;Oh, just another exfoliator...\\&quot; You will start seeing white little balls forming on your skin -&gt; dead skin cells being exfoliated.  NOW, after rinsing my face OMG!!!! My skin had NEVER felt so smooth - EVER!!!  I mean it was amazing! It was so clean and smooth, almost like as smooth as glass (in a good way).  The product was def not abrasive at all, and yet it removed more dead skin cells that my $100 scrubbing tool!  I am hooked! I will not purchase any other exfoliator again!!!  I would not reccommend using it more than twice a week. On my 3rd time during the week, very little dead skin cells came off, so it was just wasting the product.  A bottle should last you several months, possibly up to 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! It&#x27;s super gently on my already super sensitive skin. I love putting it on and gently scrubbing my face with the tips of my fingers, in small gentle circular motions to exfoliate my skin and getting that grainy feeling under my finger tips letting me know my dead skin has been removed.</li>
            <li> It last really long time</li>
            <li> After reading raving reviews I ordered some free samples of this product, used one sample and knew I must add to my beauty routine. You wash your face...pat dry and then use two pumps of the Cure(use dry, no need to add water) start rubbing it onto your face and watch the magic work. You will begin to feel and see the dead skin bead up on your face when done simply rinse and dry and you will have glowing clean skin ready to apply your other skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to think your other skin care products will be able to work much better now that you have truly clean skin. I take very good care of my skin and exfoliate, yet this still found  dead skin... after exfoliating. This can also be used on your hands, elbows, feet...any part of your skin and they will be much smoother after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great seller by the way...fast service well packaged to protect the product. Love Amazon...I can always find easy or hard to find items with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure many are going to disagree with me. However, this product is not exactly a miracle. There&#x27;s quite a lot of products similar to these floating in Asia which can also be found on Amazon for lower prices, but they are also smaller in size. The product is actually not that expensive as you get quite a bit of product. I&#x27;m not exactly sure, but I&#x27;ve heard this product expires six months after opening. If you&#x27;re on a budget, buy one of the smaller, similar products with a nicer price tag and if you like that, buy this one for comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does work, and it actually does quite a good job at removing my dead skin cells, but about just as equal as my other products do. It also did make my face look cleaner and brighter looking, and yes, they are your dead skin cells coming off, not the actual product balling up. I actually think it could be a mixture of both. It&#x27;s very watery and glides onto the face pretty nicely. I&#x27;ve used it on legs as my legs are quite dry, and I&#x27;ve noticed it doesn&#x27;t provide as much moisture as my other products. but it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve bought and used this since about five months ago if that provides any other additional information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel would probably best fit sensitive or minimally dry skin. If your skin is extremely dry and flaky, this product is not going to get rid of your problem. It does moisturize as it contains a dose of glycerin and is good for sensitive skin mainly because it&#x27;s mostly water and unscented, but it smells a bit like chlorine to me. Although it does actually do a pretty good job at taking away my dead skin cells, it&#x27;s pretty equal in terms of other gel based exfoliators. A clean and dry face is recommended for best results before using. Dead skin and oil do not cause acne, bacteria that gets mixed in with it causes acne. Most exfoliators SHOULD fade scars because the point of it is to shed dead skin and reveal newer, fresher looking skin, however, lots of exfoliators don&#x27;t dothis because of their harsh, grainy formula that can tear skin and cause more hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What isn&#x27;t overhyped is the seller, ppali beauty, very recommended! Package came in quick and neatly bubble wrapped which came with samples!</li>
            <li> Amazing. This stuff works.  Wash face, pat dry. Make sure your hands are dry and apply this all over your face.  Let it sit there until it turns a &#x27;milky white&#x27; color (initially it applies clear).  Let as much of it turn milky white as you can, then start to rub in circular motions delicately...as if your washing your face.  You don&#x27;t need to scrub, you&#x27;ll feel it start to ball up.  In my opinion, this isn&#x27;t the product balling up...it&#x27;s definitely skin.  I was wearing self tanner on my forehead and neck and I used this stuff on purpose to see if my tanner would life (it should if it&#x27;s exfoliating). My self tanner completely came off wherever I rubbed this stuff, not only that, but the &amp;#34;balls of skin&amp;#34; that came up were darker looking, like dirty skin!  After I use this, my face is the softest it has ever been!!  And it simply glows! It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s thanking me for letting it breath again!!  The more you use it, the less &amp;#34;balling up&amp;#34; you will have because you will be keeping up with the exfoliation process.  In fact, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had as much dead skin come off as the first or second time I used this stuff...but that&#x27;s okay with me!  Listen, I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but it does that&#x27;s all I can say.  And Iove it. I&#x27;ll always have it as long as it&#x27;s sold.</li>
            <li> good, very natural peeling</li>
            <li> I bought this item after reading all reviews on Amazon. yeah, ALL (it was 350 reviews that time)! Since I have very sensitive skin, I&#x27;m very skeptical when buying some new products, which most of the new products irritate my skin. When I received this item I was extremely excited and used it immediately. First impression is probably like other people, I was stared at the mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe how much dead skin that I got. But WAIT... were those really dead skin, I wonder... And then I made a small test by rubbing this gel on a plastic surface (I used the water bottle) and wrap my finger with a plastic bag (to prevent if any skin cell came off from my fingers when rubbing) and guess what? There was nothing happen like it did on my face, so that means the little balls came off on my face were dead skin, probably. If you guys still don&#x27;t believe those are your dead skin, well, do some test for yourself! When I came home for summer, I asked my mom to use this to exfoliate her skin but she was hesitate, after bunch of times asking, my mom finally gave it a try and immediately fell in love with CURE! I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and after using for almost 6 months, my skin became very soft and it helps narrow the pores. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Best exfoliator ever. Doesn&#x27;t feel too harsh and isn&#x27;t drying. Just wish the instructions on the bottle were in English!</li>
            <li> A ton of skin came off of my face first try! I&#x27;ve always had extremely dry, flaky spots on the crease of my nose, my forehead, and near my eyebrows. While not ALL of it came off the first time I used it last night, a GOOD portion came off. I&#x27;m positive once I use this another time during the week, that I&#x27;ll have way less dry skin than before. I woke up this morning with my face feeling super soft! Just be sure to use moisturizer after this exfoliate! (Also my seller got it to me super fast, way before Amazon estimated it would come!)</li>
            <li> After only a few uses I can tell it&#x27;s really helping my skin. I have acne prone skin and some pores I&#x27;d like to shrink and I know it&#x27;ll take some time but Aqua Gel always makes my skin look brighter and feel smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure I received a counterfeit bottle :-/ After reading other reviews of this product, I was excited to purchase it but am extremely disappointed in it now. The consistency is extremely watery… and when I rub it on my skin, it feels like alcohol and evaporates quickly. Definitely will not buy again</li>
            <li> Exfoliates like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. You can use it for any part of the body, not just your face. I love it for the backs of my legs and arms too. Used about once a month on those areas it keeps those areas nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Nice product, does what it claims, the most noticable thing us how it soothes out the skin and makes it very smooth no revelation regarding the dead cells, it peals a little, enough to give you a feel of a fresh face, but it doesn&#x27;t enhance cleaning, if you want a clean clear skin do that before applying the peel</li>
            <li> DOES NOT EXFOLIATE AT ALL - I suspected something was wrong when Cure Natural Agua Gel &amp;#34;produced&amp;#34; pearly white beads...over my dark Ebony complexion instead of &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; beads.  Suspicion confirmed - I&#x27;ve been tricked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it! I have used this product twice a week for 3 weeks now, and it rubs away dead skin 5 seconds from applying it. To me it doesn&#x27;t smell weird but some say it does. It doesnt leave my skin dry or itchy at all, its easy to apply and wash off afterwards. One pump is more than enough for your face. It left my skin more radiant after I applied my moisturizer! And no breakouts or anything! I know some people are skeptical about this product but it really does remove dead skin! I trust the many reviews that have proven that it works. Plus you can immediately feel the difference after using this because your skin feels thinner. I recommended this product to my family members and they&#x27;re now using it too! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Received fast and secure, thank you. Product does exactly what it says and anyone CAN use it! How they created this.. Miracle. Acne giving you flakies? This will gently dissolve them and then you can softly sponge your dead skin off and continue with the reigning to heal your face! Yay! Oh, the bottle will last soo long! Great buy! Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I think this is a fake version. it is very runny and sometimes the gel starts to form before i even rub my skin which argues against all that white stuff being dead skin. but it still works...pores are smaller, face feels smoother. but there is a reason this is a lot cheaper than in japan and thats becuase its a watered down version. I will still use it up (for the next year) but i will buy from japan seller next time or buy bio-essence.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! not only does it exfoliate your face, works great on your hands too.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Face skin feels so clean and smooth after use it. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this! I only use a tiny bit at the sides of my nose, which has dry patches. So one bottle that I use almost everyday lasted me more than a year. I would imagine that Japan and Korea have the best skincare products. They really care about their skin just that much. This product is evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it was my sister that started using this product. In the end it was me that end up with continued usage.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a new scrub and decided to give this one a try because I saw that it was a best seller. I can definitely see why. It is gentle enough to use everyday and definitely takes off all surface dead skin. My face feels very clean and soft after using this and moisturizers and other products apply a lot better after use.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My skin is so sensitive that I can&#x27;t use a lot of skincare products or my face will get red.  This is way more gentle than using the exfoliates that have the beads in them.  It&#x27;s neat being able to see all the dead skin coming off your face, leaving your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Really like this exfoliator.  Only used it once so far but I really liked how quickly it worked.  No stinging or crazy smell.  No irritation occurred.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t repurchase. It doesn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> WOW.  For the money..it&#x27;s a great deal, I must say.</li>
            <li> not bad, but not so good as i was told. i don&#x27;t think it will help clean my face. no recommends.</li>
            <li> No, that&#x27;s not dead skin rolling up in all those little balls. Once the alcohol (yes, alcohol which dries skin) evaporates or dries, it forms the little globs that you think is dead skin being exfoliated. It&#x27;s not dead skin. Don&#x27;t be fooled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, it makes a seriously great demo watching it happen, so compelling it makes it a best-selling product. If only it were true. But once you look into the science of it--all fake. Don&#x27;t fall for it, save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the money, get something less expensive without the skin-drying alcohol.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought this product because I&#x27;d seen so many good reviews on it, and boy does it meet expectations. I don&#x27;t speak Japanese so I had to youtube how to use it, but it&#x27;s honestly one of the best facial exfoliators I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all it smells like alcohol and when you start to rub your skin it burns and it is not cleaning your pores it is the product that is flaking off your skin, that is why you have to put in on dry! HELLOOO people I read the review and tried it out and it is way to expensive to put some glue and alcolhol on my face.  My face got red and hurt and didnt do a thing.  I wanted to believe it was doing something so I let a few friends try it, they felt the same way! JUNK Do not spend your money!  I am a 35 year old that has combination skin and every now and again I get terrible acne for no reason, hormones.  The best thing that worked for me and my acne after spending lots of money is BIORE Ice acne fighting cleanse $5 at Walmart so I guess you do not get what you pay for always!  I do use Mary Kay and seem to enjoy their products, but the acne comes and goes with what I eat and hormones so did not get rid of my random acne.  Who wants acne at 35 hahahah WELL DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ITS A LIE</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have seriously sensitive skin and have never found an exfoliating product that I could use, until now. Cure Natural Aqua Gel leaves my skin smooth and soft, with absolutely zero irritation. I have tried other exfoliators of this type, but this is the first one that actually works for me. The flaky patches I had on my cheeks are gone and my skin is clear and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit confused by the previous reviews that mention an \\&quot;alcohol smell\\&quot; or that there is \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; in the product.  The product I received has absolutely no fragrance or odor (alcohol or otherwise) and there is no alcohol listed in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure Natural Aqua Gel ingredients: water, glycerin, acrylates/C10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dicocodimonium chloride, steartrimonium bromide, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, gingko biloba extract , rosmarinus officinalis/rosemary leaf extract, butylene glycol.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product, I was unsure what the rave was all about but I really like it and it makes my skin feels smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Item arrived early &amp; good packaging. Great product - does what was described. It&#x27;s a big bottle, about 5 inches tall. This will probably last me 6 months and I use it every 2 days. You do need to exfoliate very well on your face with this gel or else your skin will become dry (if you did not get all the dead skin off). Sometimes I have to use it two to three times to get everything off. If it didn&#x27;t dry up my skin I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Wonderful...totally cleared my skin. Forever my regimen.</li>
            <li> It does seem to get rid of a layer of skin in a gentle way.</li>
            <li> it works, and after using it, my face turned to be smoothed! really good!</li>
            <li> Works for your face and feet</li>
            <li> This leaves my face feeling so soft.  I use it once a week and follow with a moisturizing mask and find that my face lotions sink in much better after using this then when I used a grittier exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I feel clean after using the production.that &#x27;s very gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li> Cure is the best exfoliate Ive ever used.... I use this when my clairisonic needs a new brush head. It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin and you can see the dead skin coming off! It does not dry out the skin and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals which irritate the skin it&#x27;s great for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Takes things off my face I didn&#x27;t realize were there!</li>
            <li> This stuff is really amazing.  I have very fair, very sensitive skin and this product used sparingly works wonders.</li>
            <li> After seeing reviews on it I thought I&#x27;d give it a try (bubzbeauty).I have oily acne prone skin.  It picked up a lot of my dead skin, especially around the nose.  I think it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes on this product based on other reviews.  Unfortunately, after one use of this so-called exfoliant, those expectations have been dashed.  This product did not exfoliate whatsoever.  Using it as instructed, I did notice the balls forming on my skin, however, the fact that these balls remained white when my skin is brown let me know this product is nothing more than snake oil.</li>
            <li> Yes, as many other reviewers said, I can clearly see my dead skin coming off. But it didn&#x27;t make my skin &#x27;baby soft&#x27; or &#x27;extraordinary&#x27;. It was a good exfoliator as it gets the job done very very well, but in terms of softening my skin, it didn&#x27;t do it. But i would reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a good exfoliator, though it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Oh how I feel completely duped for buying this, not so much on the raved reviews but because I trusted a product that I can&#x27;t even read what is on the bottle. Granted I choose to go with the positive reviews of this product over the negatives, and boy did I HOPE it would be some sort of holy grail. I used it a few times (prob 3x) and I think that was too much, at least for my skin. I have serious acne prone skin, hyper pigmentation and cystic acne (the cystic has calmed down since, thanks to prescription intervention) but when I used this on my skin, URGH!! it felt gross and when I rubbed it the title white grains didn&#x27;t really show up. When I washed my face it left my face feel waxy and sticky even after the third wash. I think it may have left a film on my skin that clogged my pores (which are huge cuz I have acne skin) further and triggered my acne. Listen I don&#x27;t want to knock any product, we are all different and what works for me may or may not work for you.....but this for me was a complete waste of my money and is one of my biggest regret purchases. PS. the top of the bottle was broken when it arrived even though it was in a plastic ......should have figured it was only going to be down hill from there.</li>
            <li> Thanks. I really love it. So sorry about my late review. I was busy so I forgot :)</li>
            <li> Perfect, I love it. I will order it again.</li>
            <li> Get stuff read about and I had to to try it. Arrived here in few days</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I noticed some reviewers saying that they thought they were just rubbing off the solution itself and not dead skin.  I don&#x27;t think that is correct.  What I do think is that with continued use, your skin will not have as much dead skin to remove.  I noticed this after about a week of use, I just wasn&#x27;t getting as much gray gunk off my face as the first day.  However, when I put the solution on my neck and chest area (areas that I had not used the product before) I was back to the gross roles on gray skin being rubbed away.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is a very gentle exfoliator without rough ingredients.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I rated the product with 3 stars because when I received it, the nozzle was broken. May have happened during the shipping process, however, with it broken the process of getting the actual gel out ended up being a really messy process. The gel worked good. However it isn&#x27;t as great a everyone keeps raving it is. My skin felt slightly dry and rubbery after washing with it. It is very gentle, and did not cause me to break out. It is good, but it&#x27;s not great. I probably will not repurchase due to the price. It&#x27;s worth a try :))</li>
            <li> It is everything that the hype is about. It has become a regular part of my weekly regimen and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> My skin as of late has been feeling really rough and I had no clue why. I could see all of these rough patches that weren&#x27;t necessarily dry but it just looked like a build up of something. I could never get my skin to feel baby soft, even with my clarisonic. I had thought I was exfoliating enough, but apparently not. I used this on my skin and soo much of my dead skin cells rubbed off, it was disgusting and satisfying at the same time. After I rinsed it all off, my skin was baby smooth and with no irritation, I couldn&#x27;t believe it. This was the only thing that could get my skin feeling smooth again. Not even grainy exfoliators have done this for me.</li>
            <li> First I got this because of a youtube person. I am so happy I listen to her and got this.  This is now my go to exfoliator. There is no beads, no nut shells, nothing harsh about this. It is a gel that when you apply it to your face and run in circular motions all the dead skin is is rubbed off as well. little balls of dead skin start to appear.  I apply on dry skin rub for about 30 second to almost a minute. I hop in the shower and rinse my face and then wash my face with my normal face wash. I only use this once to twice a week. I have noticed that if I use it anymore than that it does not work as well. Only 1 to 2 pumps are needed for my whole face and neck. I have used this all the way down my chest when i have had really bad break outs.&lt;br /&gt;This does cost more than most exfoliators, but I have noticed it has lasted longer than any of them that I have used. This has never irritated my skin or given my any issue. I have gotten many friends to switch over to this. I will be repurchasing this as soon as I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very oily, acne-prone young lady. I bought this a couple of days ago and hollllly smokes I&#x27;m so addicted to it. You squirt out 2 pumps of the gel, massage it all over your face, and see your dead skin cells roll off your skin. After washing the product off, my face felt soft and beautiful and clean. I use it every morning and night, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;ll update this review with how it affects my skin after a few weeks of use, but so far I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! However, if you use it too much it can make you look colorless and dry. I was so excited about this product that I used it for about 4 days out of the week, and I learned that moderation is key with this product. I now like to use it 1 or 2 times a month. I would also suggest moisturizing right after you use it to quench your newly revealed skin&#x27;s thirst. Also, avoid using this on blemishes, it will turn them into red marks which take a lot longer to heal.</li>
            <li> OMGOODNESS. I completely understand why this is a #1 product. I luv this gell.  I have had this gel for quite some time and recommended it to at least 20 people. This gel does exactly what it declares. I use it on my face, neck, chest, hands and feet. I will definently purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> This is literally the single best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on Amazon.  Where do I begin? I&#x27;m a 17 year old female with moderate acne (at least I was).  I suffered from a lot of deep seated black and white heads that caused redness and pain, and it doesnt help that I have a tendency to squeeze zits... It wasn&#x27;t severe by any means but it interfered enough to the point where I didn&#x27;t want to have sleepovers for fear of people seeing me without makeup. I tried a lot of medication including antibiotics, various strengths of benzoyl peroxide, and birth control, but nothing made a major difference. Then everything changed! I&#x27;ve been using this every 2-3 days for the past month in conjunction with a daily moisturizer and BP acne wash and my skin has never been better.  I leave Cure on until it&#x27;s dry, then lightly wet my fingers and rub my skin. My dead skin starts rubbing off like dried glue, and it&#x27;s wonderful. The first time brought off the most, by far, but this stuff still does its job even a month later. My skin is now softer, brighter, and clearer. I have the confidence to go makeup free any day now! I HIGHLY recommend.&lt;br /&gt;****An important note**** I did experience more breakouts right after I started using this but continued anyway because my skin was getting softer. It turns out that I was just bring all the deep seated impurities to the surface, and now my skin is exponentially clearer, with breakouts MUCH rarer than ever before.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if because when it was delivered it was extremely cold outside but my pump bottle was not a gel it was already liquid and did not exfoliate very well.  I am quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is so different from any other I&#x27;ve tried. I personally think all the hype for this product is true! Left my skin feeling super soft and not dry or tight.</li>
            <li> Oeder was shipped within one day, and recieved the product within days.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the packaging of the product to ensure no damage during travels, and came with a thank you note and little gifts as well.&lt;br /&gt;My experience felt very personal and I will definately order from this seller again!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for the Aqua gel, I am very pleased with the results, will be buying back-up soon. Its very gentle so great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;skin feels very smooth with a brighter and more even tone.  Best exfoliator ive used so far!!</li>
            <li> This product is really wonderful. It does exactly what it says, removing the dead skin cells from the skin. My face felt great after and with no irritation. My only issue is the price. But luckily i found a comparable product from natures republic. It comes in a spray and is only 9.99.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews of your skin almost dissolving onto your fingertips and of course became curious about this product. After much testing and analyzing the product I must say that my skin feels significantly cleaner and smoother after every use, but the small little particles are certainly not my skin. How do I know this? I placed it on glass and it still developed the small particles without any skin contact. If those were your skin cells shedding, your skin would certainly be very irritated after each use. I don&#x27;t know exactly what is in this product, but I&#x27;ve tried many exfoliators and this one is definitely on my top 10. Your skin has a very squeaky clean feel and almost flushed look to it (like a baby), maybe it helps with blood circulation also. I highly recommend this product for a deep cleanse that does not leave your skin feeling dry, tight or sensitive.</li>
            <li> Excellent the item deliver on time</li>
            <li> great product and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> In LOVE with this product... item came faster than i excepted</li>
            <li> This product is great to remove dead skin cells from your face!  Unfortunately the bottle does not have instructions in English, just Japanese.  I apply a thin layer of this gel on my face after cleansing and drying off.  I wait for the product to dry some, and the dry skin cells start to become apparent on your face.  Then I massage my face with my fingers (gently) which further loosens dead skin cells.  Follow up with a good rinse off using  a soft washcloth (if desired). I also use my cleanser to be sure I get the gel completely off, and follow up with toner and moisturizer.  Works extremely well-does not seem to be harsh or chemically at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this more than once or twice a week-you don&#x27;t want to overdo it!</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product- easy to use and seems like it refreshes my skin and is steadily reducing some acne scarring.  Your skin feels great after rinsing--- very nourished, not dry and tight.</li>
            <li> I love it! I can get rid of all my dead skin cells after I work out and my acne is clearing up! My face literally feels squeaky clean after.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I never review products--but for this product I had to--because that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
            <li> Same review as I gave moisturizer but I will say, this is an excellent exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Beauty blogger Maskcara told me about this. I don&#x27;t know what it is and it is a little bit freaky, but it is magic. Small circular motions make a layer of my skin come right off. It is strange and wonderful all at once, and my skin ends up so soft, and the hyper-pigmentation I suffer from seems to lighten each time I use it.</li>
            <li> All you need to do is apply this gently on your face like lotion, and your dead cell will come off in 60 seconds. No rough grains, no stretching, all gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> The results are not as expected</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and thought this product is going to be alright, but it got my skin&#x27;s condition worse and more uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Is much more gentle on the skin than other exfoliators that have scrubbing beads. But the result is much better since the dead skin literally just falls off by itself. My mom tried it and she really looked several years younger because her skin was much brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> So different from anything I have ever used.  I really like the results.  When I use it to often, my skin gets sensitive.  I use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, mild cleanser. My face feels clean but not overstripped.</li>
            <li> Love it, I used to pay 60 USD for a trial sized equivalent. I don&#x27;t know what the gimmick with the white stuff is, but it does help exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of annoying to pull off pieces afterwards, but that happens with the designer equivalent as well.</li>
            <li> Mine does not exfoliate at all. I feel I have gotten a knock-off. Waste of my money. I do acknowledge that all those reviews can&#x27;t be wrong. My product should be replaced.</li>
            <li> Friend recommended this to me, now I am recommending to everyone I know. So cool and unclogs all dirt out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really exfoliates the skin and isn&#x27;t abrasive at all. No more whiteheads and black heads :) This product has really worked miracles for my skin!</li>
            <li> How I ordered this product was because I heard it was the number 1 selling exfoliating product in Japan, being so popular that it doesn&#x27;t even need to advertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used this product I was completely shocked, as I scrubbed my face, I actually felt the places where dead skin cell build-up accumulated. It&#x27;s easy to notice this because there will be areas that feel raised as you scrub this product on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought my cleanser properly disposed of my dead skin cells, but this product proves that it wasn&#x27;t the case. A wonderful product indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no smell by the way and it did not irritate my skin at all. This product doesn&#x27;t dry the skin either, but it also isn&#x27;t too helpful to be used as a moisturizer. Exfoliation is the key word here but it does an amazing job doing it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Too good to be true but isn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> When the bottle arrived I was super excited as I&#x27;ve wanted this for sometime. But when opening the bottle out of it&#x27;s plastic wrapping the pump tip cracked and fell right off. I was so excited to use it so I tried to overlook it and work with it.  Here we are and I&#x27;ve only used it twice because it&#x27;s just too annoying to mess with. I saw results after a use but of course the next day I was flaky again. I can&#x27;t make a fair judgment on the actual process without consistent biweekly uses. Why did you have to break you stupid bottle! :(</li>
            <li> awww nice skin after using. It works awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just curious as to what is in this stuff?  Everything but the name of the product is in Chinese.  I hope I&#x27;m not putting acid on my face!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe its effect! My skin is so much smoother with it! Awesome product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Does a great job of exfoliating my face without any stinging or redness. I also use it on my neck, elbows, feet and hands. I&#x27;m creating a new system for myself since I found out that my Proactiv facial scrub has polyethylene &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; which are accumulating in our water systems and the fish we eat. Switch to Cure for twice a week exfoliation and looking at Murad or some other system for a natural exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I think I have more breakouts now and my skin feels sensitive. Maybe, I&#x27;m applied too vigorously.</li>
            <li> My skin is always SO amazingly soft after one pump of this gel exfoliator, its a little on the pricey side but since one pump is enough for your whole face, and you&#x27;d only use this product once a week I personally this its worth it. :]</li>
            <li> Not sure yet cause I just start using it only 1week now.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have sensitive skin, so I have to be careful with which products I use. That being said, I also suffer from dry skin and bouts of adult acne. When I first stumbled upon this product I was leery to try it and was tempted to use my sister as the official guinea pig (that&#x27;s what family is for, right?). That would have meant waiting another month and I was too curious to wait. Am I glad I gave into my curiosity because this stuff is amazing! My face was so soft and smooth after the first use that I was literally standing there with my mouth agape in shock. Even now I still can&#x27;t believe how nice my face feels. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the packaging was great. The product exfoliates the skin gently, leaving the skin smooth and soft. Lotions, creams, and serums are able to work better because the dead skin cells are removed on the upper layer.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot! I would like to recommend it to all of my friends and I will continue purchasing this product after I finish my first one.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is kind of weird because it doesn&#x27;t have any beads or anything so at first I was a little bit skeptical. However it does work. When you apply it and start rubbing it you can see the dead skin coming off; still, it isn&#x27;t harsh with the skin, it is not irritating or anything and it does leave the skin much softer and nicer. The only &amp;#34;inconvenient&amp;#34; I see is that after washing the gel off you need to put moisturizer on IMMEDIATELY afterwards or your skin will end up really dry. The other thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have the instructions in english but you can find several videos on youtube showing how it works.</li>
            <li> I should start off by saying that my skin has been so dry and uncomfortably flakey--like big, noticeable flakes of dead skin on my face despite using my softener and lotion. My usual exfoliator, a sugar scrub that&#x27;s thirty-two dollars, didn&#x27;t do the trick. I have combination skin and although my t-zone is oily, it&#x27;s been super dry. I saw this product on a bubzbeauty youtube review, saw the good and so-so reviews on amazon, but decided to give it a try. I literally ordered this product two days ago and just received it today. I followed the instructions when I washed my face tonight and was immediately blown away! The flakes are COMPLETELY gone and my skin is just so nice and silky now. I&#x27;m so impressed that I decided I really had to write a review immediately :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;I read another reviewer&#x27;s tips, and she&#x27;s right about how the product works better if you gently massage it into your skin in circular motions. Additional tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The consistency is a little tricky to work with if you immediately pump a few pumps of the product into your fingers. If you don&#x27;t want to waste product, you should definitely do one pump at a time or half a pump and apply to one section of your face. E.g. I used one pump on my chin and then massaged Cure on that area and then pumped Cure onto my finger tips and used it on my cheeks etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Make sure your face is freshly washed and pat dry before you use Cure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Immediately continue on with your facial routine. That&#x27;s when you notice the difference because your skin will have absorbed your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Very helpful review and video with English subtitles about how to use Cure: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional comment: I used Cure twice tonight because of the severity of the dryness in my skin and also because I was trying to get the hang of how the product reacts to my skin. After the second time, the flakes were completely gone! I&#x27;m definitely going to continue to buy Cure and toss outmy other face scrubs!</li>
            <li> The best exfoliator I&#x27;ve tried! It came with two little samples. I only used one of them and it totally removed these annoying dead skin on my nose</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading reviews across the web.  This stuff Really works!  I have been dealing with breakouts and have been using Retin-A, which leads to flaky skin.  I also have clogged pores.  This gel is extremely gentle on the skin, isn&#x27;t harsh at all YET it honestly removes dead skin better than many top-end exfoliators I have used.  My skin is refreshed, several hyperpigmentation marks have lessened from this gentle but powerful gel.  I definitely recommend to others, including those who have sensitivity and redness issues, as this does not aggravate the condition, which is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have acne and some bad scaring I have tried expensive to cheap skin care products, nothing worked until I tried this ,  I have only been using this product for two days and its already clearing up half of my acne and making my scars fade away. this is great for people who have dry skin or like me have acne its the best exfoliator in japan for a reason!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have dealt with acne frustration since 17 and after 5 years I&#x27;ve finally found a product that has greatly reduced my breakouts. It&#x27;s amazing how much it has helped clear my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel is a bit runny, but it works as its supposed to. As you massage it in, you can see all if the dead skin coming right off. After rinsing, your face is soooo smooth and feels fresh and light. It really feels like you have given your face a deep cleansing and polish all in one. It isn&#x27;t harsh on the skin, doesnt dry it out, and is odorless. A little bit does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this gel as an add-in to your skin-care routine, as I have noticed a significant difference in texture tone and clarity after only 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> this is the best facial product I have ever got.  I use it twice~three times a week, it is really effective. You can feel and touch the power. Every time after I use it my skin becomes smoothy and shiny~~~~</li>
            <li> Bought this product because i wanted gentle exfoliation. Well, this stuff is gentle, but too gentle for me. It gets most dry skin off after a few minutes, but it smells weird, takes a long time to ship, a bit pricey and isn&#x27;t as effective as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticed that someone voted down this review, so I wanted to elaborate on exactly why this didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most off-putting part of this product is the smell. I could not get used to it after several weeks. I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it besides sort of garlicy, and it lingered on my hands for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliation itself was not bad. It removed about 70% of the dry skin from my face and left it smooth, if kind of smelly. I voted it down because I&#x27;ve used other products half the price of Cure that removed dry skin I didn&#x27;t even know was dry. Namely, this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Frutique-Papaya-Exfoliating-Gel/dp/B0048UFTOU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s minus one star for the smell I could not bear, one for the price and one for the less powerful exfoliation. If you have sensitive skin which I do not, maybe this is the one for you, but not for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and I am very impressed. I am a black woman with problematic skin. I used this product with &amp;#34;Konjac Facial Sponge&amp;#34; and it left my skin feeling super soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Although I still applied my typical moisturizer, my skin did not feel like it even needed it. I only gave it 4/5 stars because I just got the product. But, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Works like a miracle. Love the result. I love it does not have fragrance. I have really sensitive skin, so once a week is ok but i used it 2 times a week one time, my skin burned bad (but i recovered quick)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator works fairly well on facial skin; does absolutely nothing for hands, cuticles, etc.  The reason that I only give it three stars, is that I have broken out fairly significantly every time I use it.  I get decently smooth skin initially, followed by acneic eruptions.  Just a word of caution to those with acne.</li>
            <li> when you rub it into your skin, you basically feel tiny layer of skin rubbing off. face is exceptionally smooth and drinks up whatever cream you are putting on it. i have had something like this, but it was in different country, and in America i haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like this. it cleanse the blackheads from my nose right off. love it. The major drawback is that all info in some language i can&#x27;t decipher, but still 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Dry-dead skin gone in seconds.  You will never buy another exfoliator.  I can now wear foundation without worrying about it accentuating any dry, cracked dead skin that may be - and now thanks to Cure, is never - on my face.  BUY IT.</li>
            <li> Very effective and also clear my keratosis pilaris on my arm❤️ Love it!</li>
            <li> Was very impressed with this stuff. My face feels super clean, cleaner than using my apricot scrub and I use that every other day. I&#x27;m sceptical about the white stuff that balls up being skin but honestly it doesn&#x27;t matter to me either way. It made a couple of my small pimples on my forehead open up and bleed not sure whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing depending on the harshness of clean you like. Face is very smooth, appears brighter. I did put some on my lips which were flaky and slightly chapped not sure if you should though lol it did make my lips super smooth and dead skin free.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and it does seem to remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> As the gel dries it rolls up into little bits/balls which look like dead skin cells, making you THINK it&#x27;s your skin being gently exfoliated. However the bits are NOT your dead skin cells, they are formed by the product. You can easily do a little experiment: Put on rubber or latex free gloves, place a small amount of product on one gloved hand and rub with the other glove hand, you&#x27;ll see the same bits form, no skin involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~*Ingredients*~&lt;br /&gt;-Water&lt;br /&gt;-Glycerin&lt;br /&gt;-C10-30, alkyl acrylate crosspolymer: Thickeners that when rubbed form little bits/balls with this particular formula.&lt;br /&gt;~*With Microscopic Amounts of the following*~&lt;br /&gt;-Dicocodimonium:  Emulsifier&lt;br /&gt;-Chloride: Type of chloride is NOT revealed :-(&lt;br /&gt;-Steartrimonium Bromide: Can&#x27;t imagine why this would be in any product for face/skin.

            <li> Like many other reviewers I saw this product on budzbeauty on youtube. I have combination skin but my t zone is super oily and I have large pores. My skin is a little dull and the texture is not really even. When I went to get a facial I was told I need to exfoliate more often to get rid of dead skin. I brought the clearsonic Mia and pumpkin exfoliating serum but both of them irritate a little when it&#x27;s applied to my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m so happy I found cure it is by far the best product when it comes to exfoliation. I hardly use the Mia and abandoned the pumpkin serum now (I still use the Origen clay mask once a week to deal with the oily t zone )&lt;br /&gt;The difference between cure and other exfoliating methods is that cure react with already dead skin. It&#x27;s not an acid which can peel live skin or like the rubing of brush or beats that if you are not careful you can irritate your skin. It is really gentle and when you are done your face is soft like baby skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I  went to my local wholefoods. They have a machine there that can take a photo of once side of your face and tell you about amount of your wrinkles,skin texture, pore, redness, bacteria count etc. and after using this product only a few times (I got it right before  Xmas and I use twice a week) my skin has improved tremendously. The pore count was 20 %less then last time I checked. Every aspect of my skin improved. I think it&#x27;s because after I do a good job exfoliating other skin care product and hydrating masks can be absorb more easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely please with this product and I have left family and friends to try it and they have been all very impress. You can feel the difference from the very first application</li>
            <li> I received the Cure Natural Aqua in the mail last week. I was so excited to try it out that I immediately opened it and rubbed two or three pumps onto my face. To my amazement dead skin started to bead up and fall off of my face. This was right after I had scrubbed my face with a blackhead scrub (baking soda and orange juice)! My face felt so clean and fresh. To further test it out, I tried it on my father&#x27;s hands that were very dry from winter weather and it left him with baby smooth hands. This product works, however, do not expect it to clear your pores, acnes, and scars in one or two uses. It takes time.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this product, because I don&#x27;t want to scrub my face with hard things anymore. This product does work as advertised - the gel gently dissolves dead skin cells and the massaging lifts it up. I got a lot of balled-up skin every time I used it (three times in 10 days). I do think it&#x27;s skin and not the dried-up product, because I tested it on different areas of my body and also non-skin surfaces like a porcelain plate. If you&#x27;ve ever gotten a Korean body scrub, then you know that a LOT of dead skin can come off! That&#x27;s what using this is like.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this product makes me break out in red itchy bumps on large areas of my face and also a few white heads! I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, so I know it was this product. I don&#x27;t know if my skin is just sensitive to this, or because I am also using AHA/BHA exfoliants and it reacted badly. At any rate, if your skin tolerates this, it is a great way to exfoliate! Too bad it doesn&#x27;t work with mine.&lt;br /&gt;Last thing, this is a slightly milky gel with no scent - no alcohol smell at all. I mention this because others seem to have gotten tampered bottles filled with rubbing alcohol and that is not the authentic product. I got mine from ppali beauty, and it was legitimate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have had problems with my skin for the longest of times and after using this my skin texture, color, and blemishes have improved. I can&#x27;t contribute all of the success to this product as I have also changed my face wash to one without fragrances and other harsh chemicals (I currently use Simple foaming cleanser, as I don&#x27;t feel it is smart to spend so much on something that is temporarily going to be on your face), and have increased my exercise regimen, and I currently use Clinique Dramatically Different moisturizing lotion/gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very watery, you are supposed to apply it on your face, let it sit, then massage. I have quite sensitive skin and this is extremely gentle. I love that it isn&#x27;t a scrub because I feel that scrubs are somewhat damaging and still don&#x27;t completely accomplish the job. It removes quite a lot of dead skin cells, and leaves your skin better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after using this I have noticed that my skin is brighter, plumper, more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;After awhile I have noticed that my skin is starting to even out as I have many acne scar that are starting to fade. My face is actually getting lighter, as playing tennis and other outdoor activities have darkened my face. My pores have also begun to diminish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and from my experience of an exhausting amount of exfoliators, I must say I this is my holy grail.</li>
            <li> Works! Don&#x27;t use too much at once or leave it on too long or it will burn! Also, to maintain results, you must do it 2x a week or it will revert. Besides that it does all that it promises :)</li>
            <li> My skin got worst. :(</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS LEGIT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this DOES NOT work for you, it&#x27;s probably a FAKE! Every website has a risk of selling fake beauty products if it&#x27;s not an actual certified beauty store or website! So just because YOU may have gotten a fake doesn&#x27;t mean this stuff does not work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Retin-A-Micro cream (tretinoin 0.05%) every other night on my face. It causes my face to peel horribly and when it doesn&#x27;t peel horribly, it&#x27;s dry and you can see dry patches of skin under makeup. It was horrible for a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before attending a major special occasion (wedding, dinner, graduation party, etc...), I used to have to stop using the tretinoin cream a few days before so that my skin could be smooth and look great. UNTIL I FOUND THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became a true believe when this past weekend, I had a spur of the moment business dinner meeting. I used my tretinoin the night before and I moisturized my face intensely before applying my makeup. My skin still looked hideous. I could see how cakey my makeup looked because of the dry skin. I washed the makeup off and then used the CURE aqua gel. I started re-applying my makeup from square 1. My skin looked perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a quick fix for dry blotches of skin, use this. It&#x27;s the most gentle and effective exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used. Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this product at all. It just did not work the way i wanted. I feel like i had better results from apricot scrub. Plus the entire bottle is in Japanese so i cant read anything about it or whats in it.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best  exfoliator I have ever use I didn&#x27;t use it for long time I start in a month ago but I can see my skin is more clear and clean I&#x27;m using it once a week. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.. Best exfoliator ever</li>
            <li> Going to start reading the one star reviews from now on. I purchased a bottle of pure nothingness. This does N O T H - I N G.  Put  it on, waited three minutes, rubbed my face and it was just dry to the point my fingers could not &amp;#34;gently rub in&amp;#34; squat! Did not see any &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; being rolled off. Nothing, not even a pin size anything appeared.</li>
            <li> Better than any other exfoliating product I&#x27;ve ever used. Never again will I use an unnatural rough scrub like St. Ives or anything else. This is super gentle and seriously makes the skin BABY soft! Asian skincare products are always ON POINT!</li>
            <li> Best gentle exfoliate ever. I use this everyday with vitamin C serum and my dark spots have been going away and my skin is so soft. I have dark African American skin that is oily to combination. Super awesome, I love it.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time and in good shape.  I tried the gel as soon as I received it.  I put the gel on my right face cheek and rubbed it in.  Within a couple of minutes I felt the top layer of the skin come off.  I then applied it to my left face cheek and rubbed it in and then my forehead.  In each instance I could see and feel the top layer of the skin come off into tiny particles.  Love this product!  I now use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Was no good. a waste of my money. Ne</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of this product in removing dead skin cells that I actually can feel and see.</li>
            <li> SEEMS TO BE WORKING... MY SKIN FEELS SO SMOOTH. ME LIKE :-)</li>
            <li> Another example of 5 stars not being enough! I&#x27;m not sure how I found this here at Amazon, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. A few times a week I put it on my dry, cleansed skin. I wait 3 minutes then gently start rubbing small circles on my face to loosen this product. Skin comes away easily (especially helpful for healing acne dry/scab skin). The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that I cannot use it around my chin line: I have fine hair and this attaches to my peach fuse and it very tough to remove (so I simply use it everywhere else on my face). I&#x27;ve been using it for a while (I&#x27;m on my second bottle) and it is certainly one of the reasons for my improved skin.</li>
            <li> The best exfoliate product I have every used. I love it! My skin feels so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works or if it is even exfoliating my skin. All I do know is my skin practically glows when I use this product. I use it about twice a week. Love this!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a month now, about twice a week. As a person with very dry skin, this is a must have. You just apply on skin after cleansing (but be careful for the skin not to be wet) and wait a few minutes. All the dry skin balls up and I remove with a wet cloth. This really helps in not looking cakey wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely hooked on this amazing product. It absolutely rids your face of dulling dead skin, revealing fresh new skin underneath. I do not experience sensitivity or even dryness after using this product...just soft, fresh, glowing skin! I recommended this product to my mother and aunt and now they&#x27;re hooked too!&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s time to purchase again, I will buy from this seller! I ordered on a Friday and got my package on Monday! They were kind enough to include a generous amount of samples and a hand written note thanking me for shopping with them! Nice touch! Thank you!</li>
            <li> contains alcohol, so caution if you have really sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not over drying my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;product itself contains no scrub or anything that can damage your pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;removes dead skin effectively (if those little white things came out skin that it claims to be)</li>
            <li> Cure is Magic in a bottle, best kept secret in Japan. My face showed improvements immediately and it is very soft and smooth that it does not irritate a person with soft or sensitive skin. Used twice a week will rejuvenate and improve the texture of your face.</li>
            <li> It has cleared many of my break outs and dead skin. Even my friends love it! Best exfoliator I have ever tried :)</li>
            <li> Most wonderful peeling gel I have used so far !</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product so much. Luckily it was given to me as a trial gift. First of all I have combination/normal skin and this product just did not work for my skin. It wasn&#x27;t this magical skin soften so personally its not worth the price. Now I must say that if you are someone with sensitive skin then this product will probably work wonders for you, so I think its all about the skin condition with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not hate it, since it actually cleansed my face but its not that my pores decreased, and the softness of skin I can get with other products I have for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin. I can never get dead skin off without upsetting my acne or drying out my skin. This stuff is amazing! Great for removing old dead skin gently and still leaving your sensitive skin soft and refreshed. Awesome!!</li>
            <li> I love it. It has watery texture, when you rub it gently into the skin, the dead skin (the very superficial layer) falls gently forming small balls. I wash my face with just water afterwards.I have used similar product that I bought in Thailand long ago, it was more like ticker gel and I didn&#x27;t trust it to put on my face, but I remember thinking OMG, that is so amazing. Brighter smoother skin is what you get. All the labels are in Japanese, I am just curious to know what are they. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal product, innovative formula and very easy to use. It blows so many other enzymatic exfoliators out of the water. And for half the price as well.</li>
            <li> Really works! Leaves my skin so smooth! And since you only have to use it every few weeks the bottle lasts you quite a while.</li>
            <li> Really works!!! I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I just got my Cure Natural Aqua Gel last week and the first use was not too bad. I was amazed how the product can be so gentle yet thoroughly cleanse my skin. I also used it on my heels to gently rub off the dead flaky skin. I love it and strongly recommend it~</li>
            <li> This stuff I tried for weeks and nothing good happened. When rubbed on your face it give you the illusion that it is exfoliating your skin but it isn&#x27;t your skin that you see coming off. I tried it on my 10 year old son to test his skin which he has a baby face and it did the same thing. Particles shed but it&#x27;s the product that creates it. Don&#x27;t let it fool you! I threw it in the trash.. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I love it! The best exfoliation ever! Thank you &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Amazing! I read reviews on Google, Amazon, &amp; most definitely YouTube before purchasing . I will say that this product is absolutely amazing. I saw a difference after one single use. My pores were noticeably smaller. I will be buying more of this product. Holy Grail</li>
            <li> glad I found out about this product great product</li>
            <li> My face feels pretty clean after the use.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this, not wanting to waist money on yet another disappointing product.  Thankfully, I decided to give it a try despite the reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t exfoliating.  If you follow the directions, it really works.  My skin looks better and better.  Even small wrinkles are less noticeable.  Someone told me today that my skin looked beautiful.  My skin is usually oily acne prone, large pored, and very sensitive.  Now, it just looks better, and feels softer.</li>
            <li> Used this stuff for years! It helped my acne A LOT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from the one I bought in China. Even they are in the same brand. I think the one I bought in China is a fake one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t routinely exfoliate and I would say that I my skin is mature (I&#x27;m over 40) so I was expecting greater results upon using product. There are little white pills that appear after applying -  particularly on the fingers of the hand that is applying it. Not a lot appear on my face at all. After using this routinely twice a week for several weeks now, I can&#x27;t say definitively say that my skin is smoother or more youthful in appearance. I am unlikely to purchase this again but will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 2 times but so far it&#x27;s working great. My skin has never felt so soft. If anything changes I will come back and update this review.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. Product dries on it own. Skin is still flakey and dry with no improvement or change from this product.</li>
            <li> Did not know I have been living this many years under a dense layer of dead cells. I get so much skin compliments all of a sudden</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Product is awesome.</li>
            <li> This product does remove the dead skin cells off of your face. However it doesn&#x27;t really do anything to reduce the size of your pores.</li>
            <li> First, a little background to give you perspective.  I am a 51 year old woman with combination skin and a very fair complexion.  I have near to no wrinkles due to a lifetime of using Retin A and wearing sunscreen as if it were a religious requirement.  As I&#x27;m experiencing hormonal changes my T-zone has been breaking out, particularly with blackheads on my nose.  I&#x27;ve stepped up the strength of the Retin A I use just on my nose.  This has helped, but causes the skin to dry and peel.  I have been using Hankook A3F[on] Turn Again Peeling Gel 28.3, available on this site, to gently remove the dry top layer as it is ready to come off.  The Hankook product is much more effective for my skin and with just using it a couple of times per week.  It has very fine micro-beads that the Cure product doesn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Cure product because of all the great reviews.  As other reviewers have mentioned, you must use the Cure product on dry skin to feel any effect at all.  For me, it just feels as if it is the product itself balling up and not my dry skin.  That said, perhaps my skin feels just a smidge softer after using it so I will finish it up, but I won&#x27;t be reordering this product.  In general, I have found the skin care products made in Korea to be superior to those made elsewhere.  We have a Korean market with a skin care boutique where you can try things out and they will also give samples. This is where I first bought the Hankook product and then order more from Amazon.  The shop is called &amp;#34;Missy&amp;#34; and it is inside of my SuperHMart grocery store.</li>
            <li> just so so. you can try..</li>
            <li> I am very surprised to find that so many people think the white things that come off are actually the dead skin. I thought so too until I didn&#x27;t find any change on my skin, I become suspicious. First of all, dead skin is not supposed to be white, not that much white at least. secondly, if the white things that come off are actually dead skin, my face would be red or at least dry, instead there is no change whatsoever. So I don&#x27;t think this product actually remove dead skin. It&#x27;s just make believe.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin and it flakes in the winter.  I have tried everything to get rid of the flakiness (which looks even worse when I wear makeup).  I have a home microderm kit (makes it red and irritated).  I have used exfoliators with beads (everything from apricots, to oats, to seeds).  Those always tend to just make bigger flakes.  Other harsher exfoliators have made my skin just look angry and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I read the reviews, I thought &amp;#34;Yea, but do these people have dry, sensitive, temperamental skin?&amp;#34;  Anyway, I&#x27;m always looking for a miracle  so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the balls are skin and frankly don&#x27;t care.  All I know is that it removed the flakes from my skin in one try.  Let me repeat just because I&#x27;m so happy.  No flakes!  It took them all off and left me with silky smooth skin that absorbed my serums easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fearful that this was just a temporary thing, I looked at my skin with the magnifying mirror the next morning.  No flakes! And it felt like baby skin!  Yay me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hesitant about buying this product, please don&#x27;t be.  It worked wonderfully for me and I&#x27;m always the outlier who doesn&#x27;t get the same results as everyone else.  I know it is a bit pricey, but I suspect the bottle will last me quite a while.  I had outstanding results with just three pumps on dry, clean skin.  By the way, I&#x27;ve thrown out every other exfoliating product I had!</li>
            <li> It is scary how well this exfoliator works.  It blows every other exfoliator out of the water.  You have to let it sit on your face to react with the skin for 20 sec. or so, then rub in gently with fingers.  It is so gentle on your face.  And the dead skin just sloughs off.  I have the same disgusted fascination with it that I get when I use those nose pore strips.  So wonderfully effectively gross.  I totally recommend it.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin, does what it says it will so and removes the dead skin, it definitely smooths my skin</li>
            <li> I was more impressed with this product after just ONE use than any product I have tried over the past 20 years!  I am 62 and am a product junkie so if I feel it is worth it I will buy it.  I was told my &amp;#34;mia&amp;#34; exfoliated my skin and I love the &amp;#34;mia&amp;#34; for so many reasons and highly recommend this too.  I have used lotions, creams and serums that claim to exfoliate and I assumed they were doing the job. Two things have been happening to my skin over the past few years, one is that I get these white bumps that will not go away and secondly after getting a mirror that magnify&#x27;s by 15 times I have noticed blackheads on my nose.  These have probably been there forever but I never noticed them before.  I figured by using exfoliating products I was doing all I could to address both these issues. WOW! was I wrong, after one use the blackheads showed an 80% improvement, it was mind blowing!  The blackheads were gone.  Sorry if this sounds gross but this is a fact of life for most of us and I may as get real about it.  Oh, and my face felt so soft!  I hope the white bumps disappear too but I think it will take a few more uses for that to clear up too.  Try this product it is unbelievably effective and will not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. I think I may prefer MyFaceshop product better</li>
            <li> very good product, love it.</li>
            <li> little miracle; bet exfoliator ever, I use it on my face and body, works like a charm, my skin is beautiful and soft, scalling is gone, I love it !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, no chemicals,</li>
            <li> Used it on my face and could not believe the amount of dead skin that came off. It was disgusting, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff.  But I do wonder what it&#x27;s made of, and if it&#x27;s safe for my skin.  I can feel the dead skin ball up whenever I use it.  I&#x27;ve learned for me it works better if I put it on and let it sit for about a 1/2 min before rubbing.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, because I&#x27;m afraid to use it but once a week.</li>
            <li> This was the weirdest thing ever.  Do not order.</li>
            <li> My sister has very sensitive/acne prone skin and she recommended this facial wash to my. I was very skeptical at first since I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin and figured I could just use store brands (Aveeno) to wash my face. But no more! I made sure to read most of the reviews before purchasing this. And I&#x27;m glad I did. This is by far the best facial wash product I&#x27;ve ever used. After I shower, I dampen my face and gently rub my face in a circular motion and watch all of the dead skin cells peel off. It&#x27;s not foamy, so don&#x27;t be surprised. I&#x27;m amazed I didn&#x27;t have a reaction from the skin peeling off. It&#x27;s very sensitive and you just rinse the debris off with warm water and you&#x27;re done! Your face will feel super smooth and clean just after one use. I&#x27;m a true believer in Cure!!!</li>
            <li> Better products for a much cheaper price. This does not even work on acne.  This does make skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Great for exfoliating, but not sure if it&#x27;s the product itself or how much of my dead skin it is sloughing off.  Overall, my face feels clean after use.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. After one use my skin was tighter and less spotty. More even skin color. You have to use a lot in my opinion to cover your whole face but you can see all the dirt and dead skin it picks up.</li>
            <li> dries fast - must rub - not good&lt;br /&gt;does it eflo? a little</li>
            <li> Love it! You can see all the dead skin come off.</li>
            <li> i bought it when $38， then it became $34 for next， not happy with that</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it so often now I&#x27;m going to have to order another soon. I&#x27;m also planning to gift these as Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> My holy grail exfoliating product! Super gentle yet effective enough to get out the dry spots that even my physical scrubs can&#x27;t help with. This is a total game changer and I would absolutely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> works pretty good. my face felt soft after and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i found this product. Before I purchased this product, I watched videos/reviews on YouTube and read some reviews regarding this. This totally changes my face because when in just one try, I can feel that my face becomes so smooth. In addition, as I rinse my face, I see that it brightens my face and adds glow to my face. It does not irritate my face and I do not get breakouts. I put this product on my dry face and let it sit for about 15-30 seconds, then rub it gently until I can see and feel the dead skin cells. After that, I rinse it with warm water thoroughly and begin to put my facial cleanser. I use the Beauty Facial Extreme Vitamin C cleanser because it got five star reviews and begin to love this product along with this Cure Natural Aqua Gel. I will totally repurchase this product. Give it a try and you will totally love  this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month. Using it once a week, it helps clear up my skin. I was skeptical about its watery texture at first, but after using it, your skin feels really refreshed.</li>
            <li> Gently gets off that dead skin like its supposed to. Also a fun product to make your friends try :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months. It doesn&#x27;t work. I put it on my face twice a week, though your face feels clean it didn&#x27;t help improve my complexion. No change whatsoever. And the suspicious thing was that even if I put the gel on my face three times in a row, those little white micro-beads still come out. It wasn&#x27;t dead skin cells the kept coming out, it was just the gel automatically producing those micro-beads so people think it&#x27;s dead skin cells. Like seriously I tried so many times on my hands too repeatedly, first time, second time, third time in one go....you would think by the third time there is no more dirt on your hands so no dead skin should be flaking off but it flaked everytime I used the gel. I have come to a conclusion that the gel flakes on its own but doesnt do much to your face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, but be careful not to overuse -- it damaged my skin barrier &amp; broke me out. 1x per week is plenty for me!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I use it on my face, legs, butt, and bikini area and I&#x27;ve seen dramatic results. My skin is softer than its ever been. My bikini area doesn&#x27;t get ingrown hairs as much as it used to. I try to use it every few days. I&#x27;ll be buying this product forever !</li>
            <li> More, please! This is the best exfoilater I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s gently but effective. It has no scent, so it&#x27;s not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take long to get used to rubbing your own skin off :D</li>
            <li> Cure works!  I highly recommend this product for those that need to exfoliate daily.  There are no abrasives to cause damage and the dead skin just rolls off.</li>
            <li> it does a dicent job, but i don&#x27;t see how amazing it is from other reviews. maybe i did a very good job on cleaning my face, so this thing did not show too much effect.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised . Ordered one unit to test. Will be ordering more. Exfoliates well. Interesting chemistry.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good product for others that&#x27;s why I purchased, however this does not work for me at all. I got a really bad breakout after beginning to use this product. The bottle is still filled. Not trying to discredit this product however it did not work of me at all.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s ok.  Yeah, your skin will feel very smooth after.  Yeah, you will see the little beads of dead skin (supposedly) form.  However, it&#x27;s not amazing as other reviewers claim.  It&#x27;s a gentle, very gentle, exfoliator.  Meaning, it won&#x27;t remove absolutely all of your dead skin.  I guess this is good for those with very sensitive skin.  I like it, I will use it, not likely to buy it again though.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, acne prone skin that also happens to be very sensitive. I need to exfoliate regularly or my skin literally gets this rough waxy coating that is a mixture of dead skin cells and oil (gross!) This is the first exfoliating product that really worked, but did not irritate my skin at all. My skin feels super soft and clean! My husband loves it too, and he has dry, thin skin. It makes his skin glow and makes him look younger.</li>
            <li> I use this once every two to three days after I shower - it makes my skin feel amazing. I love how you literally see the dead skin come off and makes your cheeks feel like a baby&#x27;s butt. Would definitely keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> This is an okay product and you must make sure your face is clean and dry before you apply so if you&#x27;re in the shower you need to first towel dry your face first then apply or it will have a rough time to see or feel that white beads that claims its your skin not real sure about that?? However either way wet no bead and dry with beads your face will feel smooth....</li>
            <li> I originally bought this exfoliator for my face. It really does exfoliate well and leaves the skin feeling nice and smooth. I already have a great complexion, so this is just an added bonus to my routine. My favorite exfoliator yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added benefit: I am currently using a microneedle (dermaroller) device for the stretch marks on my breasts (which are hideous and have left me very self-conscious my entire life). I have battled these embarrassing marks since my early teens due to a quick growth spurt. I&#x27;ve had laser done on my breasts (three grand!!), which only minimized the marks by maybe 10% and the doctor recommended 3 more packages of 3 sessions (nine extra grand--no way!), so those \\&quot;tiger stripes\\&quot; on my breasts are still there. I can 100% say that the microneedling device DOES work, as it damages the top layer of skin just enough for repair and collagen induction to take place BUT you must exfoliate the damaged layer of skin after microneedling (wait at least 2-3 days, as skin is sensitive). My routine was to exfoliate with a drug store brand facial exfolaitor a few days after using the device. This method with a basic exfoliator does work. HOWEVER, after receiving Cure, I decided to try it instead of the other exfoliator on my decollete and breasts. So far, I&#x27;ve experienced even BETTER results, as I see a softening of the harsh, deep (the width of a nickel) stretch marks. It&#x27;s going to take some months for me to see a dramatic difference, but I&#x27;m on the road to better looking breasts. Maybe this is TMI, but for any ladies looking improve other areas in addition to the face, this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I use this 3 times a week after first cleansing with Cetaphil. Make sure to rinse thoroughly and rinse other body parts which may come in contact with it such as hands and arms. Be careful not to use on very sensitive or irritated skin as it will make certain areas red. Use a hypoallergenic moisturizer afterwards and always use sunscreen! Hasn&#x27;t helped my blackheads but has helped with flakiness.</li>
            <li> I have had some serious issues with my dry sking through this Minnesota winter. I was excited to try this product and after the first use it completely cleared all of the dry/flaky skin off of my face! It hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; the problem, but definently helps. I would recommend not using it very often.. maybe twice a week. Also, I went tanning 3 days after using it and my face was red and irritated in the spots where I would apply the gel for at least a day. Just a heads up :) All in all, I do like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Product works really well.  It is gentle on the skin but effective exfoliator.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! Rub it on for 1 minute and watch the dead skin just roll off! No exaggeration, it really rolls right off. No redness or dry patches after use either.</li>
            <li> There are other peeling gels out there but this is the only one for me. I will never be without this product if I can help it. I only use it twice a week as it is serious exfoliation. I will certainly swear that it is removing dead skin; I was on a course of Retin-A when I first discovered this and it removed my flaking skin like nothing else. I also use it on my chest, upper back, and shoulders. I think it is a must-have for any skin regimen and I have my teen daughter using it too. Keeps face bright and other products working at their best. A big improvement over grainy scrubs! One bottle probably lasts me about 9 months with 2-3X weekly use.  Not much of a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product when I was deployed to Afghanistan and it helped keep my skin clear without dying it out!</li>
            <li> I have been hearing about this product for a few years so with free 2 day shipping, I figured I had to try it. It&#x27;s just OK in my book. It applies like a gel and immediately liquifies. It also feels like a shot of grey goose on your skin. While it doesn&#x27;t burn, the hardcore smell of alcohol is present. Amazingly enough it&#x27;s not drying but it also doesn&#x27;t leave me glowing for days. Yes, some dead skin sloughs off, most of it is product most likely, my skin is soft but it&#x27;s soft after I exfoliate regardless. The size is pretty substantial and I will continue using it but will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> great product for any place in your body&lt;br /&gt;face superbe&lt;br /&gt;merci mille fois&lt;br /&gt;thank you so muchhhh&lt;br /&gt;bisous a tous</li>
            <li> When I intially bought this I loved it and told all my friends to get it but after using it for several months I&#x27;m not actually sure it does anything for my face. It makes it feel like it&#x27;s exfoliating but I&#x27;m really not sure if its just the liquid rolling itself into little balls as it dries up. My skin does feel nice and smooth after I use it but my skin also feels nice and smooth after I use an apricot scrub or an exfoliating face towel. Also I think it&#x27;s clogging my sink because it&#x27;s so gluey. Another thing is that I don&#x27;t have time to really use it on the weekdays as I just wash my face, slap on some lotion and go to work. Washing my face then patting dry then exfoliating then patting dry takes up precious minutes when I could be sleeping more. It&#x27;s too high maintenance for me.</li>
            <li> the best way to judge a product like this isn&#x27;t when it works. It&#x27;s when it doesn&#x27;t work. As someone who has been using the Earthen instant peel, i absolutely love that product but felt there had to be something cheaper out there that could do the same thing. This is not it. With the earthen instant peel, you can tell it works great because once you use it, you cannot use it again on the same spot. The &amp;#34;white balls&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;white worms&amp;#34; whatever you call them, the actual skin cells do not shed off after you use it on a certain spot which tells you that it works. Not only that but you can tell the difference once you get out of the shower. As for this piece of crap, you use it and it keeps balling up no matter how much you have already supposedly rubbed off a certain spot. I also don&#x27;t understand how when I was using it and putting it on my finger to place on my face that the actual dead skin cells that I could SEE were not coming off when i used that finger to rub this product on my face. I also tried this product on may other objects such as my counter, my tile floor, my wooden chair in my kitchen and it would do the same &amp;#34;balling&amp;#34; thing.....I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s possible to exfoliate my kitchen counter. Unless it&#x27;s a total piece of crap product. Not just all that but I didn&#x27;t notice a single change in my skin appearance after using this product.</li>
            <li> First time I have ever actually observed an exfoliator working. I haven&#x27;t been using it regularly enough or for very long so I won&#x27;t say  I love it but I bought some for my daughter to try because I think it is worth the price--does what it is supposed to and does NOT cause any bad reactions.</li>
            <li> This is THE best exfoliator around. Period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 39 year old guy.  I&#x27;ve used face product now for about 5 years, which is to say, now that I&#x27;m starting to show my age.  I&#x27;ve used over the counter stuff and prescription stuff.  The Cure (which is a bit over the top in the name) is really an outstanding product.  Exfoliates like a champ.  Leaves my skin looking visibly better.  Be careful not to overuse, tho.  And if you&#x27;ve never used a chemical exfoliant, go easy my friend.</li>
            <li> It does wonders. I need to actually commit to it, so I can see better results.</li>
            <li> The first time, I used this product several times in a row until there was no more skin to clump off. so I know it is very gentle, apparently it only affects dead skin. My skin has been very sensitive due to sun exposure, I couldn&#x27;t use physical exfoliators like microbeads or facial brushes, etc. But this stuff works by some sort of chemical/magical reaction. It is not harsh like an acid peel, those are indiscriminate and will peel off tender skin too if used too often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no equivalent product in the US, and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries this. It&#x27;s so simple yet exactly what I need!</li>
            <li> I bought one from a korean/asian website. It does not suit me. It&#x27;s a bit complicated to use and I had tough times trying to get it off my face because the peeds stuck on my tiny facial hair. Won&#x27;t repurchase again.</li>
            <li> Doesnt do anyting, Super overpriced</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the product you&#x27;ve always hoped for but never found. Until now.  Used this for the first time tonight. . . three times. That&#x27;s how much dead skin I had on my face even though I use my Clarisonic daily!  My skin really looked years younger after I was done. . . all the dry skin was just GONE. .. and my face wasn&#x27;t the least bit raw or sore afterwards. .. it&#x27;s really an amazing product. I&#x27;ve wondered for years why there wasn&#x27;t something like this that could just kind of dissolve the outer layer of skin to leave the fresh underlayer.  This does that. And your skin feels great afterwards. .. no redness, no irritation, no sensitivity.  I used it on my dry elbows, too, and all that dry skin came off, as well.  Normally, when I exfoliate, even if I put on moisturizer immediately afterwards, I wind up developing newer dry skin pretty quickly.  If I scrub off the dry skin with a washcloth and immediately apply the thickest moisturizer I have, I still will have dry skin pretty quickly (and I have very oily skin-- you know, the oily skin with the dry outer layer).  I used this several hours ago, several times, and my skin is STILL clear and fresh looking. My pores are so much smaller, my lines are lessened (because the outer dead/dry layer is gone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still planning to use this again later tonight, but I am so pleased with this. .. I can see how my makeup will go on so much more smoothly. The actual surface of my skin is at least 80% smoother than it was earlier today.  This is really a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It exfoliates your skin without harsh chemicals and even my usually angry &amp; sentlsitive skin tolerates This like its water. A must have beauty product!!! Will buy over and over agin. Watch for lower prices and buy when it&#x27;s less than $30 and its a real bargain. Must.buy.backup supply! :) love it!</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews and was hesitant to buy this because of the price. I ended up ordering two (one for myself), along with some other Japanese skin care for my mother&#x27;s birthday. She loved it, she said she had a dry patch on her chin she couldn&#x27;t get rid of and after using this it fixed it. I like this as well, it doesn&#x27;t get quite as deep as I like but it is gentle so I&#x27;m okay with that trade off. I use this once or twice a week, alternating with a regular scrub. I would still recommend! I am convinced my large pores are less noticeable now that I&#x27;m not scrubbing with an exfoliater!</li>
            <li> Not worth Purchasing!!!!! I used it for several months before reviewing</li>
            <li> Good product, this is my 5th bottle already, thx</li>
            <li> Interesting product ?! I dont&#x27; know what it is. I am not sure that this is my dead skin.... But my skin feels nice, clean , and fresh after using it. So, I will keep using it until is gone. Probably will not buy another one :)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin and it flakes not just in the winter like many, but I have trouble throughout the year. I have tried everything to get rid of the flaking. I have a home microderm kit that only seems to exasperate the problem. I have used apricot scrubs with little luck and other harsher exfoliants that have made my skin just go bright red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;This product removed the flakes from my skin in one try. No flakes! It took them all off and left me with smooth, silky ALIVE skin. After the first day, I looked at my skin the next morning and still, no flakes and it felt like healthy baby skin!&lt;br /&gt;It has worked great for me and I&#x27;m always the one who doesn&#x27;t get the same results as everyone else.  I highly recommend this to anyone with dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> Have you ever had a nightmare where you looked into a mirror and watched the skin melt off of your face? This is kind of like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying several products in an attempt to even my complexion and perhaps help make my T-zone look less like a russet potato, I stumbled across this Japanese marvel. After reading several positive reviews across multiple websites, I threw thirty dollars into the internet and received the product less than two days later, presumably delivered via techno-wizardry. My curiosity (CURE-iosity? Get it?) reached a melting point; I had to use it instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you notice is the big blue ambiguous word on the bottle: Cure. If you saw this product on a shelf without researching it first, you would have no idea what it does. Is it hand-soap sponsored by Robert Smith? Is it sanitizer? Is it the cure for EVERYTHING? It also reads in small text &#x27;natural aqua gel&#x27;, which makes no sense. After using this product, I&#x27;m pretty sure that nothing about this product is natural. It&#x27;s the stuff of witches. Let&#x27;s squirt some into our hand, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cure &#x27;Natural&#x27; Aqua Gel is a cloudy clear color, and the consistency is that of jello when you take it out of the fridge too early (Stop being so impatient). The product claims to be 90% water; if this is to be believed, I can only assume that the remaining 10% is voodoo magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pumped some into my hand and rubbed it on my face; it&#x27;s unremarkable at first. There&#x27;s no lather, no cooling or warming sensation, and no little gritty bits scratching your face, as there is in exfoliating scrubs. I&#x27;m standing there in the mirror, massaging this smooth, watery goop into my face for about fifteen seconds wondering: &amp;#34;What did I just spend 30 dollars on?&amp;#34;. Then it happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I massage the gel in circles on my face, suddenly that smooth feeling under my fingers starts to get a bit... gritty. I squeeze a bit more gel on my hands and continue, thinking maybe the gel is coagulating or something. The gritty feeling intensifies, and begins to feel more like i&#x27;m massaging rice into my face, and upon leaning closer into the mirror, I have to keep myself from screaming. It&#x27;s skin. Oh god. THERE&#x27;S SKIN EVERYWHERE. I felt like a cicada shedding it&#x27;s exoskeleton; there was balls of dead skin covering every inch of my face and hands. It&#x27;s like when you were a kid and got craft glue on your hands, and got it off by rubbing them together. Except it&#x27;s skin, and it&#x27;s on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the next two or three minutes shouting &#x27;EW&#x27; and &#x27;OH GOD IT&#x27;S SO GROSS&#x27; while continuing to rub my face; by this time it due to morbid fascination rather than desiring even coverage. I eventually couldn&#x27;t stand the feeling of all the shedded skin on my face and hands anymore, so I leaned down to the sink and washed up. After drying my face, it looked like I just took off a mask; my face was clear, vibrant, soft, and squeaky clean. I put on some lotion and stared at the bottle of hoodoo magic for a bit before setting it on the counter. I&#x27;ve decided i&#x27;ll always have a bottle of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it every two or three days for the past month; while I haven&#x27;t had the same amount of dead skin sloughing off my face as the first time, there&#x27;s always a good bit, and it&#x27;s always slightly unnerving. Since then, my face has become soft and silky, free of blemishes entirely, and has started to clear up blackheads as well. It&#x27;s as effective as it is disturbing, and I highly recommend it to anyone that wants to get real results with an exfoliating product. Just be ready to be grossed out.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just the gel sloughing off my face to give the appearing that my flaky, dried skin was coming off. I was mistaken. After years of dried skin issues I had to use this four times in a row before the dried skin stopped forming into clumps that could be brushed off. I also put some clumps under the microscope. Plenty of evidence of skin cells being lifted off. Plus, my skin looks and feels a hella lot better! Pretty happy that I have an in-home solution for a problem that has plagued me for a long time.</li>
            <li> Cheesus H Christ this stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve never used something that worked so well!!</li>
            <li> This product is a scam. It does not exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I literally JUST used this for the first time in the shower. I pumped it and was like, &amp;#34; This is an exfoliant??&amp;#34;. Its thin, light, and doesnt foam. Here in the states we are used to our exfoliants having beads in them, thick,etc. I put it on in the shower anyway, rubbed it in circles as though it were a beaded wash and....felt the dry skin coming right off. I had so much dry skin come off, I had to do it twice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as i got out, I looked in the mirror. This is the smallest Ive ever seen my pores, no lie. My face feels smooth, and even looks better. No way did I expect to feel or see a difference the first time. Kudos to this face wash and to the seller for getting it to me 24hrs after I ordered when I had only selected two day shipping. Im so glad it came early!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! Its 90% water which is really cool, and when you first apply it you think it doesn&#x27;t do anything, but after a couple of secs you see your dead skin cells. This is the most unique exfoliator because unlike normal exfoliator which are beads that are rough on the skin and you think does this do more harm then good, but this products feels like jelly water. It bring the dead skin up and you just wash it off and you know its actually doing something. My skin feels like velvet after using this. I&#x27;m so glad I found this. Thank you Japan!!</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t sloughed off much as compared to a video I watched, but I do use mild scrubs on a regular basis.  I use several products from different lines from Japan.  I think they are marvelous!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really believe that those white stuff coming off my face are the dead skin. I tried to use this everyday and I got same amount of &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; and I didn&#x27;t feel that I have over exfoliated (because I know the feeling, I am addicted to exfoliating my skin haha). I don&#x27;t think it really does &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34;. In some way it does remove impurities off though. But don&#x27;t expect to really exfoliate as how you would get from scrubs. Nonetheless, it really does remove impurities. Leaves skin soft, squeaky clean and baby skin after. I still like it and would still repurchase it (if it doesn&#x27;t break me out in the future). But I personally don&#x27;t believe the white stuff coming off are my dead skin. I believe it is part of the product to really get the dirt outta your face (or leftover makeup). Overall. It&#x27;s a goof stuff.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and used for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Age: 32&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: fair, oily, prone to clogged pores; prone to appearance of fine lines&lt;br /&gt;Additional Skin Issues; sensitive due to use of Retin-A, glycolic acid, and other fruit acid products for exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;Occasional reaction to sulfites which can cause dry patches that are challenging to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do I normally use? Many products (I&#x27;m passionate about my skin care); Most recently I use Acnefree (better than proactiv), I use Retin-A on my forehead to keep fine lines at bay. A few different moisturizers including Neutrogena oil-free with SPF 35. I also have been using Mychelle serums, scrubs, and masks. But to my dismay, this awesome skin care line is now opting for cheaper ingredients, not to mention dry patches and oily clogged pores have continued to be a challenge for me. So i came across the reviews for \\&quot;Cure\\&quot; and ordered a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 5 stars because...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sizable bottle for the price and packaging is just fine. It&#x27;s a clear liquid gel appearing to have no added fragrance or color. After putting it on entire face and leaving for three minutes or so, I experienced no tingling or burning (Which I don&#x27;t necessarily oppose if the product works). I then massaged the gel still on my face in a circular motion and noticed the little clumps many people describe. I&#x27;ve not yet determined if this is all dead skin or if the gel has a tendency to do this. Others claim the former.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results? The best part. I rinsed off with warm water and I did in fact have soft, smooth skin with no redness or irritation. All of the dry, flaky, dead skin was gone. My pores also appeared clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliation has been challenging and expensive for me lately. Chemicals cause a lot of redness and irritation but even worse, they peel away healthy skin which tends to become scabby, dry, and rough through the healing process. Bad cycle. I need not go on except to say I&#x27;m just as impressed as the others and I&#x27;m considering stocking up a bit as I&#x27;m concerned about the price jumping as its popularity increases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh- any if anyone who speaks Japanese can translate the label, that would be fabulous.</li>
            <li> This product clearly sloughs away dead sells without any I mean any irritation.  I have extremely fragile skin and this product help me exfoliate without breaking any capillaries.  Love it! The item arrived quickly and in great condition! Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I use it twice a week and my skin in noticeably smoother. It isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I was told about it from a friend who has beautiful skin! A bottle lasts a long time, so it is not an expensive product to add to your skin care routine. When I ordered from this merchant, I had the product in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I wish I found this product sooner. This is Japan&#x27;s best selling product it has record sells 1 bottle every 20 secs. I  bought it by all the good reviews and totally surprised. Im sensitive skin and i was looking for a exfoliator that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin for ages. i have tried a lot and all does irritated my skin and breakouts. After i have tried this Cure and i set it as my exfoliator till Cure discontinue. This is simply a gel that you rub into your skin to exfoliate it. It doesn&#x27;t thinning my skin but smoother. I am just addicted that I use it once a week to deep clean my face. Not only has this product lightening my skin tone (thus fading scars), not sure if it&#x27;s prevent breakouts but so far i don&#x27;t see any breakouts. What makes CURE aqua gel a top product is that it is not only gentle, but it WORKS.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it I regret westing my money on it&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it one star cuz there&#x27;s less than that</li>
            <li> I bought this exfoliant for my daughter because she has acne rosacea and severe dry, sensitive skin.  She has never been able to use an exfoliant because it&#x27;s too irritating and makes it worse.  My daughter said it works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin and she uses 2-3 times a week.  This is not a cure for acne but the number one thing you can do to help get rid of acne is exfoliate the dead skin cells that are clogging your pores and this product does the trick.  Highly recommend and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice! it removes the death cells on the face! Recommend！</li>
            <li> Best exfoliating product!  Both gentler and more effective than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Nice product, different from all the other, does a great job.</li>
            <li> Hi there,&lt;br /&gt;This the 2nd times I purchased this item, I was excited to get them but when I opened the box, and discovered, the nozzles of both bottle were just hanging there... and it&#x27;s fell off as soon as I picked it up. It happened to me last time with one bottle as well.  I absolutely love the product but the packaging protection is very poor.</li>
            <li> LOVE lOVE THIS PRODUCT! AMAZING!</li>
            <li> will definitely order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times but this product seems amazing.  My skin always looks better the next day.</li>
            <li> Works amazing! I use it once or maybe twice a week, and once I do, I can tell my moisturizing toner absorbs into my skin SO much better! I use ~3-4 pumps each time, and I can see this bottle will last me a while!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I heard that it was supposed to be good for exfoliating your face. Well, I wasn&#x27;t really impressed with the job it did on my face and I contemplated returning it. Then, I decided to use it on my arms and legs.  HOLY COW!  This stuff really works!  My skin has never been so soft and &amp;#34;glow-y&amp;#34;. EVER!  It is actually quite disturbing to see all of the dead skin that flakes off of your body when using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I received a counterfeit bottle. After reading other reviews of this product and watching videos on YouTube, I was excited to purchase it but am extremely disappointed. The consistency is extremely watery and when I rub it on my skin, it feels like alcohol and evaporates quickly. Definitely will not buy it again. I didn&#x27;t see any dead skin after rubbing this product on my face.</li>
            <li> Between Retin-A and central gas heat this winter, my skin is very dry and flaky in spots.  The skin flakes look awful under makeup at the end of the day.  This product really helps remove those skin flakes. I&#x27;ve only used it 3 or 4 times, so I&#x27;m not sure about long term results, but it does make my skin look much smoother and better those days I use it.</li>
            <li> Nothing happened.  I rubbed this stuff on my face and nothing.  I even rubbed it on my husband&#x27;s back, which was in serious need of an exfoliation, and I couldn&#x27;t tell a thing had been done.</li>
            <li> It penetrates deeply into the skin and the result is immediate. One has to religiously do this on a regular basis in order to maintain the suppleness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and I get great results after using it, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.  But I only use it about once a week, so it&#x27;s lasting.</li>
            <li> I have been using this gel once a week for a couple of weeks now and have been very pleased with how it&#x27;s been working. I bought this product for exfoliation of my very sensitive skin based on reviews left by other customers, and was very happy to find that it is as great as other people have said. This gel exfoliates gently but effectively, leaving my skin squeaky clean but not in a way that dries it out or irritates my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only recommendation I would have is some clear instruction on its use. It is not very clear that you should use the gel on DRY, clean skin. Also, the product is a little bit pricey for my liking, but I&#x27;m too hooked to not buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that eliminates flakey skin during the cold winter months. I use it every few days.</li>
            <li> This product works as promised.  You can really see the dead skin coming off with just a little pump. Highly Recommend using this prior to using a mask.</li>
            <li> I really like Cure - it is easy to use and it made my skin really soft.  I recently discovered [...] on OpenSky (Molly Sims endorsed it there), ordered their product and found it worked better and lasts longer.  Also - the directions are in English!!!!  It&#x27;s made in the US, their ingredients are clearly printed on the label, and their customer service is great.  Their peel is a few dollars more but I&#x27;d rather buy American and be able to ask questions and deal with locals. They had a promo recently and I was supposed to get a free cosmetic bag - it didn&#x27;t come with my order.  I called and they were super nice and sent me the bag right away.  I&#x27;m gonna stick to their peel.....</li>
            <li> Total miracle product! I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people will try to tell you the little balls of stuff are not skin but that&#x27;s not true in my experience. I did an experiment! Hehe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product and a medium amount of white stuff came off my skin when rubbing it on my face. I use a lot of other skin products so my skin is in decent shape already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my older brother try it (who never uses any skin products and just washes his face in the shower every night with regular soap) and huge amounts came off but in a dark gray color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then got my 10 yr old niece to try it (who still has that beautiful baby type skin) and she didn&#x27;t have one speck of anything come off her skin. Maybe like 2-3 tiny things that were hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of how much came off , etc all three of us were left with squeaky clean skin that looked better. I love it</li>
            <li> I make a lot of impulsive beauty purchases and this is one of them. I absolutely love this product, from time to time I have major acne breakouts that require medication which dries out my skin and leaves it flaky and hideous under foundation. I use one pump of this and all the dead cells goes with it and leaves my skin looking much better! The best part is I&#x27;ve had this for nearly one year and still have half a bottle left. This is an exfoliator so it&#x27;s not recommended for everyday use anyways, use once or twice a week at one pump and it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li> I often find that when in search of an exfoliant for my face, I tend to think that the more abrasive the product, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so.  This is a gentle exfoliant (which makes more sense for facial skin) with a nice touch of moisturizer that feels so nice after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also value any product that I use on my face that does not have a scent, and this is one of those products.  I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have combination skin which has shown no irritation of either break outs or of dryness, after using this product.</li>
            <li> lightly exfoliating.  does not leave my skin tight. i have used it for 3 weeks.  I have seborreac dermatitis and I have not had new breakouts</li>
            <li> Cure Natural Aqua Gel exfoliates away the dead skin cells very effectively. The best part is you can see the dead skin cells, so you know it&#x27;s working. I use this product 2-3 times a week at night. It makes my skin a little pink afterwards, but in the morning my skin feels and looks great. The product is worth the price because it will last you at least 6 months and it makes your skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliation. I believe that it really is your dead skin that is coming off in those little balls. When I rub it off, the tiny balls are brown. My skin is brown so this makes sense to me.</li>
            <li> I am a extremely sensitive skin an fprone to allergic when season changes. This is my regular exfoliator now. It is much more gentle than particle ones and still works well.</li>
            <li> This product is like a gel alcohol, so much so that you might as well put alcohol on your face. The ingredients in this product will not make your dead skin ball up. The light sand like balls are the results of the ingredients inside. The only exfoliation you will get is from your skin rubbing against the little balls (you could buy an inexpensive scrub that works much better).</li>
            <li> Beauty Salon no more...this product is magnificent for removing old skin.</li>
            <li> I have done extensive research and after reading the reviews I decided to try this. I tried it once after i washed my face and left it on for 3 minutes and i can see the white little balls forming. When i went to wash it off, i can feel all the little balls that were not there when i applied the product! i will definitely but this product again!</li>
            <li> You need to be very careful using this product. Maybe using only 1-2 times a week. This exfoliater actually left small chemical burns on each of my cheeks. I returned this product.</li>
            <li> Have you ever noticed that Japanese and Korean women have remarkably beautiful skin? (I&#x27;m talking non-existent pores).  It may be because they have access to some pretty amazing (and often inexpensive) skincare technology.  I saw this product on a you tube video (highly recommended by Melodee Morita) and it performed exactly as demonstrated and expected.  My skin felt &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; but without any physical or chemical irritation and that it enabled the softening water and moisturizer that I use to penetrate more effectively afterward.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator works good at cleansing the skin and leaving a fresh cleaning feeling behind while at the same time it is not to harsh or abrasive to the sensitive skin of the face.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb!! It is an amazing product that really delivers. The results on my skin are wonderful and quickly noticeable after only a few uses. I will never do without (:</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous exfolliaters, and I prefer the gel ones.  They don&#x27;t dry my face out.  Of the gel exfoliators I have tried all three on the market:  Cure Natural Aqua, Obey Your Body, and Avani Dead Sea Skin Renewal.  I prefer the the Obey Your Body brand.  It&#x27;s more expensive but it gives you a tangible peel.  Ppl say it&#x27;s just parafin, but if you continue to reapply to the same area it doesn&#x27;t ball up on me.  I do not recommend this.  Go with Obey Your Body.  (I&#x27;m a real reviewer, not a paid shill).</li>
            <li> First of all the product arrived sooner than expected. Secondly, the performance is exactly as described. It&#x27;s a clear gel that doesn&#x27;t burn, or smell. You gently rub a small amount on your face, or neck, or chest-wherever, and after you are finished and rinsed off, your skin is soft and smooth. TADA!!!!! I&#x27;m a very fair skinned blonde with sensitive skin and I&#x27;m excited that this product is in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to skin care products. This is by far the best exfoliater I have ever come across!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people made a comment that the white part that comes out from rubbing your face is not dead skin cells. UMMMMMM it is! Don&#x27;t make that comment fool you! I tested this product 3 times in a row to see if white balls, or particles (your dead skin cells) will come out, but after my 2nd time, no white stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the instruction is all in Japanese, it could be difficult on how to use this product, You can google search it and find intructions very easily. It is very important to follow the instructions!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my face with facial cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;After I make sure my face is completely dried.&lt;br /&gt;Then I apply 2-3 pumps of Cure Gel on my finger tips and apply it to my forehead, nose, chin, and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t rub the product in, Massage your face!&lt;br /&gt;Then rinse your face with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is optional but I like to splash cold water on my face after rinsing with warm water. It helps tighten up the pores and your face becomes firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Highly Highly Recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews. EVER. But this product is so awesome it totally deserves the next few minutes of my life because it has changed mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for the last month and it has made a drastic change in the look of my skin. Having had troubled skin for over 13 years, I was hesitant of yet ANOTHER exfoliator. All exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried have been to harsh and left me worse off then before but I knew I needed to exfoliate! So I jumped and bought this even though it was a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was TOTALLY worth it. It&#x27;s gentle and effective and all that dead skin that was making me break out is removed gently every day. I haven&#x27;t had a major pimple since starting to use it and that&#x27;s saying something. I would recommend this to EVERYONE.</li>
            <li> Really seems to tighten the skin.  Feels good after rinsing. n I recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quality.</li>
            <li> It works very well for my sensitive skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> my favorite gentle exfoliant. I love that I only have to use this a few times a week and my skin stays glowing. It&#x27;s also fun to see it work as you gently massage the dead skin cells away.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this item but i definitely wanted to try it out without a doubt. I saw it on bubzbeauty video awhile back and i was trying to find this product. Finally i found it and i was so excited! I wish the price was lower though but the benefits of this product make up for it! So i ordered this product and i am very impatient, but this came overnight! not even joking! Considering i did the Free super saving shipping and handling (I didn&#x27;t pay for it only just the product) I thought it would takes weeks to get to my house. Not even joking, it legit came OVERNIGHT! I was amazed and surprised! So when i received it i checked to see if they lazily packaged it but they had those big bubble bags on it so it was fine. I give the packaging and shipping 10 OUT OF 5!!! So happy it came so soon :) !&lt;br /&gt;The product itself was amazing! Although i did smell the scent of rubbing alcohol which was weird but i kept using it. Then when i used it i didn&#x27;t like how it felt like i was applying nothing to my skin. I had to use about 5 or 6 pumps in order to satisfy my face. When i was massaging my face with it, i saw the white clumps of dead skin cells and i was happy because i knew it was actually working! Overall i think the product is great. i would give it 4.5/5 itself but 5/5 because of the super fast free shipping! i also like how they give a thing that if you were to press down on the pump it won&#x27;t go down (Forgot whats it called, pump stopper? idk) Anyways, i thought this was very nice!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product a couple of days ago and when I received it I tried it out right away. I&#x27;ve only tried it once but the product was easy to use and efficient. It felt soft and silky on my skin. The product left my skin softer and cleaner. I found the product really nice after just one use. Seeing how much dead skin I had left on my face was entertaining and perplexing. Definitely will buy this product again after I finish my current bottle.</li>
            <li> i recieved this product a few days agao and used it in the shower yesterday and it was like magic. I had a cold non stop runny nose so I constantly had tissue to my nose causing it to become super dry and began to peel. I used this to remove the excess skin off and I was shocked. its so soft and easy to apply I applied a dime size amount to my hand and rubbed it all over my face and my nose and was shocked to see how clean and smooth my face was. The only bad thing about this item is that all the writing is in japanese/ chinese. It did not come with and instructs at all.</li>
            <li> Amazing exfoliant. Using it twice ma week and my skin feels refreshed and rejuvinated.</li>
            <li> effectively remove dead skin! even after my clarisonic mia! absolutely recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if I end up in the poor house because of this product.  I am amazed time and time again by the advancement of Asian skincare products.  It&#x27;s why I buy all of my face cleansing products from Asia and all of my moisturizers from cold, Nordic countries.  I am almost 40 and I still get asked to see my ID card when I buy wine!  It&#x27;s a shame that in The USA all you can really get is crap that makes your skin look leathery, old and broken out.  It&#x27;s all made with filler crap that dries out the skin.  I am a lifetime customer and will tell everyone about your product.</li>
            <li> A high end cosmetic store in Las Vegas demonstrated a chemical exfoliant that worked great on me but was about $100 for a tiny little container, so I decided to see if I could find something similar online and came across Cure.  It works great!  And the price is very reasonable considering the amount of product you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who say it doesn&#x27;t really remove dead skin...I don&#x27;t even care, I just know it does something awesome to my skin and that&#x27;s what counts.  Personally, I do believe it exfoliates.  I had two really dry, calloused patches under where my glasses sit on my nose.  Those patches are gone since I started using Cure - not just softer skin, there is brand new clear skin under where the patches used to be.  I am totally sold on this stuff!</li>
            <li> It gives a gentle exfoliate. I would give 5 star but the price is too much for what you get. I am ordering similar exfoliating Japanese product- it&#x27;s more affordable )around $15. Will put a review once I get to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the best skincare product I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it one to two times a week, and it sloughs off every bit of dead skin and even blackheads. My mom - who is in her 50&#x27;s - reluctantly tried some one evening and was delighted by the results. Even though she exfoliates regularly, she said she hasn&#x27;t felt her skin so soft in years. This product is truly worth the price!</li>
            <li> Not sure of the items within it since it&#x27;s in Japanese.. I might as well be putting acid on my face. Would like to see translation because I&#x27;m hesitant to put this on my face.</li>
            <li> Works just as its said. Retail is still pricey but totally worth it, I do highly recommend it to anyone who wants a deeper clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Moment you apply cream you  can feel the dead skin peeling off your face.. Like MAGIC !</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! It leaves skin renewed and refreshed. Pricey but definitely worth it. I Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best and safest exfoliate product you can find in the market because it is super gentle that my HYPER-sensitive face skin was exfoliated 3 times in a row within 2 hours but felt no invasive feeling or any kind of cruel rubbing feelings like other products did on my skin. I tried the mildedst ones but none of them worked just as easily and effectively as Aqua Cure Gel. I was shocked to know that even the thinnest skin area around my eyes needed to be exfoliated and after 3 times being exfoliated, dead skin cells kept coming off (WOW). However even though my skin feels very good right now, I know I should stop and wait for a few days to redo it again for optimal result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing is, exfoliation with this product is so biological that I could genuinely feel that my skin was breathing more than ever after a ton of dead old skin cells accumulated on my face were removed off. My skin type is defined as thin, pale, sensitive, allergic and therefore I usually just wash my face by organic stuffs 2-3 times per week, daily use of normal facial cleanser was still too harsh for my skin, in order to say this product is an amazing discovery to my skincare routine. A must-have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all for the first time using, I noticed that my skin tone looks brighter. Baby soft skin feeling is absolutely no doubt. I look 1-2 years younger instantly after a layer of skin were lifted away, my face even look slimmer, my eyes feel lighter too. I know that dead skin cells are one of the factor that makes one&#x27;s facial skin sag down due to the gravity, it happens to every area on your face, especially your eyes, and they block your skin from breathing oxygen, makes your skin weak or unable to absorb nutrion from skincare application. I just love this product. I will try to use it for my whole body if I can&#x27;t find any other product that can do my body skin such a good favor as this gel can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we are aging, our system will slow down inproducing new cells but regular exfoliation will stimulate this reproduction process and I think to retain a youthful skin, keeping it clean, fresh and breath is something not too hard, complicated or expensive to do.</li>
            <li> WOW!  I love this product!  My face is so nice and clean after using CURE.  There is no nasty drying or stinging like you can have with other  Exfoliaters.  My Daughter has some skin issues and CURE has cleared her up pretty good.  She loves this product and so do I.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and exfoliate well. You just need to follow the instruction, and ot will leave your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> I know there is a lot of questioning about how this product actually works but it really does! My skin feels clean and smooth after I use it. Great Japanese beauty cult favorite!</li>
            <li> Amazing. I didn&#x27;t even follow the instructions and it still worked. I used as a cleanser with my face wet and it was already clumping dead skin cells. I honestly thought I got ripped off because when I think of an exfoliating I assume it&#x27;s always a scrub.....I was wrong. It left my skin soo soft I even saw a difference of my acne scars. The best of the best</li>
            <li> Originally found this at trade show. A must have. Try it you well be amazed.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty expensive purchase for me but I finally decided to get it. I had heard about Cure for a couple years but it was quite pricey so I decided to research other exfoliators that act like this one. If you don&#x27;t know what this exfoliator is, it&#x27;s a gel that you apply to your face and it loosens dead skin cells. Then when you rub your skin, the friction causes the skin cells to clump together and leaves your face with a newer layer of skin (it&#x27;s basically a chemical peel, but much much gentler?). I wanted a gentle exfoliator since I have sensitive skin, and I felt like gritty exfoliators never did the trick or were too harsh. I got the Skin79 Crystal peeling Gel and it worked well! I had that one for over a year and I was running low so I decided to finally get Cure as the price per mL was cheaper than the Skin79 one. I&#x27;ll sort of compare the two, so maybe that will help you decide on something.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about Cure was that the gel is quite watery. Use small pumps when applying it to your face so that it doesn&#x27;t drip through your fingers. There is a very faint scent of alcohol but it isn&#x27;t noticeable or irritating. Skin79&#x27;s gel is more gel-like and thicker, which I think is easier in the application. There is, however, a very heavy scent, and although it is pleasant, I&#x27;d prefer no scent as fragrances can irritate the skin. When applying either, it&#x27;s best to apply a good layer that covers your skin. If it&#x27;s too thin, it will dry before you can really rub a lot of the skin off, and if it&#x27;s too thick, it&#x27;ll waste product and be quite messy. I find that applying a layer all over your face and waiting about 45 seconds before rubbing makes it easer than just rubbing the hell out of your skin. The product needs a bit of time to start working, and you can see parts of dead skin turning whitish when you let the product sit on it. If you start rubbing right after you apply it, you&#x27;ll be rubbing for a while before you get any clumps. Both products make your skin clump similarly, but I think Cure dries a bit faster because it&#x27;s more liquid-y, so it might be easier to work in sections (like do the bottom half of your face and then your forehead). Both leave great results; visibly smoother and softer skin. Exfoliating helps minimize acne, as there is less dead skin clogging up your pores. Use it weekly for the best results (don&#x27;t use it every day as that might inflame your skin and waste product ). And for those that think it&#x27;s fake or that it&#x27;s the product and not your skin that is clumping up, it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;ve tested both on my bathroom tiles and nothing ever clumps up. I&#x27;ve also tried exfoliating back to back and while the first time there was a lot of dead skin, the second time there was barely any (because you exfoliated most of the dead skin off). I definitely recommend this to people with sensitive and acne-prone skin! You might want to try the Skin79 one before shelling out the money for this, but this big bottle of Cure will last quite a while!</li>
            <li> I cannot express how impressed I am by this product! Forever customer right here! I have combination (oily+normal) skin and I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding something that doesn&#x27;t over-dry me or make me feel greasy in the long run. This Cure gel exfoliator is incredible! Works just as most of these reviews say, and I can tell a difference in the texture of my skin immediately after cleansing. My wife has a combination of dry but acne prone skin, and since using this product, she&#x27;s seen a massive improvement in her skin. She suffers from rosacea, but this product doesn&#x27;t irritate her or cause her to break out. In fact, it seems to clear up some of her existing scars and definitely removes any dry, flaking skin. I recommend this to anyone and everyone to at least try!</li>
            <li> This is awesome. The dead skin cells just roll up. It is amazing and I feel safe. It does not make me break out. My skin is a lot smoother too.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable. I purchased Cure after reading the reviews and it is an amazing product. I am 63 yrs old and I have normal to dry skin. I use this product and my face is smoother and brighter. Applying makeup is a breeze goes on evenly and ultra smooth</li>
            <li> useless fake this product imitates dead skin but does not remove dead skin you can use it on you face 10 times a day with the same results it is the product content  not dead skin that beads up</li>
            <li> Since day one of using this exfoliator, my skin has been feeling and looking fresher and younger. I&#x27;m 37 and due to stress and hormonal changes my skin has started to look dull. With this little exfoliator I&#x27;m able to remove the layer of dead skin cells and reveal a brighter face! haha. The instructions on the backside of the bottle are in Japanese so I followed the directions given on this page. I even use the exfoliator on my hands because I live in South Florida and I wanted to remove some of my perennial tan. I recommend this product to those with acne and acne scars as well. I gave my sister a treatment and I could tell right away that this product is not abrasive or irritating as most of the products for acne available in the market.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have only used it for about a week, but the results are clear. There seems to be NO irritants in the product (like in other exfoliates) which I really liked. It is gentle and doesn&#x27;t feel like my skin is being ripped apart. I rub it lightly and so much dead skin just comes off in little balls! It is sort of distressing to realize how much needs to be removed. Sometimes I even use it twice before all the dead skin seems to be gone. I really recommend this product and I am so happy that I stumbled upon it!</li>
            <li> I did used it after washing my face and completely towel dry. However, it doesn&#x27;t remove my dead skin cells, it doesn&#x27;t take any effects on my skin. The little white things that comes out are not dead skin cells. I don&#x27;t understand why so many people say that this product is amazing, SO DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This works, but it is waterier than it should be, and you have to be very accurate with the timing and the amount of friction used. The Korean water peels are a lot better. They&#x27;re creamier and more forgiving and they seem to remove more, but are just as gentle. This is a good product, but not the best. I&#x27;m not going to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It did in five minutes what my serum took three weeks to achieve. Don&#x27;t over do it though!</li>
            <li> I received my CURE exfoliator this past Wednesday (03-12-2014), but I decided to wait until the weekend where I could do my whole facial routine without rushing to get to work. I tried it for the first time yesterday (03-15-2014), and I wasn&#x27;t really expecting much, boy was I wrong. I am IN LOVE!!!!!!  As a self professed product junkie I am telling you EVERY women needs this in her beauty arsenal!  It&#x27;s truly amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 30 something african american woman and I have acne prone skin (even though it is slowing down now), but I still do suffer from breakouts (around that time of the month), and I unfortunatley do have scarring on my cheeks. Anyway, so yesterday, I went through my normal routine with cleansing my face in the shower with my Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing Gel (that I received earlier this week), after drying my face, I applied CURE and i followed the directions provided by others and I started massaging the gel into my skin, and like others I started experiencing the \\&quot;balls\\&quot; as i massaged.  I rinsed my face, and i noticed RECENT acne scabs that were on my face were gone, (one was bleeding). Before I purchased this product I saw some reviewers debating because some reviewers felt that the \\&quot;balls\\&quot; were dead skin cells, where others felt that it was the product itself. I am going to tell you that based on the fact that my acne scabs were lifted to the point that the area of one scab was bleeding, I am going to HAVE to agree with those that state that the \\&quot;balls\\&quot; are DEAD skin cells. At any rate, I was so impressed that I decided to exfoliate a second time, and this time when I rinsed, it was like i rinsed off my old face and revealed a NEW one!!!! Serioulsy, after the second try (in which I massaged longer), when I rinsed the second time, I was literally lighter (which that is not what i am trying to do), because the gel removed all the dead skin and i was glowing!!! and my skin was so, so, so, soft and it often \\&quot;soften\\&quot; my scars.  I could be tempted to use this everyday, but i am going to follow the directions because even though it is very gentle, it is VERY strong, and I have sensitive skin and after I rinsed it did sting a little, but nothing that would discourage me from further use. This product is a keeper.ould be tempted to use this everyday, but i am going to follow the directions because even though it is very gentle, it is VERY strong, and I have sensitive skin and after I rinsed it did sting a little, but nothing that would discourage me from further use. This product is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while, and it seemed to work great the first few times, but after working it back into my skin care routine after not using it, it caused reddening on my skin and a burning sensation. I stopped using it, and am pretty much disappointed having spent this much on it.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I bought this product! For 2 weeks, I was suffering from dry patches along my nose bridge and cheek bone. I am using tons of hyraluronic acid products, so I should not have dry skin problems. When I put on liquid foundation, within only 2 hours, my skin would flake and peel. It was awful. I used another exfoliator and my skin went baby smooth, but that one wasn&#x27;t gentle enough for every day use. This one is. I have been using this every evening for 3 days in a row. It is very gentle and not abrasive. Afterwards, my skin is baby skin soft and it lets my toner and serum soak deep into my skin, keeping it hydrated. I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that the smell is rather unpleasant. It has a weird sea salt/ocean water/alcohol smell to the liquid. I found that using this after my cleanser really helped my skin overall. I paired it with the Hada Labo lotion and Haba Labo moisturizer, and found my skin still completely soft and supple the next morning. I do wish the manufacturer could do something about the smell though. It&#x27;s not very heavy, but someone with a sensitive nose can&#x27;t miss it!</li>
            <li> Great! I like this product</li>
            <li> My skin are: Olive tan, normal to combination to oily side, with pimples, cystic acne and acne scarring(the horror)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a few weeks now and it works! Make sure you use it right though; use it after your usual makeup removal and cleansing, pat skin gently with a towel and pump this once  or twice and rub onto your skin till your skin are slightly dry or till you can feel the dead skin on your fingers. The more your rub the more dead skin will slough off! Which is fun to use and you&#x27;ll know that you are getting those dead skin out for sure! It takes me awhile for the stuff to works on me though maybe because my skin is super clogged or something I don&#x27;t know because I almost never exfoliate. My skin used to be dull. But this changed that! My skin is now glowing and are so easy to unslough with fingers alone. I used silicone face brush from Japan with my face wash which are darn cheap and this adds more gentle exfoliating to my daily cleansing routine with Cure gel few times a week. My scar literally disappear, well its still there but I know for sure its going to be gone soon enough. The price is I know a lil pricy but its worth it and it looks likes its going to last me for a time especially if your are having the same skin problem as I am and just looking to try a good exfoliator. Its easier for tan skin to scar so this is definitely one of the thing I would make sure keep to prevent future outbreak and or to help with scarring. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> An awesome product and works wonderfully. First time trying it and so glad I did! 😊</li>
            <li> Got very soft skin with it.</li>
            <li> Definitely fell in love with this product since the very first time I tried it.  Came highly recommended by a friend, and I&#x27;ve never stopped using it. Have been using this product for over 4 years now.  A little goes a long way, and it is definitely worth the price!!!  Love the glow and feel of my skin after I use it.</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman and exfoliating is extremely important so that your skin care products, that are so expensive, can be readily absorbed into the skin.  This is an excellent product.  Follow the directions - and be amazed.</li>
            <li> this is great!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly you think its ot working but when you&#x27;re done your face is smooth and clear. If it&#x27;s not coming off the way its supposed to (in little balls as you rub in a circular motion) just apply a little more and it will come right off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s with oily skin that sometimes has dry patches and my pores are always congested. I use a Clairsonic a few times a week, which works great, but I&#x27;m always looking for products to help exfoliate my skin since my pores are always getting clogged. I&#x27;ve read a lot about Asian skincare products, and when I saw this one I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it I wasn&#x27;t super impressed. I washed my face with my normal face wash, then patted the skin dry, then applied Cure to my skin in gentle circular motions. The texture of it is very similar to water, so I had to repeatedly use a small amount and immediately apply to my skin. I definitely felt the texture of the dead skin cells coming off, but afterwards I didn&#x27;t notice any amazing difference. I immediately applied my nighttime serum, some moisturizer and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was really after the second and third use that I began to notice how great my skin felt (and looked). It felt like more dead skin was coming off and my face just feel cleaner afterwards. I definitely think it helps my serum absorb quickly, and my skin feels smoother. From what I&#x27;ve read you should only use it a few times a week, but the first week I ended up using it every other night because I loved the results. Now that my skin is looking and feeling better I&#x27;ll probably space out how often I use it to 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, all of the information on the bottle is in Japanese, but apparently you can find tutorials on how to apply it on Youtube or on beauty blogs. If you really feel the need to get directions before using check those out first.</li>
            <li> After searching for and trying hundreds of exfoliators 3 years later i came upon this holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;Cure Natural Aqua Gel really does all it claims to do. I decided to buy it after reading some really convincing reviews, even though this is WAY over the price I usually spend on one product its totally WORTH IT!&lt;br /&gt;The product is looks like a foggy kind of water and its rather runny when you put it on your hands. It also takes a while to start working but after 30seconds-1min on rubbing this baby on you face you will DEFINITELY see results. Your dead skin starts to come off in little white flakes and your face instantly starts to feel a lot smoother. This is a really GENTLE product unlike most. Its like rubbing water or gel on your face rather than most exfoliators which are rocky and rough which may leave your face even worse off, especially if you have sensitive skin like me. Its the perfect fit for overly sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Also, keep in mind your face and hands have to be completely dry before using this product or else it won&#x27;t work. If you have sweaty palms or live in a humid area then i maybe wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been around 2 months since i&#x27;ve started using this product (twice a week) and i see a great difference in my skin. I&#x27;m breaking out a lot less often (keep in mind this won&#x27;t cure acne, its not really meant to either), the acne that i do get is a lot smaller in size, and my old scars are ALL VANISHING! I&#x27;ve had these scars on my face for years and nothing worked to get rid of them except this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this if you have sensitive skin and are looking for an exfoliator! :-)</li>
            <li> I love love love this product I use after cleansing almost every day  it leaves my skin clean and buffed and sealed and ready for the day my lotions and potions all sink in much better my skin looks and feels so nice I will keep this product in my daily routine</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this exfoliator works magically and differently from what I&#x27;ve used. I have high acne prone skin. Unlike others, this product glides smoothly on my skin without any irritation. I let it sit for 30 seconds to do its magic to lift my dead skin away before I start gently massaging. My skin feels a lot softer and cleaner! Overall, I&#x27;d definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product! I use it 2-3 times a week in the shower to exfoliate my skin. Does not irritate my skin at all. Exfoliates better than any scrub or even my clarisonic . Skin feel refreshed and baby soft after. :)</li>
            <li> This is actually one of the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever tried, its super easy and fast :D&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone !!! love it !!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product working but after reading all the reviews, I figured all those people can&#x27;t be wrong. And I was right - this product is simply amazing &amp; removes the dead skin from my face that my usual facial scrub does (and more) but without the harsh ingredients! My skin feels so soft &amp; smooth after I use it but here&#x27;s a word of advice when using this product - do sections at a time so you don&#x27;t waste the gel. It&#x27;s more of a watery consistency so I usually start with my forehead, then my cheeks/nose then my chin because it kinda dries after a minute. I use it twice a week and this is my 3rd week running...kinda expensive too but well worth the money!</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not like a chemical peel. No, isn&#x27;t jesus in a bottle. Yes, it gives good exfoliation while remaining gentle on my dry sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used numerous glycolic and fruit acid products and this is a very well performing weekly treatment. I found most at-home AHA peels and serums too harsh but this is a long-term-use solution with far less redness and recovery time. I was originally unimpressed after a few weeks of facial use, but I&#x27;ve found it is an A+ body exfoliator as well. Multi-tasker! My arm pits and bikini line are thanking me. I&#x27;d give it 3 stars for facial treatment and 5 stars on body areas. Elementary math leads me to a 4 star rating. For sensitive skin I&#x27;d say this is a good bet but not necessarily worth the cult following. I&#x27;ll most likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of exfoliators.  This is the best I&#x27;ve used.  Gentle, easy to use.  Just apply on clean skin and rub gently in circles on your face, body, feet. Rinse.  I use it every other day because I&#x27;m older so my skin sheds a bit more I guess.  It did not come with directions that I could read but if you google it the directions are listed in English.  This exfoliator only removes dead skin, it does not cause peeling.</li>
            <li> This gel is fantastic. So quick (less than a minute) to start exfoliating, no irritation. My skin feels so soft after I use this. I use it nightly before bed and have seen my skin look smoother since I started using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Each time I exfoliate with this, I see a vast difference in my skin. It&#x27;s softer, brighter and healthier looking, plus the products that I use with this instantly work 110% better than without exfoliating with it. It&#x27;s pricey but a good investment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a skin care regimen at all, but I wanted to start getting into something and bought a few things to try. This is amazing compared to anything else that I tried. The little balls that come off I think are dead skin. My skin truly has never looked better than it does now. Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I wonder if it is realy work. But no feeling any kind different</li>
            <li> My wife found this item while browsing on Amazon and because of the countless rave reviews, we decided to have her try it. At first she had to rub it on her face for a few rounds to get off all those years of dead skin cells. She&#x27;s a very simple person and has never went for any special facials. She has oily, acne prone skin and was always conscious about it though so she tried tons of other products. But this product has changed that so much. After a week, her skin was soft. After 2 weeks, all her acne scars were gone (she never realized they were just scars and thought she just had a lot of acne all this time), revealing a much clearer skin than she thought. Her skin was softer, brighter and so much clearer that she had found the confidence to not wear any makeup at all to work! my wife and I are very pleased! This one product has changed her life, boost her confidence and made her more beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical prior to ordering, but once i tried this product on my severely dry lips, I became a convert. It truly does work and my lips are so smooth... They have never been this smooth in YEARS. I use it every other day on my lips and face so far and no negative effects. For those who think its just the product beading up and not your actual skin... have you actually used the product? Just wondering. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a week for general cleaning and to help promote pealing for some existing acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;It does appear to gradually help shed the layers away.</li>
            <li> About me: woman, mid 30s. Had minor - moderate acne as teenager, started getting cystic acne in late 20s.  sensitive skin, skin is gorgeous when I keep up with regular glycolic peels and facials. $$$$&lt;br /&gt;This product is a FANTASY COME TRUE for my skin type. I use it about 2x per week and remove lots of surface skin on my face and neck.  My neck acne has always been hard to treat because  the skin is so sensitive. use this product for a thorough exfoliation, follow with a hydrating mask for spa-quality results in an hour for an unbeatable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past I have used glycolic peels to keep my skin clear, with lots of burning and discomfort. I have even considered accutane.  I am still in disbelief that this gentle, pleasant product can deliver the same results with several uses that a chemical peel can, with NO irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: make sure you use sunscreen with this product. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting but it does remove a LOT of skin. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously in love with this stuff! It is made up of mostly water and it works great getting all of the dead skin off of your face! It leaves the skin feeling soft and supple. Also, it takes forever to use the entire bottle. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am amazed and will never be without this. The results were immediate and it so gentle. I don&#x27;t even remember getting results like this using my Clairsonic! Awesome product!  I will definitely be stocking up.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin. It is gentle but effective. I use it twice a week and it has greatly reduced my breakouts, improved my skin texture, and has lightened any skin discolorations. Now it will always be a part of my beauty regiment.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this stuff years ago!  I&#x27;m amazed at how soft and smooth it makes my skin feel even after the very first use.  The difference is very noticeable with the first few hours that you try it.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days and I&#x27;ve already ordered another bottle just so I can be sure I won&#x27;t run out of it.  I absolutely love it and this item will be an ongoing part of my skin care for many years to come.  It&#x27;s definitely a keeper!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliator ever!!! I&#x27;ve tried others, and those irritated my sensitive skin, but not this one!! I especially suggest this to who have sensitive skin like me!</li>
            <li> I obviously bought this after reading the rave reviews, but I never expected it to be as amazing as it is. I wet my face with warm water then out this stuff on it, so much dead skin came off it was ridiculous. I did not use a washcloth, just my hands for application, but the dead skin still came off as easy as a warm knife going through butter. My skin is much softer, my skin has a light glow to it, my acne is already getting better after only 24 hours, and my skin is producing less oil. I know the price is steep, but trust me there is nothing on Earth that could touch this stuff. I mean if God himself needed an exfoliater this would be his go to! It&#x27;s worth every freaking penny. I&#x27;m in love. It&#x27;s gentle enough for extremely sensitive skin like mine, but tougher than an MMA fight to get that gunk off the face. Buy this you will never regret it I PROMISE YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I usually apply this after I finish my morning shower (use it on dry, clean face). First, I spread it all over my face, wait for a few seconds, and rub in circular motions all around my face. You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s working when you feel little balls forming (they&#x27;re your dead skin). People say this is pretty gross, but I find it really fun to use haha.&lt;br /&gt;I only give this 4 stars because later on during the day, I notice that I still get dry, flaky patches on my face. Maybe I shouldn&#x27;t blame this product because my skin is pretty hard to manage.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful exfoliator but it may be better for the body than the face. These oil products from Japan for break out prone skin were so tempting because of being part Japanese but on my face, I will regularly wake up with a new blemish. It does have an unusual texture. It&#x27;s gritty, and creates a kind of a paste which dead skin seems to adhere to.&lt;br /&gt;I also found it hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> This DOES not work as far as clearing up acne marks on dark skin, and actually made things worse. I tried this for one month. The first use was great and seemed promising. However, I started to break out more and patches of my skin that haven&#x27;t even broken out still turned into dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I haven&#x27;t used this product and will continue to search for something that helps hyper-pigmentation that isn&#x27;t a bleaching cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still skeptical on whether that is really dead skin rubbing off my face. Neat concept, but I don&#x27;t feel much of a difference from using this product. Unfortunate, because it&#x27;s a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> This stuff works so well! I have VERY sensitive skin so I cannot use most exfoliating products as they cause my skin to become irritated. This is the first product I have used that does a great job removing dead skin cells and other yucky things, but also does not irritate my skin. I love that you can feel it working, and afterwards my skin is softer than ever!! I use this twice a week or when I see my pores are enlarged. Cannot recommend this product enough!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love it work very well for exfoliating!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel squeaky but that is NOT skin. If u have dry patches from acne or whatever it will not make those go away. People that are saying it is skin are wring. One thing I learned about ordering from amazon is to read 3 stars and below first.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so cool! Rub it onto you dry, clean face and watch the dead skin start to pill up! You have to massage for about a minute before it starts to work. I almost thought is wasn&#x27;t going to do anything at first but then it started sloughing off dead skin. After you&#x27;re done, wash off dead skin and remaining gel. Follow up with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the feeling using my bare hands. I recommend using a light scrub afterwards due to the residue left behind. I gave it 3 stars because I&#x27;m still learning how to work it.</li>
            <li> awesome exfoliator!!! i  use this twice a week to do a general facial dead skin removing and cleansing. i was not sure if this could work out and i heard lots ppl saying this is a good product. i gave it a try and it really didn&#x27;t disappoint me!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome!!!! Luv it!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop feeling my baby smooth skin after the very first time using this! I have extremely sensitive combination skin with some acne and my acne medication leaves patches of dry/flaky skin on my face. The first use made my skin silky smooth but still left some flakiness behind so I got carry away and used it again immediately. Bad decision! The dry patches were peeled off and started bleeding(!!), I realized then they are scabs and not dry patches. I waited for 3 weeks for my skin to completely heal then use it again and again, it left my skin softer than a baby&#x27;s. My only complaint is that it can be very drying but the product did not claim to hydrate your skin so I can&#x27;t really expect it to replace my lotion. Around 10 mins after using Cure, my skin would start to feel super dry so I always apply lotion or face mask right after. I&#x27;m using this every week now, followed by My Beauty Diary Face Mask, then Mizon Snail Cream and Nature Republic Aloe Vera. My skin has never look and feel so good!!!</li>
            <li> Good product; didn&#x27;t irritate my skin; my skin felt very soft and smooth after I used it.  Item arrived quickly.  Couldn&#x27;t read instructions on bottle but I went to the questions and answer section, and other customers explained.  Happy with product.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so soft until I used this product. I have always had flaky oily skin and I was tired of all the harsh products that never really helped. (more like made it worse) I was always embarrassed of the skin on my face always flaking. Make up never looked good on me, and all the oil build-up and dead skin felt like it was weighing my face down. This is one of the best things I&#x27;ve stumbled upon. The dead skin just comes off, it&#x27;s so amazing, and it leaves my cheeks feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just me, but it seemed to help with my oily face as well since all the dead skin is gone and not clogging up my face. Lotion seems to absorb so much better now, and my make up actually applies on so smooth now! I would say it&#x27;s worth the money, you only need a little bit (maybe like 1 pump) to cover your whole face, this will probably last me a while.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after a Blogger I follow recommended it. Works great - love how smooth it makes my skin!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face and neck.  It makes my skin feel so soft and radiant.  My husband also uses it on his forehead and upper face where he doesn&#x27;t shave.  He is pleased with the results also.  It has helped my daughter&#x27;s acne and has helped with the texture of her skin.  It is a product that I  continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and saw there were some skeptics, so I took the plunge, and tried it myself! AWESOME! I constantly have dry patches on my face that prevent optimal makeup application... I thought this would help, and help it did. No burning, no irritation, just smooth radiant skin. It seems you can feel the old dead skin just rubbing off.. some folks say it&#x27;s the product balling up. Maybe it is, and I don&#x27;t care... because at the end of the day... my skin is clear, smooth and absent any dry flakey skin... and wasn&#x27;t that the whole point???</li>
            <li> Is amazing how good is this product . I waste so much money and other cleanser and so far this is the best</li>
            <li> I use every day, love this stuff. make sure you leave it on for a few min before before you start to rub off</li>
            <li> It works well but its not the miracle face wash that I think everyone claims it to be...also it kind of smells like bleach so its not super pleasant to wash your face with but it does a vey good job of exfoliating...if it was less expensive I think I could love it...but for the price my other exfoliators do a good job too. I might buy it again if I just have some money to blow but its not something I would save for.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliation treatment I could buy! I have horrible sensitive skin and it&#x27;s hard to use scrubs. This product was easy on my skin and turned my scaly face to a baby face!</li>
            <li> I am using it twice a week for 1 month now. My face feels so great and smooth after every time using Cure. It really gentle on my skin and effective. it doesn&#x27;t break me out at all(my skin is acne-prone snd very sensitive skin type). However, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on my acnes scars or big acnes yet.I took a picture of my face before using Cure and will compare after using it for a couple months. I will update on this matter later after I use it for a couple months. overall, This is s great product for sensitive and acne-prone skin.You should give it a try.</li>
            <li> total garbage, doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that sloughs off dead skin ..never seen anything like it.  I will always use this.</li>
            <li> I loved it ! :-)  I was scared it was going to irritate my skin but it was the total opposite. Once rinseing my face my skin looked lighter, clean and extremely soft. I have found my exfoliater for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> When I opened to test it on the back of my hand, I rubbed and rubbed but nothing happened at all. I became disappointed until I saw the little balls between my fingers appearing without me even touching there - that&#x27;s when I realized that there&#x27;s simply no dead skin on the back of my hand since I wash and scrub my hands so often.&lt;br /&gt;Hopeful again, I tested it out on my nose, which has been peeling and flaky after I caught the cold. I left it on for ten seconds before I started rubbing, and immediately there&#x27;s the gross balls and strings coming together.&lt;br /&gt;After this comparison, I am very confident that the product is indeed getting rid of the dead skins. I have yet to use it as part of my routine, but I am hopeful for good results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Even if you don&#x27;t think you have dead skin, you will find white skin cells beading up when you use this product! Simply amazing results!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this. Like most of my favorite products I stumbled across this accidentally one day when looking for an exfoliator. I checked the reviews and figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. I took the reviews with a grain of salt and I was hesitant and skeptical when I first tried it because if you have experience with exfoliators you know that sometimes its just the product building up on your skin and it ends up not really doing anything. This is definitely not that! I did it back to back a couple of times to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just product buildup and after about 3 times I didn&#x27;t get any more of the white beads on my face. My skin feels lovely and soft. I had bumps along my jawline that I thought were hormonal from monthly lady time but when I was done they were completely gone. I&#x27;m guessing I was just in serious need of exfoliation but overall I really was blown away. I&#x27;ve noticed that some reviews have said it lightens red spots left from blemishes but I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine that, however, I&#x27;m looking forward to it! Also, it might be pretty expensive but it&#x27;s a very large bottle and after the first couple of times you&#x27;ll only need 1 or 2 pumps to cover your whole face and probably won&#x27;t have to use it but once or twice a week so it will last you months. I&#x27;m not sure how they do it but the Asians have completely nailed the beauty market. I have a South Korean BB cream that I adore as well. I can&#x27;t stop raving about their products. Thank god for Amazon or it&#x27;d be impossible to get such high quality beauty items here. I will definitely buy this again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Cure Natural Aqua Gel 250ml  is also a best seller in the US as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  It is easy to use and gets dead skin off of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it twice a week as recommended and plan to order it again when I use this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel really clean without becoming dry.</li>
            <li> This exfoliates my skin in a gentle manner, but clearly does the job well.  After placing on skin, gently massage through in circles and you&#x27;ll feel the dead skin on your fingertips.  Rinse it away and apply moisturizer and sunblock.  You&#x27;ll be amazed how fresher and younger your skin will look and feel.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I found this miracle skin care product in Little Tokyo in California and I fell in love. I ordered it online because I came back with a carry-on luggage so I couldn&#x27;t bring the whole bottle back with me. I read all of the 1-star reviews and don&#x27;t believe those 21 people. They are just skeptical on how a product like this could actually work like it says it does. I know that some people think that the beading is from the product itself and not from the dead skin cells but I can tell you that it&#x27;s definitely your dead skin coming off. I washed my face and exfoliated it with the skin care products that I normally use then I used Cure right after. The beading mainly came from the areas that I missed like the area close to my hair line. I then wanted to give those 21 people the benefit of the doubt so I tried it on my feet to see if it worked and immediately, instead of white beads, they were grey and dirty. Nasty, I know, but this product REALLY works. If you don&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ll buy it from you :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Cure Natual Aqua Gel!!!! I have added it to my skin care routine (using 1-2 times a week since it is gentle). I have quite a bit of red marks left from blemishes and have noticed they have gone away a lot more since started using it. I do use a serum for helping to get of them. But I do believe this is a reason for the recent improvements. All of my products seems to be absorbed better without all the dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have used similar product from Orogold which it a gel formula that removes the dead skin from my face but it was too harsh and over peald some areas, but this one is wonder i like it alot very gentel but effective,, it leave your face fealing so clean i used it one/twice a week and very pleased</li>
            <li> No more harsh exfoliating experience! I found out about this from Melodee Morita a japanese Youtube Beauty Guru. It made my skin so soft without making pores big. Love the fact that it is just a gel and not a scrub but definitely works like a charm!!! It lifts away my dead skins and I always my skin has gone softer and more radiant. Definitely one of my holy grail products!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ll probably be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this really does anything. I put it on my skin and then begin to rub it off after about 20-30 sec. As I rub, it starts to ball up into greyish little balls of &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t think it actually is skin, but rather the product balling up and helping to exfoliate your skin. It does make your skin feel a little bit smoother. I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it is gentle and makes my face feel a tad bit smoother but I probably won&#x27;t order another bottle.</li>
            <li> This will be the second time that I&#x27;m using this product but I can say that it really made my skin much smoother and cleaner!!! My BB cream glides on my face more smoothly. I don&#x27;t have acne but I have a few acne scars so I have yet to observe what good this exfoliator will do more for my skin. I recommend this product for those who have sensitive skin and is looking for a fix on how to achieve a smoother and cleaner face.</li>
            <li> great products. I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is black magic! My face has never felt so smooth and soft! I only use this once a week (twice if my skin feels like it needs it), so the bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use:&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean/wash face as you normally do.&lt;br /&gt;2. Dry face completely.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply a fair amount of Cure to your face. Too little product does not work well, so don&#x27;t be stingy!&lt;br /&gt;4. Wait 30sec to 1min for the product to start turning white on your face.&lt;br /&gt;5. Once you see white stuff start appearing on your face, gently rub in circles, creating gross white balls of skin and product.&lt;br /&gt;6. Rinse off face when done and apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice. But the price is too high. But understandable.</li>
            <li> Please-please-please do not believe the hype. I moved to Japan and saw that it was all the rage around the beauty stores, and stupidly picked one up. The little balls are NOT YOUR DEAD SKIN CELLS. There is alcohol in this, which when it evaporates (quickly), leaves behind a dense, gooey substance that can be rolled into small balls. Don&#x27;t believe me? Try using the product several times in a row - alleged &amp;#34;skin cells&amp;#34; form every time, meaning the eventually you should be rubbing raw skin...but you won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not your skin peeling off.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Keep you skin clean long time</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  Actually does what it claims and exfoliates well, leaving clean, fresh skin.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I use this every other day in the morning after cleaning and patting my face dry. Like others said it, I take small amount and rub in my face with circular motion, one area of my face at a time. Dead skins start to ball up within seconds. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of force either. It get my skin smooth but it does not clean out my pores so I am using walnut complexion scrub from Ole Henriksen the other days. I&#x27;ve been using this product for month and liquid is still near the top. I&#x27;m sure this will last for long time. I was thinking about PTR&#x27;s similar product before making my purchase but I&#x27;m very happy that I chose this product instead.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how or why this works but omg. I put it on my feet and all the dry skin washed off. It freaks me out a little but does the trick.</li>
            <li> This gel is absolutely wonderful.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my face at all.  It is amazing to see the dead skin cells gather on my face.  I bought 2 containers one for me and one for my mother who is 63 years old.  She LOVES it also and uses it 3 times a week and swears she has brighter and softer skin.</li>
            <li> extremely gentle and soft! Just like water:)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I tell everyone about it and encourage them to try it out.  Most amazing this I have ever put on my face.</li>
            <li> Decide to see if all the hype was true on this product.  It is a very good and gentle exfoliater and&lt;br /&gt;For the amount in the bottle an excellent value. I have sensitive skin and would be able to use it daily if I chose to do so,but  because I am a beauty junkie I have other favorites and so I rotate between them.&lt;br /&gt;This  is definitely now a contender because it gives an immediate clean, rosy glow to skin and a noticeable smoothness&lt;br /&gt;And softness after each use  with no negative effect.</li>
            <li> Amazing how much dead skin this removes, very exciting to see!  I try to use this twice a week at the most.  Leaves my skin feeling really soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> First off, my skin type: acne prone, sensitive, combination, and dehydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good at exfoliating, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Cure Natural –. Exfoliators, as you probably know, work typically work in one of two ways: by chemically loosening dead skin cells with an alpha hydroxy acid or similar chemical. Or by mechanically removing dead skin cells with an abrasive particle like a walnut shell or a polyethylene bead. This product contains neither type of ingredient. It does, however, contain “Activated Hydrogen Water? The balls are formed as the water evaporates and the acrylates polymer comes out of solution. (Some products like this claim that the “balls” are actually the dead skin cells but that’s not true.) I suppose the balls could give some degree of exfoliation but I wonder if they’d work as well as particles specifically sized for that task. the plastic micro-bead issue plays out. They gained popularity because they are less abrasive than walnut shells and other similar exfoliators. Now they’re losing popularity become of their environmental impact. thebeautybrains.com</li>
            <li> Awesommmmmmeeeeeee, buy it do not hesitate. I&#x27;m one of those who buys something and want it to work right There. And this product trully exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy and works amazing.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money. You can really see the difference in your face. Face is clean and bright</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Totally worth the price</li>
            <li> This product, cure natural aqua gel, is amazing! It give skin a clean feeling and takes off all dead skin cells.  For acne skin it&#x27;s a dream. While it&#x27;s not advertised or marketed specifically for acne skin, it&#x27;s a great exfoliate that doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. People prone to acne shouldn&#x27;t use scrubs as it spreads the bacteria, so this is a great alternative!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle! I use it for my face, hands and even to keep my feet soft. I have really sensitive skin and never have an issue with this. Best exfoliator I have ever used hands down.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It does everything it&#x27;s said to do and has made a real positive difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME AND COOL!!!! What I do after using this product is to rinse my face with slightly cols water. Even after ONE use, you can already see AND feel the results!!!! I&#x27;ve also noticed my pores were shrinking when using this product!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD BARGAIN AS WELL!!! Usually other sites sell these for $40 or more!!!</li>
            <li> Had a sample and was excited to try this, but it arrived with the dispenser broken.  I see that it has happened to others as well.</li>
            <li> I live in Japan and saw this exfoliating gel everywhere. The bottle is big and it will last a long time. I only need 1-2 pumps to do my face and neck. I have very sensitive skin in general and started using tretinoin cream 3 weeks ago. This works well to gently exfoliate off the peeling skin. I am slowly increasing the tretinoin applications so I don&#x27;t have the major peeling some people get. I use this about 2 times a week since starting tretinoin. You have to make sure your skin and hands are completely dry first or this won&#x27;t work. Just spread it on your skin and gently massage in a circular motion, no need to scrub. After few seconds it will start to ball up as the gel interacts with the skin cells. Then rinse it off and your skin should feel soft and silky. I have used apricot seed scrubs and microbead scrubs and think the Cure gel is the best.</li>
            <li> It works and satisfyingly so. I use this about once a week to really polish dead skin cells off. I read somewhere that it does not &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; off more dead skin after a certain point - if you test it twice on the same area of skin, there won&#x27;t be dead skin balls because it&#x27;s already gotten that layer off.</li>
            <li> This scrub definitely deserves to be N1 best-seller not only in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;1. First of all, what I love about this scrub is that it has watery consistency, so it&#x27;s extremely gentle. (I have acne-prone skin, so it&#x27;s very important that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin)&lt;br /&gt;2. I try to stick to natural products as much as possible and I love that cure aqua gel is all-natural and free of harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;3. IT WORKS WONDERS. You start massaging it on dry skin, and soon you witness your old dead skin cells leaving your face like snowflakes, it&#x27;s amazing and after you wash it off, you are left with BABY SMOOTH SKIN.</li>
            <li> Its amaizing... And fast shipping... Thanx</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have an oily complexion and this stuff cleans my face perfectly! This actually rubs away dirt and dead skin cells from your face leaving it clean and supple!</li>
            <li> I found this item on the web when I was surfing. I ordered it from the reviews and I was pleasantly surprised at how efficient it cleans your skin. I do not have bad acne or any facial problems but was looking for a good exfoliate/cleaner product. This does a great job, it is not harsh on my face and leaves it looking smooth and bright. I told my wife about this and she asked that I order one for her as well. Simple cleansing product. I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this hocus-pocus lol I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s skin that everyone keeps claiming I think it turns into a mild exfoliant  ... Also it dose leave my skin soft after I remove all the gunk  ..</li>
            <li> I use Retin-A in the .05 strength 3 consecutive days out of the week. I use this product to slough off the dead skin cells, and I&#x27;m surprised to say that it really gets off most of the dead skin. I say most because even if I go over my skin 3 times with this product, I&#x27;ll sometimes still see flakes around my mouth. But with a product like Retin-A, I expect this. For someone who doesn&#x27;t need extreme exfoliation, I can see this working miracles. But for someone like myself who&#x27;s on a strong exfoliating medication, it will work well, but possibly leave some flakes. All in all, I will continue to use this as a way to gently get all the flakies away :)</li>
            <li> I usually rush to rate things I buy,but I&#x27;ve had this product for about 5 months and finally feel ready to properly rate it.  I found out about this type of product through sephora, who generously gave me tons of samples of their aqua exfoliating gel. I really enjoyed the feeling of rubbing it on my face and seeing the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34;  come off.  I did some research when it was time to get more and this seemed like a comparable option that cost a tiny bit less. This formula is a bit more watery than you would expect a gel to be. You should also leave it on about 20 seconds before you start rubbing it, any longer and it completely dries and you cannot rub it off you have to wash it off which makes the product then useless. I know there is definitely doubts about it working and whether it&#x27;s the product that balls up as oppose to the dead skin it promises. I had some doubts too but really really enjoy  rubbing it off, then one day I woke up with a dry nasty pimple. You know the kind with the dry skin in top that makeup only draws more attention to? I put this to the test and the dry skin came completely off it and I covered it with makeup seamlessly. I use it ever other day now after I shower. I am such a believer I  this, if I forget to use this a couple of days my skin gets both flaky dry and greasy ew. I also have some acne scarring that has slowly faded, it&#x27;s not something that will get rid of it In a short time but it has made covering up the scars with make up easier because it has faded them and also gotten rid of the dry skin that made my makeup patchy. Over all I will definitely be buying this again and use it forever. It&#x27;s beyond phenomenal and it&#x27;s really fun to rub it around. Ten outta ten best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the most gentle exfoliator I&#x27;ve ever used! It gently peels the dead skin and make your soft smooth and clean. I have the most sensitive skin and I&#x27;m very much particular about the products that I use. I did a lot of research and bought it and it is far more better than my expectation! Wonderful product! I would recommend it to everyone! :D</li>
            <li> This product is utter hocus pocus people.  It is the product clumping after a couple minutes not our skin!</li>
            <li> Item arrived with nozzle broken off and missing, but product still dispenses correctly.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> First time writing a review on a product. I heard multiple people talking about this product and how great it is, that I decided to give it a try. After the first use I noticed my skin to be really soft. I was impressed how well it works. It leaves your skin feeling refreshing. I&#x27;ve been told not to use it as a daily project, just twice a week. I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the craze is about...I didn&#x27;t have hella skin rolling off. This was just okay for me. I was expecting a deep exfoliation with huge balls of skin rolling off based on how the other reviewers are talking about this item....meh...it&#x27;s just okay to me....</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I would compare two applications of this product to a mild chemical peel or a month of using retinoids, but without their harsh effects! I have very delicate acne-prone type 1 skin and this product has never broken me out or cause dryness. With the first use you will notice a fresher, cleaner, more even complexion. Just a miracle worker in a bottle. Do not let the price discourage you, you need less than a 1/4 tsp of product to clean your whole face, so on the long run it is very unexpensive and totally worth the initial investment.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was hoping it would be, a gentle and effective exfoliator. A little goes a long way and I do not have to use it very often to get good results (I use it once every 2-3 weeks).</li>
            <li> It lit your skin shine and clean</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the hype.  I went online to figure out how to use it since nothing but the name is in english.  That was OK, sorta.  I followed the directions from other consumers and the product never produced the little white balls.  Although, I never really figured out what the white balls were or what they were supposed to do.  Plus, it was difficult to get any product out of the container.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! :) And to those people who say it&#x27;s just the product balling up, not your skin, lol you&#x27;re wrong :P I went over the same spot that I used this gel on after rinsing, and no skin balled up the second time. So it IS skin. Anyway, this product really does get up all that gunk that has been shedding on your skin, and ohhh my goodness... After you rinse, your face feels freaking RAW. Not in a bad or painful way at all, just your skin is as smooth as plastic! No joke. That&#x27;s how well this gets dead skin off. And since it exfoliates so well, my acne scars have healed and faded SOO fast! You guys, i&#x27;ve used this only four times and my acne scars are already light pink instead of red/brown. It really gets that top layer of your skin off, helping for new skin to form. Scrubs have never helped my acne scars that fast, it usually takes a month or so -_-  This gel is suchhh a freaking blessing if you have acne scars!!&lt;br /&gt;However, the reason for me not giving it five stars is because it does NOT exfoliate big flake patches on my skin. Like a previous pimple that dried up really well from my acne cream, this gel did not magically get that big dry crusty patch off. It got some of the skin around it off, but not everything. But that&#x27;s expected, no rough scrubs ever did that for me, I have to literally get tweezers and pull off the scaly patches. Also, the smell of this is like alcohol... Not appealing.</li>
            <li> This is a liquid gel – not too thick and not too runny.  I have very delicate 72-year old skin and cannot use abrasive exfoliators without removing too many layers.  Even when I was young, I couldn’t use them. This gel works only on dead skin and has causes no reaction to living skin.  Apply it, wait a moment while it changes from clear to slightly white,  and then very gently massage ~ the dead skin just rolls up into little balls and there is no abrasion at all.  It is a minor miracle.  I’ve recommended it to friends of a like age.  I am using it twice a week and I love the way my skin looks and feels.  If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a little disappointed by this stuff. I was hoping for a lot of dramatic eraser shavings to come flying off my face, but I barely got anything at all. I think the problem is that I keep my skin very well exfoliated and fresh with the Holika Holika Egg Soap, Perfect Whip, a pore scrubber, and Wonder Pore Freshner. It&#x27;s SO exfoliated that I frankly don&#x27;t even need this. So if you&#x27;re religious with your skin care, don&#x27;t think that this will somehow find hidden dead skin you couldn&#x27;t reach with your pore scrubber. It can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s just a fun alternative exfoliant. In terms of these gummy sort of exfoliants, I prefer the Ettusais Peeling Milk in the turquoise bottle, it had a very dramatic effect the last time I used it, and had a dewy aftereffect that this does not provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo included for scale of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my horribly dry hands, primarily. The white beads of dry skin began, then progressed to little ropes because there was so much to take off. My hands are much smoother, but after two applications, I can see that I will need to use this at least every other day for a while. I follow the exfoliation with a heavy moisturizing cream and cotton gloves as I sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my face where I had less of a problem with dry skin. Some response.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few days and I have to say, with each usage, my skin feels sooooo smooth.&lt;br /&gt;This is a guy with stubble and ingrown hairs.  I am hoping with the continued usage, the ingrown hairs issue, will be a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in the future, but as it stands, all the reviews are spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) wash your face&lt;br /&gt;2) pat dry&lt;br /&gt;3) pump some into your palm&lt;br /&gt;4) rub into your facial skin and KEEP going until you see the white &amp;#34;elmer&#x27;s glue&amp;#34; balls of dead skin.&lt;br /&gt;5) rinse&lt;br /&gt;6) continue your skin regimen</li>
            <li> Very good product ! My skin status has improved !</li>
            <li> Strangely effective, but hard to accurately explain the usefulness of this product. It&#x27;s akin to using a pencil eraser on your face but much more gentle. It results in smooth skin and overall better complexion when used semi-frequently.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliate that I have ever used. I was amazed at the amount of dry skin that was removed on my first try.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> Works great for exfoliating my face, gets the rough peely skin off and makes my face smooth</li>
            <li> Awesome exfoiliator. Not sure if i would buy it again because of the price. But the product lasts a  long time, so maybe!!</li>
            <li> great. exfoliates gently leaving no irration or redness behind. I especially recommend it to people with acne prone skin because it exfoliates with the power needed but does not irritates spots.</li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s all dead skin than you have my business for life! Just don&#x27;t use it over any area that has Eczema or rashes. I have a problem area on my chin that gets Eczema and it should not be used on that EVER!.  ( I learned the hard way). I tested it on my arm  and did not get the beading so I am hoping it is indeed dead skin coming off.</li>
            <li> Had an allergic reaction after using this. Maybe my skin is just not used to it. Won&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
            <li> Expectation succeeded!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and although I was a bit skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve found it does a good job. I use it about every 2 weeks and it leaves my face quite smooth. In addition to my face I&#x27;ve found an unusual use: I have a palm-sized patch of eczema on my ankle. It&#x27;s like skin grows too rapidly so there&#x27;s always a lot of dead skin there. I was thinking the dead skin might interfere with medication and moisturizers, so I used Cure on it. Nice to have a nonabrasive, nonirritating exfoliant. Afterwards my eczema started feeling less itchy and as I predicted, moisturizing cream and meds get absorbed much better. The patch looks better than it has in a year and looks like it might actually heal up.</li>
            <li> Best product ever. I use it twice a week and seeing great results. Thanks</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m baffled how this brand has so many good reviews and Sakura Silk (http://www.amazon.com/Sakura-Silk-Gel-Face-Body/dp/B0052XYYQQ) has bad ones. Must admit, I was hopeful that my expectations would be even further surpassed with this product, but it&#x27;s absolute crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s watery. So watery that it runs down your hand and arm while you&#x27;re attempting to rub it on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t remove much dead skin at all. I&#x27;m guessing because it is massively watered down (see previous con). I rub and rub and rub my face, yet only a couple little white pieces come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to use more. Because it is watery, you lose extra down your arm, plus since very little skin is removed with one use, I&#x27;ve found I need to apply over and over to get the same effect as Sakura Silk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaper. You get what you pay for, apparently. Back to the superior product.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this works exactly but this gentle solution seems to do a good job at exfoliating skin. Leaves face feeling clean and supple.</li>
            <li> It worked good it took all the dead skin off my face.</li>
            <li> The product is not what it should be. This product is watered down. It might be expired or something. Be careful when ordering this.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s so gentle and has no exfoiliaters or microbeads on it. The ingredients naturally remove a layer of dead skin. As you&#x27;re massaging you&#x27;ll start to feel some tiny bits and those are tiny bits of dead skin! This products is so amazing and it makes my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this gel makes my skin feel so clean and I literally see the dead skin melting away at my face...I dont think I can live without this exfoliator, especially after being told that my other daily exfoliators have not helped remove the dead skin from my face.</li>
            <li> OMG!!! This product is beyond amazing! I purchased my first bottle of cure around six months ago and all I can say is the results speak for themselves. I use Cure basically everyday in the morning after doing my basic face routine and even after washing my face I still slough off soooo much dead skin! This product leaves my skin feeling so soft, supple, clean,  &amp; glowing without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;I have had pretty bad acne for the past two years however, Cure doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in any way :)! My acne scars fade so much faster and my breakouts have subsided enormously! I wish I could buy this in the US because it is simply astounding &gt;_&lt;! Sooo repurchasing this once I&#x27;m out. Speaking off of that this product will last you a good while, I bought this at the end of September and I&#x27;m running out just now! Soooo final thought? GO BUY this!!!!! You won&#x27;t regret it at all. I swear lol :)!!!!</li>
            <li> I have literally become a spokesperson for this product because I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered with acne and breakouts for about a year in my 20s despite never having skin problems before then. I used all different kinds of masks, drug store products, Lush products, changed my diet, tried exercising in an effort to clear my skin to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is when I found the cure on Amazon and decided I needed to buy it after reading about half of the 800 reviews. The first time I used it, I used it 3 times because my skin appeared to be so dirty that the white substance (I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s dead skin because it stops coming out if you use the product more than once) kept pouring out and I was so grossed out. But it was amazing, my skin never felt so clean and light despite the much harsher exfoliants I have used in the past. Just like the other reviews say, you rub it into your dry, clean skin and this white substance forms as the dead skin is removed from your pores and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you&#x27;re not supposed to, but I used it every single day for about a month until my skin stopped producing so much of the substance when I rubbed it in. I&#x27;m now down to a few breakouts instead of it covering my face and a lot of the scarring has lightened as well. At this point, I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 months and I still have 1/2 the bottle left despite my vigorous use. I can attribute the vast improvement in my skin to this product and HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to anyone dealing with acne and clogged pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has CHANGED MY LIFE.</li>
            <li> i am asian- 39 yrs of age; i havent been using this product long enough to give a good review and to see any dramatic changes or changes in my skin however as for the exfloxiating as it claim, it does do that. You do actually see your dead skin rub off (top layer) it does make my face feel clean. I thought it was just the product itself but when I apply the product to other surface it does do that. The  white residue are actual dead skin rubbing off. I would recommend this for exfloxiating purposes...other than that...not sure what other claims since i havent been using it that long. and a small amount does go a long way, jus do a small area at a time.</li>
            <li> I love Cure. It&#x27;s the best exfoliater I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s gentle and doesn&#x27;t scratch my skin (no &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; or walnut shell chips). I used it twice a week.</li>
            <li> This stuff is interesting and fun to use. My face looks really rejuvenated after washing off all the build up, whatever it is, and feels very soft and smooth. Great way to start off my cleansing routine!</li>
            <li> This product exfoliates like no other.  I have tried all of the gritty scrubs that claim to exfoliate well, but I found them all irritating and they did not work as well or as fast as this product did!  I have really sensitive skin and this did not cause any redness or allergic reactions.  I heard that this product does not contain alcohol (as the ingredients are in Japanese, I can&#x27;t read it), but it certainly smelled like it did, so if your skin has problems with alcohol, you may want to avoid this product.  Overall, I love this product and would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and it&#x27;s pretty good. The instructions online said to use it twice a week but my skin became excessively dry. I dropped down to once a week and I&#x27;m noticing some pretty good results. I&#x27;m 42 and experiencing hormonal skin, I&#x27;m trying natural products to ease the symptoms. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use the Clarisonic brush for cleansing my face, plus a toner with salicylic acid, so my exfoliation needs are not that many. However, I use an anti-aging retinol cream twice a week and two days after I use it I always have dry, flaky skin that my normal exfoliation doesn&#x27;t take care of. That&#x27;s when I use this gel, and it works spectacularly. It gets all the flaky skin off without irritation. And I mean without irritation. Before I started using this, I tried many grainy scrub exfoliators and even the least harsh one would make my skin red, and it hurt! But, heed this warning: if you use it and don&#x27;t think it has exfoliated enough, DO NOT use it again right away! I was one of those people that was skeptical this was actually removing dead skin from my face, so I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to do it twice. I was wrong. I&#x27;d already exfoliated all the dead skin off. Using it again right away exfoliated away my new, happy skin and it hurt. A lot. Any moisturizer I put on after that made it hurt even more. Also, my boyfriend (who used to never do much to take care of his skin because skin care products &amp;#34;don&#x27;t do anything&amp;#34;), uses this more than I do. He likes it so much because he can SEE it&#x27;s working when the little clumps form. He even uses moisturizer now, because he wants to keep his skin as smooth as it is after he uses this gel.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package, I thought this bottle size is bigger than what I expected. I am Native Japanese. I know so many things are much much smaller and more expensive in Japan. But this one was good size for this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I jumped into the shower with my daughter and tried this product. I felt that thickness of this gel is super light, not greasy at all, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive dry skin at all. I felt almost like water, so I was doubting at beginning if it will really work for me or not. Silly my guess, IT DOES WORKS!!!! I was using sugar and water scrub on my face until I found this product. Sugar scrub works enough but everyday I had to use it to remove and ended up having a dry skin.... This product helped me keeping great Asian skin quality. I am going to let my daughter use it when she gets teenager for sure, not now though!</li>
            <li> This is just what my skin needs right now. It feels amazing on my face and exfoliates it greatly. Japanese products are great!</li>
            <li> it works like a miracle.. my friends were amazed as well..</li>
            <li> Very gentle exfoliator. Love it</li>
            <li> Odd feeling at first because you don&#x27;t know what to expect but leaves your skin silky without over drying it.</li>
            <li> good product really works well to remove dead skin cells just dont use it too often or it may irritate</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff.  I exfoliate with this every single day, sometimes twice a day.  My skin is very acne prone and the products that I use to keep the pimples at bay can be drying.  The dry skin therefore gets prone to break out.  It&#x27;s a terrible cycle.  With the aqua gel, I just buff all that dry skin away so that my skin is constantly exfoliated and receptive to the medicines and moisturizers I need.  It&#x27;s great for lips, too, and I love to give myself a luxurious lip exfoliation when I&#x27;m feeling chapped.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason japanese women and men are known for their amazing skin. I&#x27;ve always loved having smooth skin and thankfully I have good genes from my mother and I have porcelain milky white skin.&lt;br /&gt;However recently I started birth control and I&#x27;ve gotten these pesky blackheads and little bumps all over. So I decided to look for a new exfoliating face scrub.&lt;br /&gt;  This stuff works great! Just put a little on your hands, rub it all over your face gently, and leave on for about 30 seconds so it has time to react with your dead skin cells. Then use your fingertips and rub in outward circular motions. Soon you&#x27;ll start to see little beads of white....&lt;br /&gt;YOUR SKIN! It&#x27;s your skin coming off. Don&#x27;t scrub too hard, just a firm pressure will do.&lt;br /&gt;Then rinse off, apply a toner, and voila! Wonderful satin smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I love! Love this product! I bought another one for my sister and recommend it to all my good friends and family. I&#x27;d buy it again as soon as its half gone.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, BUT was expecting for my face to shed a large amount of skin; only little bits of dead skin come off.. maybe my face is cleaner than I thought?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use these 2-3 times a week (or depending on how I feel).&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Scrub face, dry, apply a little on parts of my face with CURE, rub, splash, then dry.&lt;br /&gt;OR&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Scub face, cleanser, dry, then use CURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle comes with a little plastic part that prevents the bottle from accidentally squeezing out content. Nice touch. Just don&#x27;t lose it in case you have a pet or child that likes to swallow or put random little things in their mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s peeling off my skin or if the product just pills on your face after a certain amount of time and physically exfoliates. didn&#x27;t seem to help much</li>
            <li> This product is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever bought for my skin. I have oily/dry skin and this has helped SO much. I was doubting that it would actually work as I&#x27;ve read some reviews of people complaining that it didn&#x27;t. All I have to say is if you&#x27;re considering buying this....do it! You will not regret it. Just make sure you wash and dry your skin, your hands and face are dry and that you actually rub it into your face. It&#x27;s all about the method that works best for you.</li>
            <li> I love this and it works well I got my first one and turned around and bought another before I put a dent in the first bottle. This make your skin smooth, soft, clean and so touchable and beautiful. Buy it and know if you share it you will be looking for it because everyone wants it. This is rated  #1in Japan and I know why.</li>
            <li> Really love how this works! Smell is okay and bottle is nice size. Abit too pricey for me though.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! My skin is glowing!!!  I&#x27;m 31 and biracial with sensitive skin and hormonal acne nothing crazy though. . I use it 2/3 a week in the morning or before bed (which ever) after the first week I seen real results. Noticeable, visible results!! Between this and the clay mask I&#x27;ve even seen some lightening of dark spots (acne scars) on my face as well. I believe with continuos use I&#x27;ll be pimple and acne scar free very soon :). I will say you need a good moisturizer after using Cure. Works best with a dry face and hands. Good luck!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging has changed. Previously a plastic piece clipped onto the neck of the sprayer to keep the pusher from releasing the lotion. It was missing and now I cannot travel with it. Was it forgotten or has it been eliminated? This piece is necessary.</li>
            <li> Very good exfoliator,  leaves  skin soft and clear.  I use it once a week and it does a wonderful job.  I&#x27;m now using it in my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; to see if can improve the skin there and maybe lighten it.</li>
            <li> It is very mild and it make my skin very soft</li>
            <li> This stuff TOTALLY works! Let it sit on clean skin for about a minute, then rub, rub, rub and exfoliate GENTLY, revealing super soft clean skin for days!</li>
            <li> Great product, love it!! Prompt delivery, very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love it from the first use</li>
            <li> I love Cure Gel! This is my first time using it. It is a great exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;Does just what it says. My skin is so soft now and smooth to the touch. It looks more even. My olive skin seems somewhat brighter as well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s recommended that you only use it twice a week. This is how I use it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel baby soft! Love this!❤️</li>
            <li> It is a really good product，clean your death cells really gently...&lt;br /&gt;Could use it once a week for deep cleaning</li>
            <li> Amazing wonderful sexy fabulous gorgeous  what else can I use to describe this? I have used it now for 2 weeks twice a week and my skin has never looked better. It&#x27;s clear radiant and soft. You can&#x27;t ask for a better product. And for the people saying this isn&#x27;t your dead skin balling up it is just try washing your face a couple of times and see the reduction of little skin balls appearing until it eventually stops.</li>
            <li> Very clean feel, I need this for regular peeling &amp; depend on this much now! thanks Cure! I will buy again.</li>
            <li> How come i never new about it before?? It really takes off all the dead skin and my face feels as soft as a baby&#x27;s but. I always had dark areas (around my mouth and nose). This thing really takes care of that. I also have like 3 dark acne scars. I&#x27;m hoping it takes care of them as well. So far they&#x27;re getting lighter XD&lt;br /&gt;I used to exfoliate 2-3 times a week but it never gave me as good results as this one. Plus, i havent had any crazy pimple pop out since i used it!</li>
            <li> The best product I hace ever used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an gentle exfoliant for people who just want to add to their regular routine...for someone who suffers from adult acne, something stronger is recommended...I wish I had spent my money on something more tailored to my needs...</li>
            <li> I really loved it! you can see the dead skin cell pop up in the surface while you are massaging your face. However, I do recommended though, you should use the product only 2 twice a week, it does makes your skin very dry! Overall, this is best exfoliate product so far!</li>
            <li> I believe that the product is balling up itself and that the lumps created are not skin, but my skin feels amazing after using.  It really does.  I don&#x27;t know why or how to explain it.  I looked up similar items and they sell for significantly more $$ for much less product.  Buy and try if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li> On my face, it works okay. Left my face really smooth. I got my brother to use it, and it seriously worked. All his dirty pores got cleaned lol. I guess he&#x27;ll be the one using it.</li>
            <li> My acne is stupidly ridiculous and I needed something to exfoliate my face that won&#x27;t tear my sensitive skin off.  I&#x27;m already using a numerous products a day on my face and this is a great addition.  The exfoliating is so gentle that I can use this twice a day, before bed and work.</li>
            <li> No idea how it works, but one application, and you&#x27;ve got a glow to last you half the day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works very well. Does not come with instructions in English but I found them on Google.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser/exfoliater.</li>
            <li> Wow! Best exfoliating product ever! It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin and really makes my skin feel smooth and clean!&lt;br /&gt;I will DEFINATELY keep purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is doing anything, may be it is but I haven&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in 15-20 days of use yet.</li>
            <li> Awesome product will purchase again!</li>
            <li> After I read many positive reviews, I bought it, but I didn&#x27;t use it. I have oily face , big pore . So, a lot of dark can be easily put on my face. I used Cure Natural Aqua Gel from last two weeks. Now my face is clean. I am really happy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best exfoliatior I have used! I really like to see the skin peeling off! My face feels really smooth after I wash the product off!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing!!</li>
            <li> Works better than the Peter Thomas Roth product in my opinion!</li>
            <li> was good on m face, didn&#x27;t over dry. expensive thou</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really worth the money. My skin feel so soft. love it!  PTR has the similar product works good but pricy.</li>
            <li> It really cleans my skin deeply. Love it</li>
            <li> My complexion always looks better after I exfoliate. I used this product with a self tanner during the summer months and it helped to keep the tanner from looking rusty on my neck and prevented buildup of color on my face. In the winter months it works well with Tretinoin creme to subdue flaking. I feel moisturizers and vitamin C penetrates better with use of product.  5/4/2015 update: after a couple of nights of Tretinoin treatment followed by vitamin C serum, my 53-year-old skin needs serious exfoliation. This product helps with peeling, flakes, blotchiness and acne. I use it once or twice a week, depending on how it looks. Yes, it does require multiple applications to remove all the dead build-up. But if I use too much, then I&#x27;ll end up with bloody lesions. I don&#x27;t want to be without this stuff. One bottle seems to last about 2 months and I use the product rather frequently.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t no if It&#x27;s really working....</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that does best when it is left alone.  So you think I would know by now not to buy exfoliators.  But the thing is, I love exfoliating.  I love how soft and smooth my skin feels afterwards.  Sadly though, this one is just too harsh, even to use once a week.  The little &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; are definitely dead skin--all you have to do is rub the gel on another part of your body and you&#x27;ll discover it only balls in certain places on your body.  But since I&#x27;ve started using this, my face has not only broken out, but my cheeks have what appear to be broken blood vessels underneath the skin.  If you do not have sensitive skin, this product may work great; and from the other reviews it seems like some people with sensitive skin have no problems; but it made my face look really terrible.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this stuff is now my holy grail. It works very well. I feel so soft afterwards. And I tried it on a surface to make sure it doesn&#x27;t just automatically clump up and it doesn&#x27;t. It really does what it says. Totally worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product!  I read both positive and negative reviews and decided to go for it.  I also watched a couple of videos on Youtube to make sure I understood how to use it.  I pump two or three squirts of gel into my palm, then apply it to my face.  It takes about a minute or a little less to turn milky and then I just gently massage my skin, no hard rubbing needed.  After a few seconds the dead skin cells start sloughing off.  I don&#x27;t understand how it works but I am convinced it does.  Because some negative reviewers think it is not dead skin cells but just something in the gel itself, I applied some to a pesticide-free, wax-free, home grown lemon.  Nothing.  I think it is a good product but it is essential that you use it correctly.  Don&#x27;t just put it on your skin and start rubbing.</li>
            <li> To begin with, I live in Okinawa Japan so I buy Cure here and not on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can personally vouch for seeing tons of Japanese women (and some men) buying this stuff. And I can also vouch for this being an AMAZING exfoliator. But let&#x27;s be clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT A MAKEUP REMOVER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, I have been using this product for a couple weeks and my face is as beautiful as it was years and years ago when I took Accutane. Everyone from my doctor to my husband to my girlfriends to the cashier I always see at the grocery store has said that my face is just glowing all of the sudden. My make up goes on better. My skin is smoother. And yes, my face is glowing. This stuff is amazing and I will stock up before I move back to the states (because it is cheaper in Japan than on Amazon.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, your skin may still be dry after using it, but maybe that&#x27;s because your moisturizer isn&#x27;t potent enough. Seriously, this is the best beauty product I have ever bought for myself. Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews deter you. Most of those people didn&#x27;t use it correctly. Give it a shot. You&#x27;ll probably never want to live without it!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne-proned skin, so I&#x27;m always cautious when trying new products. I absolutely love Cure Natural Aqua Gel. I works just as advertised; very easy and gentle on skin while leaving my skin squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li> save your money! not really an exfoliator .... it&#x27;s more like rubbing plastic drops on your skin... it is not your skin cells for sure.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot! I would like to recommend it to all of my friends and I will continue purchasing this product after I finish my first one.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit concerned, because it smelled like rubbing alcohol when I applied it to my skin, but it faded quickly. The product does not irritate my skin at all, and effectively removes every last bit of dead skin, even patches of dry skin. Left my skin incredibly smooth and silky, not dry at all.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator is an absolute must-have in every skincare routine. Cure doesn&#x27;t break me out and is great at removing dull, dead skin. It&#x27;s essentially a \\&quot;peeling gel\\&quot;, but don&#x27;t let that deter you from buying the product because that label sounds harsh on the skin. Cure is actually super gentle and claims to made up of over 90% water! The exfoliation process is super easy and pretty clean: After washing your hands, pump the bottle 2 times into your hands and apply this allover a DRY face. Wait about 5-10 seconds and GENTLY massage the product into your skin (while avoiding the delicate eye area). You&#x27;ll see these tiny white or fleshtone balls appear, which is supposed to be a combination of your dead skin and the product itself that have been removed from your face. Afterwards just wash off the balls from your face with cool water and enjoy your super smooth and radiant skin! Continue with the rest of your skincare routine (cleanser, toner, repairing lotion, treatment, moisturizer, etc.)and keep in mind that if you use a micro-exfoliating cleanser like Proactiv, that you should use is as a more of a 1 minute wash off mask (do not rub it in like you usually would, but let it \\&quot;rest on the skin\\&quot; so that you still get the acne fighting goodness). It&#x27;s best to use this MAXIMUM once a week, or once every other week if you use a micro-exfoliating cleanser like Proactiv. Bottom line: I recommend this to everyone regardless of skin type as exfoliating is an important part of proper skincare and Cure is much more gentle in comparison to \\&quot;physical\\&quot; exfoliating products like St. Ives that rely on gritty bits which can be off-putting to those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great products, have been using it weeks now (twice a week), feel great, and it really works as lot other customers said.&lt;br /&gt;Really LOVE it !!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the stuff! I decided to purchase this item after reading all the positive reviews, and was super excited when receiving it the next day!!! It cleans very thoroughly yet is very mild at the same time. I didn&#x27;t feel any irritation or dryness as with other exfoliating products. After my first try, my skin felt very clean and refreshing. I think I&#x27;ll keep using it from now on!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well! NO PEOPLE it is not your skin that is peeling off, it is the product that is solidifying &amp; sticking together to exfoliate your skin. It does a nice job making your skin feel soft and smooth but no miracle. Remember, if it actually was strong enough to make your skin peel as fast as some described, it would require a prescription from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> bought this on a whim, thinking it would be okay, but not live up to the raves...was I wrong!  Price is in line (or actually less!!) with high end makeup products, and shipping was incredibly fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product itself is fantastic.  I squirted a half pump on my finger and massaged into my cheeks/forehead/nose/chin/neck applying a bit more where needed.  Sure enough, rubbed it aroud and had little white globs come off that I easily washed away, leaving no burning/redness/tenderness, just smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it again two days later, and noticed some recent acne scars already lightening (recent as in earlier in the week) but no real impact yet on some older darker spots, but will give it some time.  Still smooth skin, but the overall level of &#x27;brightening&#x27; wasn&#x27;t as dramatic as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will likely use 1-2 times a week and cancel those appointments for facials.  seriously.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial products I have ever used!!  Leaves my skin so soft and smoothe.  Use it twuce a week to exfoiate and you&#x27;ll see!  I&#x27;ve suggested it to several friends and they all totally agree with me!  We all love it and will contnue to order!!</li>
            <li> Finally recieved it!&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I purchase this product and I highly recommend it. I will be buying this product after I am done with this one again.&lt;br /&gt;(I had already removed the plastic wrapping on the product.)</li>
            <li> I REALLY like this stuff. Works a charm, non irritating, simple, cleasnsed all the tiny blackheads on my nose right off (as nothing else had)</li>
            <li> Amazing. Normally, my skin doesn&#x27;t respond all that great to standard exfoliators. They get off some of the dead skin, but stubborn, flaky just stick there. This got off all my flakes. I also put a dab on a callous on the pal of my hand and it dissolved it enough that I could just rub it off. It&#x27;s pretty freaking incredible. And no irritation. Kinda blows my mind.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Makes my skin feel so soft afterwards</li>
            <li> I used this before and had no problem. But the one I received wasn&#x27;t clear gel. The gel was white and milky. When I applied the gel it supposed to exfoliate. This one seems like a fake one. No peeling at all. Just a white sandy particles came out. I can tell the difference between skin and other things. I have used this before but this one wasn&#x27;t the same gel I used before. Either the it&#x27; fake or expired product. Will not buy again from this seller</li>
            <li> the best exfoilation product i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this stuff! I don&#x27;t know how it works and honestly, I don&#x27;t care. My face is pretty sensitive to face products, my face either breaks out or dries out if I use the wrong one. I do have to put some lotion on after I use it, but that&#x27;s all it takes. I&#x27;ve gotten a few people hooked on it too! The instructions are all in Japanese, but it&#x27;s easy to just look them up online. Seriously, try this stuff out. Your face will be silky smooth afterwards! I don&#x27;t really use it anywhere but my face, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works for the body. But I will always have a bottle on hand now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I know why its the number one selling exfoliator...its awesome. Yes all sorts of white balls of dead skin forms during the massage but you skin feels so soft and looks so good afterward. This stuff is a must!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I am surprised how good it is!</li>
            <li> Rather unusual treatment product. Liquid is easy to apply and massage into skin. Other users have posted comments saying particles that result are skin being exfoliated.  I don&#x27;t think thesese particles are skin. However, after using as directef, my skin is smooth and feels as if I&#x27;ve had a professional facial. Very glad I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> when I gradually use it, the skin statred to regulate itself, it is very amazing and I do not have to use scrabs as often as before.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clean :) it really helps for my clogged pores &amp; dead skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s awesome.  I usually use it every time I shower so it can be used more than once a week.  My biggest worry was if the bottle would break during its travel and the packaging was good and safe and fast too!</li>
            <li> This is such a good product. I use it 2-3 times a week. It removes dead skin cells. My face looks brighter and fresh every time I use it.</li>
            <li> This  is the best skincare product that I have ever tried ! After using this product it really makes your skin feel cleaner and not just on your face ! I had my husband  apply around may&#x27;be four pumps to my back which to me always feels icky . I always wear my bra very tight because I need the support but when I felt all that dead skin coming off I couldn&#x27;t believe how dramatic my skin changed ! It went from rough ,dry and slightly dark to being soft , smooth and lighter ! I think that the price of this product is worth every penny....it doesn&#x27;t have a ton of horrible chemicals put into it ! It does have a very slight alcohol type smell but it&#x27;s very faint and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all . I will keep buying this because it does what it says and feels great !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this stuff works, but I love it! It is very gentle, but works better than any other exfoliant I have ever tried. The dead skin just rolls right off of your face. Sounds scary, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt or damage your skin at all and my skin is so soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> This works. I understand how it would be easy to be skeptical, but it works. I went on vacation to the Caribbean and my skin was very dry and tanning. I used this at the end of my vacation and wow, I had never seen so much skin come off--it was more than I had seen using it in the past, and additional proof that it actually works. I have pretty good skin to begin with, but I just like knowing all my dead skin is gone... It makes my skin very soft and I have recommended it to a couple people already. Definitely worth checking out!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to exfoliate my face. Once applied, all the dead skin just peels off your face when you&#x27;re rubbing the product in. Afterwards, your skin becomes soft and baby smooth. I was expecting my face to dry out, but it was fine. If it does, try putting on a toner afterwards. No wonder this is a best seller in Japan!</li>
            <li> Love this exfoliator!  I was weary of it at first but it just sloughs off any dead skin easily.  Even works well on sun burned areas that are peeling!</li>
            <li> Love this gel, just like professional facial at the salon. Skin is nice and soft after it, you can see for sure top layer of the skin is gone and it feels so fresh.</li>
            <li> best exfoliator ever. hands down. you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> this really does do a great job at exfoliating dead skin off your face. This product doesn&#x27;t have any promotional vids or anything but has been a best seller in japan through word of mouth, just like how i found out about the product.</li>
            <li> My colleague turned me onto this.  She&#x27;s in her early 30s with fantastic skin.  She told me I should use it and (in my early 40s) I took one look at her skin and agreed.  It&#x27;s done wonders for me.  I will continue to order this product from here on out.  A gentle exfoliant that peels off dead layers of skin with just the tips of your fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No harsh brushes, just the tips of your fingers is all you need.  I use it at night and slather on a good night cream and it&#x27;s doing wonders for my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller sent the item quickly as well.  I ordered this a couple of months ago and use it about two to three times a week and am half way through the bottle - so you get a lot of value for your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more exfoliators and really didn&#x27;t know one way or the other if they were actually removing dead skin.  With this,...you actually see the dead skin coming off and I&#x27;ve found nothing that compares to it! I have a few microdermabrasion systems, and not one of them works like this simple gel, while using your own fingers instead of a machine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those products that is actually \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot;! You can see the dead skin clumping up into little balls and then you just rinse them away. Sounds disgusting, but the stuff gets the job done and it doesn&#x27;t hurt or irritate me in the least. I have sensitive skin and was hesitant to even purchase this, but glad I did. I try using it every day, maybe missing a day or two here and there and have never experienced redness or even the slightest bit of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your moisturizer/serums etc. and makeup go on and look much better. I was wasting expensive creams/serums etc. moisturizing dead, dull skin,....and that&#x27;s something I won&#x27;t be doing anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my fourth bottle and a little goes a long way. A bottle lasts me a little over two months, but I just don&#x27;t apply it to my face and neck. I also use it on my arms, hands, chest and every now and then on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I wish it was less expensive? Absolutely, then every inch on me would be sloughed of dead skin cells! But if you just use it for your face and neck a few times a week, a bottle should last over 3 months or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be put off by the lack of English directions. There are so many great videos on YouTube showing how to use it, but you really don&#x27;t even need to watch one. Just apply a couple of pumps of gel to the face or wherever you want to slough off the dead skin,....wait about a minute and rub in a circular motion with two or three fingers. You will feel and see little white balls, which is the dead skin dulling the complexion. Rinse off and apply your moisturizer. It is aquick process that couldn&#x27;t be easier, and best of all,...it works!</li>
            <li> THIS CAUSED MY ACNE PROBLEMS! HOLY SH--</li>
