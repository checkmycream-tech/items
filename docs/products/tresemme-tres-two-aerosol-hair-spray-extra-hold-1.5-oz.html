            <li> As expected, this product by Treseme performed perfectly!  It has an excellent scent, and the travel size fits into a purse perfectly.  I intend to purchase again!  Highly recommend....</li>
            <li> I used to  pay $28 for Salon spray that I thought was the best hairspray, but then I found Tresemme. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t get stiff and sticky, and my hair looks much better. I won&#x27;t ever pay those high prices again</li>
            <li> My favorite hair spray</li>
            <li> Specifically bought this to go through airport security when travelling.  A very convenient size.  Also I find the hairspray works extremely well with a slight application.</li>
            <li> I keep one of these in my desk drawer at work in case I need some extra hold. It&#x27;s small and easy to carry around on the go, and the hold is pretty good. Just don&#x27;t expect it to hold up to anything too demanding.</li>
            <li> Great hold. Best hairspray for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel. Exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Nice hairspray.  Not sticky and holds hair in place.  Nothing outstanding.</li>
            <li> Average product - extremely overpriced!</li>
            <li> Had to buy a travel size because I was flying to Boston.  So I thought I could get it cheaper on line.  Wrong.  Walmart has the same size for $1.00.  However, I did like the hairspray.  I would buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least ten years. This is a travel size that is perfect for purse or office desk drawer for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> I ordered this small size because the spray is perfect.  I tossed out the larger size because the spray nozzle did not work well.</li>
            <li> [t was small..for the price</li>
            <li> I like this brand, it hold very well and this is a great travel size</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I has going on an overnight airplane trip. The 1.5 oz size allows it to be in carry-on luggage per the TSA. The produce itself is fine. I did misread the heading for the product and thought I was getting two of the containers. Actually, &amp;#34;Two&amp;#34; is part of the product description and not the quantity. Later I found the identical product at target for much less than I paid online.</li>
            <li> Wow I thought this was gonna be a regular size can of hair spray..nope. it&#x27;s travel size. It&#x27;s mini. Not worth the price. I&#x27;m very unhappy I can get a can at the store for same price and a lot more spray.</li>
            <li> Tresemme is one of the better hair sprays that I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and sticky with that unnatural shiny look.  It works really well.  It does need to be reapplied during the day, but that is a small trade off.  There is no nasty smell, either, like some hair sprays have.  It holds my hair in place and looks natural.  I really like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> i RECEIVED THE TRESEMME EXTRA FIRM/HOLD CONTROL AEROSOL HAIR SPRAY PROMPTLY AND IN PERFECT CONDITION! I WILL NEVER BE WITHOUT THIS PERFECT SIZE HAIR SPRAY IN MY PURSE AGAIN!</li>
