            <li>My Dad has worn this scent for many years.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite cologne in the world</li>
            <li>Glad it is available through Amazon!</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite aftershave/cologne.  </li>
            <li>And most importantly: be appealing to women.  </li>
            <li>This is potent stuff that lasts.  </li>
            <li>Have used this musk for years and love it.</li>
            <li>Ladies love it.  </li>
            <li>Ok so my family thinks I have an aftershave addiction....</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, would recommend and I will buy again soon.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for twenty five years or more to my satisfaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still my favorite scent.....</li>
            <li>This smells like it&#x27;s appropriate for men 60</li>
            <li>I love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this musk.</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more money elsewhere.</li>
            <li>As advertised, it&#x27;s my favorite after shave, I&#x27;ve been using Jovan for many years.</li>
            <li>Quality product i love it.</li>
            <li>Just found out I can get the deodorant to the most wearable cologne I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, woman love it on me.</li>
            <li>The scent is so much better than the Jovan Musk you buy in stores now.</li>
            <li>More like a cologne than after shave and would recommend all males to try this product</li>
            <li>I will never tell, that way there will be more for me.</li>
            <li>I am so glad to get it.</li>
            <li>The top is more like a salad dressing bottle.</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>always love this...excellent price</li>
            <li>the thing that I like most about it is that for a man&#x27;s fragrance, it is not overpowering like most men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years; the ladies love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend who uses it daily--he appreciates that the formula has remained the same--Amazon offers it at a good price!</li>
            <li>It is a very clean, yet musky scent that holds up well throughout the day, but is not overpoweringly strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts a long time, and it is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>My Dad will enjoy this, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent, works with my body chemistry for a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>and you were good for the whole day.</li>
            <li>it has a nice fresh scent that seems to fade, but if u smell your skin, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The lucky ones like me it smells great and the women really like it.</li>
            <li>NOT over powering, VERY nice scent &amp; Never gets old, Real lovely scent to it , stay nice &amp; long on skin  ..</li>
            <li>Gift for my husband - not too strong.</li>
            <li>Fast service, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper here and packaging for shipment was fine.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was fine.  </li>
            <li>As for a product, I note, very resistant and pleasant I began to smell, I think to the Russian girls it very much to be pleasant.</li>
            <li>Little does she know, this is the best aftershave you can get.</li>
            <li>It has a very manly sent and is nice for the price.</li>
            <li>I saved $6 on each and bought 3 to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li>it is a good scent for old men, so I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>was a scam, not the real Jovan Musk, don&#x27;t ever buy from them!!!</li>
            <li>Just a wonderful product and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try to bounce it off the tile floor in the bathroom, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that if it were dropped, it wouldn&#x27;t even chip.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years, and this is the best value I have found, it is usually $15.00 + in brick and mortar stores,this is for the 4 oz.</li>
            <li>wife says Jovan smell very nice and very clean on me even with heavy sweat</li>
            <li>Jovan Musk was similar to what I remembered and wife loved it once again.</li>
            <li>I cant say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li>Frequently receive comments regarding the nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, I will use just the cologne, if I find a good value for it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good a product today as it was back then.</li>
            <li>I  am very pleased and the bottle was larger than expected so very pleased in deed and will buy more as soon as this is gone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m started using this Jovan Musk  since my freshman year in High school back in 84 &amp; still using it off &amp; on for 30 years now, GREAT Cologne, is smooth ..</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh scent</li>
            <li>great product, big saving, fast delivery, will recommend to others</li>
            <li>It came well-packed and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>, one does not need much and if you had some on your clothes, on day two it is even better than it was the first day..</li>
            <li>Shipping was real fast.  </li>
            <li>I am constantly being ask by women what kind of Cologne I am wearing.  </li>
            <li>JOVAN has a fragrance which is exciting but never wears off.</li>
            <li>My favorite for nearly 40 years.</li>
            <li>By far the most  compliments I get come when I wear this musk......</li>
            <li>(smile).  </li>
            <li>I used jovan musk years ago and liked it ( brings back memories ).</li>
            <li>years - fragrance is pleasant and light - not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many musks; however, Jovan is the only musk that has significantly reduced the number of in-grown hairs on my face.</li>
            <li>was right.  </li>
            <li>The cologone hits the right balance of strength and fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a scent that I never tire of and one that dances with the natural scent of a man, mingling until a new, almost euphoric scent emerges still true to the man wearing it yet smoldering with sexual undertones of musky yumminess.</li>
            <li>Smells good and it is about half price of buying this product in stores.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Ordering this one from Amazon is the first time this has happened.  </li>
            <li>Buying this in the stores is pretty spendy.  </li>
            <li>Used to use this back in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.. stopped for many years until I found it again</li>
            <li>He has worn it since before we got married 32 years ago</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>wonderful, and fast shipment will purchase again, but I misplaced to 10% off next purchase coupon which is an added plus!</li>
            <li>The 15 oz bottle sold in stores sell for more than this larger bottle does!!</li>
            <li>the cologne is light orange colour, which make skin little bit tan:)</li>
            <li>With this latest purchase, the scent is barely noticeable when first applied and completely gone in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It was as good as the same product you buy at a local retailer and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I always (at least once a day) get such nice compliments from women and men alike about how nice I smell while wearing Jovan Musk.</li>
            <li>I like the mild aroma to the cologne, not heavy or &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; like others.</li>
            <li>I have no game.</li>
            <li>, thanks to Jovan musk</li>
            <li>I really like Jovan Musk and the price</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The response time is unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li>Smell is alright, but quality of aftershave is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It is OK, not really my preference.</li>
            <li>price was very competive.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell musky to me . . .</li>
            <li>Very disapointed with product so watered almost no smell will never buy again this product from amazon again period</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very soothing to the skin after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it seems to age very well..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to apply that way.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li>Very manly and not over powering</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it</li>
            <li>therefore I ask to excuse me for my English as I own it</li>
            <li>Smells strong for the first 15-20 minutes then settles down</li>
            <li>It lasts me a long time but God willing I&#x27;ll be ordering it again in the future. :-)</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming musk with a warm comforting smell that draws you into it.  </li>
            <li>this was by far the best price - about $10 less than he usually pays</li>
            <li>Although the fancy department stores call it \\&quot;toilet water\\&quot;, it has never disappointed me.</li>
            <li>price was excellent but the scent is so subtle that it makes me wonder if it is maybe watered down?  </li>
            <li>He is old now and it think it reminds him of the first time he wore it in high school.</li>
            <li>I am the son -in-law moms hope for, and its all thanks to my new bottle of musk.</li>
            <li>It has a slight musk smell some men can not handle the musky smell it will go on ok then smell like your dog rolled in the road kill.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li>Decent stuff for decent price.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t realize how large the bottle is, probably cant see the screen, so he was super excited as it was larger than expected...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this cologne to anyone I know.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to certain scents.  </li>
            <li>I loved this brand musk as a teen and young adult and now into my mid life mid fifties</li>
            <li>if you and I are at a bar, stay upwind of me...or you&#x27;ll go home longing for the company of the women that flocked to me while you sat there in your new snazzy just-ripped-enough gucci jeans, yet smelling just meh.</li>
            <li>It was good to see Amazon has it in the 8 ounce bottle because it is hard to find in local stores in anything but the 3 ounce spray bottles.  </li>
            <li>I usually get this from Wal-Mart, but this is a much better deal.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor try a small bottle; I bet you buy more.</li>
            <li>I am using Jovan products for several years and recently i brought this product assuming original but</li>
            <li>SO expensive in other places, this was a great deal!</li>
            <li>This is the only scent I have ever worn that consistently elicits favorable comments.</li>
            <li>Free shipping and the price is less than Walmart or K-Mart.  </li>
            <li>I was also driving a convertible when dating my wife and today I use Jovan Musk when driving my Honda S2000 as my daily driver and for promoting my [...] website while traveling with my top down.</li>
            <li>He just recently told me that he opened it and used it right away, but that there was barely any scent at all</li>
            <li>I have fond memories of this Aftershave Cologne, but I like a more subtle smell now a days in my older years.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and it was brand new as expected.</li>
            <li>I look for the large size and it will last for months.  </li>
            <li>The original aroma for half the price</li>
            <li>They clearly changed the formula.  </li>
            <li>I through my Old Spice by Dana in the trash.</li>
            <li>I bought this wanting a masculine scent that is still doable for a young guy (I&#x27;m 22).</li>
            <li>Modestly priced at $17.00 or 18.00 delivered.</li>
            <li>Some may say old fashioned.</li>
            <li>I know it came out in the early 1970&#x27;s a friend of mine worked for the company and gave me a box of their products</li>
            <li>My roommate thought this was cologne and said that I smelled like an old man.</li>
            <li>Its becoming more difficult to find since it has been around so long.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product being sold at a low price.</li>
            <li>And just because it last all day does not mean it&#x27;s over powering, it just has staying power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used no other after shave since.</li>
            <li>The deals available on line are hard to pass up.</li>
            <li>I used differnt other colognes never like them as much as jovan</li>
            <li>We had a bit left of the old stuff and compared it to this recent purchase.  </li>
            <li>After purchasing some Brut and Jade East knock offs of 1960&#x27;s products which were weak and only lasted three minutes, I did research on cologne for Men that would be potent and last a long time.  </li>

            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> My Dad has worn this scent for many years.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite cologne in the world</li>
            <li> Glad it is available through Amazon!</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite aftershave/cologne.  </li>
            <li> And most importantly: be appealing to women.  </li>
            <li> This is potent stuff that lasts.  </li>
            <li> Have used this musk for years and love it.</li>
            <li> Ladies love it.  </li>
            <li> Ok so my family thinks I have an aftershave addiction....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, would recommend and I will buy again soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for twenty five years or more to my satisfaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still my favorite scent.....</li>
            <li> This smells like it&#x27;s appropriate for men 60</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this musk.</li>
            <li> I have paid a lot more money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> As advertised, it&#x27;s my favorite after shave, I&#x27;ve been using Jovan for many years.</li>
            <li> Quality product i love it.</li>
            <li> Just found out I can get the deodorant to the most wearable cologne I have ever worn.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, woman love it on me.</li>
            <li> The scent is so much better than the Jovan Musk you buy in stores now.</li>
            <li> More like a cologne than after shave and would recommend all males to try this product</li>
            <li> I will never tell, that way there will be more for me.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to get it.</li>
            <li> The top is more like a salad dressing bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> always love this...excellent price</li>
            <li> the thing that I like most about it is that for a man&#x27;s fragrance, it is not overpowering like most men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years; the ladies love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who uses it daily--he appreciates that the formula has remained the same--Amazon offers it at a good price!</li>
            <li> It is a very clean, yet musky scent that holds up well throughout the day, but is not overpoweringly strong.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time, and it is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> My Dad will enjoy this, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent, works with my body chemistry for a fantastic scent.</li>
            <li> and you were good for the whole day.</li>
            <li> it has a nice fresh scent that seems to fade, but if u smell your skin, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The lucky ones like me it smells great and the women really like it.</li>
            <li> NOT over powering, VERY nice scent &amp; Never gets old, Real lovely scent to it , stay nice &amp; long on skin  ..</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband - not too strong.</li>
            <li> Fast service, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper here and packaging for shipment was fine.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was fine.  </li>
            <li> As for a product, I note, very resistant and pleasant I began to smell, I think to the Russian girls it very much to be pleasant.</li>
            <li> Little does she know, this is the best aftershave you can get.</li>
            <li> It has a very manly sent and is nice for the price.</li>
            <li> I saved $6 on each and bought 3 to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li> it is a good scent for old men, so I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> was a scam, not the real Jovan Musk, don&#x27;t ever buy from them!!!</li>
            <li> Just a wonderful product and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try to bounce it off the tile floor in the bathroom, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that if it were dropped, it wouldn&#x27;t even chip.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and this is the best value I have found, it is usually $15.00 + in brick and mortar stores,this is for the 4 oz.</li>
            <li> wife says Jovan smell very nice and very clean on me even with heavy sweat</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk was similar to what I remembered and wife loved it once again.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li> Frequently receive comments regarding the nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I will use just the cologne, if I find a good value for it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good a product today as it was back then.</li>
            <li> I  am very pleased and the bottle was larger than expected so very pleased in deed and will buy more as soon as this is gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m started using this Jovan Musk  since my freshman year in High school back in 84 &amp; still using it off &amp; on for 30 years now, GREAT Cologne, is smooth ..</li>
            <li> Clean and fresh scent</li>
            <li> great product, big saving, fast delivery, will recommend to others</li>
            <li> It came well-packed and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> , one does not need much and if you had some on your clothes, on day two it is even better than it was the first day..</li>
            <li> Shipping was real fast.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly being ask by women what kind of Cologne I am wearing.  </li>
            <li> JOVAN has a fragrance which is exciting but never wears off.</li>
            <li> My favorite for nearly 40 years.</li>
            <li> By far the most  compliments I get come when I wear this musk......</li>
            <li> (smile).  </li>
            <li> I used jovan musk years ago and liked it ( brings back memories ).</li>
            <li> years - fragrance is pleasant and light - not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many musks; however, Jovan is the only musk that has significantly reduced the number of in-grown hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> was right.  </li>
            <li> The cologone hits the right balance of strength and fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scent that I never tire of and one that dances with the natural scent of a man, mingling until a new, almost euphoric scent emerges still true to the man wearing it yet smoldering with sexual undertones of musky yumminess.</li>
            <li> Smells good and it is about half price of buying this product in stores.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ordering this one from Amazon is the first time this has happened.  </li>
            <li> Buying this in the stores is pretty spendy.  </li>
            <li> Used to use this back in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.. stopped for many years until I found it again</li>
            <li> He has worn it since before we got married 32 years ago</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> wonderful, and fast shipment will purchase again, but I misplaced to 10% off next purchase coupon which is an added plus!</li>
            <li> The 15 oz bottle sold in stores sell for more than this larger bottle does!!</li>
            <li> the cologne is light orange colour, which make skin little bit tan:)</li>
            <li> With this latest purchase, the scent is barely noticeable when first applied and completely gone in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It was as good as the same product you buy at a local retailer and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I always (at least once a day) get such nice compliments from women and men alike about how nice I smell while wearing Jovan Musk.</li>
            <li> I like the mild aroma to the cologne, not heavy or &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; like others.</li>
            <li> I have no game.</li>
            <li> , thanks to Jovan musk</li>
            <li> I really like Jovan Musk and the price</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The response time is unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li> Smell is alright, but quality of aftershave is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is OK, not really my preference.</li>
            <li> price was very competive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell musky to me . . .</li>
            <li> Very disapointed with product so watered almost no smell will never buy again this product from amazon again period</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very soothing to the skin after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seems to age very well..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to apply that way.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> Very manly and not over powering</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it</li>
            <li> therefore I ask to excuse me for my English as I own it</li>
            <li> Smells strong for the first 15-20 minutes then settles down</li>
            <li> It lasts me a long time but God willing I&#x27;ll be ordering it again in the future. :-)</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming musk with a warm comforting smell that draws you into it.  </li>
            <li> this was by far the best price - about $10 less than he usually pays</li>
            <li> Although the fancy department stores call it \\&quot;toilet water\\&quot;, it has never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> price was excellent but the scent is so subtle that it makes me wonder if it is maybe watered down?  </li>
            <li> He is old now and it think it reminds him of the first time he wore it in high school.</li>
            <li> I am the son -in-law moms hope for, and its all thanks to my new bottle of musk.</li>
            <li> It has a slight musk smell some men can not handle the musky smell it will go on ok then smell like your dog rolled in the road kill.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> Decent stuff for decent price.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t realize how large the bottle is, probably cant see the screen, so he was super excited as it was larger than expected...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this cologne to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to certain scents.  </li>
            <li> I loved this brand musk as a teen and young adult and now into my mid life mid fifties</li>
            <li> if you and I are at a bar, stay upwind of me...or you&#x27;ll go home longing for the company of the women that flocked to me while you sat there in your new snazzy just-ripped-enough gucci jeans, yet smelling just meh.</li>
            <li> It was good to see Amazon has it in the 8 ounce bottle because it is hard to find in local stores in anything but the 3 ounce spray bottles.  </li>
            <li> I usually get this from Wal-Mart, but this is a much better deal.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor try a small bottle; I bet you buy more.</li>
            <li> I am using Jovan products for several years and recently i brought this product assuming original but</li>
            <li> SO expensive in other places, this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I have ever worn that consistently elicits favorable comments.</li>
            <li> Free shipping and the price is less than Walmart or K-Mart.  </li>
            <li> I was also driving a convertible when dating my wife and today I use Jovan Musk when driving my Honda S2000 as my daily driver and for promoting my [...] website while traveling with my top down.</li>
            <li> He just recently told me that he opened it and used it right away, but that there was barely any scent at all</li>
            <li> I have fond memories of this Aftershave Cologne, but I like a more subtle smell now a days in my older years.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and it was brand new as expected.</li>
            <li> I look for the large size and it will last for months.  </li>
            <li> The original aroma for half the price</li>
            <li> They clearly changed the formula.  </li>
            <li> I through my Old Spice by Dana in the trash.</li>
            <li> I bought this wanting a masculine scent that is still doable for a young guy (I&#x27;m 22).</li>
            <li> Modestly priced at $17.00 or 18.00 delivered.</li>
            <li> Some may say old fashioned.</li>
            <li> I know it came out in the early 1970&#x27;s a friend of mine worked for the company and gave me a box of their products</li>
            <li> My roommate thought this was cologne and said that I smelled like an old man.</li>
            <li> Its becoming more difficult to find since it has been around so long.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality product being sold at a low price.</li>
            <li> And just because it last all day does not mean it&#x27;s over powering, it just has staying power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used no other after shave since.</li>
            <li> The deals available on line are hard to pass up.</li>
            <li> I used differnt other colognes never like them as much as jovan</li>
            <li> We had a bit left of the old stuff and compared it to this recent purchase.  </li>
            <li> After purchasing some Brut and Jade East knock offs of 1960&#x27;s products which were weak and only lasted three minutes, I did research on cologne for Men that would be potent and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> start off with small amount one day and slowly increase until you find the right amount when you get complements, but not enough to where to scaring people away with too much.</li>
            <li> It also does a good job of cutting down on afterburn.</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk is the one and it is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t splash this on every day before heading for the office, this eight ounce bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She did compliment some other stuff I purchased (stronger, but more expensive for a smaller amount).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a cabinet full of big name, expensive colognes I&#x27;ve had for ten years.</li>
            <li> and what he could smell was completely gone after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I been long time customer and if the product never changes will contiune too use it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what i expected, others might be reviewing different product or i got just a fluke</li>
            <li> /&gt;the odor lingers long after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34</li>
            <li> As long as I have known him, my husband has worn Jovan Musk.  </li>
            <li> I think I will be with Jovan for a long time....</li>
            <li> I note that there are other reviews of this product that say the same thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell for very long woun&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> Back in the day, just one little splash</li>
            <li> Not the same as what I bought a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I am partial to Jovan and have been for years.  </li>
            <li> aftershave was what i expected.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for years - usually buying it at local drug stores --  </li>
            <li> my son who passed away due to an accident  always wore this</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t want it any other way.  </li>
            <li> This is not the same scent as it was in years past.  </li>
            <li> Small town price on this product is the same as Amazon for HALF the product.  </li>
            <li> My father only wears the Jovan Musk, at his age he is hard to shop for...</li>
            <li> I really hate the way Amazon has a demand on how many I should use to review a product -</li>
            <li> They must have watered it down with additional alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Much less</li>
            <li> Your price is a lot less.  </li>
            <li> after using I found it is NOT original fragrance.</li>
            <li> I must be one of few men in the area that use Jovan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> becuase it does what few mens colognes do.</li>
            <li> I checked Amazon &amp; was surprised to find it $13 less expensive!</li>
            <li> I am not a sexy guy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure everyone around me likes it</li>
            <li> We usually would get in past from a drugstore.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at Wal*Mart</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s quite expensive and the store and lots of times they only have a smaller bottle because it&#x27;s so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I usually order it two to three times per year.</li>
            <li> it and a bottle of Tequilla just plain WORK with the ladies!</li>
            <li> You can use it over long years without you or the people around you getting bored by it.</li>
            <li> The scent is terrible and doesn&#x27;t last long at all; about as long as unscented hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This is my uncle and it is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very thick, heavy glass bottle, so there is no concern about it breaking.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for 35 years, and at least 3&#x3D;4 times per week for all that time I have had some woman or another tell me how good/sexy it smells.</li>
            <li> pour this into a very small spray bottle and spray it on.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, not too subtle.</li>
            <li> water .thi product is no good  </li>
            <li> , I AM GAME.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY</li>
            <li> so watered down,it&#x27;s scentless, useless  </li>
            <li> However, my wife never gave me a compliment, which means she was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> We have tried purchasing it from different places and all are this awful stench.  </li>
            <li> Sad...</li>
            <li> That concerning the price, can really slightly expensively, but after all, these goods of it cost.</li>
            <li> Be afraid guys...</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years and the ladies go crazy for this sent.</li>
            <li> He hadn&#x27;t told me about this sooner because he didn&#x27;t want me to feel badly about buying a bad aftershave for him.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying this product from retail stores for all of the years he has been using it, and never bought a bad bottle.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I am not a sexy guy. I have no game. I am the guy you almost wish could just get laid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, thanks to Jovan musk, I AM GAME. Ladies love me. Grandmothers want me to marry their granddaughters. I am the son -in-law moms hope for, and its all thanks to my new bottle of musk. Be afraid guys... if you and I are at a bar, stay upwind of me...or you&#x27;ll go home longing for the company of the women that flocked to me while you sat there in your new snazzy just-ripped-enough gucci jeans, yet smelling just meh. Then, when you ask one of the rejected ladies what it was about me they found irresistable, they will tell you something to the effect of....&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; I just loved the way he smelled...so,  so....manly.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I&#x27;ve written this review and I&#x27;m doing it again so I can stop looking at the product in my history.  It&#x27;s cheaper here and packaging for shipment was fine.  No problem.  Would order it again except my husband moved out last week, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it anymore.  Now publish this review and get it out of my sight.  Seriously, it&#x27;s good to order it here.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  Now we don&#x27;t have to look for it in store.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> My favorite (and my wife&#x27;s favorite) cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for years - usually buying it at local drug stores --  this was by far the best price - about $10 less than he usually pays so we are happy.</li>
            <li> I always loved the smell of this cologne ..my son who passed away due to an accident  always wore this and i loved the smell now as I a purposing marriage I thought I would  buy it for my future husband... I  am very pleased and the bottle was larger than expected so very pleased in deed and will buy more as soon as this is gone</li>
            <li> I really like Jovan Musk and the price was right.  I am constantly being ask by women what kind of Cologne I am wearing.  Jovan Musk is the one and it is long lasting.  This 8 ounce bottle will last me quite a while.  Thanks Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Been using Jovan Musk for years and I love its fragrance.</li>
            <li> The original aroma for half the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure everyone around me likes it but I&#x27;ve been using it over thirty years :-)</li>
            <li> great product, big saving, fast delivery, will recommend to others</li>
            <li> Same stuff I&#x27;ve used for 25+ years and I didn&#x27;t have to drive around trying to find a store that sells it.  It lasts me a long time but God willing I&#x27;ll be ordering it again in the future. :-)</li>
            <li> Great delivery time and quality</li>
            <li> For the twenty years that I&#x27;ve known him, my husband has only worn Jovan Musk.  I&#x27;ve now bought enough to last him for several years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell for very long woun&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> took a chance and do not like how it smells at all - yuk!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my scent and at a good price.  &#x3D; 5 stars</li>
            <li> Second generation fan of this after shave for over 40 years. Would not use anything else and I always stock up when I find a good price.</li>
            <li> It was as good as the same product you buy at a local retailer and much cheaper.  My husband always tells me to order it when he is starting to use the last bottle.  The response time is unbelievably fast.</li>
            <li> Not the same as what I bought a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Once again I smell better then I look and not like swet anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 30 years.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell. Not too overpowering or offensive to anybody. Stays on for 4-5 hours.  Decent stuff for decent price.</li>
            <li> I usually get this from Wal-Mart, but this is a much better deal. My husband has worn this for years and it is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Great prices &amp;amp; fast shipping for my favorite cologne! It&#x27;s a great deal on a manly aroma!!</li>
            <li> Free shipping and the price is less than Walmart or K-Mart.  Packaging was good - no leaks or breakage.  Have purchased this for my Son for years - fragrance is pleasant and light - not overwhelming.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my Dad; it&#x27;s his staple cologne/aftershave.  It came well-packed and shipped quickly.  My Dad will enjoy this, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Great product delivered on time.</li>
            <li> JOVAN has a fragrance which is exciting but never wears off. You can use it over long years without you or the people around you getting bored by it. The women just love it. And I do, too...</li>
            <li> Ordered for a friend and he was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband, who has used this aftershave for over 20+ years and we both love the scent.  He just recently told me that he opened it and used it right away, but that there was barely any scent at all and what he could smell was completely gone after a few minutes.  He hadn&#x27;t told me about this sooner because he didn&#x27;t want me to feel badly about buying a bad aftershave for him.  I was wondering why he wasn&#x27;t using this aftershave and why I didn&#x27;t smell it on him anymore.  I have been buying this product from retail stores for all of the years he has been using it, and never bought a bad bottle.  Ordering this one from Amazon is the first time this has happened.  I note that there are other reviews of this product that say the same thing.  Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> THIS MY HUSBAND&#x27;S FAVOURITE COLOGNE.  UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE TO ORDER TO DELIVER IN THE US AND I WILL HAVE TO PICK IE UP WHENEVER WE GO BACK TO THE STATES.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Fast Shipping !</li>
            <li> My dad-in-law was about out of the Jovan cologne. We usually would get in past from a drugstore. It&#x27;s more expensive! I checked Amazon &amp; was surprised to find it $13 less expensive! I love the scent. Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> jovan has always made a good product for men I do get a lot of good remarks from women when I have this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cologne on</li>
            <li> I am in my 20&#x27;s. I bought to try it out, it moisturizing and the cologne is light orange colour, which make skin little bit tan:) Smell is alright, but quality of aftershave is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Also i thought it would be like a spray bottle but its not, one has to put on hand and massage into skin.</li>
            <li> It is OK, not really my preference.</li>
            <li> My Dad has worn this scent for many years.  I buy this for him every Christmas it seems.  He loves it so I love it!</li>
            <li> I been using this colonge since 1975 at the age of sixteen,so that tells you what i think of this cologne.I used differnt other colognes never like them as much as jovan I been long time customer and if the product never changes will contiune too use it.</li>
            <li> My favorite for nearly 40 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for over 40 years! It never goes out of style and this is THE lowest price - anywhere (even Wal-Mart can&#x27;t touch the Amazon price)...plus my wife loves how it smells on me!</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a long time, and it is very pleasant. It has always worked for me and I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> It has a very manly sent and is nice for the price.Not my favorite cologne in the world but if you want affordable and practical this is the cologne for you.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a product that my husband has used for many years.</li>
            <li> I am partial to Jovan and have been for years.  Buying this in the stores is pretty spendy.  The deals available on line are hard to pass up.</li>
            <li> I bought this aftershave/cologne for my husband when we met 38 years ago and he has worn nothing else since.  To this day, he still continues to get compliments on it.  He never gets dressed without putting some on and I wouldn&#x27;t want it any other way.  Its becoming more difficult to find since it has been around so long.  Glad it is available through Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product is great I have been using it for years. &lt;br /&gt;The price was very competive. EB</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas present in 2001 and have been buying and using this since then. It depends on one&#x27;s taste of course but I love it.</li>
            <li> this is not perfume.this is alcohol en water .thi product is no good  esto no es perfume es solo alcohol y agua con colorante.xk no uele a nada nomas huele a alcohol. never  order this perfume again tankyou</li>
            <li> Great company to work with...will be buying all fragrance needs from them...thank you again..brought back memories when I was a kid</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite aftershave/cologne.  He has used it for years and years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It doesn&#x27;t really smell musky to me . . . it&#x27;s light and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> After purchasing some Brut and Jade East knock offs of 1960&#x27;s products which were weak and only lasted three minutes, I did research on cologne for Men that would be potent and last a long time.  And most importantly: be appealing to women.  Jovan Musk works all day!  This is potent stuff that lasts.  Best on the market.  Coty Aspen is second choice.  Calvin Klein Obesession, third.  This gives variety and selection... I like to go Ball Room Dancing and also do the Polka at German Park.  Cologne must work!  I like to smell cologne when I get home not sweaty smelly clothes.  My clothes even smell like cologne when I get home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given up on locating Jade East by Swank, Regency and Songo do not make Jade East like Swank did in the 1960&#x27;s.  I through my Old Spice by Dana in the trash.</li>
            <li> been using this product for years and will not not not not use anything else this is all that I use</li>
            <li> My husband and I are big Jovan Musk fans. Always a seductive scent.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and it was brand new as expected. I will keep buying from this source as it&#x27;s still the best value sround..</li>
            <li> Have used this musk for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I must be one of few men in the area that use Jovan. I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few compliments from the ladies. I like the mild aroma to the cologne, not heavy or &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; like others.</li>
            <li> The best guys cologne ever.  Ladies love it.  BIG bargain compared to stinky designer cologne prices.  Do yourself a favor try a small bottle; I bet you buy more.</li>
            <li> Have always loved the smell of this aftershave. Not overpowering, not too subtle.</li>
            <li> Ok so my family thinks I have an aftershave addiction....and it&#x27;s true :^). But in all seriousness this stuff smells great! I recently bought a 4oz bottle from Wal-Mart for the same price as this one and this one is 8oz. I will be buying here next time. Jovan may not be for everyone but let me tell you this stuff last! And just because it last all day does not mean it&#x27;s over powering, it just has staying power. And after a while it works with your own body chemistry. And for me this stuff works perfectly with my own body chemistry. Love this stuff, would recommend and I will buy again soon. Why am I just now discovering this stuff is still a mystery to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who uses it daily--he appreciates that the formula has remained the same--Amazon offers it at a good price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what i expected, others might be reviewing different product or i got just a fluke so watered down,it&#x27;s scentless, useless  hopefully they can let me return it.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent and you get a lot for your money. I would highly recommend this cologne to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jovan Musk since it came out. It has always been my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; scent. This is not what I remember. Back in the day, just one little splash and you were good for the whole day. With this latest purchase, the scent is barely noticeable when first applied and completely gone in 10 minutes. And of course, it&#x27;s non-returnable. Stay away!</li>
            <li> I thought this was fine.  However, my wife never gave me a compliment, which means she was not impressed.  I did not buy it to impress myself.  She did compliment some other stuff I purchased (stronger, but more expensive for a smaller amount).  I thought it was a 4, she probably would give it a 2, so I averaged it out at 3.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed with product so watered almost no smell will never buy again this product from amazon again period</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for twenty five years or more to my satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very soothing to the skin after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;the odor lingers long after applying.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; I like your cologne&amp;#34; remarks by strangers and females is encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;My wife likes it. A must</li>
            <li> I used Jovan Musk back in the 70&#x27;s when dating my now wife of 34 years. I do not know if it was the Jovan Musk or my leather jacket...but it Worked! Jovan Musk was similar to what I remembered and wife loved it once again. The Jovan Musk is similar to the 70&#x27;s product in my opinion. I was also driving a convertible when dating my wife and today I use Jovan Musk when driving my Honda S2000 as my daily driver and for promoting my [...] website while traveling with my top down. My wife Still Smiles!</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for 36 years and will until the furnace is fired up</li>
            <li> Used to use this back in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s.. stopped for many years until I found it again and it is still as great as it was then, one does not need much and if you had some on your clothes, on day two it is even better than it was the first day..&lt;br /&gt; it seems to age very well.. I did transfer it into smaller bottles as 8 oz is quite a lot,&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I loved this brand musk as a teen and young adult and now into my mid life mid fifties and it&#x27;s still my favorite scent..... By far the most  compliments I get come when I wear this musk...... Excellent keep up the great work Jovan.....</li>
            <li> I have fond memories of this Aftershave Cologne, but I like a more subtle smell now a days in my older years.</li>
            <li> I bought this wanting a masculine scent that is still doable for a young guy (I&#x27;m 22). This smells like it&#x27;s appropriate for men 60+. No man under the age of 50 could ever pull this off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is a good scent for old men, so I give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;fragrance sensitivity&amp;#34; (aka perfume allergy) and never had an issue with Jovan musk before.  They clearly changed the formula.  What a shame.</li>
            <li> I am using Jovan products for several years and recently i brought this product assuming original but after using I found it is NOT original fragrance. I was disappointed with this product and I wont buy this product again from this site.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s cologne.  He has worn it since before we got married 32 years ago and I associate the smell of this with him.  I love this cologne.  And when I found it here on Amazon at such a great price I was happy and so is my husband.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this at Wal*Mart but they keep it under lock and key.  It&#x27;s such a big deal for the store to get someone over to unlock the cabinet that I just decided to start ordering online.  Much less stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pour this into a very small spray bottle and spray it on.  It&#x27;s much easier to apply that way.  It&#x27;s a few dollars cheaper on Amazon anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Wally, it&#x27;s your loss.</li>
            <li> This is not the same scent as it was in years past.  We have tried purchasing it from different places and all are this awful stench.  We had a bit left of the old stuff and compared it to this recent purchase.  Definitely not the same.  Sad...</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this for 20+ years, he was wearing it the day we met and probably played a big part on how that day played out. It&#x27;s a scent that I never tire of and one that dances with the natural scent of a man, mingling until a new, almost euphoric scent emerges still true to the man wearing it yet smoldering with sexual undertones of musky yumminess. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Jovan for years.  Now it&#x27;s quite expensive and the store and lots of times they only have a smaller bottle because it&#x27;s so expensive.  Your price is a lot less.  We get 2 a time.</li>
            <li> Modestly priced at $17.00 or 18.00 delivered. Nice scent too. Repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> aftershave was what i expected. Jovan series of after shaves are one I use all the time. Clean and fresh scent</li>
            <li> Small town price on this product is the same as Amazon for HALF the product.  This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> price was excellent but the scent is so subtle that it makes me wonder if it is maybe watered down?  My husband puts it on and I cannot even smell it... ?  Not the strength that we remember it being ?</li>
            <li> Im a construction worker and this is great. Not the best but get compliments once in a while. Than again, im not dressing up to go to a party.&lt;br /&gt;Cheapest on amazon.</li>
            <li> was a scam, not the real Jovan Musk, don&#x27;t ever buy from them!!!</li>
            <li> Store quit carrying it.  Got the same product, twice the size for about the same price.  Always been my favorite!</li>
            <li> My all time fav for my man!</li>
            <li> Just a wonderful product and the price is unbelievable. Will always by from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> My father loved this gift and uses it every day!  SO expensive in other places, this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> well packaged and good price</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this for 40 years now. Some may say old fashioned. i say it isn&#x27;t, becuase it does what few mens colognes do. It doesn&#x27;t mask a mans scentl, it compliments it. He has tried others on occasion but both he and I have always prefered Jovan musk.cologne.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS FOR OVER 20 YEARS.  IT JUST GOES WITH MY SKIN.  GOOD PRODUCT.  HOPE THEY NEVER QUIT MAKING IT</li>
            <li> The price was right,the product is excellent and it was shipped right away.Have used this product for years and received manycompliments on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time ,item just as described and everyone loves it cant wait to go On a date with someone +</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product since the 70s and he smells wonderful.  I have purchased him some newer more expensive aftershave over the years, but some have caused allergic reactions.  I&#x27;m sensitive to certain scents.  We always come back to this product.</li>
            <li> I from Russia therefore I ask to excuse me for my English as I own it not so well at once. As for a product, I note, very resistant and pleasant I began to smell, I think to the Russian girls it very much to be pleasant. In Russia of such product isn&#x27;t present. That concerning the price, can really slightly expensively, but after all, these goods of it cost. The choice carried out from reviews of goods. I took at once 2 pieces. Thanks to the seller.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than it said, which is always a good thing! Good price for a good product, the smell is quite gratifying &amp; stays for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> I love this musk. Shipping was real fast.  I have paid a lot more money elsewhere. I was almost out when i found this price.  will buy again.</li>
            <li> My brother wears only Jovan Musk for a after shave &amp; cologne. Smells so good. I try to keep him supplied at holiday time.</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband - not too strong. Very nice.</li>
            <li> As advertised, it&#x27;s my favorite after shave, I&#x27;ve been using Jovan for many years. I&#x27;ll order again when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough good things about this. I have been wearing this for years and the ladies go crazy for this sent. Quality product i love it.</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great for every day use in the office. Very manly and not over powering</li>
            <li> fast shipping. my husband loved it</li>
            <li> Been using for over 30 years. It&#x27;s a part of me.</li>
            <li> Smells great , lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m started using this Jovan Musk  since my freshman year in High school back in 84 &amp; still using it off &amp; on for 30 years now, GREAT Cologne, is smooth ..NOT over powering, VERY nice scent &amp; Never gets old, Real lovely scent to it , stay nice &amp; long on skin  ..I&#x27;m still buying it, using it to this day &amp; age &amp; I&#x27;ll bet NEVER stop using this old flame!!&lt;br /&gt;GREAT &amp; Unforgettable product  &amp; still going STRONG after many decades!!!</li>
            <li> Great product at a GREAT Price.</li>
            <li> People always tell me I smell good. This is the reason.</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk for men is a product that works for me, per others comments.  I have used this product for 40+ years.</li>
            <li> Received everything just as they said. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It has a slight musk smell some men can not handle the musky smell it will go on ok then smell like your dog rolled in the road kill.&lt;br /&gt;BUT that only happens to some. The lucky ones like me it smells great and the women really like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Jovan Musk for Men for probably forty years and am often complimented on the scent.  It is a very clean, yet musky scent that holds up well throughout the day, but is not overpoweringly strong.  It was good to see Amazon has it in the 8 ounce bottle because it is hard to find in local stores in anything but the 3 ounce spray bottles.  Now that I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t splash this on every day before heading for the office, this eight ounce bottle will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very thick, heavy glass bottle, so there is no concern about it breaking.  I wouldn&#x27;t try to bounce it off the tile floor in the bathroom, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that if it were dropped, it wouldn&#x27;t even chip.</li>
            <li> Jovan is what a cologne should be.  After the initial application, I can not tell I am wearing it.  Frequently receive comments regarding the nice fragrance.  Have been using Jovan for years.  So far Amazon has the best price.  I look for the large size and it will last for months.  Always keep an extra bottle on hand, so I don&#x27;t run out.  Occasionally, I will use just the cologne, if I find a good value for it.  Otherwise the Aftershave/Cologne is great by itself.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; great service.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 30 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;Still smells the same to me.</li>
            <li> Just found out I can get the deodorant to the most wearable cologne I have ever worn. This cologne has been my scent for years I know it came out in the early 1970&#x27;s a friend of mine worked for the company and gave me a box of their products and I have been hooked from that day my kids look around to see if I&#x27;m there when they smell it  somewhere. I work in a field that put&#x27;s me around a lot of people I sweat a lot and I get people who tell me how nice I smell when I&#x27;m soaked in sweat my friends wife says Jovan smell very nice and very clean on me even with heavy sweat she says it gets a stronger nicer scent then. Plus I have always had people ask what cologne I wear and that they find it very pleasant to stand near me one of my daughters steals my pillow when she gets the chance because she says it smells like me, I will occasionally spray her pillow and she hugs and gives me a kiss for it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, girlfriend loves it too.  Not overwhelming musk with a warm comforting smell that draws you into it.  Smells strong for the first 15-20 minutes then settles down and you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot of it start off with small amount one day and slowly increase until you find the right amount when you get complements, but not enough to where to scaring people away with too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a cabinet full of big name, expensive colognes I&#x27;ve had for ten years. This is the only scent I have ever worn that consistently elicits favorable comments.</li>
            <li> wonderful, and fast shipment will purchase again, but I misplaced to 10% off next purchase coupon which is an added plus! (smile).  great purchase</li>
            <li> The source worked wonders to meet my request. Would use them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. I love the way it smells on him. Would definitly buy this for him again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, woman love it on me. I really hate the way Amazon has a demand on how many I should use to review a product - What a bunch of horse pucky!!!</li>
            <li> I used jovan musk years ago and liked it ( brings back memories ). Jovan For Men. Aftershave Cologne 8 Ounces try it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and this is the best value I have found, it is usually $15.00 + in brick and mortar stores,this is for the 4 oz. size. The product&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon is for the 8 oz size therefore it is 33 percent cheaper.</li>
            <li> As long as I have known him, my husband has worn Jovan Musk.  Although the fancy department stores call it \\&quot;toilet water\\&quot;, it has never disappointed me.</li>
            <li> They must have watered it down with additional alcohol.  The scent is terrible and doesn&#x27;t last long at all; about as long as unscented hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I like this it smells good</li>
            <li> Big fan if Jovan musk. The cologone hits the right balance of strength and fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used this Aftershave Cologne my entire life and have got used to it. This is a high quality product being sold at a low price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 30 years and this is the BEST price I have ever seen for it. Keep up the great work.</li>
            <li> This  Musk has that wonderful scent that Jovan Musk used to have 10 years ago. The scent is so much better than the Jovan Musk you buy in stores now.</li>
            <li> Very good deal for the money. Fast service, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff! He is old now and it think it reminds him of the first time he wore it in high school. He didn&#x27;t realize how large the bottle is, probably cant see the screen, so he was super excited as it was larger than expected...well aren&#x27;t we all!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent, works with my body chemistry for a fantastic scent. More like a cologne than after shave and would recommend all males to try this product</li>
            <li> This is my secreat scent and everyone coments on what it is...... I will never tell, that way there will be more for me.</li>
            <li> This is my uncle and it is getting hard to find. I am so glad to get it. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> My father only wears the Jovan Musk, at his age he is hard to shop for...this made a nice addition to his gifts</li>
            <li> I am a creature of habit and have been using this product for over 20 years. I saved $6 on each and bought 3 to get the free shipping.</li>
            <li> The bottle does not have a spritzer/atomizer.  The top is more like a salad dressing bottle. It smells wonderful and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> For me is at Yovan a very good product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and at a nice price. I love it . Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Very good value. Smells good and it is about half price of buying this product in stores. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a Great price!  The 15 oz bottle sold in stores sell for more than this larger bottle does!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 35 years, and at least 3&#x3D;4 times per week for all that time I have had some woman or another tell me how good/sexy it smells. It does not smell that good on everyone, but for me....it and a bottle of Tequilla just plain WORK with the ladies!</li>
            <li> always love this...excellent price</li>
            <li> Nice, great price and delivered promptly!</li>
            <li> Great deal, way cheaper than the stores</li>
            <li> I always (at least once a day) get such nice compliments from women and men alike about how nice I smell while wearing Jovan Musk. I love the smell and everyone says it blends perfectly with my skin to provide a natural sexy scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many musks; however, Jovan is the only musk that has significantly reduced the number of in-grown hairs on my face. I think I will be with Jovan for a long time....</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Just like I remember it.</li>
            <li> this is a great fragrance that i&#x27;ve worn for years. the thing that I like most about it is that for a man&#x27;s fragrance, it is not overpowering like most men&#x27;s cologne. it has a nice fresh scent that seems to fade, but if u smell your skin, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My roommate thought this was cologne and said that I smelled like an old man. Little does she know, this is the best aftershave you can get. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin look oily or shiny, and in the bar people will think you smell like rich mahogany, which is great if you&#x27;re well versed in Ron Burgundy catch phrases. It also does a good job of cutting down on afterburn.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years; the ladies love it.</li>
            <li> I received Jovan as a gift for Father&#x27;s Day from one of my kids.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving I applied it and couldn&#x27;t believe the pleasant sensation and aroma it had.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used no other after shave since.</li>
            <li> Since this is my dad&#x27;s favorite and only cologne, I can never go wrong in purchasing it. I usually order it two to three times per year.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this scent &amp; my husband was happy to get a new bottle. We were very satisfied with product and shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 40years. It&#x27;s as good a product today as it was back then.</li>
