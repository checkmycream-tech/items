            <li>Love love.</li>
            <li>Wore in Vegas matched all my peacock clothing and got many compliments.</li>
            <li>This is more than teal, though.</li>
            <li>I love OPI and have purchased many bottles of their nail polish over the years.</li>
            <li>I collect nail polish, and OPI is my favorite brand.  </li>
            <li>This is a really attention-getting color, which is not my thing!</li>
            <li>and so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>AS THE PIC and more )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love giving myself a pedicure with this.</li>
            <li>In my opinion China Glaze is a better quality nail Polish than OPI.</li>
            <li>I will use this seller again and recommend you try them as well.  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m soooooooooo happy for having this nail polish, NO REGRETS :)</li>
            <li>Not as pretty as in the picture no matter how much top coat you paint on!</li>
            <li>and I am excited to wear it some more.</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty color for spring!  </li>
            <li>Very Pretty color!</li>
            <li>( my skin tone is between medium and light )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too bright, it seems to have just enough saturated pigment to look very rich in color.  </li>
            <li>The color is so pretty for hands and toes :)  </li>
            <li>Color wasn&#x27;t true to pictures.</li>
            <li>you cant go wrong with opi, this is a great color for anyone i just wished that they sold more nice colors in a combo kit to purchace in the true 5oz.</li>
            <li>love this product fast delivery</li>
            <li>I received it quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>This was a limited edition super cute color that I have enjoyed wearing.</li>
            <li>Purchased this polish and have totally fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>This color is soooo pretty when you put it on!</li>
            <li>Rich,bright and AMAZING teal blue (</li>
            <li>When my doctor pulled back the covers to check the pulse in my feet he says \\&quot;wow, great color\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Right away I tried it on my toenails</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as described</li>
            <li>and I got a lot of comments on it the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>Compliments any skin tone and comes in a stellar series of polishes.</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Deadly stylish and requires ONLY one fully coat, the formula is 10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cute one toes, did a hot pink middle toe with this color lots of fun!  </li>
            <li>I have always loved different shades of blue but this one is just \\&quot;Special\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Can easily be worn dressed up or down (which is important to me).  </li>
            <li>Such a special catchy color!</li>
            <li>I Use this then Go over it With \\&quot;pURE Ice\\&quot; in- \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li>It really pops..</li>
            <li>there are other Better polishes.</li>
            <li>OPI is worth the cost as it last without chipping.</li>
            <li>I had a pedicure right before going in the hospital to have a medical procedure.</li>
            <li>This is the first nail color that I have received SEVERAL compliments on.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it if you are looking for something different from all of the reds and pinks people normally wear!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a dull flat color unless you plan to jazz it up with another color or don&#x27;t mind adding five gallons of top coat!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more hard to find colors on amazon.</li>
            <li>This color is not just for the young ladies out there, I am older and recommend it to anyone looking for a break from the usual, but still wants to look \\&quot;classy and fun\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It came quickly, but the bottle was screwed on so tightly that I had to get my dad to open it for me.</li>
            <li>I do love the \\&quot;fun colors\\&quot; other ladies wear, I feel silly when I attempt it.  </li>
            <li>The one I got, I was expecting better, but it goes on thin and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stand on very long (despite putting a clear coat overtop of the nail polish).</li>

            <li> I have always been a fan of red on myself.  I feel it always looks pulled together.  I do love the \\&quot;fun colors\\&quot; other ladies wear, I feel silly when I attempt it.  I have tried several \\&quot;fun colors\\&quot; in the past, they are not usually very pretty or flattering to my skin or hands.  This one however hit the mark!!!!  I get compliments all the time when I wear it.  The coverage is great, I think it would definitely look great on all skin tones.  It&#x27;s not too bright, it seems to have just enough saturated pigment to look very rich in color.  Can easily be worn dressed up or down (which is important to me).  This color is not just for the young ladies out there, I am older and recommend it to anyone looking for a break from the usual, but still wants to look \\&quot;classy and fun\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Color wasn&#x27;t true to pictures. I&#x27;m over OPI there are other Better polishes. Shipped and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this OPI nail polish. It looks exactly as described and I got a lot of comments on it the first time I wore it. I would highly recommend it if you are looking for something different from all of the reds and pinks people normally wear!</li>
            <li> Love the color and OPI did not disappoint. Polish is good quality and doesnt thicken up over time. Good price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this polish and have totally fell in love with it! I have always loved different shades of blue but this one is just \\&quot;Special\\&quot;. Just one coat and you are good to go! Compliments any skin tone and comes in a stellar series of polishes. Great Job OPI and Nicki!</li>
            <li> Love it. I actually thought I was getting both colors judging by the picture.</li>
            <li> Love love. Very cute one toes, did a hot pink middle toe with this color lots of fun!  Wore in Vegas matched all my peacock clothing and got many compliments.</li>
            <li> This is more than teal, though. It&#x27;s really rich and just damn beautiful. And if you have any version of Happy Birthday - multi-colored glitter polish - it looks fantastic on top of this polish!</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty for hands and toes :)  It goes and stays on great.  I am now obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Right away I tried it on my toenails and it&#x27;s just a gorgeous color. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love OPI and have purchased many bottles of their nail polish over the years. This was a limited edition super cute color that I have enjoyed wearing. I will definitely buy more hard to find colors on amazon.</li>
            <li> just the best color ever! goes with everything! TIP! It really pops.. The whole Nikki Minaj OPI Line is AWESOME! I Use this then Go over it With \\&quot;pURE Ice\\&quot; in- \\&quot;Oh Baby\\&quot; its Great!</li>
            <li> Not as pretty as in the picture no matter how much top coat you paint on! It&#x27;s just a dull flat color unless you plan to jazz it up with another color or don&#x27;t mind adding five gallons of top coat!</li>
            <li> I have been on a blue/green kick for months and this color was definitely one I needed because of it. It&#x27;s a great summer shade, bright, but not ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I collect nail polish, and OPI is my favorite brand.  When I saw that Nicki Minaj had a line of colors, I knew I had to get some.  This one applies like a dream and is a beautiful teal color.  I don&#x27;t usually wear teals/turquoises but now I have an excuse to.  I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on this color and I am excited to wear it some more.</li>
            <li> This is a good color to wear when you want to show off your funky side. But definitely not your typical color.</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong with opi, this is a great color for anyone i just wished that they sold more nice colors in a combo kit to purchace in the true 5oz.</li>
            <li> Love OPI nail polish!  This is a very pretty color for spring!  OPI is worth the cost as it last without chipping.</li>
            <li> Darker than I imagined</li>
            <li> I looked online and had a hard time finding a picture of the nail polish because in the picture, there were two. I was expecting the shimmer one and I got the other nail polish. The one I got, I was expecting better, but it goes on thin and the nail polish doesn&#x27;t stand on very long (despite putting a clear coat overtop of the nail polish). Save your money or buy the same color from a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is a really attention-getting color, which is not my thing! It was an excellent value and the service was great, OPI is the best polish I have used. This color was impossible for me to find locally and I was very pleased to be able to give it a try.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I was a little unsure about the color. I took it with me to the nail shop and told the nail tech that I was unsure about it. Well she convinced me to give it a try and so glad that I did. This is the first nail color that I have received SEVERAL compliments on. I had a pedicure right before going in the hospital to have a medical procedure. When my doctor pulled back the covers to check the pulse in my feet he says \\&quot;wow, great color\\&quot;. I&#x27;m telling you it was a hit! Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> This color is soooo pretty when you put it on! Its an amazing color only problem I had was that it stained my nails when I took it off :/...other than that I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> love this product fast delivery</li>
            <li> ( my skin tone is between medium and light )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Rich,bright and AMAZING teal blue ( AS THE PIC and more )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Deadly stylish and requires ONLY one fully coat, the formula is 10/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Such a special catchy color! When I wear it, A LOT of girls give me that ( wow ) look in there faces :D&lt;br /&gt;( makes me like I&#x27;m the most beautiful girl in the world XD )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m soooooooooo happy for having this nail polish, NO REGRETS :)</li>
            <li> Very Pretty color! I love giving myself a pedicure with this. In my opinion China Glaze is a better quality nail Polish than OPI. Considering the fact that CG is cheaper and manufactured by OPI, it is weird that CG is the better polish.</li>
            <li> It came quickly, but the bottle was screwed on so tightly that I had to get my dad to open it for me. It is a very nice teal color.</li>
            <li> daugther loves anything Nicki!!</li>
            <li> Fly is not as bright as pictured. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the turnout. There has to be different variations of this product. It&#x27;s way darker than pictured.</li>
            <li> I saw this color and loved it.  I was able to purchase this produce at a great price, honestly the best price.  I received it quickly as well.  I will use this seller again and recommend you try them as well.  :)</li>
