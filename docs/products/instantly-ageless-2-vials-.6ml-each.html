            <li>Works amazing.</li>
            <li>This would be an amazing product if there were some way to cover up any trace of the application.</li>
            <li>Amazing Product.</li>
            <li>The difference is amazing</li>
            <li>This product works amazingly and now I dont have to cake on makeup to try to cover the circles under my eyes, I let others try</li>
            <li>It is nice to wear when you do not want to use a lot of makeup but still look nice.  </li>
            <li>I am over 65 and have fairly nice skin. .</li>
            <li>Honest didn&#x27;t even see a change.</li>
            <li>Really worked and was great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you have to get pictures and is a quick fix.  </li>
            <li>Yes I ordered more to give it one more shot!</li>
            <li>would recommend to anyone very good and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Works great until you smile</li>
            <li>OH my goodness I love love love this!</li>
            <li>so i was happy about that because I have been really wanting to try it!</li>
            <li>If it sounds too good to be true, it is.  </li>
            <li>I was able to feel the stretch, but when I asked family members if my eyes were still puffy, they said yes.  </li>
            <li>Product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and i watched it work its magic in a minute.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work on top of makeup.</li>
            <li>Needs to be packaged better.</li>
            <li>When I did my make-up, was able to use whatever I wanted without a problem with caking/flaking I have read in some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It should be against the law to be able to lie about this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I would have gladly become a member of Jeunesse just for this product, but it did not do as promised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy anything more than samples.</li>
            <li>For me I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I was ok.  </li>
            <li>I have puffiness under my eyes and was happy to try this product , I put it on and within 2 minutes saw the puffiness dissapear and was very excitied about it  </li>
            <li>and they all looked so much better within minutes.  </li>
            <li>I am ordering more.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>Ok soooo, this cream does work BUT there are caveats.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wIt to get more.</li>
            <li>Worked fabulously!</li>
            <li>Have had many people state</li>
            <li>But if you put cream over top afterwards it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li>Really only 3 applications at best.</li>
            <li>Wish I could afford more.</li>
            <li>It was &#x27;ok&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>For me, I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li>So many nurses at work want it too.</li>
            <li>you can NOT apply your make up over the top of this stuff.</li>
            <li>even if you don&#x27;t wear makeup you better keep a frozen emotionless face.</li>
            <li>You can not raisinate your skin and expect to look better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>im glad I didn&#x27;t order the bottle,.would not buy more</li>
            <li>like this packaging better than the sachets.</li>
            <li>and I got a better result</li>
            <li>Did not find this to work magically as it appeared in the video reviews I watched.  </li>
            <li>I want more.</li>
            <li>, I am so excited, this is what we have all been waiting for, Now is the time to join, I have tried MCA, ACN,Body Body by Vi, but this product is amazing,</li>
            <li>But the results really are amazing!</li>
            <li>Worked as good as the video I first saw for both myself and my daughter.  </li>
            <li>This was truly the best thing I have bought in a long time!</li>
            <li>Sure wish I hadn&#x27;t laughed so much  (NOT).  </li>
            <li>When you smile you have more wrinkles than you did before you put it on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I sampled before I bought a huge amount.</li>
            <li>I refer so many people, customer service is huge with the 40 Plus crowd.  </li>
            <li>They also make great skincare products for acne which work well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do not yet know how good the product is, but the description is very deceiving.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was a permanent fix, but for those special &amp;#34;photo shot&amp;#34; times, this works!</li>
            <li>More affordable price for us not so rich people that have kids.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so glad that I didn&#x27;t buy the full size box.</li>
            <li>Product takes away the bags under the eyes and reduces fine lines and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>so I know the product should have been fine.</li>
            <li>so people could get a fair price buying it directly from me!</li>
            <li>Maybe if you don&#x27;t use moisturizer, don&#x27;t eat, don&#x27;t talk, and don&#x27;t smile, you might have OK results.</li>
            <li>and I would tell anyone its definitely worth a try because if it works for you , you will love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy there is finally a product out that you can see the difference immediately!</li>
            <li>With all this said, I have been testing on what type of lotion works best with the eye cream as well as trying to get the cream to not look as &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; after it dried.</li>
            <li>It even came with helpful instructions on how to use the product but by that point I&#x27;d watched every youtube video available</li>
            <li>Looked like I&#x27;d been in a bar fight and to add insult to injury, the product had finally dried, perfectly preserving said welts, swelling, and puffiness in all of their non moving, glued on glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I only bought a sample.  </li>
            <li>but when I put my makeup on over it , it didn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was putting it on right or</li>
            <li>If a company says they have something to get rid of eye bags, it is an absolute falsehood aka LIE!!!  </li>
            <li>The only thing I see this good for is if you want a good photogenic but just don&#x27;t smile until you get ready to take the picture.</li>
            <li>Instantly Ageless works amazing if you apply it correctly!</li>
            <li>the results were nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>I was all excited.  </li>
            <li>Significant difference.</li>
            <li>I wish her much success!</li>
            <li>When you smile, it will create millions wrinkles under your eye where you have this cream!</li>
            <li>Glad it didn&#x27;t cost much!</li>
            <li>Because I smile alot and don&#x27;t remain expressionless most of the time, I don&#x27;t think this product is right for me.</li>
            <li>I used it on fine smile lines and it seemed to fade them</li>
            <li>I am actually surprised the overall rating isn&#x27;t better, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it worked great for me</li>
            <li>Bought a full box after my sample</li>
            <li>+ on a full order without knowing what the results would be.</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t buy the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>If you never move your face or for a quick selfie (haha), it might be ok...</li>
            <li>think somethings that work well for other people is not for everyone,but if it works for you then great</li>
            <li>and when you apply this cream and it dries up as a cement plaster, it create a lot of creases when you smile, talk or laugh!</li>
            <li>product came quickly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for the mild under eye bags I have.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty certain I&#x27;d be able to apply the product correctly.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see the videos and the dramatic results that I thought this was the perfect product for me...</li>
            <li>Definitely  buying more!</li>
            <li>Overall well worth it and better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>I was disappointed…product works great for the 1st few minutes, but once you apply moisturizer or makeup the effect goes away..</li>
            <li>This cream is advertised and sold promising customers smooth under eyes</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and actuall works and last along time.</li>
            <li>and now I became a rep Amazing Instant Results, check it out</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>its so worth it.</li>
            <li>But it was worth a try ....</li>
            <li>Figured I might be wasting my money, but turns out, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>and you should squint of smile</li>
            <li>, I used it on my forehead wrinkles and under my eye and laugh lines on the sides of my mouth</li>
            <li>not what it states, wasn&#x27;t worth buying at all</li>
            <li>It was fun to ru.</li>
            <li>Erases wrinkles until you smile</li>
            <li>It worked for me the very first time, but then I read tons of reviews and watched tutorials first.  </li>
            <li>Spend 16 dollars to find out if yours is the right situatuon.  </li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>There was a differnece right after applying this</li>
            <li>exactly right one time where I felt the &#x27;bag&#x27; was not visible any longer.  </li>
            <li>So I just got this in the mail, it arrived super fast</li>
            <li>I received this item very fast.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really does work as shown in the video!</li>
            <li>It did work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>But this stuff is really really what it says!</li>
            <li>However, a couple of seconds later, my eyes looked better....</li>
            <li>For each person I would advise to test it first.  </li>
            <li>First purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li>Pretty amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I put moisturizer on first and then the IA.  </li>
            <li>First there were no directions.</li>
            <li>I did exactly like they said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only bought 2 vials.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only bought two vials.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>Glad I only purchased two vials instead of 25.</li>
            <li>Truth is, I looked better before using Instantly Ageless.</li>
            <li>I attempted to cover up the area with concealer but only made the crust-like product more noticeable.</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>This is the first thing that has done the trick besides injections.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not fake</li>
            <li>Exactly as seen and advertised</li>
            <li>I TRIED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME &amp; COULDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with puffy eyes and dark circles since I was young so after seeing the video thought it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>happened next can only be described as &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34;, but not for good reasons.</li>
            <li>If you want to use makeup over it, give it 10 minutes or so to make sure it is completely dry and done working.  </li>
            <li>MAkes the appearance of more wrinkles and dry</li>
            <li>Well....it certainly tightens the skin just as the video shows.</li>
            <li>The product itself did not assist me because I do not have LARGE bags.  </li>
            <li>Also it needs to be left fairly damp and let it air dry, don&#x27;t rub it in.</li>
            <li>The serum works great but the tube size is to small and allows serum to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>really works....</li>
            <li>The first day, I washed my face and used my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Too much shows a crustyness.</li>
            <li>Amazon made it possible to check out this product for cheap and speedy 2-day delivery.  </li>
            <li>This product did not work much at all for me.</li>
            <li>it is too much money for the 2 samples.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just hold really still.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.did not work at all</li>
            <li>It really works..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t kno if I used to much or what</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and reliable...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s REALLY WORKS,  </li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I had to use way too much product (in fact 3X</li>
            <li>Affordable and ready to use as soon as you receive it.</li>
            <li>I just got it, and it came much quicker than it said it would ..</li>
            <li>Was very upset how this product came to me.</li>
            <li>Really works</li>
            <li>The second application doesn&#x27;t seem to go one as smoothly.</li>
            <li>I do agree with alot of the reviews that I read that too much makes it look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I applied it as directed, fanned it and remained emotionless and it dried with a matte look and very noticeable when I smiled it made me look like I had wrinkles under my eyes</li>
            <li>As soon as you apply concealer or foundation over the top you get INSTANTLY AGED by 20 years!</li>
            <li>I am not interested in buying any more.</li>
            <li>Is great for instantly getting rid of puffiness  temporarily, but use just a small  bit.  </li>
            <li>But then I saw all of the buzz around Instantly Ageless and the demonstrations seemed pretty compelling.</li>
            <li>but for only a very short time so if you are planing to go t an acaition and look good without  puffy eyes or wrinkles it will last  for 5 minutes , I think it freezes the</li>
            <li>I put a small drop on my lower eye bags and, at first, I thought the product was making them more defined.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews on various sites before I purchased Instantly Ageless.  </li>
            <li>glad I bought a small amount first.</li>
            <li>and I had to wash several times to remove the super glue like texture from my skin.</li>
            <li>Making you look much older than before application.  </li>
            <li>I did try the product several different times to make sure I was applying it correctly.</li>
            <li>I also feel the price is too high for all the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; you have to do.</li>
            <li>Still, if I&#x27;m going on a date with the husband, it&#x27;s nice to not have the dark and baggy eyes!!!</li>
            <li>I am in my early 60&#x27;s and really wanted this two work.</li>
            <li>All it does is pull your skin taught for a few minutes and then after, accentuated the wrinkles even more.</li>
            <li>Once you smile, the wrinkles all look the same.</li>
            <li>Any time you smile or show any emotion tons of crinkles and wrinkles you never had in that area before will suddenly appear.</li>
            <li>I almost want to laugh and cry at the same time.</li>
            <li>but once you put makeup on, the bags come right back.</li>
            <li>Everytime a new MLM comes out</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li>It does feel kinda funny when it is tightening up but not a big deal for us.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this worked!</li>
            <li>At least with Botox, when you smile you do not see the original wrinkles.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my bags with no facial cream on, it did exactly as you see in the videos, they disappeared,</li>
            <li>however when you apply eye cream on top, it instantly went back to how I looked prior to application.  </li>
            <li>have to admit, I saw the videos and thought, &#x27;Wow!</li>
            <li>I placed a small amount of this pinkish cream like substance on to my ring finger, gingerly patted the product in, and waited for the magic to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It was very good, although it dry the skin a little bit; but other than that it does what it says it does!!</li>
            <li>It should be wet when you are done dabbing and then allow it to dry without touching it.  </li>
            <li>You will pay mostly for shipping and get 2 little foil (smaller than a sample size product) NOT THE VIAL SHOWN!!!!  </li>
            <li>Clearly says 2 vials</li>
            <li>My results were not as clear as the demonstration video for this product portrayed.</li>
            <li>The second tube - not so much.  </li>
            <li>Just designed for under the eye but daughter did try it on the upper eyelid but it pulled too much.  </li>
            <li>SO BUYER BEWARE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>and you do look very rested and younger.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much product to get areas you missed, it turns to a white film.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I was glad I at least tried 2 vials of it, but for the longer term, it would be cheaper to pay for the Botox shots.</li>
            <li>Definitely unexpected and unwelcomed results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s far from invisible, and as a guy</li>
            <li>so far it hasn&#x27;t worked at all.</li>
            <li>If you have white residue you are applying too much.</li>
            <li>But my friend said egg whites would do absolutely the same.</li>
            <li>Do you enjoy the sensation of a second degree sunburn without the hassle of actually going outside?</li>
            <li>AND IM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li>It only works if you really have bags under your eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving Instantly Ageless 3 stars because the product did not work for me but worked very well for my partner.</li>
            <li>The bags almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not that old looking yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just thankful that I only bought two vials to sample instead of the whole box.</li>
            <li>It works, but don&#x27;t put any foundation near where you are going to apply this, or the foundation cracks on your face.</li>
            <li>Very drying , not something you can use daily or under makeup</li>
            <li>Most I have read are negative because they didn&#x27;t apply it correctly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much safer than botox with the same results.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Tried using it on top of makeup, it dried white.</li>
            <li>When you twist off the top or cap and use some, the next day when you go to use it, is dried up.</li>
            <li>it only works untill you smile, turns white.. would not buy it again</li>
            <li>There are many over the counter products with the same ingredients for WAY LESS money!</li>
            <li>Been craving a way to make your skin actually appear older?</li>
            <li>I even tried again the next day and the results were exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The other thing I did not like was that when you smile, it makes extra crease lines that you don&#x27;t have normally.  </li>
            <li>This is a major rip off!</li>
            <li>Worked fast, and for a long time.</li>
            <li>The second day, I washed my face and applied my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>we are, five days after application, and most of the skin peeling has ceased and I only have one little red spot left from my experiment.</li>
            <li>All it did was leave a slightly tight feeling, and just like some others have commented, made a crepey, wrinkley look if I smile.  </li>
            <li>Open tube, pat on clean, dry wrinkled area, allow to air dry.</li>
            <li>Quickly becomes granular and is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So I was really hoping this would help out just like in those videos; but not much happened.  </li>
            <li>I am 56 years old presently.  </li>
            <li>Instantly Ageless ah yes who dose not want to look young again?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I applied to one eye, the difference was barely even noticeable.</li>
            <li>While my bags did disappear after it dried, within a couple of hours, regardless of what I did, my bags came back WITH more of an aged look than before applying the cream.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price to try it out but a total waste of time.</li>
            <li>I product did make the lines almost disappear but left a pink, crust-like, ashy residue that was very noticeable.</li>
            <li>This product is not a waste of money if you apply this properly, it&#x27;s not a permanent solution, its only temporary, up to 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a terrible product, but not a great one either</li>
            <li>Not so much for dark circles.</li>
            <li>The other key is not to use too much...</li>
            <li>The first tube dried up after using it once.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work but as previous reviews ... Very &amp;#34;Cakey&amp;#34; appearing when dries .</li>
            <li>It definitely works, but you have to be so careful to only use a small amount, not accidentally get it in your eyes, and it seems to highlight the fine lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li>My face was a little crusty to the touch (and I didnt use that much).  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this stuff, but it is just not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Really need to apply as little as possible to avoid the caking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad, I really wanted to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So good it has to be bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works amazing.</li>
            <li> This would be an amazing product if there were some way to cover up any trace of the application.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product.</li>
            <li> The difference is amazing</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly and now I dont have to cake on makeup to try to cover the circles under my eyes, I let others try</li>
            <li> It is nice to wear when you do not want to use a lot of makeup but still look nice.  </li>
            <li> I am over 65 and have fairly nice skin. .</li>
            <li> Honest didn&#x27;t even see a change.</li>
            <li> Really worked and was great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you have to get pictures and is a quick fix.  </li>
            <li> Yes I ordered more to give it one more shot!</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone very good and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Works great until you smile</li>
            <li> OH my goodness I love love love this!</li>
            <li> so i was happy about that because I have been really wanting to try it!</li>
            <li> If it sounds too good to be true, it is.  </li>
            <li> I was able to feel the stretch, but when I asked family members if my eyes were still puffy, they said yes.  </li>
            <li> Product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> and i watched it work its magic in a minute.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work on top of makeup.</li>
            <li> Needs to be packaged better.</li>
            <li> When I did my make-up, was able to use whatever I wanted without a problem with caking/flaking I have read in some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It should be against the law to be able to lie about this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I would have gladly become a member of Jeunesse just for this product, but it did not do as promised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy anything more than samples.</li>
            <li> For me I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I was ok.  </li>
            <li> I have puffiness under my eyes and was happy to try this product , I put it on and within 2 minutes saw the puffiness dissapear and was very excitied about it  </li>
            <li> and they all looked so much better within minutes.  </li>
            <li> I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> Ok soooo, this cream does work BUT there are caveats.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wIt to get more.</li>
            <li> Worked fabulously!</li>
            <li> Have had many people state</li>
            <li> But if you put cream over top afterwards it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Really only 3 applications at best.</li>
            <li> Wish I could afford more.</li>
            <li> It was &#x27;ok&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> For me, I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> So many nurses at work want it too.</li>
            <li> you can NOT apply your make up over the top of this stuff.</li>
            <li> even if you don&#x27;t wear makeup you better keep a frozen emotionless face.</li>
            <li> You can not raisinate your skin and expect to look better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> im glad I didn&#x27;t order the bottle,.would not buy more</li>
            <li> like this packaging better than the sachets.</li>
            <li> and I got a better result</li>
            <li> Did not find this to work magically as it appeared in the video reviews I watched.  </li>
            <li> I want more.</li>
            <li> , I am so excited, this is what we have all been waiting for, Now is the time to join, I have tried MCA, ACN,Body Body by Vi, but this product is amazing,</li>
            <li> But the results really are amazing!</li>
            <li> Worked as good as the video I first saw for both myself and my daughter.  </li>
            <li> This was truly the best thing I have bought in a long time!</li>
            <li> Sure wish I hadn&#x27;t laughed so much  (NOT).  </li>
            <li> When you smile you have more wrinkles than you did before you put it on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I sampled before I bought a huge amount.</li>
            <li> I refer so many people, customer service is huge with the 40 Plus crowd.  </li>
            <li> They also make great skincare products for acne which work well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do not yet know how good the product is, but the description is very deceiving.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a permanent fix, but for those special &amp;#34;photo shot&amp;#34; times, this works!</li>
            <li> More affordable price for us not so rich people that have kids.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so glad that I didn&#x27;t buy the full size box.</li>
            <li> Product takes away the bags under the eyes and reduces fine lines and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> so I know the product should have been fine.</li>
            <li> so people could get a fair price buying it directly from me!</li>
            <li> Maybe if you don&#x27;t use moisturizer, don&#x27;t eat, don&#x27;t talk, and don&#x27;t smile, you might have OK results.</li>
            <li> and I would tell anyone its definitely worth a try because if it works for you , you will love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy there is finally a product out that you can see the difference immediately!</li>
            <li> With all this said, I have been testing on what type of lotion works best with the eye cream as well as trying to get the cream to not look as &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; after it dried.</li>
            <li> It even came with helpful instructions on how to use the product but by that point I&#x27;d watched every youtube video available</li>
            <li> Looked like I&#x27;d been in a bar fight and to add insult to injury, the product had finally dried, perfectly preserving said welts, swelling, and puffiness in all of their non moving, glued on glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I only bought a sample.  </li>
            <li> but when I put my makeup on over it , it didn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was putting it on right or</li>
            <li> If a company says they have something to get rid of eye bags, it is an absolute falsehood aka LIE!!!  </li>
            <li> The only thing I see this good for is if you want a good photogenic but just don&#x27;t smile until you get ready to take the picture.</li>
            <li> Instantly Ageless works amazing if you apply it correctly!</li>
            <li> the results were nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> I was all excited.  </li>
            <li> Significant difference.</li>
            <li> I wish her much success!</li>
            <li> When you smile, it will create millions wrinkles under your eye where you have this cream!</li>
            <li> Glad it didn&#x27;t cost much!</li>
            <li> Because I smile alot and don&#x27;t remain expressionless most of the time, I don&#x27;t think this product is right for me.</li>
            <li> I used it on fine smile lines and it seemed to fade them</li>
            <li> I am actually surprised the overall rating isn&#x27;t better, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it worked great for me</li>
            <li> Bought a full box after my sample</li>
            <li> + on a full order without knowing what the results would be.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t buy the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> If you never move your face or for a quick selfie (haha), it might be ok...</li>
            <li> think somethings that work well for other people is not for everyone,but if it works for you then great</li>
            <li> and when you apply this cream and it dries up as a cement plaster, it create a lot of creases when you smile, talk or laugh!</li>
            <li> product came quickly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the mild under eye bags I have.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty certain I&#x27;d be able to apply the product correctly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see the videos and the dramatic results that I thought this was the perfect product for me...</li>
            <li> Definitely  buying more!</li>
            <li> Overall well worth it and better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed…product works great for the 1st few minutes, but once you apply moisturizer or makeup the effect goes away..</li>
            <li> This cream is advertised and sold promising customers smooth under eyes</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and actuall works and last along time.</li>
            <li> and now I became a rep Amazing Instant Results, check it out</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> its so worth it.</li>
            <li> But it was worth a try ....</li>
            <li> Figured I might be wasting my money, but turns out, it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> and you should squint of smile</li>
            <li> , I used it on my forehead wrinkles and under my eye and laugh lines on the sides of my mouth</li>
            <li> not what it states, wasn&#x27;t worth buying at all</li>
            <li> It was fun to ru.</li>
            <li> Erases wrinkles until you smile</li>
            <li> It worked for me the very first time, but then I read tons of reviews and watched tutorials first.  </li>
            <li> Spend 16 dollars to find out if yours is the right situatuon.  </li>
            <li> I was right.  </li>
            <li> There was a differnece right after applying this</li>
            <li> exactly right one time where I felt the &#x27;bag&#x27; was not visible any longer.  </li>
            <li> So I just got this in the mail, it arrived super fast</li>
            <li> I received this item very fast.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It really does work as shown in the video!</li>
            <li> It did work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff is really really what it says!</li>
            <li> However, a couple of seconds later, my eyes looked better....</li>
            <li> For each person I would advise to test it first.  </li>
            <li> First purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li> Pretty amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I put moisturizer on first and then the IA.  </li>
            <li> First there were no directions.</li>
            <li> I did exactly like they said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only bought 2 vials.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only bought two vials.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> Glad I only purchased two vials instead of 25.</li>
            <li> Truth is, I looked better before using Instantly Ageless.</li>
            <li> I attempted to cover up the area with concealer but only made the crust-like product more noticeable.</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> This is the first thing that has done the trick besides injections.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not fake</li>
            <li> Exactly as seen and advertised</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME &amp; COULDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with puffy eyes and dark circles since I was young so after seeing the video thought it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> happened next can only be described as &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34;, but not for good reasons.</li>
            <li> If you want to use makeup over it, give it 10 minutes or so to make sure it is completely dry and done working.  </li>
            <li> MAkes the appearance of more wrinkles and dry</li>
            <li> Well....it certainly tightens the skin just as the video shows.</li>
            <li> The product itself did not assist me because I do not have LARGE bags.  </li>
            <li> Also it needs to be left fairly damp and let it air dry, don&#x27;t rub it in.</li>
            <li> The serum works great but the tube size is to small and allows serum to dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> really works....</li>
            <li> The first day, I washed my face and used my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Too much shows a crustyness.</li>
            <li> Amazon made it possible to check out this product for cheap and speedy 2-day delivery.  </li>
            <li> This product did not work much at all for me.</li>
            <li> it is too much money for the 2 samples.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just hold really still.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.did not work at all</li>
            <li> It really works..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t kno if I used to much or what</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and reliable...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s REALLY WORKS,  </li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I had to use way too much product (in fact 3X</li>
            <li> Affordable and ready to use as soon as you receive it.</li>
            <li> I just got it, and it came much quicker than it said it would ..</li>
            <li> Was very upset how this product came to me.</li>
            <li> Really works</li>
            <li> The second application doesn&#x27;t seem to go one as smoothly.</li>
            <li> I do agree with alot of the reviews that I read that too much makes it look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I applied it as directed, fanned it and remained emotionless and it dried with a matte look and very noticeable when I smiled it made me look like I had wrinkles under my eyes</li>
            <li> As soon as you apply concealer or foundation over the top you get INSTANTLY AGED by 20 years!</li>
            <li> I am not interested in buying any more.</li>
            <li> Is great for instantly getting rid of puffiness  temporarily, but use just a small  bit.  </li>
            <li> But then I saw all of the buzz around Instantly Ageless and the demonstrations seemed pretty compelling.</li>
            <li> but for only a very short time so if you are planing to go t an acaition and look good without  puffy eyes or wrinkles it will last  for 5 minutes , I think it freezes the</li>
            <li> I put a small drop on my lower eye bags and, at first, I thought the product was making them more defined.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews on various sites before I purchased Instantly Ageless.  </li>
            <li> glad I bought a small amount first.</li>
            <li> and I had to wash several times to remove the super glue like texture from my skin.</li>
            <li> Making you look much older than before application.  </li>
            <li> I did try the product several different times to make sure I was applying it correctly.</li>
            <li> I also feel the price is too high for all the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; you have to do.</li>
            <li> Still, if I&#x27;m going on a date with the husband, it&#x27;s nice to not have the dark and baggy eyes!!!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 60&#x27;s and really wanted this two work.</li>
            <li> All it does is pull your skin taught for a few minutes and then after, accentuated the wrinkles even more.</li>
            <li> Once you smile, the wrinkles all look the same.</li>
            <li> Any time you smile or show any emotion tons of crinkles and wrinkles you never had in that area before will suddenly appear.</li>
            <li> I almost want to laugh and cry at the same time.</li>
            <li> but once you put makeup on, the bags come right back.</li>
            <li> Everytime a new MLM comes out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> It does feel kinda funny when it is tightening up but not a big deal for us.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this worked!</li>
            <li> At least with Botox, when you smile you do not see the original wrinkles.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my bags with no facial cream on, it did exactly as you see in the videos, they disappeared,</li>
            <li> however when you apply eye cream on top, it instantly went back to how I looked prior to application.  </li>
            <li> have to admit, I saw the videos and thought, &#x27;Wow!</li>
            <li> I placed a small amount of this pinkish cream like substance on to my ring finger, gingerly patted the product in, and waited for the magic to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It was very good, although it dry the skin a little bit; but other than that it does what it says it does!!</li>
            <li> It should be wet when you are done dabbing and then allow it to dry without touching it.  </li>
            <li> You will pay mostly for shipping and get 2 little foil (smaller than a sample size product) NOT THE VIAL SHOWN!!!!  </li>
            <li> Clearly says 2 vials</li>
            <li> My results were not as clear as the demonstration video for this product portrayed.</li>
            <li> The second tube - not so much.  </li>
            <li> Just designed for under the eye but daughter did try it on the upper eyelid but it pulled too much.  </li>
            <li> SO BUYER BEWARE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> and you do look very rested and younger.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much product to get areas you missed, it turns to a white film.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I was glad I at least tried 2 vials of it, but for the longer term, it would be cheaper to pay for the Botox shots.</li>
            <li> Definitely unexpected and unwelcomed results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s far from invisible, and as a guy</li>
            <li> so far it hasn&#x27;t worked at all.</li>
            <li> If you have white residue you are applying too much.</li>
            <li> But my friend said egg whites would do absolutely the same.</li>
            <li> Do you enjoy the sensation of a second degree sunburn without the hassle of actually going outside?</li>
            <li> AND IM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li> It only works if you really have bags under your eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Instantly Ageless 3 stars because the product did not work for me but worked very well for my partner.</li>
            <li> The bags almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not that old looking yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just thankful that I only bought two vials to sample instead of the whole box.</li>
            <li> It works, but don&#x27;t put any foundation near where you are going to apply this, or the foundation cracks on your face.</li>
            <li> Very drying , not something you can use daily or under makeup</li>
            <li> Most I have read are negative because they didn&#x27;t apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much safer than botox with the same results.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Tried using it on top of makeup, it dried white.</li>
            <li> When you twist off the top or cap and use some, the next day when you go to use it, is dried up.</li>
            <li> it only works untill you smile, turns white.. would not buy it again</li>
            <li> There are many over the counter products with the same ingredients for WAY LESS money!</li>
            <li> Been craving a way to make your skin actually appear older?</li>
            <li> I even tried again the next day and the results were exactly the same.</li>
            <li> The other thing I did not like was that when you smile, it makes extra crease lines that you don&#x27;t have normally.  </li>
            <li> This is a major rip off!</li>
            <li> Worked fast, and for a long time.</li>
            <li> The second day, I washed my face and applied my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> we are, five days after application, and most of the skin peeling has ceased and I only have one little red spot left from my experiment.</li>
            <li> All it did was leave a slightly tight feeling, and just like some others have commented, made a crepey, wrinkley look if I smile.  </li>
            <li> Open tube, pat on clean, dry wrinkled area, allow to air dry.</li>
            <li> Quickly becomes granular and is not easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So I was really hoping this would help out just like in those videos; but not much happened.  </li>
            <li> I am 56 years old presently.  </li>
            <li> Instantly Ageless ah yes who dose not want to look young again?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I applied to one eye, the difference was barely even noticeable.</li>
            <li> While my bags did disappear after it dried, within a couple of hours, regardless of what I did, my bags came back WITH more of an aged look than before applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Not a bad price to try it out but a total waste of time.</li>
            <li> I product did make the lines almost disappear but left a pink, crust-like, ashy residue that was very noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product is not a waste of money if you apply this properly, it&#x27;s not a permanent solution, its only temporary, up to 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a terrible product, but not a great one either</li>
            <li> Not so much for dark circles.</li>
            <li> The other key is not to use too much...</li>
            <li> The first tube dried up after using it once.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work but as previous reviews ... Very &amp;#34;Cakey&amp;#34; appearing when dries .</li>
            <li> It definitely works, but you have to be so careful to only use a small amount, not accidentally get it in your eyes, and it seems to highlight the fine lines around your eyes.</li>
            <li> My face was a little crusty to the touch (and I didnt use that much).  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this stuff, but it is just not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really need to apply as little as possible to avoid the caking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, I really wanted to love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So good it has to be bad.</li>
            <li> You have to use more than a *very thin layer* as the instructions state.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not willing to have surgery for vanity&#x27;s sake, I&#x27;d long ago resolved to make peace with the fact that this is how my skin is and just live with it.</li>
            <li> not 20 years younger, but less tired :)  </li>
            <li> However, doesn&#x27;t last long and the price isnt enough bang for the BUCK!</li>
            <li> works on small puffy bags under the eye but not on large ones.</li>
            <li> (at least for my needs) I would suggest try a couple sample packs and see if it&#x27;s to your liking, as this won&#x27;t cost very much</li>
            <li> The only way I cam describe the feeling is if you crack an egg and swipe your finger on the egg white and swatch it on your hand and let it dry</li>
            <li> Absolute waste of money!  </li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I got flat sample packets.</li>
            <li> It appears to work as long as you do not make any facial expressions.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t wear well under make-up.</li>
            <li> The results didnt last THAT long.  </li>
            <li> It stretched out lines around eye but within 15 minutes all were back.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I could only use each vial once as they would dry up.  </li>
            <li> but it cakes up and turns white and makes you look dry.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why something like this could tell all this crap about how it can transform your wrinkles into smooth skin!</li>
            <li> and wow! I am 37 and within a few minutes I looked 27</li>
            <li> I could feel a little tightening under my eye but as far as the wrinkles and bags it did nothing.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t right a review unless I at least chose one!</li>
            <li> It does what it says, it will smooth out wrinkles and bags under your eyes, but it makes your skin look weird and scaley at the edges.</li>
            <li> Leaves a white film, it only lasted for 20mins not worth it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me , perhaps my face has been drooping too long for anything to work .</li>
            <li> Just a dab goes a long way, and lasts the day.</li>
            <li> I have been so self conscience for so long about my bags.</li>
            <li> , I had to be careful applying make up afterwards (for fear of my bags reverting back to how they looked before application).</li>
            <li> Have not opened them yet, Hope this product is not old..</li>
            <li> You do feel &amp;#34;tighting&amp;#34; on your skin, but it did not completely make the bag disappear.  </li>
            <li> The product was dry and in lumps only was able to get 2 uses from 1 vial also it stated it last for at least 8 hours which only lasted for about 1 hour not happy with the product!</li>
            <li> If you smile, there they are again but oddly dry, thin skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed after watching the u tube videos, thinking it was magic!</li>
            <li> But then again I also have the same thing happen with other products Ive tried so it may just be me.</li>
            <li> It also took a very long time to receive it.</li>
            <li> Tried it before foundation, let it dry...</li>
            <li> Tried it after foundation, let it dry</li>
            <li> You have to wait for it to dry</li>
            <li> Also I it does leave a film, like a dry cakey look</li>
            <li> I fanned at the product furiously thinking if it would just dry, the searing sensation would fade.</li>
            <li> I do believe that the rest of the contents of the tube dry out somewhat...</li>
            <li> Total waste of my money.... wish I had only purchased 1 tube to try.</li>
            <li> wish I could get my $5.00 back that I spent on this &amp;#34;vial&amp;#34; and the 10 minutes of my life I spent listening to some gal telling me that this works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I think I would have had the same effect if I had dabbed elmers glue under my eyes, complete with the dried glue collecting in the puffy bags!!</li>
            <li> Do you have a longing for angry red welts to form under your eyes on the most delicate skin on your face?</li>
            <li> Results weren&#x27;t what I expected, glad I bought this before the expensive package!</li>
            <li> Due to the discoloration of his under-eye area, the pink, ashy residue actually helped even out the color.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product was old...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money and the embarrassment a couple of hours later.</li>
            <li> Left the area too tight and dry</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that I typically use MAC foundation (silicon based) and these two don&#x27;t work together.</li>
            <li> It does work and very quick, but if you smile or wink your eye, where ever you applied it, it looks terrible, if you put make up over it do not use any liquid because it rubs away, but without makeup you can see like a tan color where it was applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black but it left a white substance under my eye when it dried</li>
            <li> I only bought two little vials.</li>
            <li> I bought two vials on a different site because they were a bit cheaper, and I didn&#x27;t want to commit to a large expensive box.</li>
            <li> Flakes up on the face when dry, other than that it did work on the bags under eyes.</li>
            <li> BUT there are way more bad sides to this product.</li>
            <li> Did not see much difference before and after for such an expensive product</li>
            <li> had trouble with a sticky white residue after it dryed</li>
            <li> /&gt;After it dried, if i did&#x27;t move my face my bags below my eyes looked smaller, but then you can&#x27;t move your face otherwise</li>
            <li> If you sweat or get wet, bye bye.</li>
            <li> but if it gets wet it washes away.</li>
            <li> No! Didn&#x27;t do what I expected at all.....</li>
            <li> Customer service was as I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thinking that perhaps I was being too harsh on the product, I asked my hubby if he noticed anything different about my face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work the way i expected it having watched some youtube demos.</li>
            <li> Received on time and was what I expected.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected it looks nothing like in the picture</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> What a joke, not what I expected from the product&#x27;s information.</li>
            <li> It is my belief that the people that used IA and it did not work for them either do not have serious enough eye bags or are not applying it properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt they aged me and as I get older, they are even worse.</li>
            <li> Makes ur eyes feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> A little  goes a long  way!  </li>
            <li> ; problem as other users.  </li>
            <li> but it definitely isn&#x27;t for an everyday fix!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly rocket surgery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you get stung in the face by something?&amp;#34; Not exactly a glowing endorsement.</li>
            <li> If you are an unhappy person, who does not smile at all, go ahead and apply this cream, but remember DO NOT SMILE, TALK or LAUGH!</li>
            <li> If you try to put makeup on to cover the white crust it only smear the crust and looks even worse.</li>
            <li> so I could not tell, but for the &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; this product is getting it is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not impressed really.</li>
            <li> I bought the small tubes as a tester and used them for a few weeks before making the big $ investment.</li>
            <li> To achieve the desired results a pea sized amount under each eye will remove stubborn wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning for 2.90.  </li>
            <li> I think if you would included how to properly apply it these negative reviews wouldn&#x27;t be happening.  </li>
            <li> I felt it tighten my skin, but it did nothing for the dark circles and it gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> Not worth it even a penny..</li>
            <li> Plus create a dark circle by the eyebag..</li>
            <li> The biggest waste of money that I had ever spent.</li>
            <li> I have eye bags which developed about 3 or 4 years ago and have gotten progressively worse.  </li>
            <li> The vial I opened is thick, lumpy and has gritty bits in it.</li>
            <li> Froze my under eyes,but was pink and Camry when dried.</li>
            <li> So I plunked down the $20 for two sample vials to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> This product only works with water based liquid foundations and usually they provide very little coverage.</li>
            <li> after an hour and a half, the results went away.  </li>
            <li> but def saw a slight difference</li>
            <li> A slight difference</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product, so glad I only tried the  trial size and didn&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li> Really wanted to try this but after seeing the Yellow &amp; Red 40 artificial dyes...forget it!!</li>
            <li> So would you rather have the puffiness or a little puffiness and also these lines that look like wrinkles?</li>
            <li> Also after a little while it starts caking and cracking.  </li>
            <li> product not as described this was not what I received I got little packets not vials</li>
            <li> Per instructions that meant you were applying too heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money zero star&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The product did take away the puffiness and lasts for a quite a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.  </li>
            <li> but within 5 minutes the puffiness returned , I tried it a few times unfortunatly</li>
            <li> and it seemed a bit flakey after a few hours</li>
            <li> And I only put a thin layer on...</li>
            <li> Once it dried it was all flakey underneath my eyes</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> It was like a paste that dried on my face.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> The product once applied dried and turned to a crusty feeling.</li>
            <li> The problem is that you&#x27;re left with a bunch of awkward looking wrinkles left in that area after using the product a few times.</li>
            <li> but it felt like what I would imagine what it would be like to put elmer&#x27;s glue on your face as it dried.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I thought it helped a few times.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my forehead and sometimes under eye bags.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Dont buy this,  Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> NO STARS - Don&#x27;t Waste a penny on this stuff.  </li>
            <li> When I apply the product: if it goes on smoothly no problem however uneven application shows up unevenly also.</li>
            <li> As a life long sufferer of dark circles and bags under my eyes I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive products to home remedies to lessen the appearance of dark circles and those darn puffy bags.</li>
            <li> but thought the stiff feeling under my eyes was objectionable.....</li>
            <li> A very slight firmness was detected.</li>
            <li> Feels like a tight mask, can&#x27;t wear makeup!</li>
            <li> At first it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but by the minute mark the tingling had blossomed into a raging inferno on my face.</li>
            <li> It dried my eyes out terribly and added a more wrinkled look.</li>
            <li> hard to tell, i thought i did see a little difference.  </li>
            <li> When using the product, you&#x27;re supposed to use very little, not a lot</li>
            <li> at this low price, how can you go wrong?  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Big disappointed me, but actually, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday too!  </li>
            <li> Not really sure anything happens.</li>
            <li> Was not satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results.  </li>
            <li> I have dark circles and bags under my eyes; people tell me how tired I look.  </li>
            <li> didnt do much for me, disappointed.</li>
            <li> it is hardly anything in it.</li>
            <li> It feels very tight and uncomfortable, not worth the $$.</li>
            <li> but you have to at least put one smh</li>
            <li> but at least I know now.</li>
            <li> I got my package late but the seller did contact me</li>
            <li> I mean, how hard could it be?</li>
            <li> the other hand, my partner has horrible bags under his eyes and is very conscience out them.</li>
            <li> If that it how it is usually, I don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> Unbelievable the result!</li>
            <li> Unless you are a manoguin that doesn&#x27;t need make up, this product is a big FAIL!</li>
            <li> But very small sample  packet  </li>
            <li> but then as it dries you get these weird lines going down.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive to use all the time.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the tiny amount.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> I am so tired of getting hit up to sell this \\&quot;s***\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> For me IA lasts approximately 7 hours.  </li>
            <li> not happy with product</li>
            <li> Tired of wrinkles?</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes look worse with it on.  </li>
            <li> no good sorry</li>
            <li> very disappointed do not waste your money</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it at least 10 times; no result whatsoever!!</li>
            <li> This is really expensive and does not work.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product it is fake</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed :/ it did not work.</li>
            <li> around the area of the glue, looks buckled in a weird way.</li>
            <li> I do not think this company should even be comparing themselves to needless Botox, when it is no where close.</li>
            <li> did try this product and unfortunately for me i did not see anything to do with my lines disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t rub the residue off, because then the tightening fails and you have to start all over.</li>
            <li> SORRY</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> It was difficult to figure out the application with makeup.</li>
            <li> I am shocked by the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> and then they look worse!</li>
            <li> Disappointed not amazing like they make it look</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry, it looks terrible and if you disturb the area and &amp;#34;break the  seal&amp;#34; the skin goes baggy again.  </li>
            <li> The difference was dramatic!</li>
            <li> very disappointed waste of money and time waiting for it.</li>
            <li> the vultures come to feed on the desperate.</li>
            <li> Horrible waste of money</li>
            <li> This item isn&#x27;t all that bad</li>
            <li> Bad bad bad</li>
            <li> That night, my skin began to peel as though I&#x27;d had a bad sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> and then it shows every wrinkle : (</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> I found the eye bags disconcerting,discouraging and extremely depressing!.</li>
            <li> It is crappy:( save your money</li>
            <li> Was not expecting the results I got:( it worked nothing like the demonstrations see all over YouTube...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me :[</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like glue and drys the skin so bad !</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hated it!</li>
            <li> But I guarantee you WILL be disappointed!!!  </li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> This is an awful product.</li>
            <li> it is just AWFUL...</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE !!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Left the area too tight and dry</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was able to feel the stretch, but when I asked family members if my eyes were still puffy, they said yes.  So I didn&#x27;t see a big difference</li>
            <li> It sucked!!! The biggest waste of money that I had ever spent.</li>
            <li> It really does work as shown in the video! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Product is fantastic! It really does work and I&#x27;m very happy I bought it. Will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as the video showed.</li>
            <li> Leaves a white film, it only lasted for 20mins not worth it</li>
            <li> this works like no joke. it is amazing. my mom tried it and i watched it work its magic in a minute. amazing. i am going to keep buying this. its so worth it.</li>
            <li> It works great without makeup but once you put makeup on, the bags come right back. Tried using it on top of makeup, it dried white. Per instructions that meant you were applying too heavy. So I tried a lighter application but it doesn&#x27;t work on top of makeup. It would be an awesome product if it worked with makeup.</li>
            <li> It works but it cracks and turns to powder once you start taking or making a facial expression.</li>
            <li> The first tube dried up after using it once.  It did work pretty well.  I was all excited.  The second tube - not so much.  I don&#x27;t think I will try it again.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t provide the instant gratification as advised</li>
            <li> Feels like a tight mask, can&#x27;t wear makeup! It starts flaking if you put makeup on.  Not happy and they advertised that two viles were included and I received one.  It feels very tight and uncomfortable, not worth the $$.</li>
            <li> The serum works great but the tube size is to small and allows serum to dry out quickly. Needs to be packaged better.</li>
            <li> Worked as good as the video I first saw for both myself and my daughter.  Just designed for under the eye but daughter did try it on the upper eyelid but it pulled too much.  It does feel kinda funny when it is tightening up but not a big deal for us.  If you want to use makeup over it, give it 10 minutes or so to make sure it is completely dry and done working.  I put it on just out of the shower then got dressed.  When I did my make-up, was able to use whatever I wanted without a problem with caking/flaking I have read in some of the reviews.  It is nice to wear when you do not want to use a lot of makeup but still look nice.  I am in my 60s and my daughter is in her 40s but we both had similar results and will buy again. The other key is not to use too much...we got about 5 or 6 applications from each tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, I was skeptical… But this stuff is really really what it says! It works.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This is really expensive and does not work.</li>
            <li> If I could give this zero stars I would.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  YES!  It actually works.  On me anyway.  I&#x27;m 52 and apply it under my eyes for puffiness and at the corners of my eyes for wrinkles.  AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Clearly says 2 vials but I only received ONE!!!!</li>
            <li> really works....just don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this worked!</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money I have upper eyelids bag&#x27;s &amp; it did absolutely nothing thank God I only bought two run don&#x27;t waste your money zero star&#x27;s but you have to at least put one smh</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> Quickly becomes granular and is not easy to apply. Boo.</li>
            <li> I would have given this no stars but I couldn&#x27;t right a review unless I at least chose one! I really don&#x27;t understand why something like this could tell all this crap about how it can transform your wrinkles into smooth skin! It should be against the law to be able to lie about this product. SO BUYER BEWARE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IT IS ALL A LIE!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product it is fake</li>
            <li> I bought two vials on a different site because they were a bit cheaper, and I didn&#x27;t want to commit to a large expensive box. I am in my early 60&#x27;s and really wanted this two work. You can get two applications out of each vial. The first day, I washed my face and used my normal moisturizer. After I applied the product, it seemed to tighten the skin. I did see results, and applied make up. However, after talking and smiling, the results went away. You could no longer see any difference. The second day, I washed my face and applied my normal moisturizer. The product tightened the skin, but after an hour, the results went away. I figured that it might be the moisturizer. The third day, I washed my face and did not use moisturizer. Same results of tightened skin. I did not use any make up. The same result.....after an hour and a half, the results went away.  Maybe if you don&#x27;t use moisturizer, don&#x27;t eat, don&#x27;t talk, and don&#x27;t smile, you might have OK results.</li>
            <li> There were no instructions so I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was putting it on right or the amount I should use.  I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Works just like the YouTube video shows.  Product takes away the bags under the eyes and reduces fine lines and puffiness.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Is great for instantly getting rid of puffiness  temporarily, but use just a small  bit.  A little  goes a long  way!  Too much shows a crustyness. Definitely  buying more!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a darn thing for me , perhaps my face has been drooping too long for anything to work . But it was worth a try ....</li>
            <li> TRY IT... at this low price, how can you go wrong?  Personally, I thought it worked well.  I put a small drop on my lower eye bags and, at first, I thought the product was making them more defined.  However, a couple of seconds later, my eyes looked better.... not 20 years younger, but less tired :)  It stayed that way until I cried at a wedding.... the tears affected the bond and my product time was up.</li>
            <li> I do not yet know how good the product is, but the description is very deceiving.  It implies that the price is for two vials, but in fact the price is for one vial.  When you order 1, you are charged for 2.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Can&#x27;t recognize her.</li>
            <li> It was in sachets packets and not like in the photos. It didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Total remake of Sudden Change. This is a sugar cream that when it dries firms, however it leaves a white residue. There are many over the counter products with the same ingredients for WAY LESS money! This is an MLM so they need to jack up the price to pay the downline! Buyer beware. If it sounds too good to be true, it is.  I am so tired of getting hit up to sell this \\&quot;s***\\&quot;. Everytime a new MLM comes out the vultures come to feed on the desperate. So sad.</li>
            <li> Works great until you smile and then it shows every wrinkle : (</li>
            <li> Bummer!  I was hoping this would work for me, but it didn&#x27;t.  I have dark circles and bags under my eyes; people tell me how tired I look.  So I was really hoping this would help out just like in those videos; but not much happened.  All it did was leave a slightly tight feeling, and just like some others have commented, made a crepey, wrinkley look if I smile.  Oh well.  Amazon made it possible to check out this product for cheap and speedy 2-day delivery.  I would have gladly become a member of Jeunesse just for this product, but it did not do as promised.  Back to the drawing board; I suppose the only thing that will help is surgery, which makes me too nervous.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as advertised</li>
            <li> It does work as shown in the videos.  After application it puffs the hallows out and you do look very rested and younger.  The problem is, this does not last.  The skin goes back and you are left with white crust under your eyes.  If you try to put makeup on to cover the white crust it only smear the crust and looks even worse.</li>
            <li> I didnt see the results I needed to see....I will not purchase again....It arrived on time and would buy from the seller again....just not this item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get tubes like the ones pictured. I got flat sample packets. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy anything more than samples. It does what it says, it will smooth out wrinkles and bags under your eyes, but it makes your skin look weird and scaley at the edges.</li>
            <li> good product, thank you.</li>
            <li> didnt do much for me, disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The product did take away the puffiness and lasts for a quite a few hours.  I put it on at night before going out but then by the next morning the puffiness is back.  For me I love it.  Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and I had no reactions with allergies.  For each person I would advise to test it first.  I ordered two vials to test and I was ok.  I ordered a box of 25 recently.</li>
            <li> Awesome !! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> When you twist off the top or cap and use some, the next day when you go to use it, is dried up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this item.  It feels like you have glue on your lower lids, you probably could get the same results using Elmers glue. It feels like it is stretching your lids but then as it dries you get these weird lines going down.  So would you rather have the puffiness or a little puffiness and also these lines that look like wrinkles? Also after a little while it starts caking and cracking.  I&#x27;m just so glad that I didn&#x27;t buy the full size box. What a ripoff!</li>
            <li> hard to tell, i thought i did see a little difference.  i applied with no lotion on my face so i dont know if that effects the product or not.  did not have a &amp;#34;white flacky&amp;#34; problem as other users.  i would not use on a regular basis, but might take with me on trips since i never sleep well away from home.</li>
            <li> This product did not work much at all for me.I could see it shrink a bit around my eyes but not at all what is shown on the video.</li>
            <li> Dont bother ordering this product unless you need a minute to see changes. I have puffiness under my eyes and was happy to try this product , I put it on and within 2 minutes saw the puffiness dissapear and was very excitied about it  but within 5 minutes the puffiness returned , I tried it a few times unfortunatly it workes but for only a very short time so if you are planing to go t an acaition and look good without  puffy eyes or wrinkles it will last  for 5 minutes , I think it freezes the you can feel it when you put on the cream but thats all ..</li>
            <li> Not as good as the video showed but def saw a slight difference</li>
            <li> only use once and it seemed a bit flakey after a few hours</li>
            <li> I was disappointed :/ it did not work.</li>
            <li> it is too much money for the 2 samples. it is hardly anything in it.</li>
            <li> First purchase of this product.  Pretty amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all... It left a residue like I had glue undertake eyes. And I only put a thin layer on...</li>
            <li> Didnt work at all. Once it dried it was all flakey underneath my eyes</li>
            <li> This item did nothing for my wrinkles and I used it as directed. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not what promised. Disappointed</li>
            <li> had trouble with a sticky white residue after it dryed</li>
            <li> It worked just like it was said it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and product is as described.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected it to. Figured I might be wasting my money, but turns out, it was well worth it. Just a dab goes a long way, and lasts the day. Wish it was a permanent fix, but for those special &amp;#34;photo shot&amp;#34; times, this works!</li>
            <li> Well, not as viwed on the video.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  I won&#x27;t do anything for you.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this stuff, but it is just not worth the money. It might work well for some folks, but it just did not do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised</li>
            <li> Absolute waste of money!  Tried it before foundation, let it dry...no difference. Tried it after foundation, let it dry and all it did was look flaky.</li>
            <li> I am over 65 and have fairly nice skin. . I did not use anything prior or after I applied it. If you are looking for something that will transform you into looking younger....forget this. It is a gross exaggeration on that youtube video. It did absolutely nothing for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it works for the thirty somethings?????? You know, the botox generation.</li>
            <li> It was very good, although it dry the skin a little bit; but other than that it does what it says it does!!</li>
            <li> All it does is pull your skin taught for a few minutes and then after, accentuated the wrinkles even more. I would never buy this again. Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Save your money. Period. As seen on TV type product.....</li>
            <li> This item isn&#x27;t all that bad but it definitely isn&#x27;t for an everyday fix! It&#x27;s great if you have to get pictures and is a quick fix.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is ridiculous. It&#x27;s like putting glue on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it dried, if i did&#x27;t move my face my bags below my eyes looked smaller, but then you can&#x27;t move your face otherwise it looks like you put scotch tape under your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin around the area of the glue, looks buckled in a weird way.</li>
            <li> IT DOES THE JOB AND I WAS VERY SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on various sites before I purchased Instantly Ageless.  It definitely does work!!!  I have eye bags which developed about 3 or 4 years ago and have gotten progressively worse.  I am 56 years old presently.  I found the eye bags disconcerting,discouraging and extremely depressing!. I tried every cream, moisturizer, gel, ice masks, egg whites, facial exercises, sleeping on propped pillows..... all to NO AVAIL.  If a company says they have something to get rid of eye bags, it is an absolute falsehood aka LIE!!!  Nothing topical will get rid of your eye bags, surgery is the absolutely only thing that will eliminate them permanently.  However, this product DOES flatten, hide,disquise and/or cover the eye bags temporarily.  For me IA lasts approximately 7 hours.  You can feel it tighten within seconds.  I put moisturizer on first and then the IA.  I don&#x27;t wear face make-up so that is not an issue for me. When I am wearing eyeliner or mascara, I apply that after the moisturizer THEN apply the IA.  I have had no issues with redness, dryness or burning.  It is my belief that the people that used IA and it did not work for them either do not have serious enough eye bags or are not applying it properly.  It worked for me the very first time, but then I read tons of reviews and watched tutorials first.  Maybe one day I will have $4000 to spend for the surgery for a permanent solution. Good luck all!!!!</li>
            <li> While the product does tighten your face and lessen the appearance of wrinkles, it dries and pulls but I wonder if egg whites would do the same thing.  If you sweat or get wet, bye bye. If you smile, there they are again but oddly dry, thin skin.  If you use too much product to get areas you missed, it turns to a white film.  If you never move your face or for a quick selfie (haha), it might be ok...just hold really still.</li>
            <li> Myself nor my sister didn&#x27;t noticed a difference. Definitely not at all like they showed it in the video but at least I know now.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me....the uTube video must have been &#x27;doctored&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it at least 10 times; no result whatsoever!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.did not work at all</li>
            <li> Hated it! Didn&#x27;t like the fact that u can see what you put on.</li>
            <li> The product did not work for me when applying it product is great once the product dries and you should squint of smile it becomes white under your eye and it does not come as shown on the picture above.  I got my package late but the seller did contact me</li>
            <li> So I just got this in the mail, it arrived super fast, I think within a week, anyway I saw the ad for it and the woman who basically lost 10 years of aging off her face after using the product, so I thought I would give it a try, so I ordered the 2 vial pack. I tried it this morning and wow! I am 37 and within a few minutes I looked 27 , I used it on my forehead wrinkles and under my eye and laugh lines on the sides of my mouth and they all looked so much better within minutes.  I am actually surprised the overall rating isn&#x27;t better, maybe it doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, but it worked great for me and I would tell anyone its definitely worth a try because if it works for you , you will love it!I am going to order the 25 vial pack and am going to let my mom give it a try too. Overall well worth it and better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Leaves a white residue whether you put it on before or after your foundation.</li>
            <li> Big disappointed me, but actually, I didn&#x27;t expect it to work.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work as well as portrayed in videos I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> First there were no directions. So I watched a video on You Tube. I did exactly like they said. I could feel a little tightening under my eye but as far as the wrinkles and bags it did nothing. I&#x27;m glad I only bought 2 vials. It didn&#x27;t do anything like the video on facebook.</li>
            <li> Worked just as described.</li>
            <li> Does not work! Save your money! It&#x27;s like glue and drys the skin so bad ! Bad bad bad</li>
            <li> This has nothing to do with the seller. This product is way over rated. After using the product the only thing I noticed was the tightening of my skin. It appears to work as long as you do not make any facial expressions. Once you smile, the wrinkles all look the same. I don&#x27;t have bags under my eyes so I could not tell, but for the &amp;#34;rave&amp;#34; this product is getting it is not worth the money. At least with Botox, when you smile you do not see the original wrinkles. I do not think this company should even be comparing themselves to needless Botox, when it is no where close. For the price, I was glad I at least tried 2 vials of it, but for the longer term, it would be cheaper to pay for the Botox shots.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  It really works..</li>
            <li> I definitely see a difference! I have been so self conscience for so long about my bags. I&#x27;m so happy there is finally a product out that you can see the difference immediately!</li>
            <li> Like putting spackle on your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t kno if I used to much or what or bc I&#x27;m black but it left a white substance under my eye when it dried so if it was gonna work i don&#x27;t know bc I can&#x27;t walk around with white stuff under my eye so I had to wipe it off</li>
            <li> it does work great by taking out the wrinkles but if it gets wet it washes away. so if I am watching an emotional movie or if I am swimming I can&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li> The product was dry and in lumps only was able to get 2 uses from 1 vial also it stated it last for at least 8 hours which only lasted for about 1 hour not happy with the product!</li>
            <li> It works before your eyes but short lived when ad makeup</li>
            <li> No! Didn&#x27;t do what I expected at all..... It was like a paste that dried on my face. Total waste of my money.... wish I had only purchased 1 tube to try. Thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped with my wrinkles...lol  I use it everyday too!  Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> works great for bags under the eyes. Not so much for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I ordered the sample, it worked for about 1 hour then leaves a white crusty film around eyes. very disappointed waste of money and time waiting for it.</li>
            <li> No results. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Left a white film on my face. Not impressed really. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, but I didn&#x27;t see a difference when I used the product. I&#x27;m glad I only bought two vials.</li>
            <li> Something in it made eyes eyes swell !</li>
            <li> This actually works if applied properly. I bought the small tubes as a tester and used them for a few weeks before making the big $ investment.</li>
            <li> Works great, just would be nice to be in a resealable container</li>
            <li> I did not see any change when using this product.</li>
            <li> This really works!  You have to wait for it to dry and you can feel it tighten as it drys.  Great product!</li>
            <li> As it dries, you can feel the area tighten.  Once it&#x27;s dry, it looks terrible and if you disturb the area and &amp;#34;break the  seal&amp;#34; the skin goes baggy again.  glad I bought a small amount first.</li>
            <li> AMAZING stuff. I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> Did not see any effect... to me this product is a scam.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. The product once applied dried and turned to a crusty feeling. It was lighter than the foundation I use and you could see the difference in colors around my eyes versus the rest of my face. I&#x27;m glad I sampled before I bought a huge amount. I tried it three times and it just isn&#x27;t the product it appears to be in the videos I watched about it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Before and after shots of eye area of a friend... Sachets are good for one application and vials good for 2-3 applications. You have to use more than a *very thin layer* as the instructions state. To achieve the desired results a pea sized amount under each eye will remove stubborn wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> product not as described this was not what I received I got little packets not vials</li>
            <li> Is it supposed to be liquid? The vial I opened is thick, lumpy and has gritty bits in it. If that it how it is usually, I don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> Instantly Ageless ah yes who dose not want to look young again?&lt;br /&gt;I did try this product and unfortunately for me i did not see anything to do with my lines disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;I did see the product turn matte looking and did give me a head ache.&lt;br /&gt;I think somethings that work well for other people is not for everyone,but if it works for you then great i&#x27;m glad&lt;br /&gt;it just is not for me i&#x27;m not saying it dose not work i am just stating that it dose not work for me.</li>
            <li> I applied it just as it was supposed to be applied and my eye started to swell.  Maybe I am just allergic to it?</li>
            <li> It works well but isn&#x27;t something that is going to stay.  It washes off.  Still, if I&#x27;m going on a date with the husband, it&#x27;s nice to not have the dark and baggy eyes!!!</li>
            <li> it helped to tighten the skin under my eyes and it appeared to have remove the bags however the skin under my eye became so ashy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work the way I thought it would. Honest didn&#x27;t even see a change.</li>
            <li> Did not see much difference before and after for such an expensive product</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife and it does what they claim and that is temporarily shrink the bags under your eyes. The problem is that you&#x27;re left with a bunch of awkward looking wrinkles left in that area after using the product a few times. Definitely unexpected and unwelcomed results.</li>
            <li> Flakes up on the face when dry, other than that it did work on the bags under eyes.</li>
            <li> Once you put it on it work but wash your face its gone. Sorry it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Ok soooo, this cream does work BUT there are caveats.  When I put it on my bags with no facial cream on, it did exactly as you see in the videos, they disappeared, however when you apply eye cream on top, it instantly went back to how I looked prior to application.  Also I it does leave a film, like a dry cakey look, I had to be careful applying make up afterwards (for fear of my bags reverting back to how they looked before application). With all this said, I have been testing on what type of lotion works best with the eye cream as well as trying to get the cream to not look as &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; after it dried. I also feel the price is too high for all the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; you have to do. Bottom line, this works but you will need to tweak it if you wear makeup &amp; eye cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay! The product shows up in pictures, though.</li>
            <li> Well....it certainly tightens the skin just as the video shows. HOWEVER.....it&#x27;s far from invisible, and as a guy I just cant go out in public trying to hide bags under my eyes with residue to replace them that&#x27;s more noticeable. you can&#x27;t rub the residue off, because then the tightening fails and you have to start all over. I would recommend it to women who have an intent to wear foundation, or something to blend the color with. Overall, not a terrible product, but not a great one either (at least for my needs) I would suggest try a couple sample packs and see if it&#x27;s to your liking, as this won&#x27;t cost very much</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and reliable...</li>
            <li> This stuff is like Elmer glue for the face.  Doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t wear well under make-up.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable the result!</li>
            <li> I could only use each vial once as they would dry up.  I even tried covering them, wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Purchased the Instantly Ageless by Jeunesse based on the reviews I read and the video. Didn&#x27;t work on me at all, however my sister told me it did work on my brother-in-law so I sent him my unopened tube.</li>
            <li> You would NOT believe the results. Works amazing. Make sure you use oil-free foundation for best results.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Worked fast, and for a long time. Can&#x27;t wIt to get more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last very long.  works on small puffy bags under the eye but not on large ones.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all on me. Esp my lines around my mouth and it&#x27;s leaves a white residue. Yes I ordered more to give it one more shot! I was so excited to see the videos and the dramatic results that I thought this was the perfect product for me...so far it hasn&#x27;t worked at all.</li>
            <li> Instantly Ageless works amazing if you apply it correctly! If you have white residue you are applying too much. Also it needs to be left fairly damp and let it air dry, don&#x27;t rub it in. Remain expressionless for 2-3 min for best results.</li>
            <li> Nooooo!!!! Don&#x27;t do it! I was so disappointed after watching the u tube videos, thinking it was magic! It doesn&#x27;t work. Total bummer!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a joke. I don&#x27;t wear make up. And it leaves a white chalky look everywhere you put it. It did feel like it tightened the skin. But my friend said egg whites would do absolutely the same.</li>
            <li> I love it ! It works great and within minutes. It lasts all day and does not peel. It took years off. I will be stocking up soon.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Does not last all day.</li>
            <li> Disappointed not amazing like they make it look</li>
            <li> It was garbage no good sorry</li>
            <li> Customer service was as I expected.  I NEVER have a problem with Amazon.  I order everything I can via amazon providing price is competative because of their customer service.  Through my blog www.being40plus.com I refer so many people, customer service is huge with the 40 Plus crowd.  The product itself did not assist me because I do not have LARGE bags.  I used it on fine smile lines and it seemed to fade them temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 99.00 packet and returned it for the 16.00 packet.  I suggest that you start with the 16.00.  The product does work in a lot of situatuions.  Spend 16 dollars to find out if yours is the right situatuon.  Because I had ZERO issue with returning the 99.00 box for the 16 dollar (2) vile I will continue to recommend Amazon!</li>
            <li> Not really sure anything happens. It may work for you. Purchase was done perfectly</li>
            <li> did not work. very disappointed do not waste your money I only bought two little vials.</li>
            <li> Flakey, did not wear well under make up like stated, no results. Glad I only purchased two vials instead of 25. Do not spend money on this product</li>
            <li> Do you enjoy the sensation of a second degree sunburn without the hassle of actually going outside? Do you have a longing for angry red welts to form under your eyes on the most delicate skin on your face? Been craving a way to make your skin actually appear older? Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I saw the videos and thought, &#x27;Wow! That&#x27;s amazing!&#x27; As a life long sufferer of dark circles and bags under my eyes I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive products to home remedies to lessen the appearance of dark circles and those darn puffy bags. Since I&#x27;m not willing to have surgery for vanity&#x27;s sake, I&#x27;d long ago resolved to make peace with the fact that this is how my skin is and just live with it. But then I saw all of the buzz around Instantly Ageless and the demonstrations seemed pretty compelling. So I plunked down the $20 for two sample vials to give it a shot. I figured, what did I have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My epidermis, apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came quickly from Amazon. Packaging was fine. It even came with helpful instructions on how to use the product but by that point I&#x27;d watched every youtube video available and I was pretty certain I&#x27;d be able to apply the product correctly. I mean, how hard could it be? Open tube, pat on clean, dry wrinkled area, allow to air dry. It&#x27;s not exactly rocket surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with great anticipation I opened the tube. It had an expiration date of 12/2015 so I know the product should have been fine. I placed a small amount of this pinkish cream like substance on to my ring finger, gingerly patted the product in, and waited for the magic to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened next can only be described as &amp;#34;dramatic&amp;#34;, but not for good reasons. A tingling sensation started at about the 10 second mark. At first it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but by the minute mark the tingling had blossomed into a raging inferno on my face. As the burning sensation increased, my eyes startedto water uncontrollably. This re-wetted the product adding fuel to an already out of control 5 alarm blaze under my eyes. I fanned at the product furiously thinking if it would just dry, the searing sensation would fade. Indeed, once the spackle had set the irritation wasn&#x27;t quite as furious but now I had one puffy, red, swollen eye. Looked like I&#x27;d been in a bar fight and to add insult to injury, the product had finally dried, perfectly preserving said welts, swelling, and puffiness in all of their non moving, glued on glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking that perhaps I was being too harsh on the product, I asked my hubby if he noticed anything different about my face. His response was, &amp;#34;Did you get stung in the face by something?&amp;#34; Not exactly a glowing endorsement. I decided to wash the product off. Re-wetting it again brought on the same burning sensation and I had to wash several times to remove the super glue like texture from my skin. The affected area was so injured that I couldn&#x27;t use any makeup or moisturizer that day. That night, my skin began to peel as though I&#x27;d had a bad sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we are, five days after application, and most of the skin peeling has ceased and I only have one little red spot left from my experiment. It&#x27;s too bad, I really wanted to love this stuff. I did take a before and after pic. Truth is, I looked better before using Instantly Ageless.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work the way i expected it having watched some youtube demos.</li>
            <li> not what it states, wasn&#x27;t worth buying at all</li>
            <li> Worked fabulously! Bought a full box after my sample and I use it faithfully! Have had many people state I look so rested (I use under my eyes).  I definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Received on time and was what I expected. Ordered this just to try it. Results weren&#x27;t what I expected, glad I bought this before the expensive package!</li>
            <li> THIS IS LIKE EYE CRACK... LOL&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE BEST SERUM OUT THERE AND IM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li> Makes ur eyes feel tight and dry. But if you put cream over top afterwards it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the tiny amount. Really only 3 applications at best.</li>
            <li> It works but def. exspensive. Wish I could afford more. Needs to be at. More affordable price for us not so rich people that have kids. Lol</li>
            <li> It only works if you really have bags under your eyes</li>
            <li> It was &#x27;ok&#x27;.  It did tighten the area under my eyes...but it felt like what I would imagine what it would be like to put elmer&#x27;s glue on your face as it dried.  My face was a little crusty to the touch (and I didnt use that much).  The results didnt last THAT long.  Might be a great product to use before pictures or something.  For me, I will not be ordering any more.</li>
            <li> Works as promised, very happy with results.</li>
            <li> Significant difference.</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone very good and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Instantly Ageless 3 stars because the product did not work for me but worked very well for my partner. I purchased two vials as I did not want to spend $100+ on a full order without knowing what the results would be. I have very deep lines on my forehead and wanted an alternative to Botox treatments. I product did make the lines almost disappear but left a pink, crust-like, ashy residue that was very noticeable. This was unacceptable for me as I did not want to trade one problem in for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, my partner has horrible bags under his eyes and is very conscience out them. I applied Instantly Ageless under one eye. The difference was dramatic! The bags almost completely disappeared. Due to the discoloration of his under-eye area, the pink, ashy residue actually helped even out the color. I attempted to cover up the area with concealer but only made the crust-like product more noticeable. This would be an amazing product if there were some way to cover up any trace of the application.</li>
            <li> So good it has to be bad. Leaves residue and burns like a sob.</li>
            <li> I have found this to reduce the discoloration under my eyes.  It leaves me looking rested.</li>
            <li> Works great! However, doesn&#x27;t last long and the price isnt enough bang for the BUCK! sorry,&lt;br /&gt; loved the destributor at the craft fair in Charlston Mo. though!! I wish her much success!</li>
            <li> It does work and very quick, but if you smile or wink your eye, where ever you applied it, it looks terrible, if you put make up over it do not use any liquid because it rubs away, but without makeup you can see like a tan color where it was applied. Not worth the money. The only thing I see this good for is if you want a good photogenic but just don&#x27;t smile until you get ready to take the picture.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product because I put it on under my foundation and when I put my foundation on the product came off and my under eye bags reappeared.  I tried putting it on over my foundation, but it didn&#x27;t work that way.</li>
            <li> SORRY BUT MY WIFE SAYS IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK...</li>
            <li> I found this works with residual white and filmy skin</li>
            <li> These are not vials, they are sachets.Have not opened them yet, Hope this product is not old..Like sandpaper</li>
            <li> I saw no difference whatsoever</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work and leaves a white film on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Works like magic!</li>
            <li> I had seen a youtube video of this product and I did not feel that my results were as drastic as hers. But did see some improvement.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product. ...i will reorder.</li>
            <li> Not seeing the results like the girls in video. Maybe I&#x27;m not that old looking yet. It was fun to ru.</li>
            <li> It  leaves a white crust in your face, was not impress with this product..</li>
            <li> I received this item very fast. It&#x27;s REALLY WORKS,  I use it when I go out, within seconds it tightens your skin. I would like to sell it. So many nurses at work want it too. I would like to be a representative , but don&#x27;t know who to contact.</li>
            <li> not happy with product</li>
            <li> It is crappy:( save your money</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing.  Waste of money. Rip off.</li>
            <li> Was expecting instant results as described but when applied correctly it did nothing. &#x3D;[</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference in my under eye area. Not impressed!</li>
            <li> Yes this product does shrink your eye bags. BUT there are way more bad sides to this product. #1 you can NOT apply your make up over the top of this stuff. As soon as you apply concealer or foundation over the top you get INSTANTLY AGED by 20 years! And before you wonder, YES I applied this serum correctly as instructed. The effect is like applying makeup over crinkled sand paper. #2 even if you don&#x27;t wear makeup you better keep a frozen emotionless face. Any time you smile or show any emotion tons of crinkles and wrinkles you never had in that area before will suddenly appear. Making you look much older than before application.  Basically this cream simply shrinks your under eye skin from a grape to a raisin. You can not raisinate your skin and expect to look better. Unless you are a manoguin that doesn&#x27;t need make up, this product is a big FAIL! I&#x27;m just thankful that I only bought two vials to sample instead of the whole box. This is a major rip off!</li>
            <li> This product is flaky on the skin. MAkes the appearance of more wrinkles and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s a little expensive to use all the time. You get about 2 uses just for under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Worked nothing like the videos I have seen. Not sure if the product was old...you never know what you&#x27;re buying, I guess. Not a bad price to try it out but a total waste of time.</li>
            <li> Horrible waste of money, I think I would have had the same effect if I had dabbed elmers glue under my eyes, complete with the dried glue collecting in the puffy bags!!</li>
            <li> I thought it helped a few times.  It was difficult to figure out the application with makeup.</li>
            <li> No it does not work,,,,</li>
            <li> The product works as stated, the only issue is that you have to use the entire vial at one time because it dries out in the tube.</li>
            <li> it only works untill you smile, turns white.. would not buy it again</li>
            <li> Would give no stars if that was an option.&lt;br /&gt;Product does not work at all. I followed direction and tried it two days in a row.  No results.</li>
            <li> My results were not as clear as the demonstration video for this product portrayed.</li>
            <li> Buying off of amazon was pricey.. So I decided to start selling it myself so people could get a fair price buying it directly from me!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed…product works great for the 1st few minutes, but once you apply moisturizer or makeup the effect goes away.. it&#x27;s a shame…that&#x27;s not something they talk about in their video.</li>
            <li> OMG! You want a plaster like feel under your eyes? That&#x27;s how this will feel after it dries up! When you smile, it will create millions wrinkles under your eye where you have this cream! I almost want to laugh and cry at the same time. This cream is advertised and sold promising customers smooth under eyes and when you apply this cream and it dries up as a cement plaster, it create a lot of creases when you smile, talk or laugh! If you are an unhappy person, who does not smile at all, go ahead and apply this cream, but remember DO NOT SMILE, TALK or LAUGH!</li>
            <li> It was not what I thought.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.  Too bad. I had really high hopes!</li>
            <li> The application process needs to be addressed. When I apply the product: if it goes on smoothly no problem however uneven application shows up unevenly also.</li>
            <li> im glad I didn&#x27;t order the bottle,.would not buy more</li>
            <li> Seems to work but as previous reviews ... Very &amp;#34;Cakey&amp;#34; appearing when dries .</li>
            <li> The effect only lasted 20 minutes. I&#x27;m my opinion it&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions and watched videos and this product didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> When you smile you have more wrinkles than you did before you put it on!</li>
            <li> This is a scam.  You will pay mostly for shipping and get 2 little foil (smaller than a sample size product) NOT THE VIAL SHOWN!!!!  Not worth returning for 2.90.  But I guarantee you WILL be disappointed!!!  From China&lt;br /&gt;WILL NOT LET ME POST PHOTO  But very small sample  packet  That says on Package(Not Labeled for individual Sale)&lt;br /&gt;HEAD WARNING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with puffy eyes and dark circles since I was young so after seeing the video thought it was too good to be true.  I was right.  I&#x27;m happy I only bought a sample.  Did not notice any difference whatsoever! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It works, but don&#x27;t put any foundation near where you are going to apply this, or the foundation cracks on your face. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> This was not what I expected it looks nothing like in the picture</li>
            <li> It worksngood but it cakes up and turns white and makes you look dry.</li>
            <li> Not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected. I had to use way too much product (in fact 3X the amount that was stated to use). It left a white cakie film under my eyes,that showed up when i applied make up.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t in the vial stated on the order-they were sample packs.  The product did not work.</li>
            <li> Awful! Puffy welps under my eyes after I used it! Glad it didn&#x27;t cost much!</li>
            <li> It left a white residue that was visible and only last 30 minutes</li>
            <li> Instantly removes wrinkles &amp; bags under eyes</li>
            <li> Mixed feelings on the product. It is tricky using it...Sometimes it feels too cakey. I have only two times that I used it that it went well. I am still trying it.&lt;br /&gt;I like this packaging better than the sachets.</li>
            <li> A slight difference but thought the stiff feeling under my eyes was objectionable.....I wouldn&#x27;t buy it....</li>
            <li> It worked for me and I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and actuall works and last along time.</li>
            <li> Very drying , not something you can use daily or under makeup</li>
            <li> Tired of wrinkles? This is what you need? Affordable and ready to use as soon as you receive it.</li>
            <li> It works really well! The difference is amazing but, it tends to leave a burning feeling. I dont know if this is just me or if others are having this to. But then again I also have the same thing happen with other products Ive tried so it may just be me. But the results really are amazing!</li>
            <li> Obviously this is made for someone much younger than I am.  At 71, I think the wrinkles are too deep to be helped.  Sure wish I hadn&#x27;t laughed so much  (NOT).  At any rate, it wasn&#x27;t a help.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly and now I dont have to cake on makeup to try to cover the circles under my eyes, I let others try and now I became a rep Amazing Instant Results, check it out, I am so excited, this is what we have all been waiting for, Now is the time to join, I have tried MCA, ACN,Body Body by Vi, but this product is amazing, Its selling itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.instantlybeautifulyou.jeunesseglobal.com/</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I buy it for my mom she is very happy with results.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s incredible you can see the difference in seconds...</li>
            <li> Service was great from the seller. I just didn&#x27;t like what I bought. It doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claim. Seller is great.</li>
            <li> It does work but u can&#x27;t put make up over iy</li>
            <li> I am shocked by the negative reviews.  I don&#x27;t leave the house without this stuff. I use it everyday on my forehead and sometimes under eye bags.  I got a sample here then ordered the box  free2minutefaceliftsample dot com</li>
            <li> For me, this product does not work as advertised.  No big surprise there!</li>
            <li> Works great! I have had under eye bags since I was 12. I&#x27;ve always felt they aged me and as I get older, they are even worse. This is the first thing that has done the trick besides injections. The only issue I have is that I typically use MAC foundation (silicon based) and these two don&#x27;t work together. This product only works with water based liquid foundations and usually they provide very little coverage. Other than that, this is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is a gimmick ! Erases wrinkles until you smile and then they look worse! Yuck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed every piece of advice to maximize this product and to make it work as promised. While my bags did disappear after it dried, within a couple of hours, regardless of what I did, my bags came back WITH more of an aged look than before applying the cream. It dried my eyes out terribly and added a more wrinkled look. If you go by reviews before purchasing, please take this as advice. Just don&#x27;t purchase. It&#x27;s not worth the money and the embarrassment a couple of hours later.</li>
            <li> It definitely works, but you have to be so careful to only use a small amount, not accidentally get it in your eyes, and it seems to highlight the fine lines around your eyes. I can&#x27;t figure out how to put making on over it without it looking sticky or caked-on.</li>
            <li> Awesome product ♥️ It!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while now. However the rep I got it from explained how to use it and what to and what not to do.  I think if you would included how to properly apply it these negative reviews wouldn&#x27;t be happening.  Most I have read are negative because they didn&#x27;t apply it correctly.</li>
            <li> OH my goodness I love love love this! I just got it, and it came much quicker than it said it would .. so i was happy about that because I have been really wanting to try it! Ran upstairs to my make-up mirror and applied as it said to .. the results were nothing short of amazing! love it!</li>
            <li> This product is not a waste of money if you apply this properly, it&#x27;s not a permanent solution, its only temporary, up to 8 hours. It&#x27;s much safer than botox with the same results. It&#x27;s not fake, it&#x27;s not a scam, you can watch all the results on the internet, and for yourself. When using the product, you&#x27;re supposed to use very little, not a lot and that&#x27;s where the cakey and oily look come in. My mother sells jeunesse and all of the results are flawless. Hopefully it&#x27;s the same for you. They also make great skincare products for acne which work well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Was very upset how this product came to me. All torn up and open on the bottom. Almost scared to use it.</li>
            <li> Totally works. See my review on the 25 vial box. Great product. Life saver and blessing.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to try this but after seeing the Yellow &amp; Red 40 artificial dyes...forget it!!</li>
            <li> Was not expecting the results I got:( it worked nothing like the demonstrations see all over YouTube...I purchased this for the mild under eye bags I have. I applied it as directed, fanned it and remained emotionless and it dried with a matte look and very noticeable when I smiled it made me look like I had wrinkles under my eyes which I do not! I even tried again the next day and the results were exactly the same. The only way I cam describe the feeling is if you crack an egg and swipe your finger on the egg white and swatch it on your hand and let it dry that&#x27;s the feeling it gives. NOT A PRODUCT FOR ME!!</li>
            <li> Works great, but a bit pricey!!</li>
            <li> This stuff was way overpriced and it did nothing for me. It also took a very long time to receive it.</li>
            <li> Way over priced, I have about 4 applications for almost 25.00&lt;br /&gt;Talk about being ripped off!&lt;br /&gt;Look for something cheaper!</li>
            <li> I could not see any noticeable difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time but when you applied to the area it left a noticeable film. Was not satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> i bought it...i used it....it did nothing for me!</li>
            <li> What a joke, not what I expected from the product&#x27;s information.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product, so glad I only tried the  trial size and didn&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li> I am not interested in buying any more.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money. My Wife asked me to order it for Her. She said it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Exactly as seen and advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed. I felt it tighten my skin, but it did nothing for the dark circles and it gave me a rash. This is an awful product. Stay away from this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see it do anything great</li>
            <li> The puffiness under my eyes kinda went away, but about 45 min later the stuff flaked off and it looked like under my eyes was peeling. No good.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The product firmed up my skin but when I put my makeup on over it , it didn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li> just didnt work like the vid shows</li>
            <li> I use this for the bags under my eyes.  Wow! what an incredible difference you can see within minutes of application.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. But it is not permanent.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> Froze my under eyes,but was pink and Camry when dried. Won&#x27;t by again</li>
            <li> There was a differnece right after applying this but it only lasts about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Really works</li>
            <li> Did not perform as advertised. Would not purchase again. It stretched out lines around eye but within 15 minutes all were back.</li>
            <li> love love love this stuff.......!!!!!!!!!!! WILL DEFINATLEY BE ORDERING MORE!</li>
            <li> This stuff is junk! I threw it in the trash after I tried it a couple times!!!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with the way it is packaged  .....after it is opened there is no way to keep air from removing so of the moisture in the container .. I do believe that the rest of the contents of the tube dry out somewhat... The second application doesn&#x27;t seem to go one as smoothly.</li>
            <li> So glad I didn&#x27;t buy the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I TRIED THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME &amp; COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE HE BEFORE &amp; AFTER.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS WITH MY UNDEREYE MAKEUP THAT SEEMED TO FLAKE.  WILL TRY THE METHOD THAT&#x27;S DESCRIBED IN THE DIRECTIONS TO ACHIEVE A MORE FLAWLESS LOOK/</li>
            <li> Made under my eye feel stuff. Saw some improvement but only lasts for a short while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money. Not worth it even a penny..does work for 3minutes after that eyebag came back.. Plus create a dark circle by the eyebag.. DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. HERES MY PROVE THAT THIS PRODUCT DOESNT WORK.</li>
            <li> Worked great! I put on over my make up and I got a better result</li>
            <li> The product did not produce the tightening effect as stated. A very slight firmness was detected. When I applied to one eye, the difference was barely even noticeable. I did try the product several different times to make sure I was applying it correctly.</li>
            <li> wasnt any good it left a chalky appearance that i couldnt cover up with makeup.</li>
            <li> This product actually work as it says it does.  Definitely will be getting more.&lt;br /&gt;Sandra Ercolani</li>
            <li> This was truly the best thing I have bought in a long time! Really worked and was great!!</li>
            <li> Did not find this to work magically as it appeared in the video reviews I watched.  It&#x27;s definitely a &amp;#34;fine art&amp;#34; to applying it correctly.  I do agree with alot of the reviews that I read that too much makes it look &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;.  You should also not rub it in, only dab.  It should be wet when you are done dabbing and then allow it to dry without touching it.  I only got one eye exactly right one time where I felt the &#x27;bag&#x27; was not visible any longer.  You do feel &amp;#34;tighting&amp;#34; on your skin, but it did not completely make the bag disappear.  The &#x27;tighting&#x27; feel only lasted about 4 hours.  The other thing I did not like was that when you smile, it makes extra crease lines that you don&#x27;t have normally.  Because I smile alot and don&#x27;t remain expressionless most of the time, I don&#x27;t think this product is right for me.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good product. It makes my eyes look worse with it on.  Crackly, wrinkley. it is just AWFUL...Dont buy this,  Dont waste your money. HORRIBLE !!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me :[</li>
            <li> NO STARS - Don&#x27;t Waste a penny on this stuff.  It does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could get my $5.00 back that I spent on this &amp;#34;vial&amp;#34; and the 10 minutes of my life I spent listening to some gal telling me that this works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was I thinking - I&#x27;ll stick with my Clarins products - they are the BEST.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results.  I want more.</li>
            <li> Really need to apply as little as possible to avoid the caking.</li>
    </ol>
