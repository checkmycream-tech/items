            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>These things are amazing.</li>
            <li>She now loves to brush her own hair and doesn&#x27;t have issues when I brush it either.  </li>
            <li>These are the most amazing brushes ever made.</li>
            <li>My hair is very, very fine; so I can&#x27;t say that this would work for everyone.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>These are much better at breaking up the knots.</li>
            <li>It made brushing their hair easier and drama free!</li>
            <li>These brushes work fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought the two pack b/c I love having one in each bathroom.  </li>
            <li>We are  able to get tangles out of our daughters hair without tears.</li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The many bristles do the work of detangling a bunch of hair at a time, which makes the job go faster.</li>
            <li>fact that there are two brushes is wonderful, and very necessary.</li>
            <li>These brushes aren&#x27;t magic by any means.</li>
            <li>But I love it in the shower.</li>
            <li>On more than one occasion, she&#x27;s even got the brush herself and began brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li>Great brush for detangling hair, shipped quickly,thank you the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>Ended up buying more and more as we lose them often.  </li>
            <li>I love the one I have</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better it works for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Love this hair brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush!!!!!</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has long hair and this has been the best brush to get those stubborn tangles out.</li>
            <li>I have 4 grand daughters and lots of hair to keep tangle free.</li>
            <li>Best brush ever for wet hair.</li>
            <li>It just gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>This brush goes through my hair easily and painlessly and gets the job done without tearing out my hair.</li>
            <li>They comb through my daughters kinky curls just as easily as my son&#x27;s looser ones.</li>
            <li>They were recommended to me by my stylist, and my sensitive daughter who doesn&#x27;t like getting her hair brushed at all and yells at the smallest snarl said it was a very good brush and that she loved it.</li>
            <li>and I can brush my hair free of tangles.  </li>
            <li>she can brush out herself and it&#x27;s as smooth as ever.</li>
            <li>You can use it on the most damaged, tangled hair ever and it slides right through.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter has very fine hair with a mild natural curl, that tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>No pain, no stress, quick and easy.</li>
            <li>A TRUE life savor in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>Does not work great, as this is an imitation.  </li>
            <li>This brush makes that process MUCH faster, easier, and pain free.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush for myself and 6 year old</li>
            <li>Our favorite brush by far.  </li>
            <li>I see the same kind of brushes in the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Worth any price to reduce tears before school.</li>
            <li>Good price, but definitely not worth all the hype.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old and and my 7 year old love their brushes!</li>
            <li>She is five and willingly brushes her hair.</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>Found the first one at a &amp;#34;Hy-Vee&amp;#34; store in Omaha.  </li>
            <li>But it works for me, and if you have very fine, long hair, I expect that it would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughters loved them and I would highly recommend them to other families.  </li>
            <li>Which is amazing when you have a two year old whose hair insists on looking like we&#x27;ve never brushed it since she was born.</li>
            <li>Doing hair is almost totally stress free with this brush.</li>
            <li>Daughter hair is very curly</li>
            <li>These work as brushes, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re real</li>
            <li>So much so that she begins to develop rat&#x27;s nests.  </li>
            <li>It really works well</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly (frizzy in parts) and it can take me 15 to 20 minutes to untangle on some days.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>I kept the purple and gifted the pink to my friend.</li>
            <li>I shave my head, so I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without this brush !</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my granddaughter who has super thick, yet easily tangled hair</li>
            <li>These work well for my daughters long, curly hair, but aren&#x27;t great when there&#x27;s hard tangles to get out.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and tangles very easy, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair, and these work great when my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li>Ohhh my......these brushes are great for girls that sometimes have a hard time brushing their hair due to tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>no crying in the morning when they comb their hair!</li>
            <li>If you have long hair, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard that you should never brush it while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>These brushes have completely changed the flow of our mornings, and as a bonus, she no longer looks like the completely feral child!</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter and I fought every morning over brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and durable.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 5 year old and one for work, as I am a hairdresser.....</li>
            <li>Could not believe that they would make a difference until they came and we tried them and wow was I surprised.</li>
            <li>When my hair is wet, I have to brush it in layers but so worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>Works terrific, highly recommend</li>
            <li>But once she started using this brush things have been smooth and no more tears...</li>
            <li>Especially, children that may struggle with certain &amp;#34;sensory disorder&amp;#34; challenges and do not like their hair brushed.</li>
            <li>No other product required.</li>
            <li>While this brush did work better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used on dry hair, I still prefer using a wide-tooth comb on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I threw out all my old brushes and now only use these, even on myself.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t yank on wet hair of course, just brush it gently from the bottom.</li>
            <li>Glides right through it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I felt that when I used the wet brush, it left my hair really frizzy and staticky.</li>
            <li>Our daughter hates having her hair brushed by this just as much as every other brush.</li>
            <li>This brush has long soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I have thin, easily tangled hair</li>

            <li> Our daughter hates having her hair brushed by this just as much as every other brush.</li>
            <li> This brush has long soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I have thin, easily tangled hair</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of other brushes that didn&#x27;t work and was amazed when my 8 year old daughter brushed her hair without any  whining or screaming.  </li>
            <li> but, the whole time would cringe and comment &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; it seemed with every other stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting the Wet brush, she no longer endures hair brushing, she ENJOYS it!  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this untangles it very gently without pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm enough to remove the tangles, but soft enough that they keep me from getting</li>
            <li> Well disappointed because it&#x27;s not as good as described</li>
            <li> I have nearly waist length hair, and it takes me less than five minutes to detangle and brush my hair.</li>
            <li> With other regular brushes I was constantly pulling on her hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair</li>
            <li> Minimal yanking out of hair like with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because if you have another family member with long hair (as I do), that person will steal it in no time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You still need to use conditioner in long hair to prevent tangles.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy for anyone that has long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was using a wide hair comb before this brush and this brush saves me at least 15 minutes (I have pretty long hair for reference).</li>
            <li> no matter how much detangler and, or conditioner is placed in her thick hair.</li>
            <li> and this brush still gets caught in her hair just the same as any other brush.</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with very long hair</li>
            <li> The wet brush lets you brush normally even with tangled hair and it does not pull hard on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Works for all types of hair, wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone, especially those with little ones.</li>
            <li> I am actually looking to get the paddle brush and round brush.  </li>
            <li> Before we got the Wet brush, she would ENDURE the required brushing</li>
            <li> She never did that before we got the Wet brush.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price because I actually save money because I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive detangling products!</li>
            <li> name WET BRUSH is quite odd since the instructions claim that it works in wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Reduces detangling time by about half for both wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> you get the tangles out of wet or dry hair, without snagging, pulling and, bringing tears to your little ones eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but using it...</li>
            <li> On the other hand, you probably want to spend less than two hours detangling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the real Wet Brush, which I did not realize when I ordered.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s super painful to brush when wet.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long, thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> Having 3 girls with long, thick hair can be a battle brushing them.  </li>
            <li> my daughter has tightly curled hair</li>
            <li> Overall, I was disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Almost no more complaints on hair brushing time.</li>
            <li> The girls are no longer afraid of betting their hair brushed and this also saves previous time in the morning and before bed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every brush out there to tame my tangly hair - and this somehow does it!</li>
            <li> No more screaming and crying mommy your pulling my hair out!!</li>
            <li> I have medium length, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> The thin bristles do make the brush pull less hair but unfortunately the thinness equates to weakness and I&#x27;ve already lost a few bristles from each brush.</li>
            <li> To avoid that we would need to go very slow and cover small sections at a time and hold the hair so it wouldn&#x27;t pull at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I usually dread brushing my hair after I shower because it is painful -</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> ...order it now and save yourself grief.</li>
            <li> terrible and ugly split ends.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have 4 grand daughters and lots of hair to keep tangle free. I was surprised at how well these brushes work on wet tangled hair. Saves a lot of tears. Love them.</li>
            <li> Great brush! I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Ohhh my......these brushes are great for girls that sometimes have a hard time brushing their hair due to tangled hair.  My daughters loved them and I would highly recommend them to other families.  Especially, children that may struggle with certain &amp;#34;sensory disorder&amp;#34; challenges and do not like their hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Good price, but definitely not worth all the hype. Our daughter hates having her hair brushed by this just as much as every other brush.</li>
            <li> Works terrific, highly recommend</li>
            <li> My daughter had issues with tangles and my wife got these brushes.  She now loves to brush her own hair and doesn&#x27;t have issues when I brush it either.  With other regular brushes I was constantly pulling on her hair.  These are much better at breaking up the knots.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for myself and 6 year old</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush! I have tried every brush out there to tame my tangly hair - and this somehow does it! I usually dread brushing my hair after I shower because it is painful - I have medium length, thick, wavy hair. It just gets tangled easily. I have two daughters who also dislike having their hair brushed and it is always a battle. They also loved this brush!!! It made brushing their hair easier and drama free! I recommend this brush to anyone with hair honestly! I don&#x27;t know what makes this brush work, and I don&#x27;t care. But, I do know that I am ordering another pack!!!</li>
            <li> This brush made brushing hair after baths a dream. No more screaming and crying mommy your pulling my hair out!! I recommend this a+ product and well made.</li>
            <li> Reduces detangling time by about half for both wet and dry hair. No other product required. I recommend this to anyone, especially those with little ones. Doing hair is almost totally stress free with this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a knock-off. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Well disappointed because it&#x27;s not as good as described my daughter has tightly curled hair and this brush still gets caught in her hair just the same as any other brush. Disappointed</li>
            <li> We love it!  My granddaughter has long hair and this has been the best brush to get those stubborn tangles out. She is five and willingly brushes her hair.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! They are amazing!</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair where shower time would be &amp;#34;torture&amp;#34; time. But once she started using this brush things have been smooth and no more tears...</li>
            <li> Daughter hair is very curly and she&#x27;s tender-headed so she loves this brush.</li>
            <li> These work as brushes, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re real</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter and I fought every morning over brushing her hair.  She would hide all of the brushes in the house so that I couldn&#x27;t brush her hair and then scream and cry and tell me I was hurting her.  These brushes have completely changed the flow of our mornings, and as a bonus, she no longer looks like the completely feral child!</li>
            <li> These brushes work fabulous!  My 2 year old and and my 7 year old love their brushes!</li>
            <li> I have a daughter with very long hair and she hates when we brush it.  So much so that she begins to develop rat&#x27;s nests.  After getting her to try this brush once, we haven&#x27;t had to chase her around the house to brush her hair.  The bristles are soft and durable.  I couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this purchase.  Why are you still reading this...order it now and save yourself grief.</li>
            <li> best brush for tangly hair!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I&#x27;m glad I bought the two pack b/c I love having one in each bathroom.  Yippee!</li>
            <li> Our favorite brush by far.  Works for all types of hair, wet and dry.  We are  able to get tangles out of our daughters hair without tears.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever! It&#x27;s the only brush my daughter likes!!! It glided through your hair even if it curly! You have to try it.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes for Christmas presents and one for myself.  My hair is very curly and tangles very easy, wet or dry.  So I decided to give this a try.  It really works well and I can brush my hair free of tangles.  Glides right through it wet or dry.  I would highly recommend this brush.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Works great!! No pain, no stress, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best! My hair is very curly (frizzy in parts) and it can take me 15 to 20 minutes to untangle on some days.  This brush makes that process MUCH faster, easier, and pain free.  I was so impressed I bought brushes for my daughter, daughter-in-law, sister and niece.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!!! I have thin, easily tangled hair that&#x27;s super painful to brush when wet. This brush goes through my hair easily and painlessly and gets the job done without tearing out my hair. I tried it on my granddaughter who has super thick, yet easily tangled hair and she loved it too. I bought one for all the ladies in my family!!! It is worth the price because I actually save money because I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive detangling products! I highly recommend this brush!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best detangling brushes I&#x27;ve ever seen. They were recommended to me by my stylist, and my sensitive daughter who doesn&#x27;t like getting her hair brushed at all and yells at the smallest snarl said it was a very good brush and that she loved it. I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
            <li> Both my kids and I love it! no crying in the morning when they comb their hair! this is the second time to buy it.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the glowing reviews, I was expecting these brushes to be nothing short of a miracle, but I have not found that to be the case. My daughter and I both have long, thick, curly hair and I struggle to get a brush through it. While this brush did work better than other brushes I&#x27;ve used on dry hair, I still prefer using a wide-tooth comb on wet hair. I felt that when I used the wet brush, it left my hair really frizzy and staticky. Overall, I was disappointed that this product didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair and I can&#x27;t live without this brush ! Make my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely fantastic!  I am actually looking to get the paddle brush and round brush.  My girls love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 5 year old and one for work, as I am a hairdresser.....so great!  You can use it on the most damaged, tangled hair ever and it slides right through.  Great for kids too...she can brush out herself and it&#x27;s as smooth as ever.</li>
            <li> Does not work great, as this is an imitation.  Not the real Wet Brush, which I did not realize when I ordered.</li>
            <li> My daughter cries everytime I help her brush out her hair no matter how much detangler and, or conditioner is placed in her thick hair. This brush worked like magic! It took out tangles with no discomfort at all!</li>
            <li> This thing is a timesaver and a lifesaver!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Having 3 girls with long, thick hair can be a battle brushing them.  I can finally brush my girls&#x27; hair without them squirming and crying the whole time.  I threw out all my old brushes and now only use these, even on myself.  I have extremely thick hair, and these work great when my hair is dry.  When my hair is wet, I have to brush it in layers but so worth the effort.  Minimal yanking out of hair like with a regular brush.</li>
            <li> These are the most amazing brushes ever made. They comb through my daughters kinky curls just as easily as my son&#x27;s looser ones. I even use it for myself now (though don&#x27;t tell them that!). I split the pack with a friend, and we are both very happy.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve heard that you should never brush it while it&#x27;s wet. You should only comb it gingerly, fussing from the bottom up to remove the snags and snarls you get when you shampoo. On the other hand, you probably want to spend less than two hours detangling your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is the answer that works for me. The bristles are firm enough to remove the tangles, but soft enough that they keep me from getting terrible and ugly split ends. I don&#x27;t yank on wet hair of course, just brush it gently from the bottom. The many bristles do the work of detangling a bunch of hair at a time, which makes the job go faster. I have nearly waist length hair, and it takes me less than five minutes to detangle and brush my hair. My hair is very, very fine; so I can&#x27;t say that this would work for everyone. But it works for me, and if you have very fine, long hair, I expect that it would work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that there are two brushes is wonderful, and very necessary. That&#x27;s because if you have another family member with long hair (as I do), that person will steal it in no time.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing. Saves us about 10 minutes of fighting with tangled hair in the morning. And the tears are gone. Could not believe that they would make a difference until they came and we tried them and wow was I surprised. Would recommend these to anyone with hair.</li>
            <li> These work well for my daughters long, curly hair, but aren&#x27;t great when there&#x27;s hard tangles to get out.</li>
            <li> This brush has long soft bristles. I see the same kind of brushes in the drugstore. The thin bristles do make the brush pull less hair but unfortunately the thinness equates to weakness and I&#x27;ve already lost a few bristles from each brush. They just fell out. People buy these for kids it seems but it isn&#x27;t necessarily durable enough for a kid to own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name WET BRUSH is quite odd since the instructions claim that it works in wet or dry hair. Don&#x27;t all brushes, really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You still need to use conditioner in long hair to prevent tangles. These brushes aren&#x27;t magic by any means.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever for wet hair.</li>
            <li> My hair still comes out....Booo!  But I love it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Almost no more complaints on hair brushing time. Worth any price to reduce tears before school.</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it claims.  It let&#x27;s you get the tangles out of wet or dry hair, without snagging, pulling and, bringing tears to your little ones eyes.  Our daughter has very fine hair with a mild natural curl, that tangles very easily.  Before we got the Wet brush, she would ENDURE the required brushing but, the whole time would cringe and comment &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; it seemed with every other stroke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since getting the Wet brush, she no longer endures hair brushing, she ENJOYS it!  On more than one occasion, she&#x27;s even got the brush herself and began brushing her hair.  She never did that before we got the Wet brush.  This is one product that&#x27;s remaining in my Wish list, for when we need to order another.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome!!!!  I have tried alot of other brushes that didn&#x27;t work and was amazed when my 8 year old daughter brushed her hair without any  whining or screaming.  The brush is wonderful.  This is a must buy for anyone that has long curly hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is the BOMB dot COM! I heard of this brush through a hair guru on instagram and saw that they had a 2 pack on amazon (I couldn&#x27;t find this brush at kmart, walmart, or target!). I kept the purple and gifted the pink to my friend. I was a bit skeptical at first but using it... I am a believer. This things takes out knots and tangles in a jiffy. I was using a wide hair comb before this brush and this brush saves me at least 15 minutes (I have pretty long hair for reference). LOVE THIS BRUSH! For the price, it&#x27;s amaaazinnnggg!</li>
            <li> Great brush for detangling hair, shipped quickly,thank you the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> If your kids have longer hair - only way to go...</li>
            <li> Do not walk....RUN to buy these.  We are the biggest fans.  Wouldn&#x27;t use ANYTHING else on my daughters hair.  Found the first one at a &amp;#34;Hy-Vee&amp;#34; store in Omaha.  Ended up buying more and more as we lose them often.  A TRUE life savor in the mornings.  Bought two for three of my nieces.  Same thing...best product ever created.  Thank you Wet Brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is incredible.  My daughters used to routinely cry when we would comb their tangled hair.  To avoid that we would need to go very slow and cover small sections at a time and hold the hair so it wouldn&#x27;t pull at the scalp. The wet brush lets you brush normally even with tangled hair and it does not pull hard on the hair.  The girls are no longer afraid of betting their hair brushed and this also saves previous time in the morning and before bed.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> My curly haired daughter loves it.  I shave my head, so I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li> I love the one I have so I bought these for my granddaughter. She loves it too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better it works for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing! It gets through tangled hair with the greatest of ease. Which is amazing when you have a two year old whose hair insists on looking like we&#x27;ve never brushed it since she was born. Thank goodness that it won&#x27;t be such a big fight to brush her hair anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair brush.</li>
            <li> Love this hair brush. I have thick curly hair and this untangles it very gently without pulling it out.&lt;br /&gt;I actual ordered another one to use on my horses&#x27; tail!</li>
            <li> Best brush for tender scalp.</li>
