            <li>WHILE IT IS LOUDER THAN MY RETIRED ELECTRIC, IT GIVES A GOOD SHAVE.  </li>
            <li>He would recommend it to anyone looking for a good all in one clipper set.</li>
            <li>Wahl has good products.</li>
            <li>This is a good deal....</li>
            <li>Noise wise</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with it and continue to recommend it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating upgraded from 4/5 to 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Jan 26, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Wahl fit the need perfectly being 3 tools in one and having a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product with an amazing battery.  </li>
            <li>my husband uses this all the time, he thinks it does a great job, but storage is a problem, it has to sit on the sink top</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, I have been very pleased with the assortment of attachments and accessories that it came with.</li>

            <li>VERY SMOOTH!  </li>
            <li>The clipper attachments are great but the real awesome part is buying the micro screen \\&quot;detail\\&quot; shaver from Wahl directly--</li>
            <li>I got my Wahl  rotary shaver a day early, great job, in perfect condition with everything as specified.</li>
            <li>but I would buy another one for sure!  </li>
            <li>Love this razor!</li>
            <li>when i inquired about the wahl lithium shaver, he said, &#x27;i love it!&#x27;</li>
            <li>It is amazing, passed my expectations.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s great for getting in and around beards or sideburns.</li>
            <li>If I get a good response will post more later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it dries on its own rather well on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>and it dries on its own rather well on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>When it was a good bit  better</li>
            <li>By far the best shaver I have purchased to date and the price cannot be beat!!!!!.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great little shaver, I&#x27;m still very happy with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great little shaver, I&#x27;mstill very happy with it.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very smooth and doesn&#x27;t gyrate around or anything.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s very smooth and doesn&#x27;t gyrate around or anything.</li>
            <li>The motor seemed under sized and made more noise than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>maybe you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this...maybe?</li>
            <li>Anything more then 2 days growth and you are pulling hair.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a replacement that was more</li>
            <li>and I want to suppoort and love their products.</li>
            <li>All the attachments are okay</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the better trimmers I have had.</li>
            <li>Doing this, I was able to get more than satisfactory performance from the Wahl for 5 days.</li>
            <li>I love the shaver.</li>
            <li>Still charging time is 3-4 minutes, time between charges is more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Remember to go against the grain, alternating circular and straight motions and it&#x27;ll give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this electric razor and use it daily.</li>
            <li>Most Norelco&#x27;s are made in China, unless you want to pay over $100.00 for one made in Europe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that Wahl gives you lifetime free blades every 18 months.  </li>
            <li>Braun should spend some money and make the screens out of better material</li>
            <li>I can not remember what kind of battery is in the Wahl but any manufacturer who sells you a product with a nickel-metal hydride battery instead of a lithium-ion battery is just being cheap with you.  </li>
            <li>Big win!</li>
            <li>The heads change out easy and the clippers are as good as a full sized model of hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is pretty good.</li>
            <li>As before, the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li>and yes I  would not want to drop this razor to the floor because of the plastic its made of compared to Norelco it more than makes up for the smooth shave</li>
            <li>The shaver itself isn&#x27;t very powerful, and needs many passes before you get a close shave.</li>
            <li>Some have claimed the shaver head is flimsy, and falls off easily.</li>
            <li>Guides snap on and off easily, but stay put when in use on the blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still going strong...</li>
            <li>, my beard is so strong it would kill disposable razor in one shave, I&#x27;ve  always had Wahl trimmers for my beard and now I  have it all in one razor.</li>
            <li>the razor in this package seems designed for a teenager&#x27;s fine whiskers.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.  </li>
            <li>The replacement shave head Wahl sent me has been working just fine, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And you gotta love the quick charge.</li>
            <li>However, after a 5 minute quick charge I was able to finish the job on Day 6.</li>
            <li>If you shave every day and have light hair growth it would be fine.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this product.</li>
            <li>The countertop holder is a bit light, but it too works</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviews mentioned this shaver was plasticky, light, and cheap feeling.</li>
            <li>The closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had is with my Wahl Bump Free micro screen shaver--</li>
            <li>I contacted the company to order another one and they graciously sent me a replacement piece free of charge.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t give me a great feeling that care was used in packing something this fragile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fourth, the clippers, namely the eyebrow or detailing head, do a fantastic job around my go-tee.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, the clippers do a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I just put a drop every so often on the blades and it keeps them running smoothly and sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter and it gave me a close, smooth shave.</li>

            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter and it gave me a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>bought the shaver 10/12 shave is so so can get free replacement blades(i guess)</li>
            <li>As a bonus it was &amp;#34;Made In USA&amp;#34; and had free replacement heads for life.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t really free, you have to pay a $5.00 handling fee.</li>
            <li>Light weight, compact tool.  </li>
            <li>the first day, I decided to try it out on my day-old stubble and it did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>the first day, I decided to try it out on my day-old stubble and it did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it generally takes me 5-7min to do a good, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>And while many have been unhappy with this product, I can say that I&#x27;m glad I purchased it (or, glad my wife bought it for me as a gift :D )</li>
            <li>Keeping the blades clean helps a lot, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean up was a bit tricky.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the top plate is pure genius.</li>
            <li>Clean up was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver now for a full year</li>
            <li>but you can charge it for 10 minutes and get a full shave if you haven&#x27;t got the time to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, definitely follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations if you want a good shaving</li>

            <li>So, definitely follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations if you want a good shaving</li>
            <li>Made quick work of trimming my goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had previously used a Braun electric shaver (used it until it died, and bought this Wahl as a replacement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachments work great.</li>
            <li>Bar none the best shaver i&#x27;ve had since my first Remington in the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Cut is clean and crisp,</li>
            <li>The Wahl 9937 Lithium Ion Triple Play is advertised by its makers as the world’s first no compromise full size shaver, trimmer, and detailer, giving you everything you need for all your grooming needs.  </li>
            <li>However, because I was looking for an all in one shaver/clipper and didn&#x27;t find anything else similar on the market that I liked, I took a chance on the Wahl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about calling Wahl and ordering the circular ear/nose trimmer; I could use the detailer, but a blade designed for this purpose will be far more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually shaved with it for a 6th day without charging as well, but on Day 6 the battery charge was to the point where I didn&#x27;t get the shave I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>I read about this model finishing third in top three shavers available on market today.</li>
            <li>I opened it, and found two replacement shaving heads for my triple play razor with each in their own individual boxes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>In short, clean the blades daily, go softly and lightly over your skin (against the grain) and it will do a very good job.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations since the manufacturer has made fine products I still use.</li>
            <li>The battery worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li>and it takes the hair right off.</li>
            <li>and it takes the hair right off.</li>
            <li>shaver works pretty well and the multiple attachments are a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m a great Wahl fan.&lt;br /&gt;I was struck by how the build quality was not up to usual Wahl standards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely made of plastic, and it&#x27;s light; however, I don&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very straight forward.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer recommends pulling/stretching your skin in places hard to get--this works great</li>
            <li>The manufacturer recommends pulling/stretching your skin in places hard to get--this works great</li>
            <li>And if you only have enough $ to purchase a shaver, and you&#x27;re not going to be able to wait until you have more $...</li>
            <li>I love the different attachments and I like the warranty.</li>
            <li>If look at the reviews for this item, the Wahl 9880-100 and 9880-200, most of those reviews would have you think this family of products is utter junk.</li>
            <li>Wahl also offers a free lifetime blade replacement (once every 18 months).</li>
            <li>The battery life is pretty phenomenal, actually...</li>
            <li>if you rinse the blades daily, you will get a better, faster shave.</li>
            <li>If you run it without the shaving head, with nothing on top, the motor itself is almost silent.</li>
            <li>but since this is my first, I do not know if it is louder/software than compareable electric</li>

            <li>but since this is my first, I do not know if it is louder/software than compareable electric</li>
            <li>Actually it might be better to say assembled in America.</li>
            <li>, I contacted Wahl about the defective shaver head and the company did the right thing and solve my issue; they were very apologetic, and promised to rectify the situation.</li>
            <li>It is further advertised as giving the user up to 45 uses on a full charge, for nearly 2 hours of run time, and having available a 3 minute quick charge feature which will give the user 5 minutes of run time.  </li>
            <li>I am well satisfied on how long the shaver keeps a charge.</li>
            <li>The longer you don&#x27;t clean the blades, the more trouble it seems to have getting over the stubble (esp.</li>
            <li>I shave completely dry with no water or pre-shave, so someone else may break it in better with preshave lotion.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really know exactly why he likes it so much</li>
            <li>Bought primarily for shaving my head which it did fine the first time, but then died before it could finish the job a 2nd time even though it was fully charged, and had been very well taking care of for that short time period!</li>
            <li>It works fine if a take the extra time to shave slowely and methodically.</li>
            <li>Wahl is VERY lightweight, leading some people to think it is not well built, but I believe it is plenty sturdy unless one throws it around.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you can buy too much technology for yourself.  </li>
            <li>For what is advertised, this seems to be a very robust product.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>But, as a shaver, it just doesn&#x27;t do the job in a very satisfactory way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Got quality, handle, and very close shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality item, made in the US, for a price which is very competitive given its multi-functionality.</li>
            <li>If you begin to feel a \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; sensation, you&#x27;re moving the shaver too fast.</li>
            <li>I move the shaver, \\&quot;kissing\\&quot; the skin rather than rubbing it with the shaver, the better the shave and fewer \\&quot;rough</li>
            <li>but I find going in straight lines, against the grain</li>
            <li>I can really \\&quot;get in and around\\&quot; with it.</li>
            <li>Now I gently \\&quot;brush\\</li>

            <li>Now I gently \\&quot;brush\\</li>
            <li>The Wahl unit is very noisy and it does not shave very closely.  </li>
            <li>This electric razor has plenty of power and provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The shaving head looks different, it does not tilt like the original one.</li>
            <li>box comes with 16 pieces, including the basic unit; trimmer blade; detail trimmer; beard guide combs, for stubble, medium and full beards;</li>
            <li>However there is nothing to make it more than average, thus the three star rating.</li>
            <li>It only takes one hour to charge the battery to full and the charger itself is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charging the battery to full only takes an hour</li>

            <li>does a better job with less shaving</li>
            <li>The razor feels light, but that could be simply because they are not heavy ni-cad batterys.  </li>
            <li>It consists of the the main handle/body, a triple head shaver attachment, clipper attachment, and detail clipper attachment.</li>
            <li>The clipper and detailer blades are classic Wahl.</li>
            <li>I never had this particular issue with irritation and the triple play razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to deal with them at least twice in the last year regarding the shaver head and each time they&#x27;ve been very nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Going in orbital, counter-clockwise circles is fine for a first round shave</li>
            <li>Going in orbital, counter-clockwise circles is fine for a first round shave</li>
            <li>They state that the new powerful lithium-ion technology, in addition to offering much more shave time for lesser charging time, is the only available heavy-duty shaver on the retail market, with up to 2x the torque of ordinary shavers.  </li>
            <li>Not enough to go on vacation for a week without a charger, but OK for a long weekend.</li>
            <li>Never bogged down, just asked if I could  hammer on it some more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re traveling, however, the AC adapter isn&#x27;t large, and it comes with a travel bag which is large enough to hold everything.</li>
            <li>-i guess i will try their 800# and see if they can find out if i can get a new battery-does not shave close but doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin-</li>
            <li>It all smelled new too.</li>
            <li>, thenI put the top plate back down, gave it a little tap, and most of it fell out.</li>
            <li>the only exception being that they changed the design so that the heads do not float the same as they did with the original.</li>
            <li>(hey, it&#x27;s early!).</li>
            <li>but I primarily use the foil shaver and the small and large blades for trimming.</li>
            <li>I bought a new one thinking that my old one will give-up soon.</li>
            <li>The package does come with a little bottle of oil for the blades but mineral oil works fine to.</li>

            <li>makers, who state they have been used by professionals since 1919,  further claim that the shaver will provide 3 in 1 grooming with 2 x more power than previous electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>We opened the box, and were stuck right there, for a very long time.  </li>

            <li>It cost only a little more than what the replacement head would have cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, to be clear, I purchased the 9937, Wahl Triple Play Lithium Ion Shaver/Trimmer/Detailer.</li>
            <li>It offers flex and float technology in which the shaver head conforms to the contours of the users’ face, chin and neck for a close, painless shave.  </li>
            <li>SO FAR.</li>
            <li>This triple head seems underpowered and ineffective compared to the old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as performance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But Still the old one goes well.</li>
            <li>but it does not give me anywhere near the irritation around my lower neck so in that instance I have to recommend the triple play if you&#x27;re susceptible to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The amount of \\&quot;noise\\&quot; comes directly from the shaving head.</li>
            <li>The amount of \\&quot;noise\\&quot; comes directly from the shaving head.</li>
            <li>that is a very close shave, easily a 10/10 but leaves me irritated, especially on the neck; the irritation is not worth a that extra 1/10.</li>
            <li>it is a little louder than most but not nearly as loud as a micro screen shaver.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve only used it 10 times, I am confident that after using this shaver over a long period, I&#x27;ll learn to manipulate it to provide equal or better shaves than the higher-priced brand, and over a few years, it will cost me WAY less.</li>
            <li>have a refurbished older Wahl model that looks like it was designed in the sixties (similar to the bump-free model) with a NICAD battery that won&#x27;t die and still gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested it to see how many shaves I can get out of it, because usually I just use it once and put it back on the charger.</li>
            <li>In the past i&#x27;ve lost the top plates in various ways.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of the reviews and that made me skeptical about whether this was worth it, but my buy america feelings are strong and I wanted a three blade circular electric shaver to replace my old side to side vibrating Wahl.  </li>
            <li>I found the heads (shaver, trimmer, detailer) a little tricky at first to put on and take off the main body, but once you get used to it</li>
            <li>I received the shaver a day early and charged it right away and used it to shave and as advertised in less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but solid in the hand; it doesn&#x27;t creak or crack when held firmly or squeezed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it annoyingly or excessively loud, but it&#x27;s definitely louder than my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time, I can get approximately 3-5 full shaves out of a full charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This shaver is also easier to clean than the other (more expensive) brand.  </li>
            <li>This is one powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m back to the old model.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NOTE: If you are going to shave your lower neck, go \\&quot;gently\\&quot; and softly--it can catch and cut your skin if you&#x27;re not careful, or not used to using an electric razor.</li>

            <li>Shaving right does take a little time with this thing</li>
            <li>First to trim it down.</li>
            <li>I concur with some of the other reviews that complain that this razor does not shave very well.</li>
            <li>And, even once assembled, my husband wouldn’t go near it for another very long time.  </li>
            <li>The replacement shaver head worked fine for a few months until the little dot cover that goes in the middle of each of the three shaving saucers fell out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I tested how long the battery would go on a single charge by using the shaver/trimmer just like I normally would, except when I was done I didn&#x27;t plug it back in.</li>
            <li>I got a 9880 (bad reviews) razor instead of the 9937 (good</li>

            <li> The best electric shave I ever had!</li>
            <li> If 10/10 is the perfect, blade close, against-the-grain-smooth shave, this will give me a 8/10 if I shave _</li>
            <li> Wahl has excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 6.23.2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still an excellent shaver.</li>

            <li> If ur looking a great rotary/trimmer shaver......</li>
            <li> WHILE IT IS LOUDER THAN MY RETIRED ELECTRIC, IT GIVES A GOOD SHAVE.  </li>
            <li> He would recommend it to anyone looking for a good all in one clipper set.</li>
            <li> Wahl has good products.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal....</li>
            <li> Noise wise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with it and continue to recommend it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating upgraded from 4/5 to 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Jan 26, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Wahl fit the need perfectly being 3 tools in one and having a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good product with an amazing battery.  </li>
            <li> my husband uses this all the time, he thinks it does a great job, but storage is a problem, it has to sit on the sink top</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I have been very pleased with the assortment of attachments and accessories that it came with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I have been very pleased with the assortment of attachments and accessories that it came with.</li>
            <li> VERY SMOOTH!  </li>
            <li> The clipper attachments are great but the real awesome part is buying the micro screen \\&quot;detail\\&quot; shaver from Wahl directly--</li>
            <li> I got my Wahl  rotary shaver a day early, great job, in perfect condition with everything as specified.</li>
            <li> but I would buy another one for sure!  </li>
            <li> Love this razor!</li>
            <li> when i inquired about the wahl lithium shaver, he said, &#x27;i love it!&#x27;</li>
            <li> It is amazing, passed my expectations.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s great for getting in and around beards or sideburns.</li>
            <li> If I get a good response will post more later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it dries on its own rather well on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> and it dries on its own rather well on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> When it was a good bit  better</li>
            <li> By far the best shaver I have purchased to date and the price cannot be beat!!!!!.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little shaver, I&#x27;m still very happy with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little shaver, I&#x27;mstill very happy with it.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very smooth and doesn&#x27;t gyrate around or anything.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s very smooth and doesn&#x27;t gyrate around or anything.</li>
            <li> The motor seemed under sized and made more noise than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> maybe you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this...maybe?</li>
            <li> Anything more then 2 days growth and you are pulling hair.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a replacement that was more</li>
            <li> and I want to suppoort and love their products.</li>
            <li> All the attachments are okay</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the better trimmers I have had.</li>
            <li> Doing this, I was able to get more than satisfactory performance from the Wahl for 5 days.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver.</li>
            <li> Still charging time is 3-4 minutes, time between charges is more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Remember to go against the grain, alternating circular and straight motions and it&#x27;ll give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this electric razor and use it daily.</li>
            <li> Most Norelco&#x27;s are made in China, unless you want to pay over $100.00 for one made in Europe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that Wahl gives you lifetime free blades every 18 months.  </li>
            <li> Braun should spend some money and make the screens out of better material</li>
            <li> I can not remember what kind of battery is in the Wahl but any manufacturer who sells you a product with a nickel-metal hydride battery instead of a lithium-ion battery is just being cheap with you.  </li>
            <li> Big win!</li>
            <li> The heads change out easy and the clippers are as good as a full sized model of hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty good.</li>
            <li> As before, the battery life is pretty good.</li>
            <li> and yes I  would not want to drop this razor to the floor because of the plastic its made of compared to Norelco it more than makes up for the smooth shave</li>
            <li> The shaver itself isn&#x27;t very powerful, and needs many passes before you get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Some have claimed the shaver head is flimsy, and falls off easily.</li>
            <li> Guides snap on and off easily, but stay put when in use on the blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still going strong...</li>
            <li> , my beard is so strong it would kill disposable razor in one shave, I&#x27;ve  always had Wahl trimmers for my beard and now I  have it all in one razor.</li>
            <li> the razor in this package seems designed for a teenager&#x27;s fine whiskers.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.  </li>
            <li> The replacement shave head Wahl sent me has been working just fine, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And you gotta love the quick charge.</li>
            <li> However, after a 5 minute quick charge I was able to finish the job on Day 6.</li>
            <li> If you shave every day and have light hair growth it would be fine.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this product.</li>
            <li> The countertop holder is a bit light, but it too works</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviews mentioned this shaver was plasticky, light, and cheap feeling.</li>
            <li> The closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had is with my Wahl Bump Free micro screen shaver--</li>
            <li> I contacted the company to order another one and they graciously sent me a replacement piece free of charge.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me a great feeling that care was used in packing something this fragile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fourth, the clippers, namely the eyebrow or detailing head, do a fantastic job around my go-tee.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, the clippers do a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> I just put a drop every so often on the blades and it keeps them running smoothly and sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter and it gave me a close, smooth shave.</li>

            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter and it gave me a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> bought the shaver 10/12 shave is so so can get free replacement blades(i guess)</li>
            <li> As a bonus it was &amp;#34;Made In USA&amp;#34; and had free replacement heads for life.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t really free, you have to pay a $5.00 handling fee.</li>
            <li> Light weight, compact tool.  </li>
            <li> the first day, I decided to try it out on my day-old stubble and it did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> the first day, I decided to try it out on my day-old stubble and it did a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it generally takes me 5-7min to do a good, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> And while many have been unhappy with this product, I can say that I&#x27;m glad I purchased it (or, glad my wife bought it for me as a gift :D )</li>
            <li> Keeping the blades clean helps a lot, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean up was a bit tricky.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the top plate is pure genius.</li>
            <li> Clean up was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver now for a full year</li>
            <li> but you can charge it for 10 minutes and get a full shave if you haven&#x27;t got the time to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, definitely follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations if you want a good shaving</li>

            <li> So, definitely follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations if you want a good shaving</li>
            <li> Made quick work of trimming my goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously used a Braun electric shaver (used it until it died, and bought this Wahl as a replacement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachments work great.</li>
            <li> Bar none the best shaver i&#x27;ve had since my first Remington in the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Cut is clean and crisp,</li>
            <li> The Wahl 9937 Lithium Ion Triple Play is advertised by its makers as the world’s first no compromise full size shaver, trimmer, and detailer, giving you everything you need for all your grooming needs.  </li>
            <li> However, because I was looking for an all in one shaver/clipper and didn&#x27;t find anything else similar on the market that I liked, I took a chance on the Wahl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking about calling Wahl and ordering the circular ear/nose trimmer; I could use the detailer, but a blade designed for this purpose will be far more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually shaved with it for a 6th day without charging as well, but on Day 6 the battery charge was to the point where I didn&#x27;t get the shave I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> I read about this model finishing third in top three shavers available on market today.</li>
            <li> I opened it, and found two replacement shaving heads for my triple play razor with each in their own individual boxes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> In short, clean the blades daily, go softly and lightly over your skin (against the grain) and it will do a very good job.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations since the manufacturer has made fine products I still use.</li>
            <li> The battery worked right out of the box.</li>
            <li> and it takes the hair right off.</li>
            <li> and it takes the hair right off.</li>
            <li> shaver works pretty well and the multiple attachments are a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m a great Wahl fan.&lt;br /&gt;I was struck by how the build quality was not up to usual Wahl standards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely made of plastic, and it&#x27;s light; however, I don&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very straight forward.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommends pulling/stretching your skin in places hard to get--this works great</li>
            <li> The manufacturer recommends pulling/stretching your skin in places hard to get--this works great</li>
            <li> And if you only have enough $ to purchase a shaver, and you&#x27;re not going to be able to wait until you have more $...</li>
            <li> I love the different attachments and I like the warranty.</li>
            <li> If look at the reviews for this item, the Wahl 9880-100 and 9880-200, most of those reviews would have you think this family of products is utter junk.</li>
            <li> Wahl also offers a free lifetime blade replacement (once every 18 months).</li>
            <li> The battery life is pretty phenomenal, actually...</li>
            <li> if you rinse the blades daily, you will get a better, faster shave.</li>
            <li> If you run it without the shaving head, with nothing on top, the motor itself is almost silent.</li>
            <li> but since this is my first, I do not know if it is louder/software than compareable electric</li>

            <li> Actually it might be better to say assembled in America.</li>
            <li> , I contacted Wahl about the defective shaver head and the company did the right thing and solve my issue; they were very apologetic, and promised to rectify the situation.</li>
            <li> It is further advertised as giving the user up to 45 uses on a full charge, for nearly 2 hours of run time, and having available a 3 minute quick charge feature which will give the user 5 minutes of run time.  </li>
            <li> I am well satisfied on how long the shaver keeps a charge.</li>
            <li> The longer you don&#x27;t clean the blades, the more trouble it seems to have getting over the stubble (esp.</li>
            <li> I shave completely dry with no water or pre-shave, so someone else may break it in better with preshave lotion.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really know exactly why he likes it so much</li>
            <li> Bought primarily for shaving my head which it did fine the first time, but then died before it could finish the job a 2nd time even though it was fully charged, and had been very well taking care of for that short time period!</li>
            <li> It works fine if a take the extra time to shave slowely and methodically.</li>
            <li> Wahl is VERY lightweight, leading some people to think it is not well built, but I believe it is plenty sturdy unless one throws it around.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you can buy too much technology for yourself.  </li>
            <li> For what is advertised, this seems to be a very robust product.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> But, as a shaver, it just doesn&#x27;t do the job in a very satisfactory way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Got quality, handle, and very close shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality item, made in the US, for a price which is very competitive given its multi-functionality.</li>
            <li> If you begin to feel a \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; sensation, you&#x27;re moving the shaver too fast.</li>

            <li> The Wahl unit is very noisy and it does not shave very closely.  </li>
            <li> This electric razor has plenty of power and provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The shaving head looks different, it does not tilt like the original one.</li>
            <li> box comes with 16 pieces, including the basic unit; trimmer blade; detail trimmer; beard guide combs, for stubble, medium and full beards;</li>
            <li> However there is nothing to make it more than average, thus the three star rating.</li>
            <li> It only takes one hour to charge the battery to full and the charger itself is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charging the battery to full only takes an hour</li>

            <li> does a better job with less shaving</li>
            <li> does a better job with less shaving</li>
            <li> The razor feels light, but that could be simply because they are not heavy ni-cad batterys.  </li>
            <li> It consists of the the main handle/body, a triple head shaver attachment, clipper attachment, and detail clipper attachment.</li>
            <li> The clipper and detailer blades are classic Wahl.</li>
            <li> I never had this particular issue with irritation and the triple play razor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to deal with them at least twice in the last year regarding the shaver head and each time they&#x27;ve been very nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Going in orbital, counter-clockwise circles is fine for a first round shave</li>
            <li> Going in orbital, counter-clockwise circles is fine for a first round shave</li>
            <li> They state that the new powerful lithium-ion technology, in addition to offering much more shave time for lesser charging time, is the only available heavy-duty shaver on the retail market, with up to 2x the torque of ordinary shavers.  </li>
            <li> Not enough to go on vacation for a week without a charger, but OK for a long weekend.</li>
            <li> Never bogged down, just asked if I could  hammer on it some more.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re traveling, however, the AC adapter isn&#x27;t large, and it comes with a travel bag which is large enough to hold everything.</li>
            <li> -i guess i will try their 800# and see if they can find out if i can get a new battery-does not shave close but doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin-</li>
            <li> It all smelled new too.</li>
            <li> , thenI put the top plate back down, gave it a little tap, and most of it fell out.</li>
            <li> the only exception being that they changed the design so that the heads do not float the same as they did with the original.</li>
            <li> (hey, it&#x27;s early!).</li>
            <li> but I primarily use the foil shaver and the small and large blades for trimming.</li>
            <li> I bought a new one thinking that my old one will give-up soon.</li>
            <li> The package does come with a little bottle of oil for the blades but mineral oil works fine to.</li>
            <li> The package does come with a little bottle of oil for the blades but mineral oil works fine to.</li>
            <li> makers, who state they have been used by professionals since 1919,  further claim that the shaver will provide 3 in 1 grooming with 2 x more power than previous electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> We opened the box, and were stuck right there, for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Floats freely over beard, with little pulling of beard.  </li>
            <li> It cost only a little more than what the replacement head would have cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, to be clear, I purchased the 9937, Wahl Triple Play Lithium Ion Shaver/Trimmer/Detailer.</li>
            <li> It offers flex and float technology in which the shaver head conforms to the contours of the users’ face, chin and neck for a close, painless shave.  </li>
            <li> SO FAR.</li>
            <li> This triple head seems underpowered and ineffective compared to the old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as performance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But Still the old one goes well.</li>
            <li> but it does not give me anywhere near the irritation around my lower neck so in that instance I have to recommend the triple play if you&#x27;re susceptible to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amount of \\&quot;noise\\&quot; comes directly from the shaving head.</li>
            <li> The amount of \\&quot;noise\\&quot; comes directly from the shaving head.</li>
            <li> that is a very close shave, easily a 10/10 but leaves me irritated, especially on the neck; the irritation is not worth a that extra 1/10.</li>
            <li> it is a little louder than most but not nearly as loud as a micro screen shaver.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used it 10 times, I am confident that after using this shaver over a long period, I&#x27;ll learn to manipulate it to provide equal or better shaves than the higher-priced brand, and over a few years, it will cost me WAY less.</li>
            <li> have a refurbished older Wahl model that looks like it was designed in the sixties (similar to the bump-free model) with a NICAD battery that won&#x27;t die and still gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it to see how many shaves I can get out of it, because usually I just use it once and put it back on the charger.</li>
            <li> In the past i&#x27;ve lost the top plates in various ways.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and that made me skeptical about whether this was worth it, but my buy america feelings are strong and I wanted a three blade circular electric shaver to replace my old side to side vibrating Wahl.  </li>
            <li> I found the heads (shaver, trimmer, detailer) a little tricky at first to put on and take off the main body, but once you get used to it</li>
            <li> I received the shaver a day early and charged it right away and used it to shave and as advertised in less than 2 minutes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but solid in the hand; it doesn&#x27;t creak or crack when held firmly or squeezed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it annoyingly or excessively loud, but it&#x27;s definitely louder than my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, I can get approximately 3-5 full shaves out of a full charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This shaver is also easier to clean than the other (more expensive) brand.  </li>
            <li> This is one powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m back to the old model.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NOTE: If you are going to shave your lower neck, go \\&quot;gently\\&quot; and softly--it can catch and cut your skin if you&#x27;re not careful, or not used to using an electric razor.</li>

            <li> I concur with some of the other reviews that complain that this razor does not shave very well.</li>
            <li> And, even once assembled, my husband wouldn’t go near it for another very long time.  </li>
            <li> The replacement shaver head worked fine for a few months until the little dot cover that goes in the middle of each of the three shaving saucers fell out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I tested how long the battery would go on a single charge by using the shaver/trimmer just like I normally would, except when I was done I didn&#x27;t plug it back in.</li>
            <li> I got a 9880 (bad reviews) razor instead of the 9937 (good</li>
            <li> The original shaver head was dropped and broken (my fault entirely).</li>

            <li> The shave was quieter than my old Wahl, was faster and missed less hairs, and shaved just as close.  </li>
            <li> However, I found that spending a few extra minutes helped me to get as close a shave as my old Norelco.</li>

            <li> The shaver is plastic, but it is not cheap like some claim.</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe it was sloppy shipping that caused my last replacement to come damaged--it did not come in a box, but was sloppily thrown in with some packing peanuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided to go back to using my triple play razor after I got the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s pushing that hard on the shaver head, but I was pushing the shaver head fairly firm against my skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t in the past shave every day but have to for this razor to work well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also an AC charger, a comb, small bottle of oil, cleaning brush, and case to hold it all on your table, vanity, or sinktop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I received the Wahl on June 5th.  I charged it for one hour and promptly misplaced the charger.  Today is July 6 and I still have not had to re-charge the shaver!  (I found the charger, however.)  I do not have a tough beard, but I do shave at least once a day, so the life of the charge appears to be superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl is VERY lightweight, leading some people to think it is not well built, but I believe it is plenty sturdy unless one throws it around.  It just doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;man feel&amp;#34; of a Norelco or a Remington.  It took me a number of shaves for my face to get used to the cut, even though I have been shaving with a rotary for years.  I shave completely dry with no water or pre-shave, so someone else may break it in better with preshave lotion.  Now I have no problem getting a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; shape, it takes a few shaves to get used to the long handle, but now I grip it closer to the head and have no troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product with an amazing battery.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair with Wahl clippers for years, so I thought I&#x27;d try their razor.  A mistake, I threw it away and bought another Norelco.  I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave.  The motor seemed under sized and made more noise than the Norelco.  Having to change the head to trim my sideburns was awkward compared to flipping up a built in trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Wahl 9937 Lithium Ion Triple Play is advertised by its makers as the world’s first no compromise full size shaver, trimmer, and detailer, giving you everything you need for all your grooming needs.  It is further advertised as giving the user up to 45 uses on a full charge, for nearly 2 hours of run time, and having available a 3 minute quick charge feature which will give the user 5 minutes of run time.  A 1 hour charge will give the user 2 hours of run time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makers, who state they have been used by professionals since 1919,  further claim that the shaver will provide 3 in 1 grooming with 2 x more power than previous electric shavers.  It offers flex and float technology in which the shaver head conforms to the contours of the users’ face, chin and neck for a close, painless shave.  Also a precision trimmer and precision detailer.  And a purchasers’ 30-day money back guarantee, with 5 year warranty. They state that the new powerful lithium-ion technology, in addition to offering much more shave time for lesser charging time, is the only available heavy-duty shaver on the retail market, with up to 2x the torque of ordinary shavers.  The item has also won an energy star for its thrifty energy use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with 16 pieces, including the basic unit; trimmer blade; detail trimmer; beard guide combs, for stubble, medium and full beards; 6-position guide; eyebrow guide; beard comb; cleaning brush; blade oil; foil guard; storage/charge base and travel case.  Some package, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is, in this house, we are senior citizens.  We opened the box, and were stuck right there, for a very long time.  We had to get help in assembling the thing.  And, even once assembled, my husband wouldn’t go near it for another very long time.  Sometimes you can buy too much technology for yourself.  Depends on your tolerance for high-tech.</li>
            <li> For what is advertised, this seems to be a very robust product. However, I&#x27;ve used it for about 4 weeks now and I&#x27;m not thrilled. The shaver itself isn&#x27;t very powerful, and needs many passes before you get a close shave. I had previously used a Braun electric shaver (used it until it died, and bought this Wahl as a replacement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachments work great. Really. But, as a shaver, it just doesn&#x27;t do the job in a very satisfactory way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, it&#x27;s inexpensive. And if you only have enough $ to purchase a shaver, and you&#x27;re not going to be able to wait until you have more $...maybe you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this...maybe?</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty good. I love the different attachments and I like the warranty. Not the closest shave, you have to go over areas repeatedly.</li>
            <li> This was a great product. The heads change out easy and the clippers are as good as a full sized model of hair trimmers.  And you gotta love the quick charge.</li>
            <li> WHILE IT IS LOUDER THAN MY RETIRED ELECTRIC, IT GIVES A GOOD SHAVE.  I LIKE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE GROOMING HEADS FOR OTHER HAIR TRIMMING NEEDS.  GREAT PRODUCT SO FAR.</li>
            <li> If you shave every day and have light hair growth it would be fine. I didn&#x27;t in the past shave every day but have to for this razor to work well. Anything more then 2 days growth and you are pulling hair. It works fine if a take the extra time to shave slowely and methodically. I personally won&#x27;t buy it again, it&#x27;s not for my shaving habits.</li>
            <li> the razor in this package seems designed for a teenager&#x27;s fine whiskers. This forty-something user had a difficult time getting a decent shave. The problem is the slots on the three floating heads are too narrow. I had positive experience with another Wahl razor, the 4000, but this unit is disappointing.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m a great Wahl fan.&lt;br /&gt;I was struck by how the build quality was not up to usual Wahl standards.&lt;br /&gt;I have a refurbished older Wahl model that looks like it was designed in the sixties (similar to the bump-free model) with a NICAD battery that won&#x27;t die and still gives a close shave. It sometimes irritates if you push to hard and I wanted a replacement that was more modern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to the old model. This triple head seems underpowered and ineffective compared to the old one. the motor lacks speed and torque in the shaver mode. It does not give me an acceptable shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper attachment is a plus, though. In fact I&#x27;m suprised that it works so well when the shaver is so bad. Still, for the price I want a shaver, not a clipper - trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep meaning to call Wahl and see what they can do for me, they are a great US made company and I want to suppoort and love their products. If I get a good response will post more later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend for shaver underperformance.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my fiancé and he loves it.  Got quality, handle, and very close shave.  He would recommend it to anyone looking for a good all in one clipper set.</li>
            <li> Got this to replace a worn out shaver I had. I like the different attachment to it and all. Battery has a very long run time. My only complaint is the shaver head it dosn&#x27;t give a close shave like my old rotatory razor did.</li>
            <li> I had been shaving with a blade but I wanted to try an electric razor again.  The Wahl fit the need perfectly being 3 tools in one and having a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m still getting a bit of irritation - something I&#x27;ve had previously with electrics but it seems to go away in a few weeks, I do like the ability to switch heads and trim side burns and mustache with the other clippers.  The razor feels light, but that could be simply because they are not heavy ni-cad batterys.  It works just fine.  The countertop holder is a bit light, but it too works OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and for a US backed company with support staff (who I&#x27;ve never called) in the US I&#x27;ll give it five stars.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this all the time, he thinks it does a great job, but storage is a problem, it has to sit on the sink top</li>
            <li> I had high expectations since the manufacturer has made fine products I still use. This was a complete let down. After fully charging it the power was so low that it simply didn&#x27;t cut. I had to go out and buy a competitors product the next day.</li>
            <li> I got a 9880 (bad reviews) razor instead of the 9937 (good reviews)&lt;br /&gt;Nice isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;The package looks like the one on the picture, everything looks the same except when you read the razor identification on the razor itself...</li>
            <li> Worst shaver ever. ..</li>
            <li> This is one powerful little trimmer. It hold a charge for a long time and never slows down with a bit of thick stuff to get through. All the attachments are okay but I primarily use the foil shaver and the small and large blades for trimming. This is probably one of the better trimmers I have had. The tray to hold everything is garbage however so all the attachments have to be thrown into the bag and riffled through to find one. All-in-all, I like it.</li>
            <li> He says does not work well when thick.</li>
            <li> If look at the reviews for this item, the Wahl 9880-100 and 9880-200, most of those reviews would have you think this family of products is utter junk. I almost didn&#x27;t purchase this product for fear of wasting my money because of the reviews. However, because I was looking for an all in one shaver/clipper and didn&#x27;t find anything else similar on the market that I liked, I took a chance on the Wahl. And while many have been unhappy with this product, I can say that I&#x27;m glad I purchased it (or, glad my wife bought it for me as a gift :D ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, to be clear, I purchased the 9937, Wahl Triple Play Lithium Ion Shaver/Trimmer/Detailer. It consists of the the main handle/body, a triple head shaver attachment, clipper attachment, and detail clipper attachment. There are 4 clipper guides; I&#x27;m not sure if the lengths are the same as Wahl&#x27;s hair clippers, but there&#x27;s a No 1, 2, 3, and fourth guide which is 6-position adjustable. The detail trimmer also came with a guide for trimming eyebrows and detailing goatees. There&#x27;s also an AC charger, a comb, small bottle of oil, cleaning brush, and case to hold it all on your table, vanity, or sinktop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews mentioned this shaver was plasticky, light, and cheap feeling. It&#x27;s definitely made of plastic, and it&#x27;s light; however, I don&#x27;t feel as though it&#x27;s cheap. It&#x27;s light, but solid in the hand; it doesn&#x27;t creak or crack when held firmly or squeezed. I found the heads (shaver, trimmer, detailer) a little tricky at first to put on and take off the main body, but once you get used to it it&#x27;s not at all difficult. You basically have to lay one edge of the attachment against the corresponding edge of the body and then tilt/rock it until it snaps into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as performance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The battery worked right out of the box. However, outside of testing it out, I left it to charge overnight before I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some have claimed that that battery doesn&#x27;t last very long. I haven&#x27;t tested it to see how many shaves I can get out of it, because usually I just use it once and put it back on the charger. If you&#x27;re traveling, however, the AC adapter isn&#x27;t large, and it comes with a travel bag which is large enough to hold everything. If I decide to test the battery across multiple shaves, I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some have claimed the shaver head is flimsy, and falls off easily. I&#x27;m not sure who&#x27;s pushing that hard on the shaver head, but I was pushing the shaver head fairly firm against my skin and I didn&#x27;t have a problem. At no time did the head feel like it was going to fall off the body of the razor. For those that are having this problem, I would suggest \\&quot;choking up\\&quot; on the handle like a baseball bat, so that your forefinger and thumb are sitting on the \\&quot;neck\\&quot; of the shaver attachment; this grip might help keep the head from popping off. However, your mileage may vary, because as I said, I didn&#x27;t have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some have claimed the shaver&#x27;s shave isn&#x27;t close compared to competitors. I agree that the head doesn&#x27;t seem to be as efficient at getting a close shave as some others. However, I found that spending a few extra minutes helped me to get as close a shave as my old Norelco. I also found that pressing too hard made it worse, as it would bog down the blades and prevent them from cutting efficiently. Let the razor do the work. Also, I never had a problem with hair getting pulled instead of cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The clipper and detailer blades are classic Wahl. Cut is clean and crisp, no pulling. Guides snap on and off easily, but stay put when in use on the blade. Made quick work of trimming my goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Some have reported this shaver to be noisy. It is. I don&#x27;t find it annoyingly or excessively loud, but it&#x27;s definitely louder than my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Although the accessories (shaver guides, brush, case/caddy, etc.) are made in China, the razor itself is made in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and rate it 4 stars. It&#x27;s a quality item, made in the US, for a price which is very competitive given its multi-functionality. It would get 5 stars if the razor head was just a little bit faster at getting a close shave. Wahl also offers a free lifetime blade replacement (once every 18 months). In addition, the attachments for the other All-in-one products in this family are interchangeable. I&#x27;m thinking about calling Wahl and ordering the circular ear/nose trimmer; I could use the detailer, but a blade designed for this purpose will be far more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps others to be informed consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I tested how long the battery would go on a single charge by using the shaver/trimmer just like I normally would, except when I was done I didn&#x27;t plug it back in. Doing this, I was able to get more than satisfactory performance from the Wahl for 5 days. I actually shaved with it for a 6th day without charging as well, but on Day 6 the battery charge was to the point where I didn&#x27;t get the shave I would&#x27;ve liked. However, after a 5 minute quick charge I was able to finish the job on Day 6. Not enough to go on vacation for a week without a charger, but OK for a long weekend. Also note that Wahl claims a charge to last 45-50 minutes of continuous use, and if you take 9-10 minutes to shave per day, then 5 days comes out to about Wahl&#x27;s stated runtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, hope it helps.</li>
            <li> Update 12/10/2013:  The included brochure cautions that one should wait at least 10 shaves to get used to the shaver.  After more than 20 shaves, I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I thought it would.  There are a few areas where it doesn&#x27;t shave well at all (under sideburns, philtrum).  I&#x27;ve lowered the review from 4 stars to 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works pretty well and the multiple attachments are a nice bonus.  The BIG bonus is with the LIFETIME replacement heads.  I used another brand for 10 years, and its heads became so crummy that I was desperate to find a shaver which didn&#x27;t cost so much in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is also easier to clean than the other (more expensive) brand.  Although I&#x27;ve only used it 10 times, I am confident that after using this shaver over a long period, I&#x27;ll learn to manipulate it to provide equal or better shaves than the higher-priced brand, and over a few years, it will cost me WAY less.</li>
            <li> I love the shaver. It is amazing, passed my expectations. I would recommend it to anyone. Wahl has good products. I have several.</li>
            <li> Horrible product, bought it in mid February and it died mid may. Bought primarily for shaving my head which it did fine the first time, but then died before it could finish the job a 2nd time even though it was fully charged, and had been very well taking care of for that short time period! Worst money I have spent in a long time, please do yourself a favor and get something that is going to last.</li>
            <li> This is a good deal....I read about this model finishing third in top three shavers available on market today. (The other models were in the $200 range..vs. $50)&lt;br /&gt;I never used a rotary shaver before, but its a very good shave! I would have given it five stars, but it feels a bit too plastic, and it is a little noisy (like a rattle). ....but I would buy another one for sure!  The best electric shave I ever had!</li>
            <li> I had bought this 2 years ago, I lost my adapter in travelling. I bought a new one thinking that my old one will give-up soon. But Still the old one goes well. Still charging time is 3-4 minutes, time between charges is more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that Wahl&#x27;s product is what I expect. Would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product. It gets the job done. However there is nothing to make it more than average, thus the three star rating. Seems to lack power when using the shaving attachment. Edit: Do not buy. Not only does it struggle to muster the power to shave, it also died on me after 6 months of using it once a week. Quality is terrible. Only reason I kept it so long was because I didn&#x27;t want to go out and spend another $50. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Update Apr. 5, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver now for a full year so here&#x27;s an updated review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- This is still the only shaver that does not irritate my skin. I have thick, black facial hair and it cuts through it without a problem. I do not use pre-shave lotions or oils.  Remember to go against the grain, alternating circular and straight motions and it&#x27;ll give you a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- If 10/10 is the perfect, blade close, against-the-grain-smooth shave, this will give me a 8/10 if I shave _before_ I wash my face or shower, it&#x27;ll give a 9/10 if I shave after a wash or shower. The closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had is with my Wahl Bump Free micro screen shaver--that is a very close shave, easily a 10/10 but leaves me irritated, especially on the neck; the irritation is not worth a that extra 1/10. I keep the micro screen shaver as my \\&quot;backup\\&quot; and use this Triple Play as my daily driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wahl has excellent customer service. I&#x27;ve had to deal with them at least twice in the last year regarding the shaver head and each time they&#x27;ve been very nice and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The original shaver head was dropped and broken (my fault entirely). I was sent a replacement head, the replacement head was defective; I was sent another shaver head. The replacement shaver head worked fine for a few months until the little dot cover that goes in the middle of each of the three shaving saucers fell out. I had to superglue it back in and it&#x27;s been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Per the instructions, I wash the shaver blades under a running cold faucet--I do this on average every other day and it keeps the blades working well and odorless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The battery lasts a long time, I can get approximately 3-5 full shaves out of a full charge. When the battery dies (it has a few times) while I&#x27;m shaving, just plug it in, wait five minutes, and it gives you enough of a charge to finish shaving. It only takes one hour to charge the battery to full and the charger itself is small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The clipper attachments are great but the real awesome part is buying the micro screen \\&quot;detail\\&quot; shaver from Wahl directly--it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s great for getting in and around beards or sideburns. It&#x27;s a great attachment, I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Noise wise it is a little louder than most but not nearly as loud as a micro screen shaver. Long or short hairs are not a problem. If you begin to feel a \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; sensation, you&#x27;re moving the shaver too fast. I&#x27;ve found that the slower and smoother I move the shaver, \\&quot;kissing\\&quot; the skin rather than rubbing it with the shaver, the better the shave and fewer \\&quot;rough spots\\&quot; I have to go back touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all. Barring a complete product failure, I think this will conclude my reviews from here on out. I will say that this is the only shaver that does not irritate my skin and that&#x27;s why I continue to use it. It&#x27;s got a terrific warranty and a generous blade replacement policy. I&#x27;m delighted with it and continue to recommend it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating upgraded from 4/5 to 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Jan 26, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working great, no issues to speak of. The replacement shave head Wahl sent me has been working just fine, and I&#x27;ve had no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: December 2, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I contacted Wahl about the defective shaver head and the company did the right thing and solve my issue; they were very apologetic, and promised to rectify the situation. The responsiveness of the company had nothing nothing to do with my Amazon review, just a simple email to their customer service department. About a week or so later, a box came via the post office. I opened it, and found two replacement shaving heads for my triple play razor with each in their own individual boxes. This leads me to believe it was sloppy shipping that caused my last replacement to come damaged--it did not come in a box, but was sloppily thrown in with some packing peanuts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I decided to go back to using my triple play razor after I got the replacement heads. I&#x27;ve had no issues with the replacement heads, the only exception being that they changed the design so that the heads do not float the same as they did with the original. While waiting for this issue to be rectified, I decided to try a competitor product, a Norelco, and it worked well except seem to chew up my face, especially around my neck. I never had this particular issue with irritation and the triple play razor but I can see why they made the change to the razor head. Frankly, I am unable to get any sort of irritation on my neck or face with this razor while the Norelco can chew up my neck if I&#x27;m not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By comparison, it is a tad noisier than Norelco shaver but it does not give me anywhere near the irritation around my lower neck so in that instance I have to recommend the triple play if you&#x27;re susceptible to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing my rating to 4/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 9.18.2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it died. I accidentally dropped the shaving head, and it broke. I contacted the company to order another one and they graciously sent me a replacement piece free of charge. It took over a week for me to receive it but it came as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny box it came in made had the shaving head loosly held in there by styraphome packing peanuts--It didn&#x27;t give me a great feeling that care was used in packing something this fragile. The shaving head looks different, it does not tilt like the original one. I tried it out and it worked fine for about five minutes before it started making a horrible screaching noise (See video). I have no idea why it is making this noise but it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I e-mailed the company and haven&#x27;t heard back from them since. I also sent them a copy of the video. I don&#x27;t know what to say except that I am disappointed in the product quality here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating down to 1/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking elsewhere for a replacement shaver, probably a Norelco, and will use this as a simple trimmer on occasion. Sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update 7.27.2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong... As before, the battery life is pretty good. I charge it about once, maybe twice a week and it gives me a solid shave. As a suggestion, I noticed that by alternating the pattern of my shave (think: \\&quot;wax on, wax off\\&quot;), it takes a lot less time to get a close shave. Keeping the blades clean helps a lot, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update 6.23.2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still an excellent shaver. No complaints. The battery life is pretty phenomenal, actually...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Update 5.11.2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after using this razor for a few weeks now, I have some conclusions and advice to share for those who are thinking about giving the Wahl a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First--and I cannot emphasize this enough--clean the blades DAILY. At least every other day, especially if you have a course beard. My beard stubble is akin to wire mesh--it&#x27;s thick, black, and very tough. I tried experimenting with how necessary it is to rinse/clean the blades on a daily vs. semi-daily vs. weekly basis. According to the manual, the manufacturer recommends weekly blade cleanings at the very, very least; it recommends daily cleanings are preferred. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time but some days I&#x27;m in a bigger rush than others so skipping day here and there is no biggie. However, I noticed that the quality of the shave did change. In short, clean the blades daily, go softly and lightly over your skin (against the grain) and it will do a very good job. The longer you don&#x27;t clean the blades, the more trouble it seems to have getting over the stubble (esp. if you have wiry, course beard hair like mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it generally takes me 5-7min to do a good, smooth shave. This includes checking for rough spots and sometimes going back over places that I may have missed (hey, it&#x27;s early!). If I do a quicky--zoom-zoom-zoom-done--type of job, I can be done in 2-3 minutes but I will enevitably find a rough spot or two. Shaving right does take a little time with this thing but it&#x27;s worth it. The manufacturer recommends pulling/stretching your skin in places hard to get--this works great; however, go slowly and in a straight line. It will make a difference in your shave. Going in orbital, counter-clockwise circles is fine for a first round shave but I find going in straight lines, against the grain does a better job with less shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the battery will last approximately 3-5 days, depending on how much you use it. I have gotten in the habit of charing mine about every 3-4 days but you can be the best judge of how much/little you need to charge yours. The blades will not wind down but simply \\&quot;stop\\&quot; when the battery is dead. Charging the battery to full only takes an hour but you can charge it for 10 minutes and get a full shave if you haven&#x27;t got the time to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the clippers, namely the eyebrow or detailing head, do a fantastic job around my go-tee. I can really \\&quot;get in and around\\&quot; with it. If nothing else, the clippers do a fantastic job. The package does come with a little bottle of oil for the blades but mineral oil works fine to. I just put a drop every so often on the blades and it keeps them running smoothly and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, rinse your shaving foils after every shave, and place the head on it&#x27;s side, propped open like a book. I leave mine like this after I have rinsed the foils and it dries on its own rather well on the bathroom counter. I know I mentioned this earlier but I cannot say it strongly enough--if you rinse the blades daily, you will get a better, faster shave. Also, if the blades are getting \\&quot;hot\\&quot; while you are shaving, it means you are pushing too hard against the skin. Just let it \\&quot;float\\&quot; across and don&#x27;t be afraid to go back over a spot two or three times just to make sure it&#x27;s smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little shaver, I&#x27;m still very happy with it. Still a 5/5 star purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at a local retailer while looking for replacement electric toothbrush parts if you can believe it. I have never owned an electric razor, ever. I am in my mid-thirties and I have always used a disposable razor with foam while taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is messy, I hate doing it, and I tend to nick myself more often as I have gotten older. Usually I&#x27;ll trap a mole or something and it&#x27;ll bleed like crazy. My wife told me that I should get an electric razor one of these days, so I found this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to other reviewers, it is a little loud--louder than I thought it would be. However, it&#x27;s very smooth and doesn&#x27;t gyrate around or anything. The amount of \\&quot;noise\\&quot; comes directly from the shaving head. If you run it without the shaving head, with nothing on top, the motor itself is almost silent. The noise from turning all those blades probably cannot be helped. That would be the only major criticism I have about this little guy but since this is my first, I do not know if it is louder/software than compareable electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day, I decided to try it out on my day-old stubble and it did a pretty good job. The trick is to use it \\&quot;gently\\&quot; on your skin, don&#x27;t press on it. I followed the instructions to the letter and it gave me a close, smooth shave. The booklet recommends rinsing the blades at least once a week but daily if possible. I can see why. I didn&#x27;t rinse it for about two or three days and it begins to smell so now I rinse it daily and there is no odor. So, definitely follow the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations if you want a good shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: If you are going to shave your lower neck, go \\&quot;gently\\&quot; and softly--it can catch and cut your skin if you&#x27;re not careful, or not used to using an electric razor. The manufacturer is very specific about this in the manual, and recommends \\&quot;stretching\\&quot; your skin outwhen you shave it. It also states in the manual that it can take up to three weeks for your skin to get adjusted to the electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the lower-neck, I made this mistake once....once....it wasn&#x27;t horrible but it can sting a little. Now I gently \\&quot;brush\\&quot; my lower-neck with the shaving head and it takes the hair right off. On my cheeks and face, it&#x27;s no issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been about a week now and I have not had to recharge it, it just keeps going. I tried the trimmer attachment on my go-tee and it cut through it without any problems. I normally have to use an AC-powered hair buzzer to cut through it because my beard hair is thick and wire-like. The Wahl cut through it without a problem, and I didn&#x27;t have to bust out the electrical cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have been very pleased with the assortment of attachments and accessories that it came with. I am very happy with this electric razor and use it daily.b, I can be done in 2-3 minutes but I will enevitably find a rough spot or two. Shaving right does take a little time with this thing but it&#x27;s worth it. The manufacturer recommends pulling/stretching your skin in places hard to get--this works great; however, go slowly and in a straight line. It will make a difference in your shave. Going in orbital, counter-clockwise circles is fine for a first round shave but I find going in straight lines, against the grain does a better job with less shaving time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the battery will last approximately 3-5 days, depending on how much you use it. I have gotten in the habit of charing mine about every 3-4 days but you can be the best judge of how much/little you need to charge yours. The blades will not wind down but simply \\&quot;stop\\&quot; when the battery is dead. Charging the battery to full only takes an hour but you can charge it for 10 minutes and get a full shave if you haven&#x27;t got the time to wait.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, the clippers, namely the eyebrow or detailing head, do a fantastic job around my go-tee. I can really \\&quot;get in and around\\&quot; with it. If nothing else, the clippers do a fantastic job. The package does come with a little bottle of oil for the blades but mineral oil works fine to. I just put a drop every so often on the blades and it keeps them running smoothly and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, rinse your shaving foils after every shave, and place the head on it&#x27;s side, propped open like a book. I leave mine like this after I have rinsed the foils and it dries on its own rather well on the bathroom counter. I know I mentioned this earlier but I cannot say it strongly enough--if you rinse the blades daily, you will get a better, faster shave. Also, if the blades are getting \\&quot;hot\\&quot; while you are shaving, it means you are pushing too hard against the skin. Just let it \\&quot;float\\&quot; across and don&#x27;t be afraid to go back over a spot two or three times just to make sure it&#x27;s smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great little shaver, I&#x27;mstill very happy with it. Still a 5/5 star purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;I bought this at a local retailer while looking for replacement electric toothbrush parts if you can believe it. I have never owned an electric razor, ever. I am in my mid-thirties and I have always used a disposable razor with foam while taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is messy, I hate doing it, and I tend to nick myself more often as I have gotten older.

            <li> bought the shaver 10/12 shave is so so can get free replacement blades(i guess) after 18 mounths use-charged shaver-battery still acting as not charged-went to wahl web site put in model 9937 model not found-i guess i will try their 800# and see if they can find out if i can get a new battery-does not shave close but doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin-</li>
            <li> I concur with some of the other reviews that complain that this razor does not shave very well. Shame on Wahl.</li>
            <li> I have had my Wahl 9937 for over 18 months now. I was looking for replacement heads for my Norelco when I came across this. It cost only a little more than what the replacement head would have cost. As a bonus it was &amp;#34;Made In USA&amp;#34; and had free replacement heads for life. They aren&#x27;t really free, you have to pay a $5.00 handling fee. But, that is way cheaper than buying Norelco replacements. Actually it might be better to say assembled in America. But, Wahl tells me that the only part of the razor itself that is made in China is the battery and the accessory heads that came with the shaver. Most Norelco&#x27;s are made in China, unless you want to pay over $100.00 for one made in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen comments saying the shaver is noisy. Well, to me, it is no louder than a Norelco.I am well satisfied on how long the shaver keeps a charge. As for the accessories that came with it, I have never used them. So, I am not rating them.</li>
            <li> Light weight, compact tool.  Floats freely over beard, with little pulling of beard.  A trifle noisy, but I bought it for the good cut!</li>
            <li> I received the shaver a day early and charged it right away and used it to shave and as advertised in less than 2 minutes I had the closest and best shave I have had in years and I had zero skin irritation which I had with other electric shavers. By far the best shaver I have purchased to date and the price cannot be beat!!!!!.</li>
            <li> The Wahl unit is very noisy and it does not shave very closely.  I liked the fact that Wahl gives you lifetime free blades every 18 months.  Braun shaving screens break easily and then give you a nasty face cut and Norelco&#x27;s are so-so on how close they shave.  Braun should spend some money and make the screens out of better material but they probably have it figured in to their business equation that the screens will fail every so often and you will be forced to buy one of the grossly overpriced new cutting screens, reminds me of why HP sells color ink jet printers so cheaply.  The Wahl did not shave closely.  I can not remember what kind of battery is in the Wahl but any manufacturer who sells you a product with a nickel-metal hydride battery instead of a lithium-ion battery is just being cheap with you.  Nickel metal hydride batteries develop memories that degrade performance.  Lithium ion batteries are not perfect but they are better.  Kevin L.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and that made me skeptical about whether this was worth it, but my buy america feelings are strong and I wanted a three blade circular electric shaver to replace my old side to side vibrating Wahl.  The shave was quieter than my old Wahl, was faster and missed less hairs, and shaved just as close.  I like the lifetime blade replacement as those replacement blades can be expensive. I also like the attachments for trimming.  No problems with head coming off during shaving.  Some things like the oil and carrying case are made in china, but Wahls are the the only shaver I know that is Made in the USA.  Price is comparable to a basic Norelco.</li>
            <li> This electric razor has plenty of power and provides a very close shave. The bang for your buck is definitely here.</li>
            <li> Love this razor! Been shaving with Norelco rotary razors for over 30 years but hated paying the same price for replacment blades as the cost of the razor itself, those who complained of its light weight is a plus for me and its only because of the newer style battery and yes I  would not want to drop this razor to the floor because of the plastic its made of compared to Norelco it more than makes up for the smooth shave, my beard is so strong it would kill disposable razor in one shave, I&#x27;ve  always had Wahl trimmers for my beard and now I  have it all in one razor. I also maintain a mohawk hair cut and its perfect fot that too. Im so happy I  ignored the negative gripes about this product. I  highly recommend it</li>
            <li> our son wanted this shaver so we got it for his christmas. don&#x27;t really know exactly why he likes it so much but i do know he has had problems with razors in the past--bumps, burns, etc. when i inquired about the wahl lithium shaver, he said, &#x27;i love it!&#x27; he has some facial hair that he trims &amp; some he eliminates &amp; appearantly this does it all.</li>
            <li> Great Shaver! I can&#x27;t manually shave to save my life lol, so I&#x27;ve always used electric shavers. I got my Wahl  rotary shaver a day early, great job, in perfect condition with everything as specified. Made in the USA. Big win! Why I bought it. Box is a little odd to open, but once you figure it out it&#x27;s very straight forward. Rip that baby out essentially! All the parts came in an orderly manner. It all smelled new too. Like it should. Plastic parts are ALL well done, with NO manufacturing flaws like plastic burrs. The shaver is plastic, but it is not cheap like some claim. It has a really solid feel to it. Really solid! After the initial hr. charge on it, it&#x27;s time to see if it will survive my thick beard. First to trim it down. The instructions are NOT intuitive, but looking at it you can figure it out in under 2 minutes. To get the heads off you just have to slide the rotary heads off. The trimmer only fits one way. Fool proof. It blasted my 3 month winter beard down in less then a minute. NEVER saw a trimmer/shaver blast through my thick winter beard like this did. It&#x27;s a glutton for punishment I swear. Didn&#x27;t bog down either. Just kept hammering through it.  When it was a good bit  better then stubble length (I purposely put it to the torture test by leaving my beard a bit longer then I should have) I slide the trimmer off, and got the rotary heads on. Like the Thunder of the Gods it went to work! Yes it did! Never bogged down, just asked if I could  hammer on it some more. UNREAL! Virtually no pulling. VERY SMOOTH!  It had been years since I used a rotary so I took a minute to perfect my technique. Once that happened, it roared through my 1/4 inch beard like nobody&#x27;s business. Glutton for punishment! The shaver produces a bit of noise, but no more then other rotary shavers. It&#x27;s what you want. Something that simply SOUNDS like it MEANS  business. And it does! Hammered my beard! Clean up was a bit tricky. I discovered I had to use the brush to loosen it up, thenI put the top plate back down, gave it a little tap, and most of it fell out. Clean up was pretty easy. Oh, and the top plate is pure genius. In the past i&#x27;ve lost the top plates in various ways. There&#x27;s no way to loose it. It has a swing up mechanism that keeps it from getting lost even by clumsy fingers......like mine lol! If ur looking a great rotary/trimmer shaver......this is it! Bar none the best shaver i&#x27;ve had since my first Remington in the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
