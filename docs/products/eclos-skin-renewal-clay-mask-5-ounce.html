            <li>Tights up you skin and leaves it nice and clean ready for the follow up treatment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to me!</li>
            <li>First of all, it advertises as no perfumes added; yet, the package had a strong chemical smell before I even opened it.</li>
            <li>Great product that really makes my face look much younger than 36.</li>
            <li>-- I&#x27;m sure everyone will vary by skin type; however, I do find my skin super soft after this mask.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up at Walgreens because it seemed like it had more natural ingredients</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth for the prize you pay.</li>
            <li>Saw the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>after my initial use, i had very smooth skin</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and clean after use.  </li>

            <li>(I really like that).  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of plugged pores fast.</li>
            <li>and after taking it out washing my face with warm water my face feels really clean; (I did not came up with the idea of leaving it one the whole night just happen by mistake); but in the morning when I went to take it off afraid because I realize that I did not washed my face before going to sleep my face looked and felt different, I like the sensation of my face clean; because of my very oily skin after taking off this product I really feel it clean; and to avoid dryness I use a moisturizer after taking this one off.</li>
            <li>Makes all of the other creams I have used seem like they are mostly chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has been very gentle for me.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it stings the moment you apply it on your face and made my skin look bright red (having kept it on for 5 minutes only - the suggested time is 5 to 10 minutes</li>
            <li>And I will definitely recommended for very oily skin like mine (obviously not the way I use it); but I still recommend it. :)</li>

            <li> I will put his one on it and after 2 or 3 days it will be visible dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few months and not regularly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few face masks in the past, but I highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> w/the other products (i.e. regenerative cream and face serum)</li>
            <li> Often, I find clay masks encourage breakouts &amp; other redness after using them.  </li>
            <li> Eclos is all I use and my wrinkles are less and my chin is sharp and I am 70.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s not filled with fragrances like other packet masks that I&#x27;ve used from CVS &amp; other chains).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be less abrasive, along with checking out reviews here.</li>
            <li> My skin was tighten and wrinkles less visible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure what it was.</li>
            <li> And I lend you a little secret whenever I have a pimple on my face</li>
            <li> I use the scrub and the clay mask twice a month at least.</li>
            <li> I instantly wiped it off with cold water because I&#x27;ve never had a mask burn my face like that, not even a mint mask.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use it at least once a week</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any facial mask is meant to cause such a terrible skin reaction, so I believe it might have been an allergic reaction to some ingredient</li>
            <li> This is a terrible facial mask.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s faint.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It firms up my face.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few months and not regularly but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> No need for sub-zero.  Eclos is all I use and my wrinkles are less and my chin is sharp and I am 70. Great for us mature women!</li>
            <li> This whole line of stem cell products are incredible.  I&#x27;m really loving them all.  It&#x27;s a great facial collection and worth much more than charged.</li>
            <li> I have been using the entire Eclos system for about six months, and even though I still prefer Aveda&#x27;s mud mask, this mask definitely came in a close second. After rinsing, my skin feels baby smooth and my complexion looks more even.</li>
            <li> I use the scrub and the clay mask twice a month at least. It is a big difference right away. My makeup goes on smoother and even my neck looks tighter after.</li>
            <li> Love these products. They just feel &amp; smell good &amp; natural. Makes all of the other creams I have used seem like they are mostly chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in this that makes my skin instantly burn. I picked this up at Walgreens because it seemed like it had more natural ingredients and whatnot so I thought it would be less abrasive, along with checking out reviews here. I followed directions and applied it after cleansing my face, and within seconds it began burning and making my eyes water and I had barely gotten it on my nose and cheeks. I instantly wiped it off with cold water because I&#x27;ve never had a mask burn my face like that, not even a mint mask. I looked at the ingredients for some kind of fragrance or anything that could have caused irritation but I&#x27;m not sure what it was. Anyway, I wanted this to work because of all the rave reviews so I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a good clay face mask for a while now and this one does the trick! The product leaves my face leaving refreshed. Does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin feels so soft and clean after use.  It makes me look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> This products are so magnific, you can feel the difference in your face. It&#x27;s worth for the prize you pay.</li>
            <li> when this was ordered, my face had started to have here &amp; there issues of enlarged pores. after my initial use, i had very smooth skin and my pores had noticeably shrunk (however not disappeared) but i figured w/regular usage in tandem w/the other products (i.e. regenerative cream and face serum) hopefully i am on the right road for better toned skin.&lt;br /&gt;will keep you posted!</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes my face look younger! My eye wrinkles disappeared within about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the only face mask I will use. I have tried several others and they all cause me to have breakouts. The Eclos Skin Renewal Clay Mask is by far the best. The mask feels great while applying, hardens up fairly quickly, and is easy to rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot find this locally at CVS any longer so I have to buy from Amazon now. Even though it&#x27;s a little more pricey on Amazon, I will still buy it. It&#x27;s worth it to me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this one for a little while now, and I love it, I applied every night after I take a shower and most of the times I leave it on all night; in the morning I do my cleaning routine and after that the red spots that I have on my face are a lot less red, my face really feels clean and rejuvenate.&lt;br /&gt;I should clarify that in the directions it says that it has to be on the face for 5 to 10 minutes but I have try that and after taking it out washing my face with warm water my face feels really clean; (I did not came up with the idea of leaving it one the whole night just happen by mistake); but in the morning when I went to take it off afraid because I realize that I did not washed my face before going to sleep my face looked and felt different, I like the sensation of my face clean; because of my very oily skin after taking off this product I really feel it clean; and to avoid dryness I use a moisturizer after taking this one off. I don&#x27;t use it every night; but every 3 days. And I lend you a little secret whenever I have a pimple on my face I will put his one on it and after 2 or 3 days it will be visible dry. It works for my and I just wanted to share that one with you. You all know your skin and should know what is good and  work and what it is not.&lt;br /&gt;I repeat it works for me!. And I will definitely recommended for very oily skin like mine (obviously not the way I use it); but I still recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> for the price,  you have to try this,  start with exfoliated skin,  I used my clarisonic,  then apply and let work for an hour,  great product to have for special events ,  or just because you deserve it !  would make a wonderful gift for the &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; girlfriend in your life.</li>
            <li> Love it! Tights up you skin and leaves it nice and clean ready for the follow up treatment.</li>
            <li> This mask is wonderful.  It goes on smoothly and you can feel it tightening (I really like that).  Dries in about 10 minutes and washes off easily.  And...skin feels great afterwards.  What more could you ask!</li>
            <li> Great product that really makes my face look much younger than 36. I would definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible facial mask. First of all, it advertises as no perfumes added; yet, the package had a strong chemical smell before I even opened it. Secondly, it stings the moment you apply it on your face and made my skin look bright red (having kept it on for 5 minutes only - the suggested time is 5 to 10 minutes (I will upload some pictures, so that you have some idea what I am talking about). I don&#x27;t think any facial mask is meant to cause such a terrible skin reaction, so I believe it might have been an allergic reaction to some ingredient (I have only twice in my entire life had an allergic reaction to a facial product). I took some antihistamine drug and the bright red spots had disappeared by the next day; however, my skin did break badly. Overall, I see no reason why anyone should use this product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at Target, but was unable to find it there again so I looked for it online.  My daughter and I use it at least once a week and I love the way my skin feels afterward.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of plugged pores fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight mask that doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell. It smells natural and clean but it&#x27;s faint. I have sensitive skin and this has been very gentle for me. My skin looks and feels cleaner and I love that it&#x27;s a natural product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few face masks in the past, but I highly recommend this one.  It smells GREAT (and it&#x27;s not filled with fragrances like other packet masks that I&#x27;ve used from CVS &amp; other chains).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I find that my skin cannot take the \\&quot;two times a week\\&quot; recommendation in the directions -- I&#x27;m sure everyone will vary by skin type; however, I do find my skin super soft after this mask.  Also, it did reduce the appearance of my pores.  5/5 for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;If I want my skin to look great for a particular day, I make sure to use this mask two days before the event.  Often, I find clay masks encourage breakouts &amp; other redness after using them.  By the second day my skin looks perfect.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Saw the difference right away.  My skin was tighten and wrinkles less visible.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed using this product.  It has a pleasant smell and makes a visible difference.  The price can&#x27;t be beat either.</li>
