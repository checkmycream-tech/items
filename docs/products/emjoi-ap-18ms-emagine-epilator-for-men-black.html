            <li>Am VERY happy with quality of it.</li>
            <li>I was initially impressed with performance.  </li>
            <li>This product advertised hairlessness for 6 weeks, which would have been perfect.</li>
            <li>Awesome, works well, lasts long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been an awesome product</li>

            <li>and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is the best men&#x27;s epilator out there.</li>
            <li>The best epilator I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>All in all, very happy that I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Buy it, its good!!!!</li>
            <li>IF you can endue the pain, it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY happy with this purchase and would suggest anyone that hates shaving to give epliation a try.  </li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>Works great totally impressed by the quality and performance</li>
            <li>After a good 7-10 passes over a sparse patch of hair it did not remove it all!  </li>
            <li>If this thing ever wears out, I will automatically by another, its that good!</li>
            <li>this product is simply beautiful.</li>
            <li>This product is a great alternative to laser hair removal for men.</li>
            <li>BUT for all that I will say it does a great job.</li>
            <li>It did work great in the stomach area.</li>
            <li>This is actually a great option when you have not time for waxing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happily using the Emjoi Optima for over 10 years which was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>and I figured Emjoi was the go-to brand since I was so happy with my optima.  </li>
            <li>My hair growth has been greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>lol expect what you have gotten.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>This would work great if the government wanted torcher someone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been happy with the Emjoi brand, so went with this brand again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just another GREAT epilator by Emjoi.  </li>
            <li>When it works, it works great, but I would probably not purchase this unit again.</li>
            <li>Rips all the hairs out and works great.</li>
            <li>This unit was very effective, did what was advertised</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does remove the hair very good, excellent, smooth feeling once hair is removed.</li>
            <li>I did more researching,  and this was the best product on the market, or</li>
            <li>the most part it is probably the best product on the market.</li>
            <li>This is probably best for someone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the ap-18 is the best and most effective epilator I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>, I can take the pain.&amp;#34; I finished my good.</li>
            <li>It does a good job</li>
            <li>It removed a good majority of the hairs.</li>
            <li>This is good unit...</li>
            <li>Their epilators are just superior to the Emjoi Emagine and Emjoi eRase.</li>
            <li>Now for what&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my neck and cheekbones to get rid of fine hairs, and it works incredibly well for that, too.</li>
            <li>All in all the Emjoi Emagine is a great device, and I am glad I went with the version for men despite the fact that I am female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much more than waxing!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The price at Amazon was amazing.</li>
            <li>And it makes me look amazing</li>
            <li>its amazing</li>
            <li>Nice machine</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the results, it won&#x27;t be as perfect as waxing but you can touch up as needed.</li>
            <li>So my honest review is as follows.</li>
            <li>And it feels nice in the shower.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of tricky in some places.</li>
            <li>To each their own.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if Emjoi could design a head</li>
            <li>This is a honest review i have it used here</li>
            <li>The epilator was effective.  </li>
            <li>really nice touch is that the epilator comes with an electric razor attachment.</li>
            <li>though died and I paid 119usd for it and just bought a Remington at Target for 49usd and its just as effective.</li>
            <li>I am hair free and loving it!  </li>
            <li>the Emjoi Emagine is by far the best epilator i have used!</li>
            <li>I honestly wish I would have used one of these many years ago.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you want to show off your newly-smooth chest right away, but it&#x27;s a great long-term investment.</li>
            <li>Nothing is more important than looking good, believe me...</li>
            <li>Lets just say it feels very cheap.  </li>
            <li>the area is very smooth.</li>
            <li>It also seems to break as many hairs as it pulls out.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>all I love this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks, this is a great product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s head is curved but that actually is more of an inconvenience in my opinion since you&#x27;ll have to end up manipulating your skin to get some of the areas you want.</li>
            <li>I get more in-grown hairs from this epilator than a $35 dollar epilator</li>
            <li>but I was even able to epilate my balls it did hurt a bit</li>
            <li>Over all I love it.</li>
            <li>Saw this interesting model with a Cooling  Metal Head, 72 tweezers and all.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I thought if my wife can do this....</li>
            <li>but what you would do for love.</li>
            <li>If you intend to use the emjoi 4 Men, you better be a man and handle the pain like one.</li>
            <li>Our hair is thicker and more</li>
            <li>Much better than the temporary fix of shaving.</li>
            <li>I love how it looks now.</li>
            <li>As you know some areas will be more sentive.</li>
            <li>I bought the men&#x27;s color  version because often times, they are stronger and more durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I kept it up then it would get better</li>
            <li>the was more efficient in removing hair.</li>
            <li>Works better then cheaper models.  </li>
            <li>so hopefully it will make more skin contact and remove more hairs rather than break them.  </li>
            <li>so you had to figure out the magic angle to get it to be powered at all.</li>
            <li>and I still haven&#x27;t gotten around to the touching up</li>
            <li>You will end up ripping out more hairs without their follicle.</li>
            <li>This seems more sturdy.  </li>
            <li>In the summer months I take off most off my body hair.</li>
            <li>It still works way better than the Emagine.</li>
            <li>I feel that waxing or tweezing would give better</li>
            <li>I found that I could not predict what body parts would hurt the most.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>Takes way too many passes to pluck...</li>
            <li>Most the reviews that talk about pain are are telling the truth.</li>
            <li>it just stopped working, I had to spend more money buying a replacement head</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that it will get easier as time goes by.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite work that way, but this has been much better than shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It would had been even better if it had a charging option.</li>
            <li>Hoping Remington makes better motors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting so that I enjoy the pain part!</li>
            <li>So, i read most of the reviews.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars as the head of the epilator does seem to get as many hairs as the Optima.  </li>
            <li>This was a much better deal than what I would have gotten if I had bought the Emagine for women, which does not include any of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also say it&#x27;s best to epilate after a shower when your pores are relaxed and open, so I gave up on looking for one that was water proof.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>is what I love about this product....</li>
            <li>I even epilate my bikini line now with no issues (something I feared I&#x27;d never be able to tolerate).  </li>
            <li>And Salux is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that does the best job of it!  </li>
            <li>I will ever even consider touching with a razor again</li>
            <li>I has always worked well and safely for me, despite the rotating parts that look like they would do damage.  </li>
            <li>The more you do it the more it is tolerable.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>so it was a pretty good deal all things considered.</li>
            <li>It is great to be hair free for a much longer period of time with no razor stubble.</li>
            <li>recommend the product,&lt;br /&gt;i used it under my arms and private area and works very good, once hair is removed</li>
            <li>I purchased this epilator to remove hair from my torso to be more comfortable shirtless.  </li>
            <li>So far I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope that&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>and I love the look and feel of clean shaven legs.</li>
            <li>It is relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li>It worked fine for 6 months or so, and then the plastic gear under the removable head broke.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just pain, then you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>This thing is quick!</li>
            <li>Pretty good and not very painful.</li>
            <li>Works great and the bets part is that it works very quickly unlike most other epilators out there</li>
            <li>They advertise it as it is supposed to fit the shape and curves of a man&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li>This thing is nice but it hurts so much.</li>
            <li>I bought it with great expectations but sending it back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it in August of 2103.Followed the instructions precisely</li>
            <li>works great, only wish it had a longer handle, and an angled head.</li>
            <li>but it is kinda cheap</li>
            <li>It makes me so smooth and it is luxurious to use.</li>
            <li>but nothing I couldn&#x27;t endure and now I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt</li>
            <li>Using a hair inhibitor afterwards really yields amazing results.</li>
            <li>Every thing is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The heads are both easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to go totally smooth on my legs</li>
            <li>I have course hair so to stay smooth shaving</li>
            <li>So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>The arms went fairly well, and were satisfactorily clear after about 25-30 minutes...</li>
            <li>So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a reason the female version of this epilator is so highly rated--it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>it is so quick and easy to use</li>
            <li>This works quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>However, the return and credit for the purchase was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I had to bend it aroud to fine the sweet spot and tape it to hold it shape and work.</li>
            <li>Because of this it can&#x27;t leave my legs silky smooth, so for special occasions I will still need to shave.</li>
            <li>I still have my original Optima, which still works after years of use.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try the Emagine for Men when my original Emagine stopped working.</li>
            <li>Loved being bare.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that it removed most hair on the first pass either.  </li>
            <li>, I have had several over the years but this unit works best by far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once since I&#x27;ve bought it because my experience the first time wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Usually it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for, but not in this case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a slow passes works best.</li>
            <li>After all,  as soothing as the Cool Metal Head sounds,  nothing</li>
            <li>i did not mind the pain so much but having pain and on top of that not working like its</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think has much power or that many tweetzers.</li>
            <li>The head spins so fast and there are so many tweezers, that the hairs just seem to fall out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use this one, likely because it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>You pay for what you pay for, they might not be full informative in it but</li>
            <li>Any good reviews posted for this product is only by seller of this product.</li>
            <li>Better than the no-no shaver because it really shaves.</li>
            <li>This continued for about two weeks until the hair finally grew out a fair bit.</li>
            <li>Nothing cool about&lt;</li>
            <li>it doesnt hurt much any more and there are plenty of tricks you can do to reduce the pain of epilating.</li>
            <li>I got it mainly for shoulder/back hair to serve as a more efficient method than having a loved one tweeze individually, or spending tons of cash on wax treatments.</li>
            <li>If it lasts 1 year like the original, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>This thing comes with a shaver attachment, which I use on my other lady bits and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>I loved this and works great for me on back then down there...</li>
            <li>I followed the directions perfectly and after 35 passes over the same tiny area on my leg</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a full-time working mother of a rowdy 4yo who loves to swim, and I&#x27;m also heavily pregnant.</li>
            <li>I only use this product on my private areas and Emagine is just not the best product for this.</li>
            <li>The gears are made of plastic, so they&#x27;re bound to wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase - especially when it pays for itself versus paying to get waxed every 5 weeks.</li>
            <li>Returned this epilator quickly.  </li>
            <li>My gf loves my smooth skin and new look!!!</li>
            <li>Initially I was very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>First, the epilator head is made of pig metal and cheap plastic including a plastic drive-gear.  </li>
            <li>Just got it in Came in a nice normal small box, the packaging is great, and im going to see what it is going to feel like.  </li>
            <li>I can still watch TV while epilating though, I just have to turn up the volume more than I normally would.</li>
            <li>Like the mettal head because stay cool and is helpping to calm the area where is working giving some confort.</li>
            <li>Emjoi advertises this model as having a \\&quot;cool touch\\&quot; head that makes it more comfortable to use, but this gets warm pretty quickly, and after about an hour gets irritatingly hot, so I&#x27;ll take a break and let it cool down for a while.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this until the first touch.</li>
            <li>(make sure you pull skin tight because it will pull your skin in and kind of bite you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also have to try my legs and chest again in a few days to make sure that the hair has grown a fair bit, which will hopefully make it easier for the tweezers to easily find, grab and completely pull them.</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to get accustomed to the pulling out of the hair, but it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>If the unit doesn&#x27;t break in a few months than it&#x27;s a great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>it is easy to clean and store away for that smooth look that guys like would recommend in the future a battery rechargeable product</li>
            <li>Be ready for some pain but be ready to love this as well.</li>
            <li>but I preferred to shaving because it last more and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>It works ok but not as good as cheaper ones i have used, the shaver attachment sucks.</li>
            <li>more importantly the amount of time consumed is lesser then as compared with any other.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Now it works seamlessly, and I love it.</li>
            <li>there and around the navel are the only areas that were actually kind of</li>
            <li>Head is noticeably heavier than the original and head stays MUCH cooler during use.</li>
            <li>Right out of the box there&#x27;s a problem.  </li>
            <li>maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right...</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll do it right</li>
            <li>all right.</li>
            <li>Ohwell this is what you bought right?</li>
            <li>areas are pain free and some are not, but once i was done with the first session, the keep-up was very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife loves touching me now that I have no sharp stubble.</li>
            <li>This device makes back grooming ... not painless, but certainly a heck of a lot easier and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I think is useful if your pain resistance is higher than mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like to start off saying that I had high hopes for this product based on numerous good reviews and even a mention in the most current GQ magazine.</li>
            <li>easy to use better than other product</li>
            <li>I guess its cheap materials or some stuff, its the new age guys.</li>
            <li>Stopped working right after the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Very durable and works quickly.</li>
            <li>Very efficient, fast and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean and simple to operate.  </li>
            <li>I regret this purchase very, very much.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure how much I was going to enjoy this product, especially after reading about the pain.  </li>
            <li>The design isn&#x27;t as good as i expected it to be, there is a lot of plastic (it might be high quality tho</li>
            <li>When I first used a epilator it was because my girlfriend had a Remington epilator she bought from Walmart for $30.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always grab all the hairs, many passes in different directions are required to get the job done.</li>
            <li>No device, regardless of quality and features, will be able to physically do anything (massage, stimulate, etc.)</li>
            <li>the mind can overcome anticipatory pain if you let it!ll be able to physically do anything (massage, stimulate, etc.)</li>
            <li>It may work better if you have coarse hair.</li>
            <li>No reason why they could not make a dual one in first place for something which costs 95 us$.</li>
            <li>so just doing something preventative that my skin most likely needs anyway.</li>
            <li>I tried using it on the first day</li>
            <li>But the machine really works!</li>
            <li>The others I have had (women&#x27;s models) needed patience and going over the same spit many times.</li>
            <li>My first experience with an epilator</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with am Epilator.</li>
            <li>found I was enduring a lot of extra pain and effort for a result hardly better than shaving.  </li>
            <li>The enclosed instructions were followed exactly.</li>
            <li>Broke on the first try, quit working.</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate your skin prior to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first epilator.</li>
            <li>My first was an Emjoi Optima.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the Panasonic next time and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li>I suggest that you wax first or do something called sugaring.</li>
            <li>This is the first time i used one things can only get better.</li>
            <li>The first time you use it...expect pain.  </li>
            <li>so this is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this</li>
            <li>I bought this item and used it the first time on July 7th..</li>
            <li>Again, it is pretty bearable unless (I imagine) you point it at your junk...</li>
            <li>I think the guard design is a bit lower on the Optima which seems to get the smaller stubborn hairs better.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was more robust and can last longer.</li>
            <li>I think this was because it was my first time using an epilator, and at times the pain caused me to hold the device improperly.</li>
            <li>The first time was the worst--they took a couple of weeks to go away.</li>
            <li>This results in breakage of the hairs more often than not, rather than pulling them out at the root, sometimes close enough to the skin so they can&#x27;t even be plucked with tweezers.</li>
            <li>;, but I bought it for female use thinking it would be better than the ladies&#x27; versions.  </li>
            <li>The truth is some places on your body will hurt more than others...and it is always the opposite of what you would think.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried one it was bittersweet because I am a hairy man and it hurt so much every millimeter of my arms were covered in hair and often 3 hairs would grow out of one pore!</li>
            <li>only thing is it would have been better if it was chargeable and water proof.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many differences other than the metal head (nice for putting in the fridge then epilating for a cool feel) which is sturdier than the plastic heads from other emjoi products.</li>
            <li>mainly don&#x27;t like this because of how it made me look like I had a full body rash for a whole 3 days and</li>
            <li>The claim of being able to remove hair as short as 0.4mm would appear to be pure marketing hype.</li>
            <li>As a guy with thick hair, the Red one works perfectly and will save you some Cash!  </li>
            <li>Not 100% sure my wife was doing it as gentle as she could have on my back hair</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s not entirely painless, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than it was.</li>
            <li>It works so well that I have gone from chest and stomach to pretty much everywhere else.</li>
            <li>This also happens to pretty much negate my concern over battery life with the Braun model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Additionally, it pretty much negates any increased efficiency</li>
            <li>but I never quite saw the value in it when I could just as easily shave my legs and not have to do it again for several months.</li>
            <li>Also, this epilator very quickly (it takes me 15min min to do my chest, abdomen and lower back) plucks a majority of the hairs</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m in the privacy of my own home and don&#x27;t need a black and steel one...</li>
            <li>This unit does a good job as long as you make several passes.</li>
            <li>I had to run this over certain areas a couple times but it did pluck out 99% of the hairs.</li>
            <li>, there are large parts of my body that I can&#x27;t even see</li>
            <li>so if this worked I would certainly endure the pain.  </li>
            <li>Well, unless Injection molding Plastic is a new kind of metal, this things got Cow poop written all over it.</li>
            <li>This might be the most painful thing I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>It seems like a reasonable quality product.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>The results were very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Really Amazon?</li>
            <li>I like this product and really works</li>
            <li>I think it really depends on the area.</li>
            <li>It was a very manageable</li>
            <li>This product works really well</li>
            <li>The unit itself performs very well.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t spin as fast</li>
            <li>Just spend however much money you need to get your &#x27;effected area&#x27; waxed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to get some spirit or solution that makes your skin numb before epilating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing another Optima very soon.</li>
            <li>They really need to change the design, and replace the plastic gear for a metal one.</li>
            <li>you are very hairy</li>
            <li>The device itself does seem to be a bit on the cheaply built side of things but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>, look at what $100 gets you in an electric razor (much nicer construction,ergonomics, cordless operation, build quality, etc.).  </li>
            <li>The epilator worked better than I expected; works as well as getting waxed, but without the stickiness.  </li>
            <li>YET, i really don&#x27;t want to Shave in said locations anymore.</li>
            <li>This thing tears out hear so fast I don&#x27;t have time to feel any pain.  </li>
            <li>At this point my chest is maybe 3/4-4/5 cleared, but very patchy looking...</li>
            <li>I recommend doing one area a day instead of trying to to your whole body at one time.  </li>
            <li>I really think any guy that can&#x27;t handle this really has got to be a wimp.</li>
            <li>so I just used it to thin the hair which works great.  </li>
            <li>The head of the unit feels heavy and well made and the trimmer attachment is always handy.</li>
            <li>I discovered (with this product) that epilation is no for me.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver/trimmer attachment is excellent, I think i will use it more than the epilator attachment because, as i said, the epilation is very painful for me.</li>
            <li>The big problem that i have with it is that the head is really curved, and while that is good for some areas, for others it makes it even harder to do the job (would be better if it would be just slightly curved).&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It does pull hair out, those you out there, suggest you get yourself waxed first couple times before doing this yourself, waxing is quicker and short time,  otherwise first timers, would have tears when attempt try first time....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair all the time, but it gets most of it and instead of shaving every other day you can wait a week to two weeks in between uses.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a new epilator with more tweezers to reduce the time spent on epilating.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully it goes away after a couple seconds, and I hear the more often you do it, the less intense the pain becomes.</li>
            <li>and it makes the whole process less often and more efficient</li>
            <li>This is basically the same thing, but black and made of metal (thus, more rugged), so it made no sense to me why this was rated significantly lower.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty loud, but I managed to do it while watching TV with my half-deaf husband and neither the epilator nor the TV woke the 4yo.</li>
            <li>WoW, This item works pretty well.</li>
            <li>If you never waxed an area and have old growth, get ready for the pain!</li>
            <li>This product hurts more than waxing but is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.</li>
            <li>hairs.&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 months you will notice some slowing down of the spinning heads after prolonged use (more than 10 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got these because the ones I had for women before, the tweezers went dull and we&#x27;re jamming, so I thought the men&#x27;s one would be sturdier and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I opted for a replacement head because it was much cheaper than a new unit of any brand, though still overpriced IMO.</li>
            <li>They basically just made this one black in order to charge men more for it.    </li>
            <li>I am told by my wife, just like in waxing, the more you do it, the less it will hurt.  </li>
            <li>The main plastic drive gear broke after a month of use.  </li>
            <li>Just got the Emagine Epilator for Men and it seems like a much better product than the standard Emagine (the red one).</li>
            <li>I sent this torture device  back to the seller, and I sure hope I get my money back.  </li>
            <li>Since hair grows at different rates, using the epilator means that, even if I need to buy razors, I am not going through them as quickly as I did before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll come back and update this review when I&#x27;ve done both to make sure I&#x27;m not accidentally lowering the overall rating via ignorance/misuse/not reading the instructs and make any edits.</li>
            <li>The legs went pretty much the same as the arms except they took a bit longer due to having a lot more area to cover.</li>
            <li>It it lasts longer than my original Emagine (and hopefully as long as my Optima)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend Shave Now as a trustworthy and reliable trading partner.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest as directions say to trim the hair a bit before you start.</li>
            <li>I would like to echo the advice of another reviewer and highly suggest the use of baby powder.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you are like I was and are uncertain about whether you should get this, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DO.  </li>
            <li>and I have a high tolerance for pain..</li>
            <li>It took numerous passes just to clear a small section of skin, which is not exactly the most pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>This is a Major problem makes it break down very easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It quickly goes down hill and is constantly gets stuck until even more gear parts chip off then its completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tweezers are also kind of sunk in, so it&#x27;s hard to make contact with your skin.  </li>
            <li>During general use, the pain level is pretty bearable.  </li>
            <li>I just bought the \\&quot;Red\\&quot; 72 tweezer version of this - it does the exact same job and is much cheaper.    </li>
            <li>Still, I use it regularly and the results are worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this device managed to remove 99% of my hair and with no negative effects to the skin itself.</li>
            <li>I have used the epilator a few times...and each time has been better...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also worth noting the rotating head cannot reach concave areas of skin properly such as between the pecs and around well defined abs.</li>
            <li>After spending twice the time I normally would use with the optima, it missed 30% of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I suppose it would be worth the pain if it actually removed all the hair.  </li>
            <li>Also I noticed a fair amount of broken hairs instead of removing them.  </li>
            <li>The optima&#x27;s tweezer heads were mostly flat without the major raised stainless steel sides so the head made full contact with your skin.  </li>
            <li>unlike the other areas, I still haven&#x27;t been able to successfully clear my chest with this model due to what I view as a significant design flaw.</li>
            <li>What I mean is if you are starting off with old growth, thick shaved hairs, you will most likely cry from using it on most places, but if you are using it on fine new growth you will not feel pain just a gentle and mild sting.</li>
            <li>Although it does have 72 tweezers, it still requires proper positioning and using the right speed and stroke technique.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to epilators and just want to have one on the side in case, look for a cheaper one.</li>
            <li>now it&#x27;s like new.</li>
            <li>and I still have no need to do a new &amp;#34;run&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It was still under warranty, so I returned it for a new one.</li>
            <li>Im daring, i like to experience new things.</li>
            <li>So this will be new to me.</li>
            <li>I know hair grows in cycles so there are always new ones coming up.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the more pricey epilators, and even though its &amp;#34;for Men&amp;#34; all that really means is it&#x27;s black and blue colored.</li>
            <li>I bought my Emjoi Emagine approximately a month ago, and so far I think it was a good investment.</li>
            <li>Not having sharp stubble is great, however, and after the first time the pain is less intense (because there are less hairs to pull out).</li>
            <li>it pulls almost all the hairs on the first swipe, the only drawback...</li>
            <li>but WOW!</li>
            <li>noticed the first day that not only did it hurt, but the epilator seemed to break a  lot of the hair, rather than pulling it out.</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Emjoi epilator, the first had 30 tweezers, which did the job but took forever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to many issues with battery operated items in the past.  </li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m not entirely disappointed with this model, but I&#x27;m still returning it and am going to spend the extra money to give the Braun SE7681 a go.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted a year, the last one lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the metal heats up really quick and the two metal pieces on the side make it hard to go over the skin when it&#x27;s hot and your body is hot!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t expect miracles, you will still need a lot of patience to do the job properly, and the first three-four times it will hurt considerably.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, rather than having a nice, smooth, hair-free surface, you&#x27;ve got a bunch of dark spots/stubble from the broken hairs.was due to this or another issue, but the abdominal region was a significant challenge as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had multiple conversations with Emjoi&#x27;s customer service and they do not sell replacement gears and refuse to upgrade to even a metal set of gears, most likely due to this very reason, it causes you to replace your epilator</li>
            <li>Luckily, after a short burning skin discomfort there is no further discomfort.</li>
            <li>This product is a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>Also, the device instructions indicate this is not meant to be used on the face, even though some folks reviews make it clear they&#x27;ve tried it there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this epilator for maybe 10 hours, give or take, over the course of three days trying to clear my arms, legs and chest.</li>
            <li>an hour if you include using a pair of tweezers plucking the remaining hairs once they were ~95% clear.</li>
            <li>It clearly says &amp;</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also a hair-growth inhibitor that should be considered, in order not to have to go through the operation too frequently.  </li>
            <li>The device is somewhat loud and the dual opposed rotating heads can seem intimidating but even while rotating they do not cut, pinch or otherwise hurt to touch.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I have a bit of a reaction after using it which lasts about a day.</li>
            <li>I have no complains about this epilator so far.</li>
            <li>I have not used razors in 30+ years so was looking to replace my old epilator.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, do not use this.  </li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t seem surprised.</li>
            <li>The key is not to stop, it won&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>Overall, really like it.  </li>
            <li>This results in a loud and clunky operation of the device</li>
            <li>Falling on my face while skiing and hitting a rock about the size of a soft ball and come out</li>
            <li>WOW does it hut.</li>
            <li>The cost was reasonable and the ordering was simple.</li>
            <li>One downside is how loud it is.</li>
            <li>Between this epilator and the salux, my skin is as soft as if it was just shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li>it being more than a few years old and the battery&#x27;s just naturally wearing out, but I haven&#x27;t been motivated enough to see if I can replace it,</li>
            <li>but they keep making them cheaper with soft plastic gears.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; more firm parts of my back</li>
            <li>It hurts more than waxing initially, though not as messy.</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that it was corded since I&#x27;ve got a shaver now that has an irritating habit of dying mid-shave if I don&#x27;t plug it in after every use.</li>
            <li>Of course, the stinging sensation of hair being pulled is never fun, but you either spread it out over a longer time using something else, or get through an area quickly with this device.</li>
            <li>I must admit that I have thick curly hair and this little machine kind of intimidated me when I first tried it.</li>
            <li>The cool steel part actually starts dragging on your skin causing the machine to bounce over your skin rather than glide making skin contact even more difficult.  </li>
            <li>It does not cut any coarse hair as particular of men&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves you smooth with very little pain.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the body itself is amazingly light considering it must house a small motor.  </li>
            <li>It was there, available, and I was tired of getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps from shaving certain areas under my belt.</li>
            <li>The only complaint is that its noisy as hell and isn&#x27;t charge able as was advertised.  </li>
            <li>A hot shower may help with pain if you&#x27;re just doing a small body part, but the whole process took me about 4 hours because you start sweating and you need to take breaks.</li>
            <li>First off, I would have given this epilator 5 stars, but it&#x27;s not rechargeable &amp; can&#x27;t be used cordless as described (and for the price I hoped it would be), but it does have  an extra long cord.  </li>
            <li>The first time it lasted a couple weeks before I had hair long enough to do it again.  </li>
            <li>This device is well built and when you get right down to it-</li>
            <li>With the emagine, between the curve of the tweezer head and the protruding stainless steel &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; side pieces it made minimum skin contact for the mostly flat parts a guy would be using this on - chest - back - abs.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to the pain of having your hair yanked out from the follicle but the result is worth it.</li>
            <li>I am sure it gets less and less each time.  </li>
            <li>i would recommend the Emagine to anyone looking for the best way to achieve that sexy smooth hair free feel, and with little pain without going to a salon and getting waxed which is not only painful but expensive!!!</li>
            <li>It is as effective as waxing without all the mess, as far as the pain goes it was not as bad as waxing for sure and the pain subsided after a short time</li>
            <li>Works well, is a little bigger but really powerfull and fast.</li>
            <li>I feel like a mans back is way too sensitive for this product.  </li>
            <li>he has barely hair onhis legs.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s nearly 2 weeks later</li>
            <li>but apparently the problem was in the engine ...</li>
            <li>I have had my chest waxed a couple of times before, as far as pain is concerned this was about the same..</li>
            <li>It seems to do more poorly with shorter regrown hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, I used the original red emjoi for a few months but the gears broke inside the machine from basic wear and tear.</li>
            <li>Sugaring is less painful than waxing, but more time consuming and more</li>
            <li>I also thought it would be more painful, maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m used to getting waxed, but there was only some mild stinging - nothing that made tears flow.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned the unit several times when it began to slow after plugging with hair, but it the cheap plastic gear broke after a month of use.  </li>
            <li>(im rating this 5 star since the red one i bought worked extremely well, and this one is exactly the same make.)</li>
            <li>It hurt a little the first time I used it</li>
            <li>It worked fine as long as you held the skin tight and it didn&#x27;t take very long to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I would take the short sting for the long term (few weeks) of smooth back.</li>
            <li>it is so much better than waxing which is messy and much more painful.  </li>
            <li>Did a great job with thick &amp; thin hairs, especially on the chest area</li>
            <li>A few passes should take care of the ones it missed the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It ain&#x27;t the missing metal thats got me peeved as much as the apparent Bait N switch.  </li>
            <li>that pretty much sums up the complaints in 90% of the poor reviews.  </li>
            <li>Make no mistake, plucking large numbers of hairs at a time is painful, but if you&#x27;re willing, the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>use it in sensitive areas (underarms and groin) and have yet to have a single problem</li>
            <li>, mine worked fine for a week and now the power cord is broken inside.</li>
            <li>but it was taking a little too much time</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say they all are good or bad and since i am a Newcomer to this, I cant wait to use it.</li>
            <li>The bad news is that if you&#x27;re a hairy guy like I am, the pain will be pretty intense while you&#x27;re using it, especially if it&#x27;s your first time ever using an epilator.</li>

            <li> All in all, very happy that I made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Buy it, its good!!!!</li>
            <li> IF you can endue the pain, it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY happy with this purchase and would suggest anyone that hates shaving to give epliation a try.  </li>
            <li> Very good.</li>
            <li> Works great totally impressed by the quality and performance</li>
            <li> After a good 7-10 passes over a sparse patch of hair it did not remove it all!  </li>
            <li> If this thing ever wears out, I will automatically by another, its that good!</li>
            <li> this product is simply beautiful.</li>
            <li> This product is a great alternative to laser hair removal for men.</li>
            <li> BUT for all that I will say it does a great job.</li>
            <li> It did work great in the stomach area.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great option when you have not time for waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happily using the Emjoi Optima for over 10 years which was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> and I figured Emjoi was the go-to brand since I was so happy with my optima.  </li>
            <li> My hair growth has been greatly diminished.</li>
            <li> lol expect what you have gotten.</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> This would work great if the government wanted torcher someone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happy with the Emjoi brand, so went with this brand again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another GREAT epilator by Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> When it works, it works great, but I would probably not purchase this unit again.</li>
            <li> Rips all the hairs out and works great.</li>
            <li> This unit was very effective, did what was advertised</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does remove the hair very good, excellent, smooth feeling once hair is removed.</li>
            <li> I did more researching,  and this was the best product on the market, or</li>
            <li> the most part it is probably the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> This is probably best for someone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the ap-18 is the best and most effective epilator I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> , I can take the pain.&amp;#34; I finished my good.</li>
            <li> It does a good job</li>
            <li> It removed a good majority of the hairs.</li>
            <li> This is good unit...</li>
            <li> Their epilators are just superior to the Emjoi Emagine and Emjoi eRase.</li>
            <li> Now for what&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my neck and cheekbones to get rid of fine hairs, and it works incredibly well for that, too.</li>
            <li> All in all the Emjoi Emagine is a great device, and I am glad I went with the version for men despite the fact that I am female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much more than waxing!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon was amazing.</li>
            <li> And it makes me look amazing</li>
            <li> its amazing</li>
            <li> Nice machine</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the results, it won&#x27;t be as perfect as waxing but you can touch up as needed.</li>
            <li> So my honest review is as follows.</li>
            <li> And it feels nice in the shower.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of tricky in some places.</li>
            <li> To each their own.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if Emjoi could design a head</li>
            <li> This is a honest review i have it used here</li>
            <li> The epilator was effective.  </li>
            <li> really nice touch is that the epilator comes with an electric razor attachment.</li>
            <li> though died and I paid 119usd for it and just bought a Remington at Target for 49usd and its just as effective.</li>
            <li> I am hair free and loving it!  </li>
            <li> the Emjoi Emagine is by far the best epilator i have used!</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I would have used one of these many years ago.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you want to show off your newly-smooth chest right away, but it&#x27;s a great long-term investment.</li>
            <li> Nothing is more important than looking good, believe me...</li>
            <li> Lets just say it feels very cheap.  </li>
            <li> the area is very smooth.</li>
            <li> It also seems to break as many hairs as it pulls out.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> all I love this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks, this is a great product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s head is curved but that actually is more of an inconvenience in my opinion since you&#x27;ll have to end up manipulating your skin to get some of the areas you want.</li>
            <li> I get more in-grown hairs from this epilator than a $35 dollar epilator</li>
            <li> but I was even able to epilate my balls it did hurt a bit</li>
            <li> Over all I love it.</li>
            <li> Saw this interesting model with a Cooling  Metal Head, 72 tweezers and all.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I thought if my wife can do this....</li>
            <li> but what you would do for love.</li>
            <li> If you intend to use the emjoi 4 Men, you better be a man and handle the pain like one.</li>
            <li> Our hair is thicker and more</li>
            <li> Much better than the temporary fix of shaving.</li>
            <li> I love how it looks now.</li>
            <li> As you know some areas will be more sentive.</li>
            <li> I bought the men&#x27;s color  version because often times, they are stronger and more durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if I kept it up then it would get better</li>
            <li> the was more efficient in removing hair.</li>
            <li> Works better then cheaper models.  </li>
            <li> so hopefully it will make more skin contact and remove more hairs rather than break them.  </li>
            <li> so you had to figure out the magic angle to get it to be powered at all.</li>
            <li> and I still haven&#x27;t gotten around to the touching up</li>
            <li> You will end up ripping out more hairs without their follicle.</li>
            <li> This seems more sturdy.  </li>
            <li> In the summer months I take off most off my body hair.</li>
            <li> It still works way better than the Emagine.</li>
            <li> I feel that waxing or tweezing would give better</li>
            <li> I found that I could not predict what body parts would hurt the most.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> Takes way too many passes to pluck...</li>
            <li> Most the reviews that talk about pain are are telling the truth.</li>
            <li> it just stopped working, I had to spend more money buying a replacement head</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that it will get easier as time goes by.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite work that way, but this has been much better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It would had been even better if it had a charging option.</li>
            <li> Hoping Remington makes better motors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting so that I enjoy the pain part!</li>
            <li> So, i read most of the reviews.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars as the head of the epilator does seem to get as many hairs as the Optima.  </li>
            <li> This was a much better deal than what I would have gotten if I had bought the Emagine for women, which does not include any of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also say it&#x27;s best to epilate after a shower when your pores are relaxed and open, so I gave up on looking for one that was water proof.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> is what I love about this product....</li>
            <li> I even epilate my bikini line now with no issues (something I feared I&#x27;d never be able to tolerate).  </li>
            <li> And Salux is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that does the best job of it!  </li>
            <li> I will ever even consider touching with a razor again</li>
            <li> I has always worked well and safely for me, despite the rotating parts that look like they would do damage.  </li>
            <li> The more you do it the more it is tolerable.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> so it was a pretty good deal all things considered.</li>
            <li> It is great to be hair free for a much longer period of time with no razor stubble.</li>
            <li> recommend the product,&lt;br /&gt;i used it under my arms and private area and works very good, once hair is removed</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator to remove hair from my torso to be more comfortable shirtless.  </li>
            <li> So far I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s hope that&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> and I love the look and feel of clean shaven legs.</li>
            <li> It is relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li> It worked fine for 6 months or so, and then the plastic gear under the removable head broke.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just pain, then you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li> This thing is quick!</li>
            <li> Pretty good and not very painful.</li>
            <li> Works great and the bets part is that it works very quickly unlike most other epilators out there</li>
            <li> They advertise it as it is supposed to fit the shape and curves of a man&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> This thing is nice but it hurts so much.</li>
            <li> I bought it with great expectations but sending it back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it in August of 2103.Followed the instructions precisely</li>
            <li> works great, only wish it had a longer handle, and an angled head.</li>
            <li> but it is kinda cheap</li>
            <li> It makes me so smooth and it is luxurious to use.</li>
            <li> but nothing I couldn&#x27;t endure and now I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt</li>
            <li> Using a hair inhibitor afterwards really yields amazing results.</li>
            <li> Every thing is cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The heads are both easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to go totally smooth on my legs</li>
            <li> I have course hair so to stay smooth shaving</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The arms went fairly well, and were satisfactorily clear after about 25-30 minutes...</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a reason the female version of this epilator is so highly rated--it is awesome.  </li>
            <li> it is so quick and easy to use</li>
            <li> This works quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> However, the return and credit for the purchase was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I had to bend it aroud to fine the sweet spot and tape it to hold it shape and work.</li>
            <li> Because of this it can&#x27;t leave my legs silky smooth, so for special occasions I will still need to shave.</li>
            <li> I still have my original Optima, which still works after years of use.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try the Emagine for Men when my original Emagine stopped working.</li>
            <li> Loved being bare.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that it removed most hair on the first pass either.  </li>
            <li> , I have had several over the years but this unit works best by far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once since I&#x27;ve bought it because my experience the first time wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> Usually it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for, but not in this case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a slow passes works best.</li>
            <li> After all,  as soothing as the Cool Metal Head sounds,  nothing</li>
            <li> i did not mind the pain so much but having pain and on top of that not working like its</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think has much power or that many tweetzers.</li>
            <li> The head spins so fast and there are so many tweezers, that the hairs just seem to fall out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use this one, likely because it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> You pay for what you pay for, they might not be full informative in it but</li>
            <li> Any good reviews posted for this product is only by seller of this product.</li>
            <li> Better than the no-no shaver because it really shaves.</li>
            <li> This continued for about two weeks until the hair finally grew out a fair bit.</li>
            <li> Nothing cool about&lt;</li>
            <li> it doesnt hurt much any more and there are plenty of tricks you can do to reduce the pain of epilating.</li>
            <li> I got it mainly for shoulder/back hair to serve as a more efficient method than having a loved one tweeze individually, or spending tons of cash on wax treatments.</li>
            <li> If it lasts 1 year like the original, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> This thing comes with a shaver attachment, which I use on my other lady bits and it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I loved this and works great for me on back then down there...</li>
            <li> I followed the directions perfectly and after 35 passes over the same tiny area on my leg</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a full-time working mother of a rowdy 4yo who loves to swim, and I&#x27;m also heavily pregnant.</li>
            <li> I only use this product on my private areas and Emagine is just not the best product for this.</li>
            <li> The gears are made of plastic, so they&#x27;re bound to wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase - especially when it pays for itself versus paying to get waxed every 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Returned this epilator quickly.  </li>
            <li> My gf loves my smooth skin and new look!!!</li>
            <li> Initially I was very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> First, the epilator head is made of pig metal and cheap plastic including a plastic drive-gear.  </li>
            <li> Just got it in Came in a nice normal small box, the packaging is great, and im going to see what it is going to feel like.  </li>
            <li> I can still watch TV while epilating though, I just have to turn up the volume more than I normally would.</li>
            <li> Like the mettal head because stay cool and is helpping to calm the area where is working giving some confort.</li>
            <li> Emjoi advertises this model as having a \\&quot;cool touch\\&quot; head that makes it more comfortable to use, but this gets warm pretty quickly, and after about an hour gets irritatingly hot, so I&#x27;ll take a break and let it cool down for a while.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this until the first touch.</li>
            <li> (make sure you pull skin tight because it will pull your skin in and kind of bite you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also have to try my legs and chest again in a few days to make sure that the hair has grown a fair bit, which will hopefully make it easier for the tweezers to easily find, grab and completely pull them.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get accustomed to the pulling out of the hair, but it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> If the unit doesn&#x27;t break in a few months than it&#x27;s a great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> it is easy to clean and store away for that smooth look that guys like would recommend in the future a battery rechargeable product</li>
            <li> Be ready for some pain but be ready to love this as well.</li>
            <li> but I preferred to shaving because it last more and leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> It works ok but not as good as cheaper ones i have used, the shaver attachment sucks.</li>
            <li> more importantly the amount of time consumed is lesser then as compared with any other.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Now it works seamlessly, and I love it.</li>
            <li> there and around the navel are the only areas that were actually kind of</li>
            <li> Head is noticeably heavier than the original and head stays MUCH cooler during use.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box there&#x27;s a problem.  </li>
            <li> maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right...</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll do it right</li>
            <li> all right.</li>
            <li> Ohwell this is what you bought right?</li>
            <li> areas are pain free and some are not, but once i was done with the first session, the keep-up was very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife loves touching me now that I have no sharp stubble.</li>
            <li> This device makes back grooming ... not painless, but certainly a heck of a lot easier and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I think is useful if your pain resistance is higher than mine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like to start off saying that I had high hopes for this product based on numerous good reviews and even a mention in the most current GQ magazine.</li>
            <li> easy to use better than other product</li>
            <li> I guess its cheap materials or some stuff, its the new age guys.</li>
            <li> Stopped working right after the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Very durable and works quickly.</li>
            <li> Very efficient, fast and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean and simple to operate.  </li>
            <li> I regret this purchase very, very much.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure how much I was going to enjoy this product, especially after reading about the pain.  </li>
            <li> The design isn&#x27;t as good as i expected it to be, there is a lot of plastic (it might be high quality tho</li>
            <li> When I first used a epilator it was because my girlfriend had a Remington epilator she bought from Walmart for $30.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always grab all the hairs, many passes in different directions are required to get the job done.</li>
            <li> No device, regardless of quality and features, will be able to physically do anything (massage, stimulate, etc.)</li>
            <li> the mind can overcome anticipatory pain if you let it!ll be able to physically do anything (massage, stimulate, etc.)</li>
            <li> It may work better if you have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> No reason why they could not make a dual one in first place for something which costs 95 us$.</li>
            <li> so just doing something preventative that my skin most likely needs anyway.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on the first day</li>
            <li> But the machine really works!</li>
            <li> The others I have had (women&#x27;s models) needed patience and going over the same spit many times.</li>
            <li> My first experience with an epilator</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with am Epilator.</li>
            <li> found I was enduring a lot of extra pain and effort for a result hardly better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> The enclosed instructions were followed exactly.</li>
            <li> Broke on the first try, quit working.</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate your skin prior to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first epilator.</li>
            <li> My first was an Emjoi Optima.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the Panasonic next time and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> I suggest that you wax first or do something called sugaring.</li>
            <li> This is the first time i used one things can only get better.</li>
            <li> The first time you use it...expect pain.  </li>
            <li> so this is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this</li>
            <li> I bought this item and used it the first time on July 7th..</li>
            <li> Again, it is pretty bearable unless (I imagine) you point it at your junk...</li>
            <li> I think the guard design is a bit lower on the Optima which seems to get the smaller stubborn hairs better.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was more robust and can last longer.</li>
            <li> I think this was because it was my first time using an epilator, and at times the pain caused me to hold the device improperly.</li>
            <li> The first time was the worst--they took a couple of weeks to go away.</li>
            <li> This results in breakage of the hairs more often than not, rather than pulling them out at the root, sometimes close enough to the skin so they can&#x27;t even be plucked with tweezers.</li>
            <li> ;, but I bought it for female use thinking it would be better than the ladies&#x27; versions.  </li>
            <li> The truth is some places on your body will hurt more than others...and it is always the opposite of what you would think.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried one it was bittersweet because I am a hairy man and it hurt so much every millimeter of my arms were covered in hair and often 3 hairs would grow out of one pore!</li>
            <li> only thing is it would have been better if it was chargeable and water proof.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many differences other than the metal head (nice for putting in the fridge then epilating for a cool feel) which is sturdier than the plastic heads from other emjoi products.</li>
            <li> mainly don&#x27;t like this because of how it made me look like I had a full body rash for a whole 3 days and</li>
            <li> The claim of being able to remove hair as short as 0.4mm would appear to be pure marketing hype.</li>
            <li> As a guy with thick hair, the Red one works perfectly and will save you some Cash!  </li>
            <li> Not 100% sure my wife was doing it as gentle as she could have on my back hair</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s not entirely painless, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than it was.</li>
            <li> It works so well that I have gone from chest and stomach to pretty much everywhere else.</li>
            <li> This also happens to pretty much negate my concern over battery life with the Braun model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Additionally, it pretty much negates any increased efficiency</li>
            <li> but I never quite saw the value in it when I could just as easily shave my legs and not have to do it again for several months.</li>
            <li> Also, this epilator very quickly (it takes me 15min min to do my chest, abdomen and lower back) plucks a majority of the hairs</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in the privacy of my own home and don&#x27;t need a black and steel one...</li>
            <li> This unit does a good job as long as you make several passes.</li>
            <li> I had to run this over certain areas a couple times but it did pluck out 99% of the hairs.</li>
            <li> , there are large parts of my body that I can&#x27;t even see</li>
            <li> so if this worked I would certainly endure the pain.  </li>
            <li> Well, unless Injection molding Plastic is a new kind of metal, this things got Cow poop written all over it.</li>
            <li> This might be the most painful thing I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> It seems like a reasonable quality product.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> The results were very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Really Amazon?</li>
            <li> I like this product and really works</li>
            <li> I think it really depends on the area.</li>
            <li> It was a very manageable</li>
            <li> This product works really well</li>
            <li> The unit itself performs very well.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t spin as fast</li>
            <li> Just spend however much money you need to get your &#x27;effected area&#x27; waxed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to get some spirit or solution that makes your skin numb before epilating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing another Optima very soon.</li>
            <li> They really need to change the design, and replace the plastic gear for a metal one.</li>
            <li> you are very hairy</li>
            <li> The device itself does seem to be a bit on the cheaply built side of things but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> , look at what $100 gets you in an electric razor (much nicer construction,ergonomics, cordless operation, build quality, etc.).  </li>
            <li> The epilator worked better than I expected; works as well as getting waxed, but without the stickiness.  </li>
            <li> YET, i really don&#x27;t want to Shave in said locations anymore.</li>
            <li> This thing tears out hear so fast I don&#x27;t have time to feel any pain.  </li>
            <li> At this point my chest is maybe 3/4-4/5 cleared, but very patchy looking...</li>
            <li> I recommend doing one area a day instead of trying to to your whole body at one time.  </li>
            <li> I really think any guy that can&#x27;t handle this really has got to be a wimp.</li>
            <li> so I just used it to thin the hair which works great.  </li>
            <li> The head of the unit feels heavy and well made and the trimmer attachment is always handy.</li>
            <li> I discovered (with this product) that epilation is no for me.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver/trimmer attachment is excellent, I think i will use it more than the epilator attachment because, as i said, the epilation is very painful for me.</li>
            <li> The big problem that i have with it is that the head is really curved, and while that is good for some areas, for others it makes it even harder to do the job (would be better if it would be just slightly curved).&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It does pull hair out, those you out there, suggest you get yourself waxed first couple times before doing this yourself, waxing is quicker and short time,  otherwise first timers, would have tears when attempt try first time....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair all the time, but it gets most of it and instead of shaving every other day you can wait a week to two weeks in between uses.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a new epilator with more tweezers to reduce the time spent on epilating.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully it goes away after a couple seconds, and I hear the more often you do it, the less intense the pain becomes.</li>
            <li> and it makes the whole process less often and more efficient</li>
            <li> This is basically the same thing, but black and made of metal (thus, more rugged), so it made no sense to me why this was rated significantly lower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty loud, but I managed to do it while watching TV with my half-deaf husband and neither the epilator nor the TV woke the 4yo.</li>
            <li> WoW, This item works pretty well.</li>
            <li> If you never waxed an area and have old growth, get ready for the pain!</li>
            <li> This product hurts more than waxing but is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess.</li>
            <li> hairs.&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 months you will notice some slowing down of the spinning heads after prolonged use (more than 10 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got these because the ones I had for women before, the tweezers went dull and we&#x27;re jamming, so I thought the men&#x27;s one would be sturdier and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I opted for a replacement head because it was much cheaper than a new unit of any brand, though still overpriced IMO.</li>
            <li> They basically just made this one black in order to charge men more for it.    </li>
            <li> I am told by my wife, just like in waxing, the more you do it, the less it will hurt.  </li>
            <li> The main plastic drive gear broke after a month of use.  </li>
            <li> Just got the Emagine Epilator for Men and it seems like a much better product than the standard Emagine (the red one).</li>
            <li> I sent this torture device  back to the seller, and I sure hope I get my money back.  </li>
            <li> Since hair grows at different rates, using the epilator means that, even if I need to buy razors, I am not going through them as quickly as I did before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back and update this review when I&#x27;ve done both to make sure I&#x27;m not accidentally lowering the overall rating via ignorance/misuse/not reading the instructs and make any edits.</li>
            <li> The legs went pretty much the same as the arms except they took a bit longer due to having a lot more area to cover.</li>
            <li> It it lasts longer than my original Emagine (and hopefully as long as my Optima)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend Shave Now as a trustworthy and reliable trading partner.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest as directions say to trim the hair a bit before you start.</li>
            <li> I would like to echo the advice of another reviewer and highly suggest the use of baby powder.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you are like I was and are uncertain about whether you should get this, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DO.  </li>
            <li> and I have a high tolerance for pain..</li>
            <li> It took numerous passes just to clear a small section of skin, which is not exactly the most pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> This is a Major problem makes it break down very easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It quickly goes down hill and is constantly gets stuck until even more gear parts chip off then its completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tweezers are also kind of sunk in, so it&#x27;s hard to make contact with your skin.  </li>
            <li> During general use, the pain level is pretty bearable.  </li>
            <li> I just bought the \\&quot;Red\\&quot; 72 tweezer version of this - it does the exact same job and is much cheaper.    </li>
            <li> Still, I use it regularly and the results are worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this device managed to remove 99% of my hair and with no negative effects to the skin itself.</li>
            <li> I have used the epilator a few times...and each time has been better...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also worth noting the rotating head cannot reach concave areas of skin properly such as between the pecs and around well defined abs.</li>
            <li> After spending twice the time I normally would use with the optima, it missed 30% of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I suppose it would be worth the pain if it actually removed all the hair.  </li>
            <li> Also I noticed a fair amount of broken hairs instead of removing them.  </li>
            <li> The optima&#x27;s tweezer heads were mostly flat without the major raised stainless steel sides so the head made full contact with your skin.  </li>
            <li> unlike the other areas, I still haven&#x27;t been able to successfully clear my chest with this model due to what I view as a significant design flaw.</li>
            <li> What I mean is if you are starting off with old growth, thick shaved hairs, you will most likely cry from using it on most places, but if you are using it on fine new growth you will not feel pain just a gentle and mild sting.</li>
            <li> Although it does have 72 tweezers, it still requires proper positioning and using the right speed and stroke technique.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to epilators and just want to have one on the side in case, look for a cheaper one.</li>
            <li> now it&#x27;s like new.</li>
            <li> and I still have no need to do a new &amp;#34;run&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was still under warranty, so I returned it for a new one.</li>
            <li> Im daring, i like to experience new things.</li>
            <li> So this will be new to me.</li>
            <li> I know hair grows in cycles so there are always new ones coming up.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the more pricey epilators, and even though its &amp;#34;for Men&amp;#34; all that really means is it&#x27;s black and blue colored.</li>
            <li> I bought my Emjoi Emagine approximately a month ago, and so far I think it was a good investment.</li>
            <li> Not having sharp stubble is great, however, and after the first time the pain is less intense (because there are less hairs to pull out).</li>
            <li> it pulls almost all the hairs on the first swipe, the only drawback...</li>
            <li> but WOW!</li>
            <li> noticed the first day that not only did it hurt, but the epilator seemed to break a  lot of the hair, rather than pulling it out.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Emjoi epilator, the first had 30 tweezers, which did the job but took forever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to many issues with battery operated items in the past.  </li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m not entirely disappointed with this model, but I&#x27;m still returning it and am going to spend the extra money to give the Braun SE7681 a go.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted a year, the last one lasted 3 months.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the metal heats up really quick and the two metal pieces on the side make it hard to go over the skin when it&#x27;s hot and your body is hot!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t expect miracles, you will still need a lot of patience to do the job properly, and the first three-four times it will hurt considerably.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, rather than having a nice, smooth, hair-free surface, you&#x27;ve got a bunch of dark spots/stubble from the broken hairs.was due to this or another issue, but the abdominal region was a significant challenge as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had multiple conversations with Emjoi&#x27;s customer service and they do not sell replacement gears and refuse to upgrade to even a metal set of gears, most likely due to this very reason, it causes you to replace your epilator</li>
            <li> Luckily, after a short burning skin discomfort there is no further discomfort.</li>
            <li> This product is a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Also, the device instructions indicate this is not meant to be used on the face, even though some folks reviews make it clear they&#x27;ve tried it there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this epilator for maybe 10 hours, give or take, over the course of three days trying to clear my arms, legs and chest.</li>
            <li> an hour if you include using a pair of tweezers plucking the remaining hairs once they were ~95% clear.</li>
            <li> It clearly says &amp;</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a hair-growth inhibitor that should be considered, in order not to have to go through the operation too frequently.  </li>
            <li> The device is somewhat loud and the dual opposed rotating heads can seem intimidating but even while rotating they do not cut, pinch or otherwise hurt to touch.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I have a bit of a reaction after using it which lasts about a day.</li>
            <li> I have no complains about this epilator so far.</li>
            <li> I have not used razors in 30+ years so was looking to replace my old epilator.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, do not use this.  </li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t seem surprised.</li>
            <li> The key is not to stop, it won&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li> Overall, really like it.  </li>
            <li> This results in a loud and clunky operation of the device</li>
            <li> Falling on my face while skiing and hitting a rock about the size of a soft ball and come out</li>
            <li> WOW does it hut.</li>
            <li> The cost was reasonable and the ordering was simple.</li>
            <li> One downside is how loud it is.</li>
            <li> Between this epilator and the salux, my skin is as soft as if it was just shaved with a razor.  </li>
            <li> it being more than a few years old and the battery&#x27;s just naturally wearing out, but I haven&#x27;t been motivated enough to see if I can replace it,</li>
            <li> but they keep making them cheaper with soft plastic gears.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; more firm parts of my back</li>
            <li> It hurts more than waxing initially, though not as messy.</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that it was corded since I&#x27;ve got a shaver now that has an irritating habit of dying mid-shave if I don&#x27;t plug it in after every use.</li>
            <li> Of course, the stinging sensation of hair being pulled is never fun, but you either spread it out over a longer time using something else, or get through an area quickly with this device.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I have thick curly hair and this little machine kind of intimidated me when I first tried it.</li>
            <li> The cool steel part actually starts dragging on your skin causing the machine to bounce over your skin rather than glide making skin contact even more difficult.  </li>
            <li> It does not cut any coarse hair as particular of men&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves you smooth with very little pain.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the body itself is amazingly light considering it must house a small motor.  </li>
            <li> It was there, available, and I was tired of getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps from shaving certain areas under my belt.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that its noisy as hell and isn&#x27;t charge able as was advertised.  </li>
            <li> A hot shower may help with pain if you&#x27;re just doing a small body part, but the whole process took me about 4 hours because you start sweating and you need to take breaks.</li>
            <li> First off, I would have given this epilator 5 stars, but it&#x27;s not rechargeable &amp; can&#x27;t be used cordless as described (and for the price I hoped it would be), but it does have  an extra long cord.  </li>
            <li> The first time it lasted a couple weeks before I had hair long enough to do it again.  </li>
            <li> This device is well built and when you get right down to it-</li>
            <li> With the emagine, between the curve of the tweezer head and the protruding stainless steel &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; side pieces it made minimum skin contact for the mostly flat parts a guy would be using this on - chest - back - abs.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to the pain of having your hair yanked out from the follicle but the result is worth it.</li>
            <li> I am sure it gets less and less each time.  </li>
            <li> i would recommend the Emagine to anyone looking for the best way to achieve that sexy smooth hair free feel, and with little pain without going to a salon and getting waxed which is not only painful but expensive!!!</li>
            <li> It is as effective as waxing without all the mess, as far as the pain goes it was not as bad as waxing for sure and the pain subsided after a short time</li>
            <li> Works well, is a little bigger but really powerfull and fast.</li>
            <li> I feel like a mans back is way too sensitive for this product.  </li>
            <li> he has barely hair onhis legs.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s nearly 2 weeks later</li>
            <li> but apparently the problem was in the engine ...</li>
            <li> I have had my chest waxed a couple of times before, as far as pain is concerned this was about the same..</li>
            <li> It seems to do more poorly with shorter regrown hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, I used the original red emjoi for a few months but the gears broke inside the machine from basic wear and tear.</li>
            <li> Sugaring is less painful than waxing, but more time consuming and more</li>
            <li> I also thought it would be more painful, maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m used to getting waxed, but there was only some mild stinging - nothing that made tears flow.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned the unit several times when it began to slow after plugging with hair, but it the cheap plastic gear broke after a month of use.  </li>
            <li> (im rating this 5 star since the red one i bought worked extremely well, and this one is exactly the same make.)</li>
            <li> It hurt a little the first time I used it</li>
            <li> It worked fine as long as you held the skin tight and it didn&#x27;t take very long to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I would take the short sting for the long term (few weeks) of smooth back.</li>
            <li> it is so much better than waxing which is messy and much more painful.  </li>
            <li> Did a great job with thick &amp; thin hairs, especially on the chest area</li>
            <li> A few passes should take care of the ones it missed the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It ain&#x27;t the missing metal thats got me peeved as much as the apparent Bait N switch.  </li>
            <li> that pretty much sums up the complaints in 90% of the poor reviews.  </li>
            <li> Make no mistake, plucking large numbers of hairs at a time is painful, but if you&#x27;re willing, the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> use it in sensitive areas (underarms and groin) and have yet to have a single problem</li>
            <li> , mine worked fine for a week and now the power cord is broken inside.</li>
            <li> but it was taking a little too much time</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say they all are good or bad and since i am a Newcomer to this, I cant wait to use it.</li>
            <li> The bad news is that if you&#x27;re a hairy guy like I am, the pain will be pretty intense while you&#x27;re using it, especially if it&#x27;s your first time ever using an epilator.</li>
            <li> In order to retain the appearance of smooth skin I needed to use the emagine at least every other day.  </li>
            <li> it has a mostly flat head and only 1 rotating tweezer</li>
            <li> and explained the short comings of the plastic gear only to receive a less than professional and essentially just a &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; response.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are about half the cost of a new unit.  </li>
            <li> The epilator head seams to work pretty well on very thin hair (although it is hard to know if it is breaking the hairs rather than pulling them) while even the most slightly-coarse hair will need dozens of passes to target and remove them.  </li>
            <li> But with minor yelps of pain and a few tears it works really well.  </li>
            <li> the additional tweezers provided since you to wait for the hairs to regrow enough to either pluck by hand with ordinary tweezers or use the epilator again much sooner than 4-6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am concerned about how long it will last because some of the reviews said it quit working after a short time.</li>
            <li> The hair takes long to grow back and grows back thinner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, i have to admit that the first time i used the Emjoi it was painful, BUT not the excruciating pain that i read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s dark blue not black, and it must always be plugged in (not rechargeable or cordless)</li>
            <li> They do not have any plans to change from the plastic gears for obvious reasons, as it causes the item to be replaced almost yearly if it lasts that long.</li>
            <li> Adapter (electric cord is long enough)</li>
            <li> The cooling head isn&#x27;t a plus feature, even if you put it in the fridge for a bit the cooling effect doesn&#x27;t last long because it warms with your body heat.   </li>
            <li> Other effects include extremely deeply rooted hair (causing higher than usual levels of pain when epilating) and a ridiculously short regeneration time for a plucked hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It needs to be plugged in for use, but the chord is long enough.</li>
            <li> It worked for like two years or so, its not built to last long, the head stopped spinning as the gear material is plastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs were also a frequent problem resulting in unattractive little bumps and red spots all over.  </li>
            <li> The second time I would say there was less than half as much hair</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t remove the whole hair, it&#x27;s difficult with short hairs in particular.</li>
            <li> Although not advertised as such, I expected the unit would be independent of a wall socket.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I happen to be afflicted with pili multigemini, a condition in which multiple strands of hair emerge from a single follicle.  </li>
            <li> I found if I shave first, then start using this thing everyday for about a week after, there is less pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud but gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> but a short time later it wasn&#x27;t bad at all much better than razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I eagerly waited for so long time for men&#x27;s epilator.</li>
            <li> It has a rather long dangling cord which attaches to the unit and a wall-wart-type transformer.  </li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;m not very impress about the quality ans the consumer service.</li>
            <li> This razor attachment was very useful in that I could use it blindly on these invisible areas without hurting myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super hairy but have some solid patches on my back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Though the base motor unit seems somewhat cheaply made, the tweezer disc head feels heavy and solid, and should last quite a long time if used properly and with realistic expectations.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend also didn&#x27;t like the sharp hairs growing back.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, for $75 I expected more that a year&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/30/2012:</li>
            <li> main complaint is almost like clock work, after the year warranty the plastic gear sprocket inside chips</li>
            <li> My girlfriend does my back, which works out well since she is the one that doesn&#x27;t like the few hairs I do have on my back.  </li>
            <li> My hair is far too thick, often growing back into the skin.</li>
            <li> No idea why they sell replacement heads as half the time the model itself doesn&#x27;t last long enough to replace the heads due to the plastic gear teeth breaking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not powerful enough for the trimmer to work without tugging on your hair.</li>
            <li> I like to be hairless from the neck down, and I have some very coarse hair in places, but this thing plucks even the thickest hairs almost painlessly.</li>
            <li> And yes it does get less painful the more times you use it!</li>
            <li> I would have been happier with the red version, but only slightly because the edges on the head slope up on the men&#x27;s version and down on the ladies.</li>
            <li> it was not as bad but on the areas coming toward the sides it was a pretty intense sting.</li>
            <li> The manual says to run the epilator in the direction of hair growth, but half the tweezers are going to pull any hairs they catch against the grain because they&#x27;re spinning in the opposite direction.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 of these (3 red 1 black).</li>
            <li> I have depilated for over 20years, used epilators,  hot and cold wax,  epilator creams and none left me with bigger irritation than this.  </li>
            <li> Considering it is meant to be portable item , its NOT cool to have a 110 V  power plug only.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to use it \\&quot;down there\\&quot; for obvious reasons but it&#x27;s safe, you wont get skin caught up in the machine, and it&#x27;s not TOO painful</li>
            <li> The device is not meant to work wet, so even a slight amount of perspiration on the skin will affect its ability to epilate properly.</li>
            <li> This, while a little uncomfortable, leaves skin smooth and lasts a lot longer than shaving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it caused problems because it&#x27;s hard to stretch the skin in the upper chest area especially if you&#x27;re a skinny person like myself.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more painful going against the hair than with the hair, but often going with the hair doesnt pick it up.</li>
            <li> The most painful area for me was on my thighs and knees--and</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it tended to leave red bumps, even when I cleaned the epilator and my chest with alcohol.</li>
            <li> Be prepared mentally and just go with it-</li>
            <li> Be prepared mentally and just go with it-</li>
            <li> then a few weeks later use this thing--I used hers to try to remove pubic hair.  </li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18MS is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I think the people who gave this item poor reviews didn&#x27;t really know what epilating was when they bought this.  </li>
            <li> (i.e. stopped working only a few months after expiration of warranty.)</li>
            <li> And so what, it&#x27;s pink -</li>
            <li> Rough and hurts but does the job</li>
            <li> It only grabbed a few hairs at a time, which lead me to believe that what I was feeling was the tweezers pinching my skin and not plucking the hair.  </li>
            <li> For roughly $80 you would expect to get a device that performs as-described and is built somewhat well, the Emjoi AP-18MS does not meet those expectations.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using a skin soother afterwards to reduce redness and bumps, but that&#x27;s always to be expected when your plucking hair from the roots.  </li>
            <li> I compared it to the pink version and they are identical.  </li>
            <li> my initial impression is that this epilator has trouble on fattier surfaces regardless of how you try to stretch the skin to make it easier for the tweezers to grab the hair.</li>
            <li> Already after just a few weeks I notice that it slows down considerably after just a few minutes use.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was very painful, but I stuck with it and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about how well it will last though.</li>
            <li> It does not allow you to get in sharp the cracks and crevices as well as I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> me on the other hand...</li>
            <li> Like any other epilator it hurts but it depends on your hair type and pain resistance.</li>
            <li> My children use it on each other as a torture device.  </li>
            <li> I am now looking at other epilators as i would not purchase this machine again.</li>
            <li> I did my legs in the dark, but minimal touch-up was required.</li>
            <li> First of all, the curved construction which is supposed to be &#x27;specifically designed&#x27; to go with the contours of your body is useless.</li>
            <li> Read some other reviews that talk about not needing to do anything for sixty days after using the epilator.  </li>
            <li> I understand that the process is going to be painful, I bought a machine that rips out body hair, duh; but having to make numerous passes requires a significant time investment to the process just increasing the overall pain experience.</li>
            <li> As with all the other reviews, its hurts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I would say the construction of this device is laughable and while I may have higher expectations of product quality than others I would still recommend staying away from this device until these companies start manufacturing them with some hint of quality.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that if I used it around my bikini line, pulling out the hairs would actually cause a small amount of blood.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enter the search for other hair removal methods and this epilator.</li>
            <li> I also considered the Braun SE7681, but ended up going with this one due to price.</li>
            <li> Granted, that&#x27;s probably partially due to</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a couple other issues that I have with this unit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> /&gt;So overall, while I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with this machine&#x27;s performance and definitely wish they had made the parallel to the tweezers, rather than concave</li>
            <li> I know that removing hair from the root would hurt, and I expected nothing less.  </li>
            <li> Judging from the negative reviews of epilators, some folks simply can&#x27;t take the pain.</li>
            <li> On a secondary note I bought a back &amp;#34;scrub brush&amp;#34; for the shower.</li>
            <li> That sounds not fun</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t figure that out until I had used the thing for a whole week.</li>
            <li> but so far nothing has broken down yet.</li>
            <li> I trimmed it down...</li>
            <li> Remove unwanted hair from all over your body, and just trim it down.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I ever shaved with a razor, such a waste of time!!  </li>
            <li> Epilating is painful (I mean, you are pulling out your hair!), has the potential to cause ingrowns (which is why you MUST exfoliate), and does not remove every single little hair on your body (you will NOT be silky smooth like when you shave)...</li>
            <li> It hurts but ain&#x27;t no big deal, you feel like very small pinches.</li>
            <li> There are a few other downsides though.</li>
            <li> hurt any less.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the half star.</li>
            <li> Compared with previous epilators I had, this one does the job a bit faster.</li>
            <li> and it stopped working in less than 2 summers of use</li>
            <li> so less hairs broke</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; version because at the time, the black one was cheapest.  </li>
            <li> For instance, I figured that the crack, taint and hole would have been the most painful, but it was the least.</li>
            <li> That did require some slight acrobatics to accomplish.</li>
            <li> I am on my Half sisters</li>
            <li> It cut the time I was used to the process taking in half.  </li>
            <li> Emagine Epilator for Men, Black</li>
            <li> I bought the black one because since it&#x27;s adv for men, it&#x27;s like $20 cheaper.  </li>
            <li> So buy a black one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of excess fat, but I do have a small gut and, although I don&#x27;t have man-boobs by any stretch, not particularly well-defined pecs and</li>
            <li> Its poor results are partly due to its concave shape (slightly depressed in the middle to reduce the risk of pinching skin).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you that it doesn&#x27;t hurt, its not true.  </li>
            <li> I was screaming like a little girl...</li>
            <li> I have to a little safer</li>
            <li> The little comb that&#x27;s between the epilator heads helps lifting shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> First off, if you have never waxed or epilated before, it will hurt like a mad man.</li>
            <li> This had little to no effect.</li>
            <li> I have to do little parts of my body each day.</li>
            <li> I usually use this about 1x a week or every other week.  </li>
            <li> It was definitely an improvement over the mess of waxing, but the thing was cordless with poor battery life and</li>
            <li> I can withstand from crying like a little baby</li>
            <li> In fact, it was so bad, I pulled out my old Optima that only has one side working and used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before purchasing this I had only ever used a cheap $40 epilator my friend had and it was the worst experience ever.  </li>
            <li> On the flip-side, if you want a high-end one don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I tried a few times but just can&#x27;t take the pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this thing lasts a few years...</li>
            <li> the base of the unit feels rather cheap</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I tend to either take a few advil before epilating, or a few shots of whiskey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to let the soreness from all the tweezing wear off and give it another go in a few days, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would just about have to do it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It does help to trim hair down though, do not use on hairs past 1/2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> While painful to use, I have found that even within a month it seems to hurt less than it did on the first day.</li>
            <li> epilator was less painful than my previous one and it is FAST.</li>
            <li> That flaw is that the head has a concave curve to it that, combined with concave areas of the body like the collarbone and between the pecs,make it pretty much impossible for the tweezers to grasp</li>
            <li> Just bought this to epil my legs as I m a pro bike rider, the product epil as well but is painful , don t get lied that won&#x27;t hurt, speed is very to fast</li>
            <li> First off, I had every expectation of this being painful.  </li>
            <li> I am pleasantly shocked to find out this product works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The hair I was removing was thick, so I tried to trim it down to make it a bit easier to remove and reduce the likelihood of tugging and pulling the hairs.</li>
            <li> Newer growth has very little pain.</li>
            <li> It was intensely painful and tickled so much</li>
            <li> After the hair started growing back, some of them grew inside the pore causing some swelling and redness, which I guess was something I did wrong.</li>
            <li> because of the curved shape (concave) doesn&#x27;t pick small hair, as the tweezers don&#x27;t come close to skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) have to be plugged in for use.</li>
            <li> The sensation is that of stinging or pinching in a relatively small area.  </li>
            <li> um, Ill try it later after a bath.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;dual opposed\\&quot; head design is flawed for several reasons.</li>
            <li> I have only done 1 round, but if it gets less painful as I go along, I will try that.</li>
            <li> used to have an older model that was quite painful.  </li>
            <li> It can hurt if started on full hair growth, but the day after a shave, it is less shocking.</li>
            <li> Within a day the stubble made it outright painful to wear a t-shirt, and sitting down was mildly irritating at best, painful at worst because of the stubble on the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> In addition to the shape of the unit&#x27;s business end making it impossible to completely clear</li>
            <li> mere 6 months after the purchase and half of the rotating heads were dead.</li>
            <li> Baby powder makes the process ten times less painful and at least two to three times quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tylenol, aspirin, even vodka can&#x27;t dull the pain sufficiently to make it bearable.  </li>
            <li> But I managed to finish epilating for 2 hours because I would stop because the pain was hard to ignore.</li>
            <li> The device is not foolproof by any means and you must use common sense when using it.</li>
            <li> It left me with terrible looking red dots for a few days where the hair used to be.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my chest and stomach and it hurt a bit (duh), but did the job.</li>
            <li> they would have made a slow speed function, it isn t rechargeable as stated in description .</li>
            <li> you have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have to say I was severely disappointed in the new Emjoi Emagine.</li>
            <li> I also tried applying a cold towel after doing an are, but this didn&#x27;t really make it any less painful.</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers have written, the cooling head is silly since your body heat will change that.</li>
            <li> Ill Update this and give a little opinion on it.    </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t remove my really thick, tough hairs.</li>
            <li> Pain wasn&#x27;t too bad and you definitely get used to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chalked it up to guys who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing, who have a low pain-tolerance, and who decided to voice their complaints and give bad reviews.</li>
            <li> No good.  </li>
            <li> The problem is the unit is totally useless after the plastic gear fails approximately 6 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;I would tell everyone to not purchase this unit until they make a metal gear assembly for this.&lt;br /&gt;Please make a metal gear assembly that is interchangeable with the current model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not get till now where is the problem with this only machine or with the company :(.</li>
            <li> The simple thought of that may seem awful to some folks but it really isn&#x27;t quite that bad.</li>
            <li> The dual opposing heads are not effective at all!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I had a defective product, or maybe my hair is unusually tough, but I felt as if this was ripping my skin apart.  </li>
            <li> Your skin goes a little numb when using it.</li>
            <li> i aint afraid of little pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2016: 4th year and 4th one where the plastic gears have broken.</li>
            <li> This epilator, however, causes approximately 1/10th the level of pain of the cheapo epilator.  </li>
            <li> but I got tired of shaving my junk.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they are trying to remove thin, sparse patches of hair; definetely not for hairier people.</li>
            <li> However having tired it now for 4 weeks, I can say it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> This is approximately 1 year of ownership.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m kinda mad that I wasted 80 bucks on this thing.</li>
            <li> Follow directions and it gets less painful every time you use it</li>
            <li> and it was a little too painful.</li>
            <li> but I have updated because after a few times of using this...it&#x27;s not that bad....</li>
            <li> Today I found some of the teeth on the tweezer head&#x27;s gear have broken off or worn out, causing the spinning tweezers to stop when any force is required to pull hair while in use, so it&#x27;s basically useless now.</li>
            <li> I have real thick hair on my legs and it takes a number of passes to get all the hair</li>
            <li> It was super painful, irritated my skin terribly, and tore a lot of hairs rather than plucking them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few times i&#x27;ve been disappointed by an Amazon purchase</li>
            <li> No more hair!!!  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the results after initial use.</li>
            <li> The product failed and skipped on the cogs as they quite often appear to do.</li>
            <li> Its useless.</li>
            <li> Without the cord it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> The construction of each component is laughable.  </li>
            <li> Any ways, Supposedly baby powder helps, so ill try that.</li>
            <li> About two to three weeks ago I gave shaving a go and that effing sucked.</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> think, it&#x27;s useless , in one blow pluck one or two hairs while broke rest of em.</li>
            <li> Pulled my hair so hard, very uncomfortable and painful.</li>
            <li> did not work like it said it would, in fact it was very painful, and did not remove hardly any hair.</li>
            <li> The process was slow and very painful.</li>
            <li> Bad device.  </li>
            <li> the plug connector was bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;The stinging pain sensation wasn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Bad.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t definitively say that they&#x27;re a bad product just yet.</li>
            <li> Dear got was it painful.</li>
            <li> But an extremely painful extended procces.</li>
            <li> Im really very angry :(</li>
            <li> If I were to describe the pain I would put it about as painful as a tattoo.</li>
            <li> If you are hairy you must also be a lover of pain, because this is without question a painful device to use.  </li>
            <li> It was painful, but achieved the advertised results... for about two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Horrifically painful experience -</li>
            <li> I knew going in that this was going to be painful..</li>
            <li> When I ask for return it say I have to pay for postal by myself to return this idiot thing.    </li>
            <li> this is horrifically painful!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very painful process!</li>
            <li> It was awful and didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty good and not very painful. Helps to chill device and hold skin taut as the instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! No more hair!!!  My gf loves my smooth skin and new look!!! Best investment ever!!!</li>
            <li> Yeah it hurts a bit.  Does the job well though.</li>
            <li> It seems like a reasonable quality product. Im not sure about how well it will last though. Already after just a few weeks I notice that it slows down considerably after just a few minutes use. It also seems to break as many hairs as it pulls out. The claim of being able to remove hair as short as 0.4mm would appear to be pure marketing hype. It doesn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m adding to my review after almost a year.   The product failed and skipped on the cogs as they quite often appear to do. However I am adding this specifically relating to Shave Now customer service. I am very happy. I contacted them and advised of a problem. They replaced the item under warranty including shipping at no cost. They replaced it without question and I am very impressed with the customer service. I&#x27;d highly recommend Shave Now as a trustworthy and reliable trading partner. Excellent service. Very impressed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Third one I&#x27;ve gone through in three years. It starts well enough, but I would suggest not going past the first speed as the second speed tends to break hairs and cause in-grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 months you will notice some slowing down of the spinning heads after prolonged use (more than 10 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint is almost like clock work, after the year warranty the plastic gear sprocket inside chips one of the spikes and that&#x27;s all she wrote on it.&lt;br /&gt;It quickly goes down hill and is constantly gets stuck until even more gear parts chip off then its completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it&#x27;s always the gear sprocket that&#x27;s in the machine and not the gear set in the head that constantly breaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had multiple conversations with Emjoi&#x27;s customer service and they do not sell replacement gears and refuse to upgrade to even a metal set of gears, most likely due to this very reason, it causes you to replace your epilator almost annually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2016: 4th year and 4th one where the plastic gears have broken. I give up on this brand and model. I spoke with Emjoi c.s. and explained the short comings of the plastic gear only to receive a less than professional and essentially just a &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34; response. They do not have any plans to change from the plastic gears for obvious reasons, as it causes the item to be replaced almost yearly if it lasts that long. No idea why they sell replacement heads as half the time the model itself doesn&#x27;t last long enough to replace the heads due to the plastic gear teeth breaking.</li>
            <li> Bad device.  I have depilated for over 20years, used epilators,  hot and cold wax,  epilator creams and none left me with bigger irritation than this.  My wife, s epilator works best than this.</li>
            <li> Although it takes some practice, the Emagine Epilator does its job.  The included shave head is a convenient prep tool.  It&#x27;s pretty easy to clean and simple to operate.  It will hurt, of course, so using a numbing spray is essential.  There&#x27;s also a hair-growth inhibitor that should be considered, in order not to have to go through the operation too frequently.  Not having sharp stubble is great, however, and after the first time the pain is less intense (because there are less hairs to pull out).</li>
            <li> the Emjoi Emagine is by far the best epilator i have used! i would recommend the Emagine to anyone looking for the best way to achieve that sexy smooth hair free feel, and with little pain without going to a salon and getting waxed which is not only painful but expensive!!!</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s Epilator does what the ad says. It works very well, I have had several over the years but this unit works best by far. I you need one go for it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. When I first used a epilator it was because my girlfriend had a Remington epilator she bought from Walmart for $30. It was there, available, and I was tired of getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps from shaving certain areas under my belt. My girlfriend also didn&#x27;t like the sharp hairs growing back. So I started epilating. Dear got was it painful. &amp;#34;How do the girls do it!&amp;#34; I was thinking. I was also thinking, &amp;#34;I am a man, I can take the pain.&amp;#34; I finished my good. The results were very pleasing. But an extremely painful extended procces. I did some researching, and found this product. I did more researching,  and this was the best product on the market, or so they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part it is probably the best product on the market. It is honestly relatively painless to use. The Emjoi 4men does not pinch the skin, glides over the skin and pulls the hairs efortlessly. I have one problem though. They advertise it as it is supposed to fit the shape and curves of a man&#x27;s body. The inward sloping head of the epilator I think is counter productive. It does not allow you to get in sharp the cracks and crevices as well as I had hoped for. You have to keep going over these areas to get them well, and still it does not always get all of the hair from these areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I love this product.</li>
            <li> I just bought the \\&quot;Red\\&quot; 72 tweezer version of this - it does the exact same job and is much cheaper.    They basically just made this one black in order to charge men more for it.    As a guy with thick hair, the Red one works perfectly and will save you some Cash!  (im rating this 5 star since the red one i bought worked extremely well, and this one is exactly the same make.)</li>
            <li> Thanks, this is a great product</li>
            <li> This thing is nice but it hurts so much. I discovered (with this product) that epilation is no for me.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver/trimmer attachment is excellent, I think i will use it more than the epilator attachment because, as i said, the epilation is very painful for me. The epilator has dual speed control to eliminate fine/coarse hair. I think is useful if your pain resistance is higher than mine.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator can be used in back, chest, legs and arms.&lt;br /&gt;The package contains the following items:&lt;br /&gt;1) The Epilator&lt;br /&gt;2) shaver/trimmer attachment&lt;br /&gt;3) Comb attachment on the shaver head&lt;br /&gt;4) Travel pouch&lt;br /&gt;5) Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;6) Instruction booklet&lt;br /&gt;7) Adapter (electric cord is long enough)</li>
            <li> This is one of the more pricey epilators, and even though its &amp;#34;for Men&amp;#34; all that really means is it&#x27;s black and blue colored. It&#x27;s head is curved but that actually is more of an inconvenience in my opinion since you&#x27;ll have to end up manipulating your skin to get some of the areas you want. It&#x27;s also specifically designed to prevent in-grown hairs, but I found this to be the opposite. I get more in-grown hairs from this epilator than a $35 dollar epilator my s/o uses. Usually it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for, but not in this case.  If you&#x27;re new to epilators and just want to have one on the side in case, look for a cheaper one. On the flip-side, if you want a high-end one don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Pulled my hair so hard, very uncomfortable and painful. If pain is your thing go for it but I will not be using one of these things again.</li>
            <li> Just bought this to epil my legs as I m a pro bike rider, the product epil as well but is painful , don t get lied that won&#x27;t hurt, speed is very to fast they would have made a slow speed function, it isn t rechargeable as stated in description .</li>
            <li> The design isn&#x27;t as good as i expected it to be, there is a lot of plastic (it might be high quality tho i don&#x27;t know), but so far nothing has broken down yet. The big problem that i have with it is that the head is really curved, and while that is good for some areas, for others it makes it even harder to do the job (would be better if it would be just slightly curved).&lt;br /&gt;For those that don&#x27;t come from the USA, i would like to remind you that you will have to buy voltage converter or adapter.&lt;br /&gt;And please guys don&#x27;t buy anything cheaper than this, i had an epilator for 35 € and it was god damn worthless.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect miracles, you will still need a lot of patience to do the job properly, and the first three-four times it will hurt considerably.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always grab all the hairs, many passes in different directions are required to get the job done. I&#x27;ve found that a slow passes works best. Thinner hairs tend to break. I would probably try a different model or brand the next time. Still, I use it regularly and the results are worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/15/2012: I&#x27;ve owned and used this regularly for 1 year and 1 month. Today I found some of the teeth on the tweezer head&#x27;s gear have broken off or worn out, causing the spinning tweezers to stop when any force is required to pull hair while in use, so it&#x27;s basically useless now. Disappointing, for $75 I expected more that a year&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/30/2012: I got a replacement head from Emjoi&#x27;s web site for $33.99 (25.00 plus 8.99 shipping). The head is everything on this thing, so now it&#x27;s like new. I opted for a replacement head because it was much cheaper than a new unit of any brand, though still overpriced IMO. If it lasts 1 year like the original, it will be worth it. I&#x27;ll check back in when it breaks.</li>
            <li> I eagerly waited for so long time for men&#x27;s epilator. After finding this I ordered it from Amazon. But when I tried to Use it for the Time it wont worked and also the adapter given with that was fired after 20 secs. I am scared of that it burned smoking. Don&#x27;t know How it hapened. This product didn&#x27;t allowed me to Use. Did not get till now where is the problem with this only machine or with the company :(.</li>
            <li> Judging from the negative reviews of epilators, some folks simply can&#x27;t take the pain. It seems as simple as that. This device is well built and when you get right down to it- it does its job. Hairs are plucked out, by the root one after another in rapid succession. The simple thought of that may seem awful to some folks but it really isn&#x27;t quite that bad. I have coarse hair and plenty of it- this device managed to remove 99% of my hair and with no negative effects to the skin itself. The device is somewhat loud and the dual opposed rotating heads can seem intimidating but even while rotating they do not cut, pinch or otherwise hurt to touch. The discs target only the hair so if you feel pain when using the epilator it is probably just doing its job and removing the hair, not pinching skin. The device is not foolproof by any means and you must use common sense when using it. Although it does have 72 tweezers, it still requires proper positioning and using the right speed and stroke technique. The way in which you pass the device over your skin will also affect the amount of pain felt and also how well hair will be removed. The device is not meant to work wet, so even a slight amount of perspiration on the skin will affect its ability to epilate properly. Also, the device instructions indicate this is not meant to be used on the face, even though some folks reviews make it clear they&#x27;ve tried it there. I think the manufacturer just doesn&#x27;t want guys trying it on their beards because the ladies model is identical and it says it can be used on the face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;Though the base motor unit seems somewhat cheaply made, the tweezer disc head feels heavy and solid, and should last quite a long time if used properly and with realistic expectations. I would recommend this device to any man looking for a longer lasting solution to shaving. (And someone who doesn&#x27;t mind getting used to the discomfort... No device, regardless of quality and features, will be able to physically do anything (massage, stimulate, etc.) to reduce the pain associated with ripping out hair. Be prepared mentally and just go with it- the mind can overcome anticipatory pain if you let it!ll be able to physically do anything (massage, stimulate, etc.) to reduce the pain associated with ripping out hair. Be prepared mentally and just go with it- the mind can overcome anticipatory pain if you let it!</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure how much I was going to enjoy this product, especially after reading about the pain.  I have shaved, sanded, sugared, and waxed and I have to say this is the best.  It is as effective as waxing without all the mess, as far as the pain goes it was not as bad as waxing for sure and the pain subsided after a short time and I know your going to cringe guys but I was even able to epilate my balls it did hurt a bit but a short time later it wasn&#x27;t bad at all much better than razor burn.  The only complaint is that its noisy as hell and isn&#x27;t charge able as was advertised.  It seams well constructed but only time will tell.  Over all I love it.</li>
            <li> The main plastic drive gear broke after a month of use.  I cleaned the unit several times when it began to slow after plugging with hair, but it the cheap plastic gear broke after a month of use.  I don&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Right out of the box there&#x27;s a problem.  Been using an epolator for years. Braun finally quit. Saw this interesting model with a Cooling  Metal Head, 72 tweezers and all. Well, unless Injection molding Plastic is a new kind of metal, this things got Cow poop written all over it. The only metal in the head are the tweezers. It ain&#x27;t the missing metal thats got me peeved as much as the apparent Bait N switch.  After all,  as soothing as the Cool Metal Head sounds,  nothing short Anesthesia is gonna make ripping bunches of hair out by the root hurt any less. I kinda feel hoodwinked and I have not even finished unpacking the box yet. Really Amazon? I can&#x27;t find the half star.</li>
            <li> Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.  I tried a few times but just can&#x27;t take the pain.  Tylenol, aspirin, even vodka can&#x27;t dull the pain sufficiently to make it bearable.  Additionally, it often break the hair off rather than pulling it.  It may work better if you have coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it with great expectations but sending it back to Amazon.  Its useless. It does not cut any coarse hair as particular of men&#x27;s hair.  I tried epilating hair on my cheeks but it could not do it well despite repeated attempts.  I guess I have to wait till I can get a lazer done.  Also it comes with a 110 V power cord only. Considering it is meant to be portable item , its NOT cool to have a 110 V  power plug only. i saw at Emjoi website, they are selling a 220 V plug separately! Thats robbery. No reason why they could not make a dual one in first place for something which costs 95 us$.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I thought if my wife can do this....so can I...OMG!!!! My wife has got pain tolerance.  She can wax....then a few weeks later use this thing--I used hers to try to remove pubic hair.  Let me tell you I trimmed it down...then tried this...maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right...but she can do this like it&#x27;s nothing...me on the other hand...I was screaming like a little girl...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive...it takes forever for the hair to grow back...but if you ask me it&#x27;s just easier to use nair or something...yea it will grow back quicker and you will have to use it quite a bit, but the chemical burn is way easier to deal with then each hair being pulled one by one (Ouch, I am about to cry just writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK I have used the epilator a few times...and each time has been better...you can read about in the comments section...I rated this initially one star because of the pain...but I have updated because after a few times of using this...it&#x27;s not that bad....</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product. I got it mainly for shoulder/back hair to serve as a more efficient method than having a loved one tweeze individually, or spending tons of cash on wax treatments. Does this product hurt? Yes... but what do you expect. It is definitely more painful going against the hair than with the hair, but often going with the hair doesnt pick it up. I have sensitive skin, so I have a bit of a reaction after using it which lasts about a day. I have only done 1 round, but if it gets less painful as I go along, I will try that. As previous reviewers have written, the cooling head is silly since your body heat will change that. I also tried applying a cold towel after doing an are, but this didn&#x27;t really make it any less painful. Luckily, after a short burning skin discomfort there is no further discomfort. I find yelling obscenities helps alleviate some of the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this product lasts.</li>
            <li> now he can leave mine alone.  i recommend this for any male it is so quick and easy to use</li>
            <li> I had to run this over certain areas a couple times but it did pluck out 99% of the hairs. The bad news is that if you&#x27;re a hairy guy like I am, the pain will be pretty intense while you&#x27;re using it, especially if it&#x27;s your first time ever using an epilator. Thankfully it goes away after a couple seconds, and I hear the more often you do it, the less intense the pain becomes. Let&#x27;s hope that&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used in place of a trimmer for the back and it makes the whole process less often and more efficient</li>
            <li> did not work like it said it would, in fact it was very painful, and did not remove hardly any hair.</li>
            <li> works well.  Nice machine</li>
            <li> Stopped working right after the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I like this product and really works but sometimes when i have to do this to myself i regret that i bought this for my self. I just do this for my wife. I have to a little safer but what you would do for love.</li>
            <li> This product is a great alternative to laser hair removal for men. The metal head cools as it removes hair.</li>
            <li> If you intend to use the emjoi 4 Men, you better be a man and handle the pain like one. Our hair is thicker and more course and it does hurt to rip it out! This product hurts more than waxing but is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t leave a mess. The most painful area for me was on my thighs and knees--and yes I did my entire body (chest to feet). I was hesitant to use it \\&quot;down there\\&quot; for obvious reasons but it&#x27;s safe, you wont get skin caught up in the machine, and it&#x27;s not TOO painful BUT the redness does last a couple days. There is a learning curve, some users say use circles but the manual says use brush strokes...I think it really depends on the area. A hot shower may help with pain if you&#x27;re just doing a small body part, but the whole process took me about 4 hours because you start sweating and you need to take breaks. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the results, it won&#x27;t be as perfect as waxing but you can touch up as needed. I&#x27;m hoping this thing lasts a few years...the base of the unit feels rather cheap, it&#x27;s dark blue not black, and it must always be plugged in (not rechargeable or cordless) The head of the unit feels heavy and well made and the trimmer attachment is always handy. If the unit doesn&#x27;t break in a few months than it&#x27;s a great bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> I feel like a mans back is way too sensitive for this product.  The process was slow and very painful.</li>
            <li> So my honest review is as follows. This thing hurts. Not 100% sure my wife was doing it as gentle as she could have on my back hair but it hurts. The &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; more firm parts of my back it was not as bad but on the areas coming toward the sides it was a pretty intense sting. I highly suggest as directions say to trim the hair a bit before you start. Just trim not shave. BUT for all that I will say it does a great job. I am now 3 weeks after just my 1st use and I still have no need to do a new &amp;#34;run&amp;#34;. Much better than the temporary fix of shaving. Be ready for some pain but be ready to love this as well. I would take the short sting for the long term (few weeks) of smooth back. I&#x27;m not super hairy but have some solid patches on my back. I love how it looks now. But if you are doing your back you will need help. On a secondary note I bought a back &amp;#34;scrub brush&amp;#34; for the shower. I have never used one before but am using it to exfoliate as it sounds like thsi may reduce teh risk of ingrown hairs when teh hair does grow back. That sounds not fun so just doing something preventative that my skin most likely needs anyway. And it feels nice in the shower. Buy this.</li>
            <li> I tried using it on the first day i did not mind the pain so much but having pain and on top of that not working like its suppose to just not for me also the shaver to it doesnt even cut that well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little loud but gets the job done.  It hurt a little the first time I used it but you do get used to it</li>
            <li> I have no complains about this epilator so far. I have been using it for a couple of months and haven&#x27;t given me any problems. The Head is interchangeable between the epilator and a trimmer/shaver. Additional to that it brings a cleaning brush, the cable, a trimming comb for the trimmer, caps for both of the heads and pouch for putting everything in.   Compared with previous epilators I had, this one does the job a bit faster. It&#x27;s a bit big so it&#x27;s kind of tricky in some places. The little comb that&#x27;s between the epilator heads helps lifting shorter hairs. The cooling head isn&#x27;t a plus feature, even if you put it in the fridge for a bit the cooling effect doesn&#x27;t last long because it warms with your body heat.   Like any other epilator it hurts but it depends on your hair type and pain resistance. Hair growth it&#x27;s the same for me but I preferred to shaving because it last more and leaves skin smooth. You just have to remember to exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> The ultimate manscaping tool, and the wife can use it too... Remove unwanted hair from all over your body, and just trim it down.</li>
            <li> Ok, i have to admit that the first time i used the Emjoi it was painful, BUT not the excruciating pain that i read in other reviews. It was a very manageable pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grab a pair of tweezers and pull one hair from your chest, if you can handle the pain, then stay hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some areas are pain free and some are not, but once i was done with the first session, the keep-up was very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one thing that i learn from an ex-girlfriend, exfoliation for 2-3 days in a row, before and after removing hair, helps reducing the ingrowing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The first time I used it I was very painful, but I stuck with it and it was worth it. After the hair started growing back, some of them grew inside the pore causing some swelling and redness, which I guess was something I did wrong. But the machine really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once since I&#x27;ve bought it because my experience the first time wasn&#x27;t great. I follow all of the instructions and still after the fourth day there were bumps on my upper chest. I had to use tweezers to pick out some of the hairs that were starting to regrow and cause irritation. I&#x27;m guessing it caused problems because it&#x27;s hard to stretch the skin in the upper chest area especially if you&#x27;re a skinny person like myself. It did work great in the stomach area. Pain wasn&#x27;t too bad and you definitely get used to it. I&#x27;ve thought about using this again but I&#x27;m waiting for a time when I don&#x27;t have to be shirtless in case the irritation happens again.</li>
            <li> I get this epilator and its already not working Im really very angry :( Im not US sitizen or wish to back it to seller.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great option when you have not time for waxing. I doesn&#x27;t remove the whole hair, it&#x27;s difficult with short hairs in particular. I use it on my arms and nape. It hurts but ain&#x27;t no big deal, you feel like very small pinches. As you know some areas will be more sentive.</li>
            <li> I have not used razors in 30+ years so was looking to replace my old epilator. I have tried a number of models. I can quit looking now! I bought the men&#x27;s color  version because often times, they are stronger and more durable. This is an excellent epilator for a woman too. Very durable and works quickly. The others I have had (women&#x27;s models) needed patience and going over the same spit many times. This works quickly and easily. Am VERY happy with quality of it.</li>
            <li> This product works really well it pulls almost all the hairs on the first swipe, the only drawback... It hurts!  My children use it on each other as a torture device.  But with minor yelps of pain and a few tears it works really well.  If I were to describe the pain I would put it about as painful as a tattoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bicyclist and I love the look and feel of clean shaven legs. I must admit that I have thick curly hair and this little machine kind of intimidated me when I first tried it. It was working but it was taking a little too much time and it was a little too painful. I&#x27;m sure if I kept it up then it would get better but I never quite saw the value in it when I could just as easily shave my legs and not have to do it again for several months. To each their own.</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t work. I followed the directions perfectly and after 35 passes over the same tiny area on my leg it STILL has some hair left. My first experience with an epilator and I&#x27;m kinda mad that I wasted 80 bucks on this thing.</li>
            <li> If you are hairy you must also be a lover of pain, because this is without question a painful device to use.  It might be bearable if it took it off in one pass, but this is not the case.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work unless it is plugged in. Without the cord it&#x27;s useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The Emjoi AP-18MS is what I expected. It would be nice if Emjoi could design a head the was more efficient in removing hair.</li>
            <li> Although not advertised as such, I expected the unit would be independent of a wall socket.  It has a rather long dangling cord which attaches to the unit and a wall-wart-type transformer.  The unit itself performs very well.</li>
            <li> The 72 tweezers that this model uses as a selling point makes no difference while pulling hair.&lt;br /&gt;1) because of the curved shape (concave) doesn&#x27;t pick small hair, as the tweezers don&#x27;t come close to skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) have to be plugged in for use. I expect rechargeable item if i am paying 80$&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this item after a week of use. Ordered Braun SE 7181 WD Silk Epil 7 Epilator, received yesterday and it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;I will not recommend Emoji AP-18MS to anyone looking for an epilator.</li>
            <li> The gears inside are Plastic. This is a Major problem makes it break down very easily. Mine has broke twice with one year. Baby powder helps a ton on making things smoother for you. But the plastic gears kills this thing I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one. This is a honest review i have it used here and there not all the time so. Gonna get it replaced again wish i could just return it for a refund buy something else .</li>
            <li> I think the people who gave this item poor reviews didn&#x27;t really know what epilating was when they bought this.  Epilating is painful (I mean, you are pulling out your hair!), has the potential to cause ingrowns (which is why you MUST exfoliate), and does not remove every single little hair on your body (you will NOT be silky smooth like when you shave)... that pretty much sums up the complaints in 90% of the poor reviews.  So, if you already know what you are getting into, just ignore the haters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing this I had only ever used a cheap $40 epilator my friend had and it was the worst experience ever.  It was super painful, irritated my skin terribly, and tore a lot of hairs rather than plucking them.  This epilator, however, causes approximately 1/10th the level of pain of the cheapo epilator.  Also, this epilator very quickly (it takes me 15min min to do my chest, abdomen and lower back) plucks a majority of the hairs and I have yet to notice any skin irritation.  [NOTE: I would like to echo the advice of another reviewer and highly suggest the use of baby powder.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are like I was and are uncertain about whether you should get this, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DO.  Especially if you are a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason the female version of this epilator is so highly rated--it is awesome.  This is basically the same thing, but black and made of metal (thus, more rugged), so it made no sense to me why this was rated significantly lower.  I&#x27;ve chalked it up to guys who didn&#x27;t know what they were doing, who have a low pain-tolerance, and who decided to voice their complaints and give bad reviews.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with am Epilator. This product did not perform as well as I would like. I have been using it for weeks and continue to have difficulty with it removing all hair even after numerous passes. It seems to do more poorly with shorter regrown hair.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband so he didn&#x27;t have to use mine (Braun epilator) he has barely hair onhis legs. I used it and I don&#x27;t think has much power or that many tweetzers. I preffer my epilator 100 times.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator to remove hair from my torso to be more comfortable shirtless.  I was initially impressed with performance.  It was painful, but achieved the advertised results... for about two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I happen to be afflicted with pili multigemini, a condition in which multiple strands of hair emerge from a single follicle.  Other effects include extremely deeply rooted hair (causing higher than usual levels of pain when epilating) and a ridiculously short regeneration time for a plucked hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found I was enduring a lot of extra pain and effort for a result hardly better than shaving.  In order to retain the appearance of smooth skin I needed to use the emagine at least every other day.  Ingrown hairs were also a frequent problem resulting in unattractive little bumps and red spots all over.  In the end I gave up on it and returned to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also worth noting the rotating head cannot reach concave areas of skin properly such as between the pecs and around well defined abs.</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachment that arrived with mine was defective, so I returned it for a refund (because for some reason they couldn&#x27;t just replace the trimmer attachment; they wanted the entire unit back). I do appreciate the fact that I got a refund, but I can&#x27;t give you feedback about the shaving attachment. The epilator part itself worked, but I had to return it along with the shaving attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it one star, though, because after just one use, it caused permanent hair removal for me, on the spot that I used it. It was excruciating (which I was expecting, so that&#x27;s not factored into my rating), but I just don&#x27;t think my skin type was meant to be epilated. If you have sensitive skin, do not use this.  I wasn&#x27;t looking for a permanent hair removal solution - I just wanted something that gave similar results to waxing. This product advertised hairlessness for 6 weeks, which would have been perfect. But I&#x27;m not kidding you - I used this epilator just once, on one strip on my stomach, and the hair has not grown back there 9 months later. Perhaps its the speed with which the tweezers spin, or the angle at which they pull the hairs out. Perhaps I&#x27;m the exception, but I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> Initially I was very pleased with this item.I purchased it in August of 2103.Followed the instructions precisely and it removed the hair for an extended period of time.Then I went to use the item in Feb.-a mere 6 months after the purchase and half of the rotating heads were dead.This machine was never dropped,misused and was cleaned after each use.The enclosed instructions were followed exactly.I think that for $100 I should have gotten a longer performance span out of this machine.I am now looking at other epilators as i would not purchase this machine again.It&#x27;s one of the few times i&#x27;ve been disappointed by an Amazon purchase</li>
            <li> Broke on the first try, quit working. However, the return and credit for the purchase was quick and easy. Might work for others...</li>
            <li> Works better then cheaper models.  Follow directions and it gets less painful every time you use it</li>
            <li> Just got the Emagine Epilator for Men and it seems like a much better product than the standard Emagine (the red one). I am a guy who only uses my epilator on my legs during summer road biking season. Had the red Emagine before and it stopped working in less than 2 summers of use (i.e. stopped working only a few months after expiration of warranty.) Called Emjoi tech support and they didn&#x27;t seem surprised. I still have my original Optima, which still works after years of use. But the Emagine line is definitely an improvement in terms of epilation speed and thoroughness. Thought I&#x27;d try the Emagine for Men when my original Emagine stopped working. Head is noticeably heavier than the original and head stays MUCH cooler during use. So far, so good. It it lasts longer than my original Emagine (and hopefully as long as my Optima) I will increase rating to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get accustomed to the pulling out of the hair, but it does a great job.  It is great to be hair free for a much longer period of time with no razor stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been happily using the Emjoi Optima for over 10 years which was discontinued.  Did a great job with thick &amp; thin hairs, especially on the chest area (obviously, i&#x27;m a guy...).  It finally stopped working so it was time to replace and I figured Emjoi was the go-to brand since I was so happy with my optima.  Um, no...  The optima&#x27;s tweezer heads were mostly flat without the major raised stainless steel sides so the head made full contact with your skin.  With the emagine, between the curve of the tweezer head and the protruding stainless steel &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; side pieces it made minimum skin contact for the mostly flat parts a guy would be using this on - chest - back - abs.  After spending twice the time I normally would use with the optima, it missed 30% of the hairs.  Also I noticed a fair amount of broken hairs instead of removing them.  The optima had 2 tweezer heads too but it didn&#x27;t spin as fast so less hairs broke (and yes I used this on the low speed setting in finer hair areas).  The cool steel part actually starts dragging on your skin causing the machine to bounce over your skin rather than glide making skin contact even more difficult.  Returning it to Amazon &amp; gonna try the Braun silk-epil 5 next.  Now that I know what to look for it has a mostly flat head and only 1 rotating tweezer so hopefully it will make more skin contact and remove more hairs rather than break them.  And so what, it&#x27;s pink - i&#x27;m in the privacy of my own home and don&#x27;t need a black and steel one...</li>
            <li> This unit works well for underarms, and bikini line. Works well on legs also.</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the box. Horrifically painful experience - but that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault. I blame the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It needs to be plugged in for use, but the chord is long enough.</li>
            <li> This thing is quick! I found if I shave first, then start using this thing everyday for about a week after, there is less pain. It can hurt if started on full hair growth, but the day after a shave, it is less shocking.</li>
            <li> When I plugged it in it didn&#x27;t work for 10 seconds. Rubbish I want my money back</li>
            <li> Awesome, works well, lasts long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve no complaints, no malfunctions, nothing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in sensitive areas (underarms and groin) and have yet to have a single problem</li>
            <li> works great, only wish it had a longer handle, and an angled head.</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; version because at the time, the black one was cheapest.  Check all the colors before you buy as the price varies by color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second epilator, third if you count my mom&#x27;s 80s-era Epilady, which was a vile instrument of torture. I bought a ~$40 epilator in a store a year ago to try it and see if it was for me.  It was definitely an improvement over the mess of waxing, but the thing was cordless with poor battery life and the plug connector was bad so you had to figure out the magic angle to get it to be powered at all. However, it was enough of a taste to tell me that epilators were the solution for me. I&#x27;m a full-time working mother of a rowdy 4yo who loves to swim, and I&#x27;m also heavily pregnant. I don&#x27;t have time and I can&#x27;t stand like a stork in the shower to shave, besides, there are large parts of my body that I can&#x27;t even see right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This epilator was less painful than my previous one and it is FAST. I did both legs from the knees-down in ten minutes. It&#x27;s pretty loud, but I managed to do it while watching TV with my half-deaf husband and neither the epilator nor the TV woke the 4yo. The epilator was effective.  I did my legs in the dark, but minimal touch-up was required. (It&#x27;s nearly 2 weeks later and I still haven&#x27;t gotten around to the touching up it&#x27;s that sparse and I&#x27;m blonde.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really nice touch is that the epilator comes with an electric razor attachment. Like I said, there are fairly vast areas of my body I can&#x27;t see.  This razor attachment was very useful in that I could use it blindly on these invisible areas without hurting myself.</li>
            <li> If I could, I would rate this product lower. This product is a huge waste of money. First of all, the curved construction which is supposed to be &#x27;specifically designed&#x27; to go with the contours of your body is useless. You&#x27;ll have a hell of a time trying to epilate your shoulders. Second, you have to go over each area multiple times, and a lot of hairs are not pulled out by their root. You will end up ripping out more hairs without their follicle. Lastly, it&#x27;s just a pain in the butt. Just spend however much money you need to get your &#x27;effected area&#x27; waxed. They&#x27;ll do it right and it&#x27;ll last longer. I regret this purchase very, very much.</li>
            <li> It does a good job but it is kinda cheap, mine worked fine for a week and now the power cord is broken inside. I had to bend it aroud to fine the sweet spot and tape it to hold it shape and work. Overall i&#x27;m not very impress about the quality ans the consumer service.</li>
            <li> It works. It hurts. It hurts more than waxing initially, though not as messy. Your skin goes a little numb when using it. The key is not to stop, it won&#x27;t hurt as much.  Make sure to exfoliate your skin prior to use. I like to use alcohol after to decrease bumps.</li>
            <li> I have owned the women&#x27;s brand and gone thru a couple in 5 years.  This seems more sturdy.  In the summer months I take off most off my body hair. It&#x27;s cooler in the Florida summer heat.  So far I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first epilator. It&#x27;s a very painful process! It&#x27;s best to get some spirit or solution that makes your skin numb before epilating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like hair. Shaving leaves stubbles.  This, while a little uncomfortable, leaves skin smooth and lasts a lot longer than shaving.  My partner loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the second epilator I have purchased. My first was an Emjoi Optima. It has been an awesome product but I&#x27;ve owned it since 2006. The gears have worn out and one side no longer spins. I have to say I was severely disappointed in the new Emjoi Emagine. It did not work as well as the Optima. In fact, it was so bad, I pulled out my old Optima that only has one side working and used it. It still works way better than the Emagine. I only use this product on my private areas and Emagine is just not the best product for this. I&#x27;ll probably be purchasing another Optima very soon.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t remove my really thick, tough hairs. It can&#x27;t be used on the face. It left me with terrible looking red dots for a few days where the hair used to be. It&#x27;s not powerful enough for the trimmer to work without tugging on your hair. The gears are made of plastic, so they&#x27;re bound to wear out quickly. I do not like this product. I feel that waxing or tweezing would give better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stinging pain sensation wasn&#x27;t too bad. It removed a good majority of the hairs. A few passes should take care of the ones it missed the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly don&#x27;t like this because of how it made me look like I had a full body rash for a whole 3 days and then some. I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if that problem goes away.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator for use on back and upper arms. It worked fine for 6 months or so, and then the plastic gear under the removable head broke. It was still under warranty, so I returned it for a new one. The same thing happened again with the replacement, after about 6 months of using it twice a month. They really need to change the design, and replace the plastic gear for a metal one. I&#x27;m going to try the Panasonic next time and see if I have better luck.</li>
            <li> It works ok but not as good as cheaper ones i have used, the shaver attachment sucks.</li>
            <li> easy to use better than other product it is easy to clean and store away for that smooth look that guys like would recommend in the future a battery rechargeable product</li>
            <li> I am a man, and this was the best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a while. The price at Amazon was amazing. I bought the men&#x27;s version of the ap-18 and I am very happy with it. I would have been happier with the red version, but only slightly because the edges on the head slope up on the men&#x27;s version and down on the ladies. This causes some problems getting into some areas of my skin. I like to be hairless from the neck down, and I have some very coarse hair in places, but this thing plucks even the thickest hairs almost painlessly. There are some tricks to this though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First off, if you have never waxed or epilated before, it will hurt like a mad man. What I mean is if you are starting off with old growth, thick shaved hairs, you will most likely cry from using it on most places, but if you are using it on fine new growth you will not feel pain just a gentle and mild sting. One thing I have learned is that you should use baby powder. It makes the hairs stand up and the epilator glide over your skin. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t figure that out until I had used the thing for a whole week. Baby powder makes the process ten times less painful and at least two to three times quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found that I could not predict what body parts would hurt the most. For instance, I figured that the crack, taint and hole would have been the most painful, but it was the least. That did require some slight acrobatics to accomplish. My wife could not stop laughing at me. I also found that my ribcage was almost unbearable. It was intensely painful and tickled so much I could not hold still.&lt;br /&gt;My wife had to do my back, and that also hurt.  I found that if someone else did it I could not anticipate the pain so it was worse.&lt;br /&gt;If you are very hairy I suggest that you wax first or do something called sugaring. Sugaring is less painful than waxing, but more time consuming and more messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Anyway, the ap-18 is the best and most effective epilator I have ever used.  The head spins so fast and there are so many tweezers, that the hairs just seem to fall out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I just love this product. It makes me so smooth and it is luxurious to use. My wife loves touching me now that I have no sharp stubble. And it makes me look amazing</li>
            <li> Takes way too many passes to pluck...</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to the pain of having your hair yanked out from the follicle but the result is worth it. This is the best men&#x27;s epilator out there.</li>
            <li> Rough and hurts but does the job</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair in 2 or 3 passes &amp; it hurts big time.</li>
            <li> WoW, This item works pretty well. Most the reviews that talk about pain are are telling the truth. If you never waxed an area and have old growth, get ready for the pain! Newer growth has very little pain. This is the first time i used one things can only get better.</li>
            <li> I only use the product one time, the next time I tried it just stopped working, I had to spend more money buying a replacement head but apparently the problem was in the engine ... I never use the product and I lost all my money</li>
            <li> I had never used an Epilator before but I got tired of shaving my junk.When I recieved it and looked at the head I was a bit concerned but I went ahead and used it.It worked fine as long as you held the skin tight and it didn&#x27;t take very long to get the job done.There was some pain but nothing I couldn&#x27;t endure and now I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and I&#x27;m sure that it will get easier as time goes by.I am concerned about how long it will last because some of the reviews said it quit working after a short time.You should know that the add says that it is rechargeable but it isn&#x27;t,it has to be pluged in to work.</li>
            <li> I loved this and works great for me on back then down there... Now using smaller version to keep up with it... Stored away for while now... It does pull hair out, those you out there, suggest you get yourself waxed first couple times before doing this yourself, waxing is quicker and short time,  otherwise first timers, would have tears when attempt try first time.... It does hurt but later .... You can bear the pain. I been doing this coupe years, kept up with it.  Loved being bare. This is good unit... Has 72 pullers, now I&#x27;m using 16 so pullers, I&#x27;d recommend this one but get yourself different sizes on hand.</li>
            <li> This things works great!&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend uses it on my back (she likes me smooth).&lt;br /&gt;We used to have an older model that was quite painful.  This device makes back grooming ... not painless, but certainly a heck of a lot easier and more comfortable.  Again, it&#x27;s not entirely painless, but it&#x27;s a whole lot better than it was.</li>
            <li> First off, I had every expectation of this being painful.  I know that removing hair from the root would hurt, and I expected nothing less.  That being said... this is horrifically painful!  So much more than waxing!  Maybe I had a defective product, or maybe my hair is unusually tough, but I felt as if this was ripping my skin apart.  I suppose it would be worth the pain if it actually removed all the hair.  After a good 7-10 passes over a sparse patch of hair it did not remove it all!  Don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that it removed most hair on the first pass either.  It only grabbed a few hairs at a time, which lead me to believe that what I was feeling was the tweezers pinching my skin and not plucking the hair.  Nothing is more important than looking good, believe me... so if this worked I would certainly endure the pain.  I sent this torture device  back to the seller, and I sure hope I get my money back.  Stick with tweezing, shaving, and waxing.</li>
            <li> Read some other reviews that talk about not needing to do anything for sixty days after using the epilator.  It doesn&#x27;t quite work that way, but this has been much better than shaving.  The dual heads keep the skin from being pulled or grabbed, and have made all the difference.  The first time you use it...expect pain.  If you can expect the pain and realize it isn&#x27;t going to kill you...it&#x27;s just pain, then you&#x27;ll be fine.  I sweat alot from either the discomfort or my body just reacting to the device grabbing my hair, so I grab an ice pack and place it on my leg.  It just keeps my body cooler while I use the epilator on my arms and shoulders.  My girlfriend does my back, which works out well since she is the one that doesn&#x27;t like the few hairs I do have on my back.  Overall, really like it.  The best epilator I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> this product is simply beautiful. works the way it has to be and more importantly the amount of time consumed is lesser then as compared with any other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would had been even better if it had a charging option.</li>
            <li> Very good. Last forever it seems between hair removals. To prevent in-grow hairs I would suggest that you use a loufa.</li>
            <li> I got these because the ones I had for women before, the tweezers went dull and we&#x27;re jamming, so I thought the men&#x27;s one would be sturdier and so far so good. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the metal heats up really quick and the two metal pieces on the side make it hard to go over the skin when it&#x27;s hot and your body is hot!</li>
            <li> I would like to start off saying that I had high hopes for this product based on numerous good reviews and even a mention in the most current GQ magazine. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the results after initial use. The hair I was removing was thick, so I tried to trim it down to make it a bit easier to remove and reduce the likelihood of tugging and pulling the hairs. This had little to no effect. It took numerous passes just to clear a small section of skin, which is not exactly the most pleasant experience. I understand that the process is going to be painful, I bought a machine that rips out body hair, duh; but having to make numerous passes requires a significant time investment to the process just increasing the overall pain experience. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they are trying to remove thin, sparse patches of hair; definetely not for hairier people. I am just going to stick to waxing.</li>
            <li> Alright so this is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this and I decided to start on my thigh. As with all the other reviews, its hurts. But 30 minutes I finished an area the skin cleared up and all the hair was gone. The device itself does seem to be a bit on the cheaply built side of things but only time will tell. I&#x27;ll update in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> He loves it, it was a Valentine&#x27;s Day gift.... since he loves it, so do I...</li>
            <li> Works great totally impressed by the quality and performance</li>
            <li> The dual opposing heads are not effective at all!  The tweezers are also kind of sunk in, so it&#x27;s hard to make contact with your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt to use this one, likely because it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of getting all the hairs.  I have had my braun silk epil for several years now and will never switch from braun again.  Their epilators are just superior to the Emjoi Emagine and Emjoi eRase.</li>
            <li> Emjoi was servicable for months- though died and I paid 119usd for it and just bought a Remington at Target for 49usd and its just as effective. Hoping Remington makes better motors.</li>
            <li> I just received mine today....July 7th.  I have had my chest waxed a couple of times before, as far as pain is concerned this was about the same.. Neat part is is that you are in control.  I trimmed moderately short, I showered, then used gold bond.  Using a powder helps alot.  Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you that it doesn&#x27;t hurt, its not true.  I got thru my chest and stomach area in about 1/2 an hour.  This unit was very effective, did what was advertised (ripping hair out by the roots]. Its basically a mini roto-tiller!!  I had a couple of beers while I did it, eases the pain somewhat.  I am told by my wife, just like in waxing, the more you do it, the less it will hurt.  All in all, very happy that I made this purchase.  However I didn&#x27;t trust it around my nipples. I didn&#x27;t want to erase them, chuckle... Buy it, its good!!!! Oh yeah, I also bought a hair inhibitor spray.. 2 spray bottles... Makes sense to keep the hair at bay!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is my follow-up: ts July 22nd.&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this item and used it the first time on July 7th.. I have used it 3 times all together.. Using a hair inhibitor afterwards really yields amazing results. My hair growth has been greatly diminished. And yes it does get less painful the more times you use it! Either that or I&#x27;m getting so that I enjoy the pain part! It works so well that I have gone from chest and stomach to pretty much everywhere else. I honestly wish I would have used one of these many years ago. If this thing ever wears out, I will automatically by another, its that good! Take care, RSBNG</li>
            <li> For roughly $80 you would expect to get a device that performs as-described and is built somewhat well, the Emjoi AP-18MS does not meet those expectations.  The construction of each component is laughable.  First, the epilator head is made of pig metal and cheap plastic including a plastic drive-gear.  This results in a loud and clunky operation of the device and I suspect the plastic drive gear makes the devices days numbered.  Additionally, the body itself is amazingly light considering it must house a small motor.  Lets just say it feels very cheap.  Lastly, the shaver attachment head is quite possibly the cheapest trimmer/shaver head I have ever seen.  Like the epilator head, it too is constructed of poor metal and cheap plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the functionality, it is a miracle it works at all, but it does function to some extent.  The epilator head seams to work pretty well on very thin hair (although it is hard to know if it is breaking the hairs rather than pulling them) while even the most slightly-coarse hair will need dozens of passes to target and remove them.  Its poor results are partly due to its concave shape (slightly depressed in the middle to reduce the risk of pinching skin).  This results in hair removal at both ends of the head but not towards the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although there are plenty of reviews that mention the pain factor, I will throw in my 50 cents.  During general use, the pain level is pretty bearable.  The sensation is that of stinging or pinching in a relatively small area.  Again, it is pretty bearable unless (I imagine) you point it at your junk...all bets are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I would say the construction of this device is laughable and while I may have higher expectations of product quality than others I would still recommend staying away from this device until these companies start manufacturing them with some hint of quality.  Case and point, look at what $100 gets you in an electric razor (much nicer construction,ergonomics, cordless operation, build quality, etc.).  This is one product to skip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Drew H_</li>
            <li> First off, I would have given this epilator 5 stars, but it&#x27;s not rechargeable &amp; can&#x27;t be used cordless as described (and for the price I hoped it would be), but it does have  an extra long cord.  Now for what&#x27;s good.  The epilator worked better than I expected; works as well as getting waxed, but without the stickiness.  I recommend using a skin soother afterwards to reduce redness and bumps, but that&#x27;s always to be expected when your plucking hair from the roots.  I also thought it would be more painful, maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m used to getting waxed, but there was only some mild stinging - nothing that made tears flow.  It does help to trim hair down though, do not use on hairs past 1/2\\&quot;.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase - especially when it pays for itself versus paying to get waxed every 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake, plucking large numbers of hairs at a time is painful, but if you&#x27;re willing, the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> So, i read most of the reviews. I wouldn&#x27;t say they all are good or bad and since i am a Newcomer to this, I cant wait to use it. (PS. I am on my Half sisters Fathers account i am 16(btw my name is brian))Now i aint afraid of little pain. Such as, needles, Lip ring piercing. Falling on my face while skiing and hitting a rock about the size of a soft ball and come out all right. YET, i really don&#x27;t want to Shave in said locations anymore. Im daring, i like to experience new things. So this will be new to me. From what i have read it might hurt pinch. Ohwell this is what you bought right? lol expect what you have gotten. Any ways, Supposedly baby powder helps, so ill try that. Then its how its made. I guess its cheap materials or some stuff, its the new age guys. Every thing is cheaply made. Look at the iphones. Three dollars to make? HA sheesh. You pay for what you pay for, they might not be full informative in it but what ever. So once it come sin the mail (3 to 5 day shipping) Ill Update this and give a little opinion on it.    --Update space--    2/12/13- Just got it in Came in a nice normal small box, the packaging is great, and im going to see what it is going to feel like.  (opens package)Okay so it comes with the instructions the charger, the warranty, and interchangeable head. cover, and comb. Time to try it.    2Hours later  barley did my leg. S*** hurts. But it does its job. I can withstand from crying like a little baby but tbh it does hurt. um, Ill try it later after a bath. Lol.</li>
            <li> Very efficient, fast and comfortable.  It cut the time I was used to the process taking in half.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  Leaves you smooth with very little pain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator to replace my Emjoi Optima (after having it for about 8 years or so).  I didn&#x27;t rebuy the Optima because this one has a bigger grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars as the head of the epilator does seem to get as many hairs as the Optima.  I think the guard design is a bit lower on the Optima which seems to get the smaller stubborn hairs better.</li>
            <li> I knew going in that this was going to be painful.. and I have a high tolerance for pain.. but WOW! I have used this 3 times and \\&quot;plucked\\&quot; about 15 hairs of my shoulder. This might be the most painful thing I&#x27;ve ever experienced. IF you can endue the pain, it works wonderful. I have think hair just FYI.</li>
            <li> It worked for like two years or so, its not built to last long, the head stopped spinning as the gear material is plastic.&lt;br /&gt;It does remove the hair very good, excellent, smooth feeling once hair is removed. The hair takes long to grow back and grows back thinner.&lt;br /&gt;As said, the results are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend the product,&lt;br /&gt;i used it under my arms and private area and works very good, once hair is removed the area is very smooth. Just wish it was more robust and can last longer.</li>
            <li> works great!!amazing!!!!!!love it!!!greattttttt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi AP-18MS Emagine Epilator for Men, Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi AP-18MS Emagine Epilator for Men, Black&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi AP-18MS Emagine Epilator for Men, Black</li>
            <li> I have tried this machine in every possible way and it foes not work. It only pulls a cou0le of hairs and thats it. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Bought it to remove my hair off my back and chest. WOW does it hut. &amp;#34;It pulls it from it roots. I have to do little parts of my body each day. It leaves red marks everywhere after uses it. This would work great if the government wanted torcher someone. I give it a big OUCH</li>
            <li> Ouch!!! is all I can say!</li>
            <li> Aweful  epilator doesn&#x27;t work at all another blade for trimming is just a peice of s*** adding extra weight to the package.    When I ask for return it say I have to pay for postal by myself to return this idiot thing.    Any good reviews posted for this product is only by seller of this product.</li>
            <li> It is relatively easy to use. Better than the no-no shaver because it really shaves. The cost was reasonable and the ordering was simple.</li>
            <li> I bought my Emjoi Emagine approximately a month ago, and so far I think it was a good investment. While painful to use, I have found that even within a month it seems to hurt less than it did on the first day. I tend to either take a few advil before epilating, or a few shots of whiskey. Either way, it&#x27;s still necessary for me to epilate my thighs. I bought the Emagine for Men, which came with the epilator, the charger cord, the shaving attachment, and the trimmer attachment, as well as a bag to hold it all. This was a much better deal than what I would have gotten if I had bought the Emagine for women, which does not include any of the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the first day that not only did it hurt, but the epilator seemed to break a  lot of the hair, rather than pulling it out. I think this was because it was my first time using an epilator, and at times the pain caused me to hold the device improperly. Now it works seamlessly, and I love it. One downside is how loud it is. My boyfriend prefers for me to only epilate when he isn&#x27;t home, so he doesn&#x27;t have to hear it. I can still watch TV while epilating though, I just have to turn up the volume more than I normally would. There are a few other downsides though. The machine doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair, even though it does come close. Because of this it can&#x27;t leave my legs silky smooth, so for special occasions I will still need to shave. I also noticed that if I used it around my bikini line, pulling out the hairs would actually cause a small amount of blood. So, the product is demoted 1 star because I still need to buy razors. Since hair grows at different rates, using the epilator means that, even if I need to buy razors, I am not going through them as quickly as I did before. All in all the Emjoi Emagine is a great device, and I am glad I went with the version for men despite the fact that I am female.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product through TREND MARKETING at $80 for the product, cord, attachments, and bag. It also got 2 day shipping through Prime so it was a pretty good deal all things considered.</li>
            <li> The product does what it claims. However having tired it now for 4 weeks, I can say it&#x27;s not for me. My hair is far too thick, often growing back into the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been epilating for over 2 years.  I can&#x27;t believe I ever shaved with a razor, such a waste of time!!  This is my 2nd Emjoi epilator, the first had 30 tweezers, which did the job but took forever.  I did a lot of research before buying this because of the price.  I&#x27;m a big believer in corded electronics.  I&#x27;ve had to many issues with battery operated items in the past.  I wanted a new epilator with more tweezers to reduce the time spent on epilating.  I was hoping to find one that worked in the shower, but those all had some sort of battery.  No good.  They also say it&#x27;s best to epilate after a shower when your pores are relaxed and open, so I gave up on looking for one that was water proof.  I&#x27;ve been happy with the Emjoi brand, so went with this brand again.  I&#x27;m really glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I love about this product....corded...no need to hurry, or worry about a battery failing.  72 tweezers!  I am done with both of my legs in about 10-15 minutes.  This thing comes with a shaver attachment, which I use on my other lady bits and it does a great job.  The heads are both easy to clean.  It has a storage pouch.  It&#x27;s just another GREAT epilator by Emjoi.  I bought the black one because since it&#x27;s adv for men, it&#x27;s like $20 cheaper.  I have no idea why.  I compared it to the pink version and they are identical.  So buy a black one.  Who cares about color anyhow.  This thing tears out hear so fast I don&#x27;t have time to feel any pain.  I even epilate my bikini line now with no issues (something I feared I&#x27;d never be able to tolerate).  I usually use this about 1x a week or every other week.  I am hair free and loving it!  Just a suggestion....if you epilate, go buy yourself a Salux brand Japanese wash cloth.  You must exfoliate!  And Salux is the ONLY product I&#x27;ve found that does the best job of it!  Between this epilator and the salux, my skin is as soft as if it was just shaved with a razor.  No ingrown hair issues either.  I&#x27;m VERY happy with this purchase and would suggest anyone that hates shaving to give epliation a try.  I&#x27;m an Emjoi customer for life.and would suggest anyone that hates shaving to give epliation a try.  I&#x27;m an Emjoi customer for life.</li>
            <li> This unit does a good job as long as you make several passes. The problem is the unit is totally useless after the plastic gear fails approximately 6 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;I would tell everyone to not purchase this unit until they make a metal gear assembly for this.&lt;br /&gt;Please make a metal gear assembly that is interchangeable with the current model.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;miedstkr</li>
            <li> This is probably best for someone with fine hair. I tried it on my chest and stomach and it hurt a bit (duh), but did the job. The only complaint I have is that it tended to leave red bumps, even when I cleaned the epilator and my chest with alcohol. The first time was the worst--they took a couple of weeks to go away. I tried it on smaller areas since and haven&#x27;t had the same problem. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you want to show off your newly-smooth chest right away, but it&#x27;s a great long-term investment. I use it on my neck and cheekbones to get rid of fine hairs, and it works incredibly well for that, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy and recently I&#x27;ve decided I wanted to try getting rid of some of it. About two to three weeks ago I gave shaving a go and that effing sucked. Bad. Within a day the stubble made it outright painful to wear a t-shirt, and sitting down was mildly irritating at best, painful at worst because of the stubble on the back of my legs. This continued for about two weeks until the hair finally grew out a fair bit. After that experience the only area of body hair I will ever even consider touching with a razor again is my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the search for other hair removal methods and this epilator. I also considered the Braun SE7681, but ended up going with this one due to price. I also liked the fact that it was corded since I&#x27;ve got a shaver now that has an irritating habit of dying mid-shave if I don&#x27;t plug it in after every use. Lame. Granted, that&#x27;s probably partially due to it being more than a few years old and the battery&#x27;s just naturally wearing out, but I haven&#x27;t been motivated enough to see if I can replace it, so... meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this epilator for maybe 10 hours, give or take, over the course of three days trying to clear my arms, legs and chest. The arms went fairly well, and were satisfactorily clear after about 25-30 minutes... an hour if you include using a pair of tweezers plucking the remaining hairs once they were ~95% clear. The legs went pretty much the same as the arms except they took a bit longer due to having a lot more area to cover. I didn&#x27;t intend to, but I ended up doing my armpits as well, which went swimmingly aside from the discomfort... there and around the navel are the only areas that were actually kind of painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...unlike the other areas, I still haven&#x27;t been able to successfully clear my chest with this model due to what I view as a significant design flaw. That flaw is that the head has a concave curve to it that, combined with concave areas of the body like the collarbone and between the pecs,make it pretty much impossible for the tweezers to grasp the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I&#x27;m not entirely disappointed with this model, but I&#x27;m still returning it and am going to spend the extra money to give the Braun SE7681 a go. In addition to the shape of the unit&#x27;s business end making it impossible to completely clear all the areas I want to be hair-free, there&#x27;s a couple other issues that I have with this unit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Emjoi advertises this model as having a \\&quot;cool touch\\&quot; head that makes it more comfortable to use, but this gets warm pretty quickly, and after about an hour gets irritatingly hot, so I&#x27;ll take a break and let it cool down for a while. This also happens to pretty much negate my concern over battery life with the Braun model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The \\&quot;dual opposed\\&quot; head design is flawed for several reasons. The manual says to run the epilator in the direction of hair growth, but half the tweezers are going to pull any hairs they catch against the grain because they&#x27;re spinning in the opposite direction. This results in breakage of the hairs more often than not, rather than pulling them out at the root, sometimes close enough to the skin so they can&#x27;t even be plucked with tweezers. Additionally, it pretty much negates any increased efficiency the additional tweezers provided since you to wait for the hairs to regrow enough to either pluck by hand with ordinary tweezers or use the epilator again much sooner than 4-6 weeks. Meanwhile, rather than having a nice, smooth, hair-free surface, you&#x27;ve got a bunch of dark spots/stubble from the broken hairs.was due to this or another issue, but the abdominal region was a significant challenge as well. I don&#x27;t have a lot of excess fat, but I do have a small gut and, although I don&#x27;t have man-boobs by any stretch, not particularly well-defined pecs and my initial impression is that this epilator has trouble on fattier surfaces regardless of how you try to stretch the skin to make it easier for the tweezers to grab the hair. At this point my chest is maybe 3/4-4/5 cleared, but very patchy looking... simply didn&#x27;t have the energy to finish it today. I&#x27;m going to let the soreness from all the tweezing wear off and give it another go in a few days, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, while I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with this machine&#x27;s performance and definitely wish they had made the parallel to the tweezers, rather than concave, I can&#x27;t definitively say that they&#x27;re a bad product just yet. Another reviewer mentioned using baby powder to get the hairs to stand up, which I&#x27;m going to try. I&#x27;ll also have to try my legs and chest again in a few days to make sure that the hair has grown a fair bit, which will hopefully make it easier for the tweezers to easily find, grab and completely pull them. I&#x27;ll come back and update this review when I&#x27;ve done both to make sure I&#x27;m not accidentally lowering the overall rating via ignorance/misuse/not reading the instructs and make any edits.</li>
            <li> Works well, is a little bigger but really powerfull and fast. Like the mettal head because stay cool and is helpping to calm the area where is working giving some confort.</li>
            <li> I has always worked well and safely for me, despite the rotating parts that look like they would do damage.  Of course, the stinging sensation of hair being pulled is never fun, but you either spread it out over a longer time using something else, or get through an area quickly with this device.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 of these (3 red 1 black). I like them when they work but they do not last. I have tried everything to try to make them last longer but they keep making them cheaper with soft plastic gears. The first one lasted a year, the last one lasted 3 months. I&#x27;m moving on. I suggest you do the same.</li>
            <li> Thought this could be used for men&#x27;s beards but after reading instructions sent it back.</li>
            <li> Returned this epilator quickly.  It was awful and didn&#x27;t work at all.  It clearly says &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34;, but I bought it for female use thinking it would be better than the ladies&#x27; versions.  I was wrong.</li>
            <li> The rotating head broke after only 5 uses.  This is approximately 1 year of ownership.  The replacement heads are about half the cost of a new unit.  When it works, it works great, but I would probably not purchase this unit again.</li>
            <li> I am not a hairy guy but I like to stay groomed.  I have tried everything else so I thought I would give this a try.  The truth is some places on your body will hurt more than others...and it is always the opposite of what you would think.  The more you do it the more it is tolerable.  I am pleasantly shocked to find out this product works pretty well.  It doesn&#x27;t get all the hair all the time, but it gets most of it and instead of shaving every other day you can wait a week to two weeks in between uses.  I recommend doing one area a day instead of trying to to your whole body at one time.  That way you don&#x27;t get overwhelmed and quit on the product.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this until the first touch. Nothing cool about&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair please be careful.&lt;br /&gt;It will hurt like hell and I did not pulled hair all the way out.&lt;br /&gt;In about a day I had a bunch of blister in my stomach and chest from ingrown hair&lt;br /&gt;because it did not pull the hair all the way out&lt;br /&gt;It still has not healed after a week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about returning it.</li>
            <li> I bought this machine about a month ago because a friend of mine introduced me to her epilator. The first time I tried one it was bittersweet because I am a hairy man and it hurt so much every millimeter of my arms were covered in hair and often 3 hairs would grow out of one pore! But I managed to finish epilating for 2 hours because I would stop because the pain was hard to ignore. Now I epilate 1 every 2-3 weeks its amazing it doesnt hurt much any more and there are plenty of tricks you can do to reduce the pain of epilating. I like the presentation of the machine tye only thing is it would have been better if it was chargeable and water proof.</li>
            <li> Rips all the hairs out and works great.</li>
            <li> I love this it is so much better than waxing which is messy and much more painful.  I really think any guy that can&#x27;t handle this really has got to be a wimp. I would say on a scale of 1 to 10 this is about a 4 waxing is probably a 6 or 7.  I have used this on my chest, back, private areas (make sure you pull skin tight because it will pull your skin in and kind of bite you if your not careful)it stops if that happens but will leave a mark.  I have real thick hair on my legs and it takes a number of passes to get all the hair and I didn&#x27;t want to go totally smooth on my legs so I just used it to thin the hair which works great.  The first time it lasted a couple weeks before I had hair long enough to do it again.  I know hair grows in cycles so there are always new ones coming up.  The second time I would say there was less than half as much hair I am sure it gets less and less each time.  I have course hair so to stay smooth shaving I would just about have to do it everyday.  I hope it lasts but even if it doesn&#x27;t I have paid $100 for a chest, back and pube wax so even if it burns up in a year it will save a fortune.</li>
            <li> I wish I don&#x27;t pay money for this rubbish think, it&#x27;s useless , in one blow pluck one or two hairs while broke rest of em.</li>
            <li> Works great and the bets part is that it works very quickly unlike most other epilators out there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, I used the original red emjoi for a few months but the gears broke inside the machine from basic wear and tear. I decided to get the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; version. There aren&#x27;t many differences other than the metal head (nice for putting in the fridge then epilating for a cool feel) which is sturdier than the plastic heads from other emjoi products. Also the contour of the head is different, but I haven&#x27;t found it to be a problem. So far so good with this product. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
