            <li> This is the ONLY lotion that has touched my son&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> a few years.it is the only lotion I can use since i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried other more expensive lotions but this product outdoes them all.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY Product that helps when the yarn I am crocheting with dries out my  hands and now . . . .</li>
            <li> It was affordable, relieved my dry skin and had no fragrance (I dislike scented lotions).  </li>
            <li> Thick, rubs in quickly and well with no oily residue on your hands and a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and I am down to my last two bottles as family members have depleted my supply.  </li>
            <li> I loved this lotion and was very disappointed when I could not find it in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so hard to find anymore in local stores.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Suave Natural Lotion, but was disappointed that I was charged $25.00 a bottle.</li>
            <li> For the past 6 months or more, the only Suave lotion I can find is the icky scented crap which makes me nautious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune trying to find a lotion that WORKED, wasn&#x27;t greasy and didn&#x27;t trigger an asthma attack because of its fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Why does Suave make only this one lotion paraben free and have those nasty parabens in the other lotions they make?</li>
            <li> Make it year round.  </li>
            <li> yes Suave Body Moisturizer, Natural Oatmeal, 18 oz to bad</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t mean that Suave plans to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This lotion had absolutely no fragrance, which was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Then in the past year or so it has become next to impossible to find in stores!</li>
            <li> I have skin issues and need lotion with oatmeal, but found that others with oatmeal are too expensive, or too oily, or don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a hard time at finding this lotion :(</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is a seasonal product, but if it is, that is really stupid.  </li>
            <li> Although, their website is really stupid and they don&#x27;t seem to care what their customers think or want.  </li>
            <li> IDIOTS!!</li>

            <li> I really like the Suave Natural Lotion, but was disappointed that I was charged $25.00 a bottle. The last time I brought this product I received a box with six bottles for that price. I feel like I was taken advantage of. I will not do business with them again.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY lotion that has touched my son&#x27;s dry skin. It has a great scent and no parabens listed in ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive but it works very well.  I have skin issues and need lotion with oatmeal, but found that others with oatmeal are too expensive, or too oily, or don&#x27;t work as well.  I hope that Suave will not discontinue this lotion.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this lotion was discontinued and was in such demand. I have a bottle that is barely used if someone wants it. I was trying to figure out what to do with it because i think ive had it for about a year. Id like to give it to someone who would appreciate it. It is used but good condition. I can mail it to whoever wants it. No payment necessary. Just want to get rid of it bc i have an excess of lotion and will probably never use it.</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion and was very disappointed when I could not find it in the stores anymore.  It was affordable, relieved my dry skin and had no fragrance (I dislike scented lotions).  I bought about 40 bottles from Soap.com but they don&#x27;t have it any longer and I am down to my last two bottles as family members have depleted my supply.  I have been trying different oatmeal lotions but have not found any that compare to this one yet.  Hopefully, Suave will read these comments and consider bringing back this fragrance free lotion.</li>
            <li> We love this lotion! It is very effective for dry skin, healthy and well-absorbed, and most of all, it is paraben free. Why does Suave make only this one lotion paraben free and have those nasty parabens in the other lotions they make? Then in the past year or so it has become next to impossible to find in stores! It used to be everywhere, now it&#x27;s nowhere to be found. Great stuff if you can find it, and Suave- stop putting parabens in your other lotions!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and wish they hadn&#x27;t stopped making it. Lengthy responses are too much of a bother and will not be providing any more feedback!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really heartbreaking for me not finding suave oatmeal body lotion on the market . All my efforts to get this lotion proved unsuccessful even when I was ready to pay any price for this product . This product has been the best I have ever used and so to stop producing this product because some complained its not good for them is really unfair to those of us who cherish this wonderful lotion . After all , it&#x27;s not possible for a lotion to work for everybody . I&#x27;m personally pleading with suave to please have some pity on those of us who love this product even if we are few . At least records show others buy this product on consistent basis . I do too . hope suave will do something about this . Thanks .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO distressed that this is no longer available!  I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune trying to find a lotion that WORKED, wasn&#x27;t greasy and didn&#x27;t trigger an asthma attack because of its fragrance.  This WONDERFUL LOTION fit the bill on all counts, and was reasonably priced, to boot!  Amazon, I am already a customer for life, but if you can find a way to carry this again, I will sing your praises nonstop all over Facebook and Twitter!  &#x3D;D  My recommendation to anyone who can find this lotion anywhere, GRAB IT!!</li>
            <li> The body lotion had no fragrance at all.  Previous purchases were pleasing with a nice, light scent.  This lotion had absolutely no fragrance, which was disappointing.  Product was returned with no problem.</li>
            <li> Love product just cant find it anywhere</li>
            <li> This lotion is excellent.  I use it everywhere, including my face.  It is scent free, which is the ONLY thing I will buy.  I buy it at Walmart, but they are out of stock, it seems, during the fall and winter.  I don&#x27;t know if it is a seasonal product, but if it is, that is really stupid.  Inexpensive and great product.  Make it year round.  Email Suave and let them know.  Although, their website is really stupid and they don&#x27;t seem to care what their customers think or want.  For the past 6 months or more, the only Suave lotion I can find is the icky scented crap which makes me nautious.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite lotion for over 5 years. It&#x27;s absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or slimy. I use it for everything. My feet once broke out and the way I got rid of it was putting oatmeal lotion on my feet 5 times a day for a week. Cleared up whatever the issue was. I&#x27;m having a hard time at finding this lotion :( I&#x27;ve checked two Walmarts, Walmart.com, and Target.com and it isn&#x27;t showing up there.</li>
            <li> Yes this has been discontinued! My family has been using this for years, my son is 14 and this has been the only lotion that&#x27;s ever touched his skin his entire life and my skin has been just screaming for it!! Nothing I use works, cheap or costly it just doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
            <li> Have used this for several years and nothing else compares (though Working Hands Creme is the best for cracked skin).  Helps dry skin the best.  Thick, rubs in quickly and well with no oily residue on your hands and a small amount goes a long way.  Can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s so hard to find anymore in local stores.  Fantastic product and I&#x27;m hoping it doesn&#x27;t mean that Suave plans to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.I have used it for a few years.it is the only lotion I can use since i have sensitive skin. I have tried other more expensive lotions but this product outdoes them all.</li>
            <li> yes Suave Body Moisturizer, Natural Oatmeal, 18 oz to bad they dont make this anymore&lt;br /&gt;Unilever  i would buy more of it</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY Product that helps when the yarn I am crocheting with dries out my  hands and now . . . . I CAN&#x27;T FIND IT ANYWHERE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> This is the BEST remedy for dry skin that someone with allergies could ever find. But for some reason Suave has discontinued it. IDIOTS!!</li>
