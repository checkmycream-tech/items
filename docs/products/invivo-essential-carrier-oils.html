            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for my essential oils</li>

            <li>I like the looks of this product - but more importantly I like using it in my bath!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a rub on style lotion that could do a better job than</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and a cute label to boot.  </li>
            <li>Perfect compliment to essential oils.</li>
            <li>I started using coconut oil about a year ago because it has so many benefits that I wanted to test out.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different massage oils and this is the best...</li>
            <li>My skin is that of a healthy 40 yoa.</li>
            <li>I have heard that there are many uses for Coconut Oil, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>

            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>but whenever I pump the oil out, oil leaks out of the top cap.</li>
            <li>It feels much better than olive or castor oil, and has no scent or dyes.</li>
            <li>So I could add an essential oil (or not) and it would be the perfect carrier for it.  </li>

            <li>The owner reached out via email to make sure I was satisfied and pass along some information on the product.</li>
            <li>it would say how many teaspoons 1 pump is.</li>
            <li>The pump top leaks even with the seal in place.  </li>
            <li>I also love the label.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m sure the oil itself will be fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying department store brands for your face and body are more costly but they do not mean you are getting a superior product.</li>
            <li>Thus far, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>I think that I may have needed to put more on overnight &amp; let it soak in to get the full effect that I desired but it was not awful.</li>
            <li>, if you don&#x27;t like scented oils then this is great for you, if you do like scented oils this is a fantastic product in which you can transfer some of the oil into smaller containers and make a multitude of scented oils for your body or hair, or like me, play around with a mixture of scents to make your own special blend!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and great oil and price.  </li>
            <li>This really tempered the scent nicely to make what would have been far too much a really beautiful experience.n without something to help with that &amp;</li>

            <li>It is non-greasy and absorbs easily into your skin.</li>
            <li>This Fractionated Coconut Oil is really the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to apply</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong coconut smell which I like.</li>

            <li>I am so glad to have gotten it at such a great price and so quickly.</li>
            <li>Best of all, this Fractionated Coconut Oil by Invivo Essential is actually branded as being &amp;#34;Scentless&amp;#34; so it makes an excellent carrying oil that absorbs quickly and completely into the skin.</li>
            <li>well, no leaks, and with the original seal still strongly in place.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t stain fabrics which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Also I think it&#x27;s a great value for the big bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this with essential oils and this is a great size, plus it&#x27;s organic.  </li>

            <li>didn&#x27;t come with a pump, but it works great mixed with surgar and a capful of vanilla or almond extract, for a scrub!</li>
            <li>have used this on skin and for working through my hair with fabulous results.</li>
            <li>Also great to use to mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Some may find this a non-issue, but if the pump delivery is important, this may become a problem.</li>

            <li>Great for essential oils!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>

            <li>It is great for blending with essential oils.</li>
            <li>The solid version is good for many uses but not for all.</li>
            <li>I tried it in place of my good old stand by Morocan oil on my hair as a conditioning/ taming treatment.</li>
            <li>Coconut is the perfect oil and really the only oil you need.  </li>
            <li>It makes my foundation look much smoother and more skin-like, as opposed to just sitting on top of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really is non grease!!!</li>
            <li>The cost was very economical as well.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super quick and the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li>It’s great to clean my face and moisturize it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This company was also fast and wanted to be sure the product came to me in a timely manner and that I was happy with the product, as a company goes, they go above and beyond to assure customer satisfaction!!</li>
            <li>It is ultra light, virtually scent-free and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The quantity is very convincing and you can use it with pretty much everything: skin, hair, massage, moisturizing...</li>
            <li>You can also use it for dry skin, works great and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I use it all over, and it has really hydrates my skin, makes it look great, and is so soft now.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>If there was some kind of slow flow cap on the bottle it&#x27;d be great.</li>
            <li>There was an initial issue with getting the free info download, but the company made good on it.  </li>
            <li>part but decided that it would be ideal for the lotion after a little research told me it had extended shelf life and didn&#x27;t smell like coconuts.  </li>
            <li>Wow am I lucky :) I &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 this oil !</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, great carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have switched to making my own care products as my allergies/sensitivities seem to increase as I age.  </li>
            <li>Love this, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and this is one I&#x27;ll be purchasing at full price once I&#x27;ve used this bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I will continue to order it.</li>
            <li>I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very generous and I will be using this for many of my beauty needs.</li>
            <li>Nice big easy to pour bottle.</li>
            <li>Often times essential oils can be a bit too strong on their own without something to help with that &amp;</li>
            <li>Love it...received it super fast.</li>
            <li>came quickly and bottle was full.  </li>
            <li>I am a very fortunate individual in many things,I know this.</li>

            <li>When using it on your skin, it will absorb quickly, but won’t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>As a body oil, it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Oil was as promised and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>And is absorbs quickly so your body is not oily...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the bigger bottle of fractionated oil because my daughter told me she thought that this was the best fractionated oil for mixing with essential oils.</li>
            <li>My wife is currently pregnant and she loves using the oil</li>
            <li>I have already ordered and begun using a second bottle, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the price, the Amazon shipping, or the product</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s perfect for diluting essential oils for topical</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be exploring more of the many uses for coconut oil I have read about.</li>
            <li>I have bought other fractionated oils and have liked them better.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, very clear.</li>
            <li>It goes on soft and smooth with no greasy feeling so it works great alone or along with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase and will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li>do love trying out new products an experimenting with them.</li>
            <li>After using the oil for the first time my hands and my clients body smelled like a moldy dish rag!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is exactly as it was described!  </li>
            <li>I appreciated getting an email and a card included with the purchased product that allows me to get a free e-book.</li>
            <li>This oil has done amazing things for my skin, especially my face!  </li>
            <li>came fast, fast, fast, and it is so nice to have the pump</li>
            <li>The problem with what I was using prior to finding this awesome product was all the others were solid which prevented me from using it very often.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>This seller has a nice Pinterest site and they explain about the different kinds of coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump.  </li>
            <li>I first thought that maybe it was just too full, so I emptied some of it and replaced the pump.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own or with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Best part is that an entire jar will last you a lot longer than most skincare products you currently buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely leave reviews,  but this</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m so glad this came with a normal cap and the pump-top separate</li>
            <li>I have been using it to make my own blends and to dilute my oils for topical application.</li>
            <li>but since I retired I have lots of extra time to research making my own beauty products.</li>
            <li>So far I am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>Really nice carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it has a nice feel and no smell.</li>
            <li>has nothing to do with quality, but I kind of miss the coconutty smell that you get with regular coconut oil</li>
            <li>Works great use it for my hair along with my conditoner makes my hair really shiny without the greasiness of other oils .</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Arived quick and Very god quality!</li>
            <li>Came right on time.</li>
            <li>And I started using it right away....</li>
            <li>We have the answer right here.</li>
            <li>I use it right on my skin, as well as my son&#x27;s after bath time at night.</li>
            <li>BUT that&#x27;s where the positive remarks end!</li>
            <li>Ok so my fur baby is not fond of me chasing him down to spray him with my homemade concoction,  but it has helped his scratching and i love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>, it is light, makes use easy and simple.</li>
            <li>I love Invivo Essential Top Rated Fractionated Coconut Oil - 16oz - Pure Unscented Cocos Nucifera Liquid FCO for Massage Therapy - Best Carrier Oil for Essential Oils and Aromatherapy - 100% Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee by Invivo Essential</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a cheap feel, absorbed very easily into your skun when massaging, and hold other fragrances well!</li>
            <li>so I simply added some of my favorite essential oil scents to the bottle to make my own blend of aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>I received a discount off of a new order and I really enjoy using their Oil.</li>
            <li>It does work nicely as a massage oil, although I would definitely wash it off afterwards, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and leaves skin with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great price for such a big bottle, will buy again</li>
            <li>Great for diluting your essential oils for topical use!</li>

            <li>There are so many things to do with Coconut oil that I am looking forward to using it daily as part of my regimen.</li>
            <li>First time purchase of this brand as I ran out of the one I had.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been using this as a massage oil for me during my pregnancy and it has made my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely scent free</li>
            <li>Very soothing to the skin!</li>
            <li>first thing I did was shave my legs with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are plenty more ways to use this Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.  </li>
            <li>Using this with my Essential oils, love it</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>My first time to experience coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It leaked a little bit but nothing significant and because it was in a plastic bag it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>My only issue was when I received it there was about an ounce of liquid that had leaked in the bag, so I transferred it to another jar I had that the pump fit into luckily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle that will last for many uses.</li>
            <li>I would recommend ordering this item on its own since I ordered with other items it leaked over everything and had to return.</li>
            <li>Really leaves her skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It left my skin super soft and I love the fact that is unscented so it does not clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li>This oil soaks into your skin quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple!</li>
            <li>This makes a great carrier oil for other essential oils.</li>
            <li>Other than that, product works great with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really qualified to make a judgement call here since this was my first foray into making lotion</li>
            <li>I am currently using this to make my own oils and it has worked out very well so far.</li>
            <li>I happy that I can mix any of my essential oils and not worry about any other additional scent.</li>
            <li>It is feather light and leaves skin feeling silky smooth, and won&#x27;t clog pores like other vegetable oils.</li>
            <li>Very retro ;)</li>
            <li>As the name implies, fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the full spectrum of the natural oil.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice size, dark tinted, plastic bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s odorless and colorless and penetrates the skin quickly and completely.</li>
            <li>% Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions</li>
            <li>We are all trying to grow our hair with all natural products, and this has provided a great solution for my usually dry hair after only one use.</li>
            <li>The oil is fine, but it also arrived open and leaked all over the box.</li>
            <li>I had been using the type of coconut oil that is sold at the grocery store in solid form and wanted to try this since the other kind was too greasy, this is not at all!  </li>
            <li>Makes using coconut oil so much easier and it pure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s used for a carrier oil for essential oils like when they are too strong, massage oil, face &amp; body oil, a hair conditioning oil &amp; many other things.</li>
            <li>It works very well with my EOs and also use with food.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile.</li>
            <li>It has helped so much with the dryness.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on my hair straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>The accessory that comes with it makes it very practical to use to pump in the quantity you need.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not getting what I paid for now because of how much was spilled all over the box.</li>
            <li>and i used prime for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it absorbs fast</li>
            <li>That said, I really like this coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Was told it was really relaxing.</li>
            <li>I enjoy making essential oil blends with this coconut oil...for relaxation, for gifts, etc.</li>
            <li>The dilution chart is very helpful and guide was informative.  </li>
            <li>really like this product.</li>
            <li>Fractionated coconut oil soaks in so much faster than the coconut oil</li>
            <li>followed up with shampooing twice with a sulfate free shampoo and then a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I think when maybe I don&#x27;t need quite as much moisture.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a carrier oil and also received a very informative guide to the oil through a follow up email.</li>
            <li>I really like this .</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for this opportunity to try this product out and use for myself and my family.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It didn’t leave a film on my razor and left my legs smooth like baby’s skin.  </li>
            <li>No smell, absorbs fast, and this quality is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li>Will keep using this one as it is reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li>Invivo also sent me a pdf Dilution Guide too which is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is nice enough to display with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>It is colorless &amp; not quite as thick which may certainly be an appealing thing to those of you with light hair as the other is a darker color &amp; a thicker more syrupy consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a fantastic glide for use in massage and you can make a little go a long way, so it&#x27;s even more economical.</li>
            <li>Appreciated the free E-Book since I&#x27;m new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li>About an ounce of the product was in bottom of the bag and entire outer bottle was covered.&lt;br /&gt;Proceeded to clean that up and took lid off to attach pump that came in the baggy.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and does not smell bad or strong, honestly it&#x27;s practically odorless.</li>
            <li>I am a chronic user of essential oils, and this is by far the best base oil that I own.</li>
            <li>it seems to keep dripping down from the pump :)</li>
            <li>For some reason, the oil seeps up through the top of the pump/lid and runs down the sides of the bottle.</li>
            <li>The company sends some helpful information after order via email which really helps if you are new to using fractionated coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I was paying more for less of another brand when I discovered Invivo and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Works fabulous for massages and dry skin</li>
            <li>I love this FCO, especially for my essential oils and lotions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s safe enough to use for the entire family; yes, babies and pets</li>
            <li>I was disapointed as that was the main reason I ordered this oil and not others.</li>
            <li>The main problem is the mouth of the bottle has nothing to help it pour slower.</li>
            <li>It was packaged well and the lid was tightly on, which was great to me as I have bought carrier oils from other brands before</li>
            <li>The oil comes with a great e-book which breaks down the different uses of both carrier and essential oils.</li>
            <li>High quality oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Invivo Fractionated Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and have a plethora of high end product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this not just for hair but skin</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this company to others.</li>
            <li>Unlike other oils used for massage that leave you feeling like some kind of fried food, this coconut oil absorbs into the skin, but remains oily enough for a massage.  </li>
            <li>The oil and customer service is great but the defective pump causes the oil to run down the bottle and onto the surface created a mess and is wasteful.</li>
            <li>As with others, my only complaint is that the large bottle of oil isn&#x27;t easy to pour without making a mess unless you plan ahead using a funnel or if you find a top that will fit correctly and has a pouring nozzle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use in many ways and is a better base than other carrier oils because of its light scent.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong here; it&#x27;s a great coconut oil, they provide additional documentation on usage and they give part of the sale to St. Jude&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.  </li>
            <li>It is completely fragrance-free and absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>Just received this oil and so far I really like it</li>
            <li>What a nice way to get a relaxing fragrance without feeling the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li>I’m sure it will go along way with trying anything else I stumble upon using Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m sure it will go along way with trying anything else I stumble upon using Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product, ours was delivered and the cap was loose causing about 10% of the oil to leak our creating quite the slimy mess.</li>
            <li>So many of my oily buddies use a different &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; however, they are getting less product for a higher price.</li>
            <li>I got the product right away and put it in with my essential oil in my warmer.</li>
            <li>so it is necessary to do your own research and spend a little time in the trial and error phase.</li>
            <li>Eventually transferred to a new pump brought from another store.</li>
            <li>I live in Louisiana and the humidity does bunches of damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am new to using oils</li>
            <li>It does not go rancid and mixes perfectly for massage and cutting essential oils.</li>
            <li>I have permed hair and it makes it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s labeling is very classy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s highly stable as a result of the refining distillation process, so it&#x27;s shelf life is nearly indefinite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils, but had read that a quality carrier oil was &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; (sorry; I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve never heard THAT one before...) to safely dilute oils for skin application.</li>
            <li>My 10 month old has had no issues with it either!</li>
            <li>I made my first stress relief roller with essential oils...</li>
            <li>I bought this product to see if it would help me keep my skin semi normal, it&#x27;s helping as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>The book was short but helpful and informative, and the pump makes it so much easier to make beauty products at home!</li>
            <li>The order arrived in time &amp; the coconut oil is exactly what I was looking for to go with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>First off, the ONLY reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the lid.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair as usual then put a quarter size amount of fractionated coconut oil in my palm and spread it throughout my hair paying more attention to my ends.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean, feels lightweight and smooth and absorbs into the skin without leaving any oily feeling or residue behind.</li>
            <li>BTW these small roller bottles are great for a little boost of fragrance on the go.</li>
            <li>If they put a device to pour this oil easily and with little to no mess it&#x27;d be a 5 star rating all the way!</li>
            <li>; Make roll-on perfume (again with essential oils); I put a small amount on after showing (while still wet), then towel dry - wonderful way to keep skin soft and moist!</li>
            <li>New at this essential oil therapy but really liking it so far!</li>
            <li>You can use it to make homemade beauty products, preserve essential oils, and even cook with certain types of it.</li>
            <li>My very dry curly hair absorbed the product overnight and was shiny and not greasy</li>
            <li>Also worked wonders on my neck with a little mint mixed in for sore muscles!I will for surely purchase this again</li>
            <li>Just started using essential oils and Fractionated Coconut Oil, but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>It’s odorless, colorless, and completely clear.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it on myself and on my dogs and had no problems</li>
            <li>Thanks, definitely will order again.</li>
            <li>a young 60+ young lady.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>and my feet feel so soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I use coconut oil with essential oils and the fractionated oil is so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>So far this hasn&#x27;t caused any issues.  </li>
            <li>Also works as is rubbed in beard for soft hair</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would give the product a 5 star (so far).</li>
            <li>It defeats the whole purpose of the &amp;#34;convenience of the pump&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m constantly cleaning up oil.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised with the amount</li>
            <li>I have ordered 2 bottles so far and will continue to use this in my practice.</li>
            <li>It is all natural moisturizer for your face,skin and your hair.</li>
            <li>Packed in a 16 oz amber bottle and ready to use as soon as you open the cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes skin soft.  </li>
            <li>but like this just as much (at a fraction of the cost) as a carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it is fluid.</li>
            <li>When using on skin, the oil completely soaks in and does not leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li>Odorless, colorless, completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have so far used it to mix with peppermint oil for my oil diffusers and for skin application.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find that it gave me relief.</li>
            <li>Makes a wonderful base for lots of oil blends</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large quantity &amp; very cost-effective compared to other brands with tiny bottles that cost almost as much.</li>
            <li>Old dogs apparently can indeed learn a new trick now and again.</li>
            <li>Have used it to make many homemade beauty products and use it plain as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Although it has many other purposes, such as mixing with essential oils for making soaps, bath salts, candles, and the like, I don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t make those things because I lost my sense of smell years ago.</li>
            <li>It is in my experience as I was massaging my husbands shoulders that it also leaves the skin nourished with softness, and leaves a lasting smoothness for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially when this company donates $10 per review to St. Jude organization!</li>
            <li>I bought this coconut oil to use as a carrier oil with my new Young Living Essential oils, and every expectation that I had is exceeded with this stuff.</li>
            <li>it is fantastic with a small amount of Lavender and sugar</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really moisturizing and helps with all my really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I ONLY have one complaint I wish it came in gallon bottles :)</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase a few essential oils so that I can add scent to this fabulous carrier oil when I would like it.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, shiny and feeling alive again.  </li>
            <li>Have only used once as base oil for essential oil blend but loved it, absorbs easily</li>
            <li>Not excessively greasy had had a lasting effect while doing the massage session.  </li>
            <li>As I was attempting to clean up my other items to see if they were salvageable, I did notice it felt nice, unfortunately there wasn&#x27;t enough left in the bottle to do anything with it.</li>
            <li>I got this for my fiance&#x27; to use as massage oil and at 16 oz its a rather large bottle; it will last a really long time.</li>
            <li>I mix it with kukui nut oil &amp; a few drops of my favorite aroma therapy oil &amp; use on my very dry skin daily.</li>
            <li>Can be used to dilute ALL essential oils, is totally clear, unscented, and won&#x27;t stain fabrics or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients</li>
            <li>I like the product so far, it is not as oily on my skin as virgin coconut oil which I use for moisturizer, absorbs faster, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to experiment with it with essential oils or lotions.  </li>
            <li>I chopped it to my shoulders and started the grow out process doing a tint back to my natural color.</li>
            <li>I was told that you can use coconut oil not only in cooking, but you can use it by rubbing in on your cuticles to help keep them soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Hopefully the glitch is fixed for future buyers.  </li>
            <li>The product itself I only used once so far</li>
            <li>Have been using it to mix with essential oils to make natural remedies.</li>
            <li>I have to say though that her skin felt soft that next day!!!  </li>
            <li>I find this Oil non irritating and love the feeling of my skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It kind of feel like they took all the fat out of it: no sense of oiliness, which is weird, for oil.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many different products I have tried with little or no success.</li>
            <li>It was a slippery hot mess, pintrest lied.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used this twice, still waiting on my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I live in a place that is extremely dry!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this coconut oil over any other.</li>
            <li>Not familiar with how the quality should be, since I&#x27;m fairly new to carrier oils, but so far just using in roll-ons with my essential oils for easier travel.</li>
            <li>It also put a little on my chapped lips and it really helped.  </li>

            <li> I like the looks of this product - but more importantly I like using it in my bath!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a rub on style lotion that could do a better job than</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and a cute label to boot.  </li>
            <li> Perfect compliment to essential oils.</li>
            <li> I started using coconut oil about a year ago because it has so many benefits that I wanted to test out.</li>

            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> but whenever I pump the oil out, oil leaks out of the top cap.</li>
            <li> It feels much better than olive or castor oil, and has no scent or dyes.</li>
            <li> So I could add an essential oil (or not) and it would be the perfect carrier for it.  </li>

            <li> and I must say I really love this product.</li>
            <li> but I have found through trial and error that my favorite oil to use is coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I have been asked many times what do I use on my face.....</li>
            <li> Love the fact that its liquid.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m using this for essential oils and it works great!</li>
            <li> The owner reached out via email to make sure I was satisfied and pass along some information on the product.</li>
            <li> it would say how many teaspoons 1 pump is.</li>
            <li> The pump top leaks even with the seal in place.  </li>
            <li> I also love the label.</li>
            <li> so when I was offered to try this at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion, I was so excited.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure the oil itself will be fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying department store brands for your face and body are more costly but they do not mean you are getting a superior product.</li>
            <li> Thus far, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I think that I may have needed to put more on overnight &amp; let it soak in to get the full effect that I desired but it was not awful.</li>
            <li> , if you don&#x27;t like scented oils then this is great for you, if you do like scented oils this is a fantastic product in which you can transfer some of the oil into smaller containers and make a multitude of scented oils for your body or hair, or like me, play around with a mixture of scents to make your own special blend!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great oil and price.  </li>
            <li> This really tempered the scent nicely to make what would have been far too much a really beautiful experience.n without something to help with that &amp;</li>
            <li> This really tempered the scent nicely to make what would have been far too much a really beautiful experience.</li>

            <li> It is non-greasy and absorbs easily into your skin.</li>
            <li> This Fractionated Coconut Oil is really the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to apply</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong coconut smell which I like.</li>

            <li> I am so glad to have gotten it at such a great price and so quickly.</li>
            <li> Best of all, this Fractionated Coconut Oil by Invivo Essential is actually branded as being &amp;#34;Scentless&amp;#34; so it makes an excellent carrying oil that absorbs quickly and completely into the skin.</li>
            <li> well, no leaks, and with the original seal still strongly in place.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t stain fabrics which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Also I think it&#x27;s a great value for the big bottle</li>

            <li> have used this on skin and for working through my hair with fabulous results.</li>
            <li> Also great to use to mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Some may find this a non-issue, but if the pump delivery is important, this may become a problem.</li>

            <li> Great for essential oils!</li>

            <li> It is great for blending with essential oils.</li>
            <li> The solid version is good for many uses but not for all.</li>
            <li> I tried it in place of my good old stand by Morocan oil on my hair as a conditioning/ taming treatment.</li>
            <li> Coconut is the perfect oil and really the only oil you need.  </li>
            <li> It makes my foundation look much smoother and more skin-like, as opposed to just sitting on top of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really is non grease!!!</li>
            <li> The cost was very economical as well.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super quick and the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> It’s great to clean my face and moisturize it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This company was also fast and wanted to be sure the product came to me in a timely manner and that I was happy with the product, as a company goes, they go above and beyond to assure customer satisfaction!!</li>
            <li> It is ultra light, virtually scent-free and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The quantity is very convincing and you can use it with pretty much everything: skin, hair, massage, moisturizing...</li>
            <li> You can also use it for dry skin, works great and does not leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I use it all over, and it has really hydrates my skin, makes it look great, and is so soft now.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> If there was some kind of slow flow cap on the bottle it&#x27;d be great.</li>
            <li> There was an initial issue with getting the free info download, but the company made good on it.  </li>
            <li> part but decided that it would be ideal for the lotion after a little research told me it had extended shelf life and didn&#x27;t smell like coconuts.  </li>
            <li> Wow am I lucky :) I &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 this oil !</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, great carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have switched to making my own care products as my allergies/sensitivities seem to increase as I age.  </li>
            <li> Love this, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> and this is one I&#x27;ll be purchasing at full price once I&#x27;ve used this bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I will continue to order it.</li>
            <li> I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very generous and I will be using this for many of my beauty needs.</li>
            <li> Nice big easy to pour bottle.</li>
            <li> Often times essential oils can be a bit too strong on their own without something to help with that &amp;</li>
            <li> Love it...received it super fast.</li>
            <li> came quickly and bottle was full.  </li>

            <li> When using it on your skin, it will absorb quickly, but won’t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> As a body oil, it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Oil was as promised and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> And is absorbs quickly so your body is not oily...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the bigger bottle of fractionated oil because my daughter told me she thought that this was the best fractionated oil for mixing with essential oils.</li>
            <li> My wife is currently pregnant and she loves using the oil</li>
            <li> I have already ordered and begun using a second bottle, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the price, the Amazon shipping, or the product</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s perfect for diluting essential oils for topical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be exploring more of the many uses for coconut oil I have read about.</li>
            <li> I have bought other fractionated oils and have liked them better.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, very clear.</li>
            <li> It goes on soft and smooth with no greasy feeling so it works great alone or along with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase and will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li> do love trying out new products an experimenting with them.</li>
            <li> After using the oil for the first time my hands and my clients body smelled like a moldy dish rag!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is exactly as it was described!  </li>
            <li> I appreciated getting an email and a card included with the purchased product that allows me to get a free e-book.</li>
            <li> This oil has done amazing things for my skin, especially my face!  </li>
            <li> came fast, fast, fast, and it is so nice to have the pump</li>
            <li> The problem with what I was using prior to finding this awesome product was all the others were solid which prevented me from using it very often.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> This seller has a nice Pinterest site and they explain about the different kinds of coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump.  </li>
            <li> I first thought that maybe it was just too full, so I emptied some of it and replaced the pump.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own or with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Best part is that an entire jar will last you a lot longer than most skincare products you currently buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews,  but this</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m so glad this came with a normal cap and the pump-top separate</li>
            <li> I have been using it to make my own blends and to dilute my oils for topical application.</li>
            <li> but since I retired I have lots of extra time to research making my own beauty products.</li>
            <li> So far I am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> Really nice carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it has a nice feel and no smell.</li>
            <li> has nothing to do with quality, but I kind of miss the coconutty smell that you get with regular coconut oil</li>
            <li> Works great use it for my hair along with my conditoner makes my hair really shiny without the greasiness of other oils .</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Arived quick and Very god quality!</li>
            <li> Came right on time.</li>

            <li> I use it right on my skin, as well as my son&#x27;s after bath time at night.</li>
            <li> BUT that&#x27;s where the positive remarks end!</li>
            <li> Ok so my fur baby is not fond of me chasing him down to spray him with my homemade concoction,  but it has helped his scratching and i love the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> , it is light, makes use easy and simple.</li>
            <li> I love Invivo Essential Top Rated Fractionated Coconut Oil - 16oz - Pure Unscented Cocos Nucifera Liquid FCO for Massage Therapy - Best Carrier Oil for Essential Oils and Aromatherapy - 100% Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee by Invivo Essential</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a cheap feel, absorbed very easily into your skun when massaging, and hold other fragrances well!</li>
            <li> so I simply added some of my favorite essential oil scents to the bottle to make my own blend of aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> I received a discount off of a new order and I really enjoy using their Oil.</li>
            <li> It does work nicely as a massage oil, although I would definitely wash it off afterwards, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and leaves skin with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Great price for such a big bottle, will buy again</li>
            <li> Great for diluting your essential oils for topical use!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  </li>

            <li> First time purchase of this brand as I ran out of the one I had.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using this as a massage oil for me during my pregnancy and it has made my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely scent free</li>
            <li> Very soothing to the skin!</li>
            <li> first thing I did was shave my legs with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are plenty more ways to use this Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.  </li>
            <li> Using this with my Essential oils, love it</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> My first time to experience coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It leaked a little bit but nothing significant and because it was in a plastic bag it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> My only issue was when I received it there was about an ounce of liquid that had leaked in the bag, so I transferred it to another jar I had that the pump fit into luckily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle that will last for many uses.</li>
            <li> I would recommend ordering this item on its own since I ordered with other items it leaked over everything and had to return.</li>
            <li> Really leaves her skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It left my skin super soft and I love the fact that is unscented so it does not clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li> This oil soaks into your skin quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple!</li>
            <li> This makes a great carrier oil for other essential oils.</li>
            <li> Other than that, product works great with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really qualified to make a judgement call here since this was my first foray into making lotion</li>
            <li> I am currently using this to make my own oils and it has worked out very well so far.</li>
            <li> I happy that I can mix any of my essential oils and not worry about any other additional scent.</li>
            <li> It is feather light and leaves skin feeling silky smooth, and won&#x27;t clog pores like other vegetable oils.</li>
            <li> Very retro ;)</li>
            <li> As the name implies, fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the full spectrum of the natural oil.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice size, dark tinted, plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odorless and colorless and penetrates the skin quickly and completely.</li>
            <li> % Pure Fractionated Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions</li>
            <li> We are all trying to grow our hair with all natural products, and this has provided a great solution for my usually dry hair after only one use.</li>
            <li> The oil is fine, but it also arrived open and leaked all over the box.</li>
            <li> I had been using the type of coconut oil that is sold at the grocery store in solid form and wanted to try this since the other kind was too greasy, this is not at all!  </li>
            <li> Makes using coconut oil so much easier and it pure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s used for a carrier oil for essential oils like when they are too strong, massage oil, face &amp; body oil, a hair conditioning oil &amp; many other things.</li>
            <li> It works very well with my EOs and also use with food.  </li>
            <li> Very versatile.</li>
            <li> It has helped so much with the dryness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on my hair straight out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> The accessory that comes with it makes it very practical to use to pump in the quantity you need.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not getting what I paid for now because of how much was spilled all over the box.</li>
            <li> and i used prime for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it absorbs fast</li>
            <li> That said, I really like this coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Was told it was really relaxing.</li>
            <li> I enjoy making essential oil blends with this coconut oil...for relaxation, for gifts, etc.</li>
            <li> The dilution chart is very helpful and guide was informative.  </li>
            <li> really like this product.</li>
            <li> Fractionated coconut oil soaks in so much faster than the coconut oil</li>
            <li> followed up with shampooing twice with a sulfate free shampoo and then a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I think when maybe I don&#x27;t need quite as much moisture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a carrier oil and also received a very informative guide to the oil through a follow up email.</li>
            <li> I really like this .</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this opportunity to try this product out and use for myself and my family.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It didn’t leave a film on my razor and left my legs smooth like baby’s skin.  </li>
            <li> No smell, absorbs fast, and this quality is unbeatable.  </li>
            <li> Will keep using this one as it is reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li> Invivo also sent me a pdf Dilution Guide too which is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is nice enough to display with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> It is colorless &amp; not quite as thick which may certainly be an appealing thing to those of you with light hair as the other is a darker color &amp; a thicker more syrupy consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a fantastic glide for use in massage and you can make a little go a long way, so it&#x27;s even more economical.</li>
            <li> Appreciated the free E-Book since I&#x27;m new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li> About an ounce of the product was in bottom of the bag and entire outer bottle was covered.&lt;br /&gt;Proceeded to clean that up and took lid off to attach pump that came in the baggy.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and does not smell bad or strong, honestly it&#x27;s practically odorless.</li>
            <li> I am a chronic user of essential oils, and this is by far the best base oil that I own.</li>
            <li> it seems to keep dripping down from the pump :)</li>
            <li> For some reason, the oil seeps up through the top of the pump/lid and runs down the sides of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The company sends some helpful information after order via email which really helps if you are new to using fractionated coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I was paying more for less of another brand when I discovered Invivo and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Works fabulous for massages and dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this FCO, especially for my essential oils and lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s safe enough to use for the entire family; yes, babies and pets</li>
            <li> I was disapointed as that was the main reason I ordered this oil and not others.</li>
            <li> The main problem is the mouth of the bottle has nothing to help it pour slower.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well and the lid was tightly on, which was great to me as I have bought carrier oils from other brands before</li>
            <li> The oil comes with a great e-book which breaks down the different uses of both carrier and essential oils.</li>
            <li> High quality oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Invivo Fractionated Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and have a plethora of high end product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this not just for hair but skin</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this company to others.</li>
            <li> Unlike other oils used for massage that leave you feeling like some kind of fried food, this coconut oil absorbs into the skin, but remains oily enough for a massage.  </li>
            <li> The oil and customer service is great but the defective pump causes the oil to run down the bottle and onto the surface created a mess and is wasteful.</li>
            <li> As with others, my only complaint is that the large bottle of oil isn&#x27;t easy to pour without making a mess unless you plan ahead using a funnel or if you find a top that will fit correctly and has a pouring nozzle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use in many ways and is a better base than other carrier oils because of its light scent.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here; it&#x27;s a great coconut oil, they provide additional documentation on usage and they give part of the sale to St. Jude&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.  </li>
            <li> It is completely fragrance-free and absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> Just received this oil and so far I really like it</li>
            <li> What a nice way to get a relaxing fragrance without feeling the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I’m sure it will go along way with trying anything else I stumble upon using Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m sure it will go along way with trying anything else I stumble upon using Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product, ours was delivered and the cap was loose causing about 10% of the oil to leak our creating quite the slimy mess.</li>
            <li> So many of my oily buddies use a different &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; however, they are getting less product for a higher price.</li>
            <li> I got the product right away and put it in with my essential oil in my warmer.</li>
            <li> so it is necessary to do your own research and spend a little time in the trial and error phase.</li>
            <li> Eventually transferred to a new pump brought from another store.</li>
            <li> I live in Louisiana and the humidity does bunches of damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am new to using oils</li>
            <li> It does not go rancid and mixes perfectly for massage and cutting essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have permed hair and it makes it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s labeling is very classy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s highly stable as a result of the refining distillation process, so it&#x27;s shelf life is nearly indefinite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils, but had read that a quality carrier oil was &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; (sorry; I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve never heard THAT one before...) to safely dilute oils for skin application.</li>
            <li> My 10 month old has had no issues with it either!</li>
            <li> I made my first stress relief roller with essential oils...</li>
            <li> I bought this product to see if it would help me keep my skin semi normal, it&#x27;s helping as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> The book was short but helpful and informative, and the pump makes it so much easier to make beauty products at home!</li>
            <li> The order arrived in time &amp; the coconut oil is exactly what I was looking for to go with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> First off, the ONLY reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the lid.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair as usual then put a quarter size amount of fractionated coconut oil in my palm and spread it throughout my hair paying more attention to my ends.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean, feels lightweight and smooth and absorbs into the skin without leaving any oily feeling or residue behind.</li>
            <li> BTW these small roller bottles are great for a little boost of fragrance on the go.</li>
            <li> If they put a device to pour this oil easily and with little to no mess it&#x27;d be a 5 star rating all the way!</li>
            <li> ; Make roll-on perfume (again with essential oils); I put a small amount on after showing (while still wet), then towel dry - wonderful way to keep skin soft and moist!</li>
            <li> New at this essential oil therapy but really liking it so far!</li>
            <li> You can use it to make homemade beauty products, preserve essential oils, and even cook with certain types of it.</li>
            <li> My very dry curly hair absorbed the product overnight and was shiny and not greasy</li>
            <li> Also worked wonders on my neck with a little mint mixed in for sore muscles!I will for surely purchase this again</li>
            <li> Just started using essential oils and Fractionated Coconut Oil, but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> It’s odorless, colorless, and completely clear.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it on myself and on my dogs and had no problems</li>
            <li> Thanks, definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> a young 60+ young lady.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> and my feet feel so soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I use coconut oil with essential oils and the fractionated oil is so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> So far this hasn&#x27;t caused any issues.  </li>
            <li> Also works as is rubbed in beard for soft hair</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would give the product a 5 star (so far).</li>
            <li> It defeats the whole purpose of the &amp;#34;convenience of the pump&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m constantly cleaning up oil.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with the amount</li>
            <li> I have ordered 2 bottles so far and will continue to use this in my practice.</li>
            <li> It is all natural moisturizer for your face,skin and your hair.</li>
            <li> Packed in a 16 oz amber bottle and ready to use as soon as you open the cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes skin soft.  </li>
            <li> but like this just as much (at a fraction of the cost) as a carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it is fluid.</li>
            <li> When using on skin, the oil completely soaks in and does not leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li> Odorless, colorless, completely clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have so far used it to mix with peppermint oil for my oil diffusers and for skin application.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that it gave me relief.</li>
            <li> Makes a wonderful base for lots of oil blends</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large quantity &amp; very cost-effective compared to other brands with tiny bottles that cost almost as much.</li>
            <li> Old dogs apparently can indeed learn a new trick now and again.</li>
            <li> Have used it to make many homemade beauty products and use it plain as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Although it has many other purposes, such as mixing with essential oils for making soaps, bath salts, candles, and the like, I don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t make those things because I lost my sense of smell years ago.</li>
            <li> It is in my experience as I was massaging my husbands shoulders that it also leaves the skin nourished with softness, and leaves a lasting smoothness for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially when this company donates $10 per review to St. Jude organization!</li>
            <li> I bought this coconut oil to use as a carrier oil with my new Young Living Essential oils, and every expectation that I had is exceeded with this stuff.</li>
            <li> it is fantastic with a small amount of Lavender and sugar</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really moisturizing and helps with all my really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I ONLY have one complaint I wish it came in gallon bottles :)</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase a few essential oils so that I can add scent to this fabulous carrier oil when I would like it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, shiny and feeling alive again.  </li>
            <li> Have only used once as base oil for essential oil blend but loved it, absorbs easily</li>
            <li> Not excessively greasy had had a lasting effect while doing the massage session.  </li>
            <li> As I was attempting to clean up my other items to see if they were salvageable, I did notice it felt nice, unfortunately there wasn&#x27;t enough left in the bottle to do anything with it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance&#x27; to use as massage oil and at 16 oz its a rather large bottle; it will last a really long time.</li>
            <li> I mix it with kukui nut oil &amp; a few drops of my favorite aroma therapy oil &amp; use on my very dry skin daily.</li>
            <li> Can be used to dilute ALL essential oils, is totally clear, unscented, and won&#x27;t stain fabrics or skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients</li>
            <li> I like the product so far, it is not as oily on my skin as virgin coconut oil which I use for moisturizer, absorbs faster, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to experiment with it with essential oils or lotions.  </li>
            <li> I chopped it to my shoulders and started the grow out process doing a tint back to my natural color.</li>
            <li> I was told that you can use coconut oil not only in cooking, but you can use it by rubbing in on your cuticles to help keep them soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the glitch is fixed for future buyers.  </li>
            <li> The product itself I only used once so far</li>
            <li> Have been using it to mix with essential oils to make natural remedies.</li>
            <li> I have to say though that her skin felt soft that next day!!!  </li>
            <li> I find this Oil non irritating and love the feeling of my skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It kind of feel like they took all the fat out of it: no sense of oiliness, which is weird, for oil.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many different products I have tried with little or no success.</li>
            <li> It was a slippery hot mess, pintrest lied.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used this twice, still waiting on my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I live in a place that is extremely dry!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this coconut oil over any other.</li>
            <li> Not familiar with how the quality should be, since I&#x27;m fairly new to carrier oils, but so far just using in roll-ons with my essential oils for easier travel.</li>
            <li> It also put a little on my chapped lips and it really helped.  </li>
            <li> It can be used as a carrier oil, for applying other essential oils directly to the body.</li>
            <li> My nails are far less brittle since I have been adding Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil to my bath.</li>
            <li> The 4 rating is only because I have not been using it long, but I do expect I wll be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Overall, much easier to use for skin/hair care than hard, cold-pressed coconut oil.</li>
            <li> bottle will last you a long time too!</li>
            <li> its not something I would worry about due to this 1 bottle can make enough products to replace all of your current Beauty Products !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy and not as easy to use as other FCO pump brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> (as I was afraid it would be) after washing it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love this product as a treatment for my sometimes very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recall a couple other reviews with this same problem.  </li>
            <li> Have recommended to other people and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> The other use that I tried it for was as a carrier oil for a essential oil in a warmer.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face during the winter if I start getting dry, flaky patches....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this coconut oil since I received it on my dry dry dry shins</li>
            <li> I like the way this oil soaks into my dry skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film.</li>
            <li> You can make cleaner, which I did, also make body scrub, or for massage, for body and hair care, make body cream, or just put on your dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use as a moisturizer for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have horribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> My hands crack and bleed and my face is always flaky from being so dry.</li>
            <li> You can also use it on your body by rubbing on your dry skin to also moisturize it.</li>
            <li> Use as a moisturizer for skin and hair by applying directly to dry areas.</li>
            <li> I apologize for taking too long to update my review!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this specific oil because of the pump dispenser as there are other fracted coconut oils with high ratings, but unfortunately, the pump does not work for oils apparently.</li>
            <li> it will help in healing those chapped and dry lips!</li>
            <li> I mixed this oil with some of my essential oils and put the mixture in a small roller ball bottles.</li>
            <li> Strange that I didn&#x27;t recognize other reviews with this defect</li>
            <li> A little weird that the pump had to be trimmed to fit though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 100% pure cold pressed fractionated coconut oil to use as a carrier oil for my doTerra Essential Oils, and this product meets all the requirements necessary for mixing CPTG oils.  </li>
            <li> The pump does leak so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> (were getting itchy from the rough Wisconsin winter).  </li>
            <li> It is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so convenient with the pump, and it doesn&#x27;t go rancid like the solid did after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I added a splash of this to my warmer cup &amp; then added a few drops of my essential oil before I lit my tea candle.</li>
            <li> I added a splash of this to my warmer cup &amp; then added a few drops of my essential oil before I lit my tea candle.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a base for many of my personal care products.  </li>
            <li> I mix a few drops of other essential oils</li>
            <li> If I may say, the only thing I would like to see different is that maybe there could be a pump on the bottle so that it would be a little less messy.  </li>
            <li> Oil dried quickly, no greasy residue left.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for use in massage, and other options per buyer preference.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The lid was cracked so it was leaking as I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of different  brands of fractionated oils in the past, but I won&#x27;t use any other brand now.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin during &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; time of the month, and normal moisturizers make that worse.  </li>
            <li> The bottle leaked all over my shipment soaking the shipping box as well as the other items included in my order.</li>
            <li> the other items in boxes also have coconut oil on them.</li>
            <li> Other than the packaging problem all is well.</li>
            <li> I saw other reviewers comment on this, but I was hoping mine would work without issue.</li>
            <li> No scent, so can be used with any other scented oil that one might prefer.</li>
            <li> Unlike other versions, this one does not leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I order other brands of items just to compare products but not this time.</li>
            <li> Unlike other oils, fractionated coconut oil will not go rancid over time.</li>
            <li> It is like that of other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> Mine came leaking and half empty.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin without any gross left behind.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken as I was unable to release the top up.</li>
            <li> and they came covered in oil and half empty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is 100% pure, therapeutic grade oil, well suited for troubled skin.</li>
            <li> Well my other half is a truck driver and when she gets home off the road she is worn out sore and all.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s plastic and unfortunately, mine came with a whole in it.  </li>
            <li> I did NOT receive the e-book or the guide which kinda sucks because I like reading different ways to use things!</li>
            <li> It almost seems endless!  </li>
            <li> Half of my bottle oozed away.</li>
            <li> The girl that does my massages typically uses lotions.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight scent to it but is almost unscented.</li>
            <li> this top rated unscented base with your expensive organic essential oils to save them from going rancid, making them have a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> No greasy hands trying to close the bottle again without spilling and making a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like silk and as others have stated there isn&#x27;t some sticky residue left behind like some other oils or lotions.</li>
            <li> and the seal wasn&#x27;t attached all the way, nor was the lid on tight.</li>
            <li> It makes it less messy.</li>
            <li> A pump sounds like it would be less messy when using it.</li>
            <li> so if you are using it for Oil Pulling you don&#x27;t have that awkward texture the first few minutes where it melts in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It pumps but also oozes out of the bottom portion of the pump, so it runs down the bottle and gets messy.</li>
            <li> main use is as a carrier for essential oils, or to be a base for other stuff.</li>
            <li> Package is horrible, the pump oozes from the top, so strange!</li>
            <li> I tried it as a face serum, just a few drops, but it was a bit too greasy for my face and made me break out a little.</li>
            <li> I took a few cotton pads and soaked them in a little plastic container with a few drops of fractionated coconut oil on each pad.  </li>
            <li> It seals in moisture without leaving a heavy, greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> massaging a few drops into your hair over night and put it up in a bun to sleep.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Fractionated Coconut Oil for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I picked a few to try out with this coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> I just dabbed a few drops on my legs spread with my hands and got to shaving.  </li>
            <li> If you try and pour some out it drips down the bottle and you waste it!</li>
            <li> It was a mess!</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless !!!</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with the product at all.</li>
            <li> Plus, considering the price and questionable ingredients in store bought lotions, this fractionated coconut oil is not only a bargain but a healthier alternative.</li>
            <li> unfortunately each persons needs are so different</li>
            <li> If I don’t have shaving cream around I usually use conditioner or just water and a razor.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil doesn&#x27;t leave any stains behind like other oils do.</li>
            <li> Only negative (which didn&#x27;t warrant reducing the star rating) was the crappy and useless pump dispenser that came with it.</li>
            <li> it spits and leaks rendering the convenience of the pump useless due to the mess that it creates.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, I use it as a base in a facial moisturizer I have made with essential oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stays liquid at room temperatures, not just above 76 degrees like raw cold pressed oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> It was a hard winter...</li>
            <li> I can hardly wait to get started on the projects I have in mind for this</li>
            <li> It is hard to use an oil that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling &#x27;oily&#x27;, but this does not leave any oily feeling after use.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern was that it wouldn&#x27;t smell like coconuts and it didn&#x27;t, not in the least.  </li>
            <li> I happen to be one of those people that likes the smell of artificial coconut but not real coconut.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a base for an essential oil mixture for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy because all I see is oil all over one side of the box.  </li>
            <li> A refining process leaves behind 100% saturated oil loaded with beneficial medium chain triglycerides.</li>
            <li> However, it has left my bathroom counter in a terrible mess!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You’ll find that this coconut oil will stay liquid at room temperature unlike raw cold pressed oil.</li>
            <li> I just wish my pump didn&#x27;t ooze oil out of its base and drip down the sides.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was leaking when I got the package.</li>
            <li> I twisted my hair in a bun and let it sit.  </li>
            <li> but, all my fancy stuff just wasn&#x27;t cutting it alone.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the label misguide you, as it does not state that it is cold pressed,</li>
            <li> So sorry in the feedback delay, forgot to hit the &amp;#34;submit&amp;#34; button!).</li>
            <li> Customer for life I&#x27;m totally obsessed with this stuff!</li>
            <li> There is no smell bad at all to it.</li>
            <li> I like the oil, but the pump leaked like crazy!</li>
            <li> I had a problem with the oil leaking, but it was during our very cold weather with ice and snow.</li>
            <li> Bad bottle!</li>
            <li> It smells terrible!</li>
            <li> This is very annoying!</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work, smelled awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it! it&#x27;s perfect for my essential oils</li>
            <li> Mine came leaking and half empty. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Use it on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product so I could blend it with essential oils and make roller balls.  So far I&#x27;m loving it!  Blends great, very moisturizing and not too greasy.  Also I think it&#x27;s a great value for the big bottle so I&#x27;m pretty happy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.  I&#x27;m using this with essential oils and this is a great size, plus it&#x27;s organic.  Perfect and awesome value!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for massage oil and goes further than you would expect at first. It also managed to make my beard softer, so that&#x27;s also nice. I haven&#x27;t tried it for anything else suggested yet, but I&#x27;m sure that my datemate and I will enjoy it on spa night. :)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this oil.  It works very well with my EOs and also use with food.  It is a great price for the size.</li>
            <li> Just received this FCO. It is my first experience with it, but so far I am very pleased. The 4 rating is only because I have not been using it long, but I do expect I wll be ordering it again. Service was excellent and additional educational information that has been provided has been helpful.</li>
            <li> My first purchase from this seller and it was great!  Appreciated the free E-Book since I&#x27;m new to essential oils.  I will be back.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just started using essential oils and Fractionated Coconut Oil, but so far I really like it. So far I have used it on myself and on my dogs and had no problems, it is light, makes use easy and simple. Thanks, definitely will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Invivo Essential Premium Fractionated Coconut Oil. Their customer service is very quick to respond to any issues. I had a problem with the oil leaking, but it was during our very cold weather with ice and snow. I received a discount off of a new order and I really enjoy using their Oil.</li>
            <li> I do like this product. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like the looks of this product - but more importantly I like using it in my bath!  I don&#x27;t think there is a rub on style lotion that could do a better job than this stuff - skin is AMAZING after my baths!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and a cute label to boot.  ;) Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and I am happy with the product.  Very versatile.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and shipping! Perfect compliment to essential oils. Will order from Invivo again!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for massage. Although it has many other purposes, such as mixing with essential oils for making soaps, bath salts, candles, and the like, I don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t make those things because I lost my sense of smell years ago. I was able to snag this product at an awesome promotional price, and I did so for the purpose of massage. I like the way the oil feels, and helps prevent friction on the skin. It is in my experience as I was massaging my husbands shoulders that it also leaves the skin nourished with softness, and leaves a lasting smoothness for a decent amount of time. I would recommend this product for use in massage, and other options per buyer preference.</li>
            <li> This oil is a great carrier oil for adding with essential oils.  It&#x27;s a large quantity &amp; very cost-effective compared to other brands with tiny bottles that cost almost as much.</li>
            <li> I started using coconut oil about a year ago because it has so many benefits that I wanted to test out. The problem with what I was using prior to finding this awesome product was all the others were solid which prevented me from using it very often. Now that I have coconut oil that is always in liquid form I use it ALL the time. I highly recommend this coconut oil over any other.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance&#x27; to use as massage oil and at 16 oz its a rather large bottle; it will last a really long time. He loved the feel of it, it&#x27;s not too greasy and it washes off easy too. It is fragrance free which he was happy with. You can use it with scented aroma therapy oils to dilute aroma therapy oils or to make a scented massage oil. Massages are great for creased blood circulation and proves metabolism, Relief from stress, helps relief pain and removes stiffness from body, and helps in case of depression and helps calm the mind.  Coconut oil when used to  massage can also help revitalizing skin cells and make skin softer and smoother. Coconut oil doesn&#x27;t leave any stains behind like other oils do. I recommend this oil to anyone looking for an oil that works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for a discounted price, however, all thoughts, ideas and words are indeed my own.</li>
            <li> I love the fractionated coconut oil! There is no scent to interfere with the products I have used it for. The oil absorbs quickly. I would not hesitate to recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a base for many of my personal care products.  I have sensitive skin and have switched to making my own care products as my allergies/sensitivities seem to increase as I age.  This product has been well suited to my skin needs, and as I move from purchased, prepared products to my own home blends, I am seeing glowingly positive results:  clearer complexion, softer skin, brighter and fuller hair.  Plus, I&#x27;ve stopped sneezing and sniffling so much, too!</li>
            <li> I love Invivo Essential Top Rated Fractionated Coconut Oil - 16oz - Pure Unscented Cocos Nucifera Liquid FCO for Massage Therapy - Best Carrier Oil for Essential Oils and Aromatherapy - 100% Money Back Satisfaction Guarantee by Invivo Essential&lt;br /&gt;  I received this this amazing product as part of a promotion for my Honest review ! Wow am I lucky :) I &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 this oil ! it is for external use ONLY !! also another important thing I&#x27;d like to add there is No scent !! so the sky&#x27;s the limit and that makes this a fantastic carrier oil !!  if my review doesn&#x27;t help you to decide to get this oil then the 100% money back Satisfaction Guarantee should !!&lt;br /&gt;I am more than happy with this oil  &amp; I love how amazing it makes my skin feel ! it is fantastic with a small amount of Lavender and sugar and I used it as a sugar scrub for an evening bath !! I also use it on my daughter and she Loves it ! so great for dry shin issues as well as making your own skin care and hair care  products !! The possibilities are endless !!! even though this product has a next to non existent shelf life its not something I would worry about due to this 1 bottle can make enough products to replace all of your current Beauty Products !</li>
            <li> Great oil! Works perfectly with essential oils. A little weird that the pump had to be trimmed to fit though.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I ONLY have one complaint I wish it came in gallon bottles :)</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price! Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Exactly has described. I would definitely buy again. Just wish it has a pump with it to dispense more easily. Please think about including a pump with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different massage oils and this is the best...light non greasy leaves skin renewed and glowing.</li>
            <li> great product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> You just cant get anything better than this for skin care!!!! Im a young 60+ young lady. My skin is that of a healthy 40 yoa. I&#x27;ve used this oil for 10 years and wont ever give it up. It really is non grease!!!</li>
            <li> I have heard that there are many uses for Coconut Oil, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I tried it as a face serum, just a few drops, but it was a bit too greasy for my face and made me break out a little. It does work nicely as a massage oil, although I would definitely wash it off afterwards, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well and leaves skin with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> The lid was cracked so it was leaking as I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.  The price is good.  The oil feels nice, but that&#x27;s a comparison to organic cold pressed and some coconut oil I picked up at Sally&#x27;s Beauty.  This my first &amp;#34;fractionated&amp;#34; coconut oil.  I am upset that the lid was cracked and product leaked.  I recall a couple other reviews with this same problem.  Product appeared sealed and was shipped with air bags.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to dilute my essential oils and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell. I really like organic!</li>
            <li> I have been using this in my hair and on my skin. It has helped so much with the dryness. It has no smell! so you don&#x27;t have to walk around smelling all coconut all day. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I use this as a carrier for my essential oils.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I used this to make night cream. It absorbs well and moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, nice value and quality product. Thank you! I use as a carrier oil, a moisturizer for hair and skin, and sometimes add some to regular skin lotion in warmer weather. Great stuff</li>
            <li> I use this oil to mix my essential oils in. Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Company provided information on uses and mixtures with essential oil by e-mail.  Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I use it on my face during the winter if I start getting dry, flaky patches....works wonders but never breaks me out or leaves me looking &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner. The oil is great. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. The bottle is nice enough to display with my essential oils. The pump does leak so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> This coconut oil came packaged well, no leaks, and with the original seal still strongly in place. The oil is great for mixing with essential oils! I use it when making rollerballs for my family and for massage therapy. There is no smell at all, it absorbs well, and was a great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I&#x27;ve used a couple of different  brands of fractionated oils in the past, but I won&#x27;t use any other brand now. This makes a great carrier oil for other essential oils. It&#x27;s very smooth and easily absorbed. And I love the included pump!</li>
            <li> Coconut oil is one of my favorite oils because there are so many uses. From hair treatments to skin moisturizer to an ingredient for several body butter or lip balms. I like this fractionated coconut oil because it&#x27;s the perfect carrier oil for essential oils. And I use it as a hair mask. I let it sit in my hair overnight and wash it out in the morning. My hair is so soft and shiny. It looks healthier. I am so thankful that I was able to get this at a great price!</li>
            <li> Let me just begin by saying I&#x27;m a Coconut Oil freak. I cook with it. I put it on my face, my body, my cuticles, and my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this coconut oil since I received it on my dry dry dry shins (were getting itchy from the rough Wisconsin winter).  After three days of using they no longer itch.  I&#x27;ve also been putting it on my feet and then wearing socks to bed and my feet feel so soft in the morning.  This is a great purchase because of the many many ways in which it can be used.  Definitely multipurpose.  I was excited that I was able to purchase this at the discounted price and am happy to share my experience with it with you.</li>
            <li> This product is very good . We love it for massages. ..</li>
            <li> Generous size of fractioned coconut oil for the price. Smells clean, feels lightweight and smooth and absorbs into the skin without leaving any oily feeling or residue behind. This is a quality oil and fractioned coconut oil has a shelf life of almost forever! It does not go rancid and mixes perfectly for massage and cutting essential oils.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil with essential oils and the fractionated oil is so much easier to use. Love it!</li>
            <li> Have only used once as base oil for essential oil blend but loved it, absorbs easily</li>
            <li> My nails are far less brittle since I have been adding Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil to my bath.</li>
            <li> Wonderful carrier oil for making all manner of soaps, scrubs and creams. It is ultra light, virtually scent-free and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  I have acne prone skin during &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; time of the month, and normal moisturizers make that worse.  So far this hasn&#x27;t caused any issues.  It&#x27;s very lightweight, and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;ve even used it on my hair straight out of the shower.  I have permed hair and it makes it very soft and manageable.  My only issue was when I received it there was about an ounce of liquid that had leaked in the bag, so I transferred it to another jar I had that the pump fit into luckily.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and awesome products!</li>
            <li> Works great. Like this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Arived quick and Very god quality! I will be reordering for sure!..</li>
            <li> Works beautifully for essential oil dilutions and blends--great product. Feels excellent and smooth on skin, and pure, too. :)</li>
            <li> I have used this on everyone in my house, yes everyone, myself, baby and dog included and we all love it! Ok so my fur baby is not fond of me chasing him down to spray him with my homemade concoction,  but it has helped his scratching and i love the way my skin feels. My 10 month old has had no issues with it either! Great price for such a big bottle, will buy again</li>
            <li> Mixes great with oils and stretches their use! Also works as is rubbed in beard for soft hair</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Came on time - looks fabulous and easy to use!!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality! Have used it to make many homemade beauty products and use it plain as a daily moisturizer. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The fractionated coconut oils is great... although I did not receive a pump or ebook or dilution guide as the photo describes.</li>
            <li> Oil keeps leaking out of the pump top bottle. Got all over my dresser. Need to keep a towel or something underneath so it doesn&#x27;t ruin surfaces. Other than that, product works great with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I like the oil okay, but whenever I pump the oil out, oil leaks out of the top cap. It&#x27;s very messy and not as easy to use as other FCO pump brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Great product. I would recommend it to anyone. Smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> The bottle leaked all over my shipment soaking the shipping box as well as the other items included in my order. I guess it was just a faulty bottle and the seal wasn&#x27;t attached all the way, nor was the lid on tight. As I was attempting to clean up my other items to see if they were salvageable, I did notice it felt nice, unfortunately there wasn&#x27;t enough left in the bottle to do anything with it.</li>
            <li> This bottle of Coconut oil is great. The quantity is very convincing and you can use it with pretty much everything: skin, hair, massage, moisturizing...etc.  The accessory that comes with it makes it very practical to use to pump in the quantity you need. I recommend it for those who make sure to match the quality with quantity and price all at the same time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a base for an essential oil mixture for my hair. It seals in moisture without leaving a heavy, greasy feeling. My detangling brush went through my hair without a problem and I have 4B/C hair. I am buying this as well as the essential oils I use to make care packages for my aunts and mother. We are all trying to grow our hair with all natural products, and this has provided a great solution for my usually dry hair after only one use. It feels much better than olive or castor oil, and has no scent or dyes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a coconut oil to make homemade baby lotion with.  I had not 1 but 3 baby showers to go to.  It was a hard winter... I had no idea about the &amp;#34;fractionated&amp;#34; part but decided that it would be ideal for the lotion after a little research told me it had extended shelf life and didn&#x27;t smell like coconuts.  So I could add an essential oil (or not) and it would be the perfect carrier for it.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really qualified to make a judgement call here since this was my first foray into making lotion but I was pleased with my outcome.  The shipping was great, arriving in perfect condition in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I just received my bottle and as I see the box my packages came in I&#x27;m not happy because all I see is oil all over one side of the box.  I open the box and the other items in boxes also have coconut oil on them. I&#x27;m sure the oil itself will be fine but I&#x27;m not getting what I paid for now because of how much was spilled all over the box.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil topically and for cooking. The solid version is good for many uses but not for all. This fractionated version gives me a solution when solid doesn&#x27;t work. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong coconut smell which I like. I will be purchasing this again when I use this up. There are so many uses for coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Love it! Will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> Great quality. Affordable price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Makes a wonderful base for lots of oil blends</li>
            <li> I like the product so far, it is not as oily on my skin as virgin coconut oil which I use for moisturizer, absorbs faster, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to experiment with it with essential oils or lotions.  The packaging is a bit deceiving, I thought I was getting a glass bottle but it&#x27;s plastic and unfortunately, mine came with a whole in it.  Otherwise, I would give the product a 5 star (so far).</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It is a perfect addition to my essential oil collection! Great quality ingredients!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil! It is light and feels nice on my skin and works great for massages with essential oils  thanks!</li>
            <li> It is what I expected. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used this twice, still waiting on my essential oils. But I used this on my daughters eczema with some juniper berry and it seemed to help. Good size for the price, nice packaging. I&#x27;ll update once I use more of it. Going to add it to some blends.</li>
            <li> great product. happy with service.</li>
            <li> I love to use this as a carrier oil. It is very easy to use with the pump. Definitely worth the price and i used prime for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good product, ours was delivered and the cap was loose causing about 10% of the oil to leak our creating quite the slimy mess. Other than the packaging problem all is well.</li>
            <li> Item shipped when it was supposed to. Great quality!</li>
            <li> One of the best coconut oils I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Great item, shipped quickly.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great oil and price.  Love that a pump is included.</li>
            <li> Came right on time. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. Loved the sturdy leak proof bottle and the bonus pumper. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Nice oil. Leaky pump.  Prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the oil, but don&#x27;t like the packaging. The pump top leaks every time I use it, which means the bottle and whatever surface it&#x27;s on gets coconut oil all over it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, works great!</li>
            <li> Thank you! I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product as well as with the service.</li>
            <li> Its exactly as described and perfect for mixing with essential oils. Love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the pump but otherwise very pleased</li>
            <li> Great product and service.</li>
            <li> I love this Fractionatied Coconut oil. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product. Took a while for shipping.</li>
            <li> Feels great. Absorbs into skin without any gross left behind. Love this stuff. Bottle leaks with pump attached, though.</li>
            <li> The pump leaks!  I saw other reviewers comment on this, but I was hoping mine would work without issue. Nope. It defeats the whole purpose of the &amp;#34;convenience of the pump&amp;#34; when I&#x27;m constantly cleaning up oil.</li>
            <li> Great oil!! Bad bottle! It leaks EVERYWHERE!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and love the pump.</li>
            <li> Great oil!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it for massage, but my wife loved it.  Really leaves her skin silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. Very high quality and the perfect &amp;#34;carrier&amp;#34; oil.</li>
            <li> Great for message!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the pump...but I would recommend a flip top. Product is great it seems to keep dripping down from the pump :)</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Works well for mixing my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected. Great results</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil, I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils and homemade skin/hair care recipes and it works great!</li>
            <li> Love the quality of this oil! New at this essential oil therapy but really liking it so far!</li>
            <li> Excellent product great price enjoyed the ebook</li>
            <li> Works great use it for my hair along with my conditoner makes my hair really shiny without the greasiness of other oils .</li>
            <li> I like the pump included with the bottle of coconut oil. It makes it so convenient to use. No greasy hands trying to close the bottle again without spilling and making a mess. I&#x27;ll save the bottle and reuse again. Wonder if they sell refills for this container? Are you listening Invivo? This seller has a nice Pinterest site and they explain about the different kinds of coconut oil. Educate yourself with the information so you know for yourself what kind is best for you according to the uses you have in mind. The product is exactly as pictured here. The bottle is plastic so there is no fear of breaking a glass bottle. I&#x27;ve heard it is best to have glass containers but sometimes plastic is more convenient for many reasons. Easy to pour off some of the oil into another travel size container if needed. I can&#x27;t say that it absorbs fast but once it does your skin will be noticeably softer. I am happy with the results of this purchase and would buy it again. This was my first experience with this seller, this brand. I am going to make the shampoo and the cleaner that Invivo has posted in their Pinterest section. I appreciated getting an email and a card included with the purchased product that allows me to get a free e-book. This company has thought through what a customer would like with the inclusion of the pump and the follow up email and e-book material. Kudos for that in my book.</li>
            <li> I have not use this product yet but I know it will work great with my essential oils and is quite a lot I was really surprised with the amount</li>
            <li> I really like this product! Comes with an e-book and essential oil dilution guide.</li>
            <li> Love this Oil. Light feel. Absorbs quickly. Blends well with my essential oils. Only negative (which didn&#x27;t warrant reducing the star rating) was the crappy and useless pump dispenser that came with it. But the oil is great.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and service.... got it in 2 days.... delivered on a Sunday!  And I started using it right away.... I made my first stress relief roller with essential oils... the dilution guide and bonus ebook is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and am looking forward to using it with my EO&#x27;s (making roller ball bottle blends, etc).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because I heard it takes care of eczema. It works for him. He has been using it daily and the bleeding is stopping and all the itching that goes with it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I purchased this item to use as a massage oil. Let me just say that the oil worked great in terms of gliding and absorption into the skin BUT that&#x27;s where the positive remarks end! After using the oil for the first time my hands and my clients body smelled like a moldy dish rag! It smells terrible! And because the oil absorbs so well into the skin it doesn&#x27;t go away after washing your hands or taking a shower! Unless you have a condition that prevents you from having the sense of smell DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Love it! Great Price... Nothing better than coconut oil in my world&#x3D;) So many uses and they also sent me a PDF guide!</li>
            <li> This is really nice oil.  But I didn&#x27;t get the e-book with dilution guide, as promised in the ad.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d have given it a 5 Star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service saw my message &amp; emailed out the d-book, immediately!!  I apologize for taking too long to update my review!!</li>
            <li> The oil is fine, but it also arrived open and leaked all over the box.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and the price is excellent. Not familiar with how the quality should be, since I&#x27;m fairly new to carrier oils, but so far just using in roll-ons with my essential oils for easier travel. So far seems to be great!</li>
            <li> I have bought other fractionated oils and have liked them better. This is too oily when it goes on and it takes a while to absorb into your skin. I have to wait to get dressed! It definitely does the job though. I did NOT receive the e-book or the guide which kinda sucks because I like reading different ways to use things! I do like that is has a pump. It makes it less messy. I don&#x27;t think I would buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> Love it, using as a carrier for essential oils. Great for kids too</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to use with my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and was delivered quickly and ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> Good value, seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> the oil itself is great!! works wonderful for massages and I didn&#x27;t have problems with staining the sheets. my only complain is the pump. it doesnt work well and it&#x27;s leaking. I think the company needs to solve this issue.</li>
            <li> Feels great.  Finest quality.</li>
            <li> this oil does not leave you feeling oily, I have thyroid issues and I am always looking for a moisturizer and this is now my go to for all of my moisturizing needs!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Love the product.</li>
            <li> I like it. I think its a great product.</li>
            <li> I live in a place that is extremely dry! I bought this product to see if it would help me keep my skin semi normal, it&#x27;s helping as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Love this, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t come with a pump, but it works great mixed with surgar and a capful of vanilla or almond extract, for a scrub!</li>
            <li> a great product, my pregnant wife use it on here belly, and i use i also.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I use it after bathing for moisturizing. It&#x27;s so convenient with the pump, and it doesn&#x27;t go rancid like the solid did after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing coconut oil I have ever found. It can be used in so many ways - and I really appreciated the excellent e-materials that came with the product - very useful. The oil has no odor and absorbs quickly. .I have used this on skin and for working through my hair with fabulous results. I am going to purchase a few essential oils so that I can add scent to this fabulous carrier oil when I would like it. Do yourself a favor and get some of this oil!</li>
            <li> Amazing product at an amazing price!! You can&#x27;t beat the quality!!!</li>
            <li> Love the pump and the included e-book was so helpful!!  So happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product! In a competitive field, I like this product.</li>
            <li> I love the FCO and I recieved it the next day👍👍👍</li>
            <li> Works great, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Only reason not a 5 is the bottle, like others mentioned, does leak. Oil is great!</li>
            <li> Great oil!!! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love that this oil came with both a pump and a free e-book! The book was short but helpful and informative, and the pump makes it so much easier to make beauty products at home! I love this FCO, especially for my essential oils and lotions.</li>
            <li> Pump leaks, even when not in use.</li>
            <li> great oil! I just wish my pump didn&#x27;t ooze oil out of its base and drip down the sides.</li>
            <li> I bought this coconut oil to use as a carrier oil with my new Young Living Essential oils, and every expectation that I had is exceeded with this stuff. It is odorless, and absorbs very quickly into the skin. The guide was helpful and easy to use. I will definitely be making this a regular purchase.</li>
            <li> Great value, prompt shipping and love the pump top!</li>
            <li> Use this for all my essential oil blending and love being able to use a pump..</li>
            <li> I love it and it came very quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the pump.  It is almost too strong.  I end up squirting it all over.  The product is great though</li>
            <li> works great, smooth and silky way to hydrate skin without an oily feel.  pump is nice accessory.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil, and it works great with my essential oils. However, it has left my bathroom counter in a terrible mess! For some reason, the oil seeps up through the top of the pump/lid and runs down the sides of the bottle. I first thought that maybe it was just too full, so I emptied some of it and replaced the pump. Next morning, it was all over the counter top again. This is very annoying! If they would fix this issue, I would gladly give this oil five stars!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because it is unscented.  I was using coconut oil but didn&#x27;t like smelling like what I was cooking!  It is truly unscented.  I don&#x27;t use it as a carrier oil but have noticed that when I put a couple of pumps into the bathtub with my L&#x27;Occitane Lavendar foaming bath gel, it enhances the smell of the lavendar.  It absorbs into the skin quickly.  I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the quality of the fco and the price! The follow through customer service is wonderful, making efforts to ensure I am pleased with the product and even sent a complimentary downloadable user guide. Definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> The order arrived in time &amp; the coconut oil is exactly what I was looking for to go with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> High quality oil. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this coconut oil stays liquid. I mix it with kukui nut oil &amp; a few drops of my favorite aroma therapy oil &amp; use on my very dry skin daily. It has made such a difference.  No scent, so can be used with any other scented oil that one might prefer.</li>
            <li> Great for massage and your skin.</li>
            <li> Great formula, it&#x27;s been perfect to use on it&#x27;s own or with my essential oils. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great pump and perfect oil to mix with my essential oils. Good quality and price.</li>
            <li> Great coconut oil to mix with many oils as a carrier. Nice big easy to pour bottle.</li>
            <li> Got the pdf guides which were helpful.  Company seems pretty good.  Great that the company donates to St. Jude&#x27;s.  :-). Thus far, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Not only do I LOVE the oil but the customer service is the best I have ever experienced. The oil comes with a great e-book which breaks down the different uses of both carrier and essential oils.</li>
            <li> Perfect for diluting essential oils! Pump is a nice clean feature.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Just bought two more bottles.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite beauty product. You can use it in the shower to shave plus it&#x27;s an awesome moisturizer, awesome make up remover. Also great to use to mix with essential oils. This will replace multiple beauty products for me.</li>
            <li> Greatly satisfied with my order</li>
            <li> I use it as a carrier oil to dilute essential oils, and I use it as a body and hair moisturizer.  The oil is non greasy and odorless.  It is very light and absorbs into skin easily.  It also doesn&#x27;t stain fabrics which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to leave a perfect feedback for this product because the oil itself is very good: no odor, absorbs well, non-greasy and silky. I ordered this specific oil because of the pump dispenser as there are other fracted coconut oils with high ratings, but unfortunately, the pump does not work for oils apparently. The first one leaked, so I requested another and I was promptly sent another, but it to leaks out of the top. The oil and customer service is great but the defective pump causes the oil to run down the bottle and onto the surface created a mess and is wasteful. Some may find this a non-issue, but if the pump delivery is important, this may become a problem. Strange that I didn&#x27;t recognize other reviews with this defect</li>
            <li> Great value! Great price....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my face and it feels so velvety, that I will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I like that the product came with a pump and the amber plastic bottle looks nice. I would recommend ordering this item on its own since I ordered with other items it leaked over everything and had to return.</li>
            <li> I got my package in two days. No problems.</li>
            <li> Good oil! Package is horrible, the pump oozes from the top, so strange! Half of my bottle oozed away. Eventually transferred to a new pump brought from another store.</li>
            <li> I used the oil for a class I took using doTERRA Essential oils! The class was amazing, the oil was amazing and I am impressed with all the applications it can be used for! This oil soaks into your skin quickly, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple!</li>
            <li> The bottle constantly leaks. Not satisfied with the product at all.</li>
            <li> I like the way this oil soaks into my dry skin and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily film. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil almost every day. It&#x27;s easy to use in many ways and is a better base than other carrier oils because of its light scent. A 16 oz. bottle will last you a long time too! I use it in everything from my dogs&#x27; homemade flea and tick spray, to home-mixed luxurious scented bath oils, to DIY shampoo and conditioners, and more. This is a must have!</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for diluting my doTERRA essential oils. Great value for the price and awesome customer appreciation. Also this company is pledging $10 per Amazon review to St Jude&#x27;s Childrens Research.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this and will buy it again. Also love that the company sent emailed info on how it could be used.</li>
            <li> I recieved this to review and love it. If you like massage oils as I do this is definitely for you to try. I am currently using this to make my own oils and it has worked out very well so far. It doesn&#x27;t have a cheap feel, absorbed very easily into your skun when massaging, and hold other fragrances well! Also worked wonders on my neck with a little mint mixed in for sore muscles!I will for surely purchase this again I the future once I run out!</li>
            <li> Great Product allover. I gave this product a try after my friend (who is a MakeUp Artist) told me about it. I love how it doesn&#x27;t smell like Coconut (I am not a fan of that), but still gives my hair and skin the hydration it needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try massaging a few drops into your hair over night and put it up in a bun to sleep. My very dry curly hair absorbed the product overnight and was shiny and not greasy (as I was afraid it would be) after washing it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love this product as a treatment for my sometimes very dry skin. I find this Oil non irritating and love the feeling of my skin afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for sure also a great product for massages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought any type of oil so I have no frame of reference.  That said, I really like this coconut oil.  My biggest concern was that it wouldn&#x27;t smell like coconuts and it didn&#x27;t, not in the least.  I mix a few drops of other essential oils and I use the mixture from head to toe, it leaves the skin feeling smooth without any greasy residue.  Plus, considering the price and questionable ingredients in store bought lotions, this fractionated coconut oil is not only a bargain but a healthier alternative.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I will purchase this oil again, ABSOLUTELY!</li>
            <li> I like the oil, but the pump leaked like crazy! It was a mess!</li>
            <li> Great coconut oil and excellent seller.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great for essential oils!</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is great. You can use this coconut oil for multiple things. You can make cleaner, which I did, also make body scrub, or for massage, for body and hair care, make body cream, or just put on your dry skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, great carrier oil for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this carrier oil.  I&#x27;m using it for all my essential oils.  I got it at a reduced price to try it and offer an honest opinion on how much I liked or disliked it and this is one I&#x27;ll be purchasing at full price once I&#x27;ve used this bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with using Coconut Oil. Thank you sending me the guide. I can hardly wait to get started on the projects I have in mind for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again.</li>
            <li> Mixes well with essential oils. Seems to do good for massage and absorbs good. The only issue is with the pump. It pumps but also oozes out of the bottom portion of the pump, so it runs down the bottle and gets messy. It would be nice if they sent a squirt flip top instead of the pump.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT stuff! I have ordered 2 bottles so far and will continue to use this in my practice. It&#x27;s got a fantastic glide for use in massage and you can make a little go a long way, so it&#x27;s even more economical. LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Great conduit to use with my fragrances...I love to diffuse.  This is a great quality product that I got when it was discounted.  I would highly recommend Invivo Fractionated Coconut Oil.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product</li>
            <li> Use it for carrier oil</li>
            <li> This coconut oil is amazing.  I bought it to use as a moisturizer for my dry skin.  I had been using the type of coconut oil that is sold at the grocery store in solid form and wanted to try this since the other kind was too greasy, this is not at all!  It left my skin super soft and I love the fact that is unscented so it does not clash with my perfume. It also put a little on my chapped lips and it really helped.  Great product!</li>
            <li> No problem with the order</li>
            <li> I just started using essential oils &amp; was looking to purchase a carrier oil when saw your product. Great product</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and absorbs easily into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have arthritic shoulder, use oil with vibrator to help with stiffness and ability to move.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut( actually, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. You can use it in different ways. I used it on my legs and feet. I massaged it in and my skin feels so smooth.It is not that type of oil that takes forever to rub in.I was able to review this product.It can also be used for aromatherapy massage. It is all natural moisturizer for your face,skin and your hair. There is no smell bad at all to it.It is a great oil!</li>
            <li> I have never seen a product as versatile as coconut oil. You can use it to make homemade beauty products, preserve essential oils, and even cook with certain types of it. Invivo Essential 16 oz Fractionated Coconut Oil is the perfect beauty product to add to your collection. Best part is that an entire jar will last you a lot longer than most skincare products you currently buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You’ll find that this coconut oil will stay liquid at room temperature unlike raw cold pressed oil. It’s odorless, colorless, and completely clear. Packed in a 16 oz amber bottle and ready to use as soon as you open the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider using it to make body butters or conditioners. Spray it in a room for aroma therapy. When using it on your skin, it will absorb quickly, but won’t leave you feeling greasy. It’s loaded with antioxidants and MCT triglycerides perfect for healing: Psoriasis, Acne, Eczema, Rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s safe enough to use for the entire family; yes, babies and pets included!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils.  I will buy it again when I run out.  If I may say, the only thing I would like to see different is that maybe there could be a pump on the bottle so that it would be a little less messy.  A pump sounds like it would be less messy when using it.</li>
            <li> I got the product right away and put it in with my essential oil in my warmer. Oh, the smell was delicious! I am so glad to have gotten it at such a great price and so quickly. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Unlike other oils used for massage that leave you feeling like some kind of fried food, this coconut oil absorbs into the skin, but remains oily enough for a massage.  Makes skin soft.  I mix it with Lavender essential oil and use it for a nighttime massage for my child.  I rarely leave reviews,  but this I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially when this company donates $10 per review to St. Jude organization! 😊</li>
            <li> Great product!  Many uses - also comes with informative guide.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery of a great product!</li>
            <li> As a huge user of essential oils, this coconut oil has worker wonderful! I have used it to dilute oils and it works great. The shipping was super quick and the bottle is huge! You can also use it for dry skin, works great and does not leave a greasy feeling. I was able to order this at a reduced price but will definitely reorder. So much more product for the price.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here; it&#x27;s a great coconut oil, they provide additional documentation on usage and they give part of the sale to St. Jude&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Research Hospital.  This will be my go-to coconut oil for future purchases.</li>
            <li> Great oil, works well as carrier oil and feels amazing on skin. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the bottle doesn&#x27;t pour well AT ALL! If you try and pour some out it drips down the bottle and you waste it! It should have a pump top instead!</li>
            <li> Great oil. Very smooth, very clear. I use it for skin lotion, to mix essential oils &amp; teeth pulling. Love the pump,top. I ordered 4 bottles &amp; will order from here again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it like lotion! It is awesome as a carrier for my essential oils too!</li>
            <li> This is the best fractionated coconut oil that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. As a body oil, it absorbs quickly. As a hair oil, it provides shine without greasiness. I also mix a capful of it with mostly water and a bit of baby shampoo for an excellent makeup remover. What I love most about it is that it DOES NOT smell like coconut oil. I happen to be one of those people that likes the smell of artificial coconut but not real coconut. Go figure. The pump that comes with it is also a great plus since it&#x27;s a rather large bottle. A good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great oil, recommend at each class I teach. And it&#x27;s labeling is very classy.</li>
            <li> My first time trying FCO and I love it!  It goes on soft and smooth with no greasy feeling so it works great alone or along with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> This came without the pump. I was disapointed as that was the main reason I ordered this oil and not others.</li>
            <li> Odorless and non-greasy, this fractionated coconut oil is perfect for working out muscle kinks. More importantly, you don&#x27;t feel the immediate need to shower after applying it to skin!</li>
            <li> This Fractionated Coconut Oil is really the best I have found so far. I use it to mix with Essential Oils in roller balls. Unlike other versions, this one does not leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Was told it was really relaxing.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and has so many uses you need to read the guide. We love it here and you will too.</li>
            <li> I love the oil but unfortunately it was leaking when I got the package. I lost about 1/5 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! First of all, I&#x27;m so glad this came with a normal cap and the pump-top separate so there was no risk of leakage. Secondly, this oil is great (no scent, soaks into skin really really well) and works perfectly for my products. I&#x27;m actually thinking of transitioning the ones that use EVOO to this...</li>
            <li> Love this fractionated coconut oil. I&#x27;ve been using the Doterra oil but like this just as much (at a fraction of the cost) as a carrier oil for essential oils. It&#x27;s smooth, rubs in well, and doesn&#x27;t have a coconut smell at all. Plus I love the packaging! Came quickly and company was great to order from. Have recommended to other people and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful carrier oil for use with essential oils.  I have been using it to make my own blends and to dilute my oils for topical application. Very pleased with this purchase and will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> Great product! I enjoy making essential oil blends with this coconut oil...for relaxation, for gifts, etc. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It works great as a carrier oil and I use it straight on my face everyday. Great price.</li>
            <li> Oil was as promised and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> New user and happy customer.  No leaks or pump issues.  I love using on my face and with my essential oils.  Appreciate the freebie documents too.  The dilution chart is very helpful and guide was informative.  Great communication with the company as well. 😊 Thanks Jeff for the great customer service. (Purchased in June - So sorry in the feedback delay, forgot to hit the &amp;#34;submit&amp;#34; button!). I also have purchased your Tea Tree Oil and that is great as well.</li>
            <li> Lots of coconut oil. Great product, can&#x27;t smell anything. Rubs on smooth, non greasy. And is absorbs quickly so your body is not oily...&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Fractionated Coconut Oil for a few weeks and I must say I really love this product. I mixed this oil with some of my essential oils and put the mixture in a small roller ball bottles. BTW these small roller bottles are great for a little boost of fragrance on the go. I also mixed some of this oil with a bit of Lavender Essential oil to rub on my arms, neck, and shoulders after my shower. What a nice way to get a relaxing fragrance without feeling the least bit greasy. Fractionated coconut oil soaks in so much faster than the coconut oil I was using before and my arms have never felt smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the bigger bottle of fractionated oil because my daughter told me she thought that this was the best fractionated oil for mixing with essential oils. I love this product so much that I will continue to order it. Sometimes I order other brands of items just to compare products but not this time. I have been using coconut oil for the last year to make products for my face and body but I have found through trial and error that my favorite oil to use is coconut oil. If you need a liquid oil then fractionated coconut oil for is the best way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying department store brands for your face and body are more costly but they do not mean you are getting a superior product. Making your own beauty products is a lot of fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love trying out new products an experimenting with them. For years I used store bought items but since I retired I have lots of extra time to research making my own beauty products. I have been asked many times what do I use on my face.....unfortunately each persons needs are so different so it is necessary to do your own research and spend a little time in the trial and error phase.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my hair drastically! I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and have a plethora of high end product but, all my fancy stuff just wasn&#x27;t cutting it alone.  I was recently platinum blonde and desided I didn&#x27;t want my hair to feel like straw anymore and to stop breaking. I chopped it to my shoulders and started the grow out process doing a tint back to my natural color. I still had a ton of breakage until I found this! I&#x27;ve been doing treatments twice a week for 3 to 4 hours with this oil followed up with shampooing twice with a sulfate free shampoo and then a deep conditioner. Every day I mix a bit in with my daily repair oil and just put it on the ends. I highly recommend this not just for hair but skin as well I&#x27;ve been putting it on my face and mixing in in with my body cream after the shower. Customer for life I&#x27;m totally obsessed with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells great! The girl that does my massages typically uses lotions. She has a change of heart after using this oil. I&#x27;m a happy girl right here!</li>
            <li> I have horribly dry skin. My hands crack and bleed and my face is always flaky from being so dry. I can&#x27;t tell you how many different products I have tried with little or no success. I had been hearing a lot of good things about coconut oil so when I was offered to try this at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion, I was so excited. I use it all over, and it has really hydrates my skin, makes it look great, and is so soft now. The price on this is great, you get 16 ounces, and there are so many things you can use it for. I am so impressed with this Coconut oil and it will be the only thing I use from now on to hydrate my skin. I recommend you give it a try and if for some reason you aren&#x27;t satisfied they offer a 100% money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that its liquid. I happy that I can mix any of my essential oils and not worry about any other additional scent. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great versatile oil, non fragranced and not oily after it is rubbed on.</li>
            <li> Great Price, and I like that it came with a pump. It leaked a little bit but nothing significant and because it was in a plastic bag it was easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Already have started using it for my blends and I love it. It was delivered on time. I&#x27;m very happy with it and when it&#x27;s gone I will for sure purchase another!</li>
            <li> I have a Chiropractic office and have 2 massage therapist that use this oil on our patients.  The patients love it and the therapist like it more than what we used to buy.  My wife also uses this at home after she showers and she swears it makes her skin smoother.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have use a lot of coconut oil. This is by far one of the best. I really like the fact that it is fluid. I will be using this for food and my hair. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> My first time using fractionated coconut oil. It has been great used as a carrier oil for my essential oil blends.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, love the pump.  Makes using coconut oil so much easier and it pure.  Plan on getting this for my daughters and granddaughter.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I use this as moisturizer.  Works well for me</li>
            <li> Finally had a chance to use this oil. Very nice feel. Not greasy at all. Great for diffusion with other oils.</li>
            <li> I like this oil, it works perfectly for blending with my doTERRA essential oils, but the pump that came with it spits and leaks rendering the convenience of the pump useless due to the mess that it creates. Aside from that, I am pleased with the product, just bummed about the pump.</li>
            <li> Received bottle in a baggy as it seemed to be leaking. About an ounce of the product was in bottom of the bag and entire outer bottle was covered.&lt;br /&gt;Proceeded to clean that up and took lid off to attach pump that came in the baggy. The pump was broken as I was unable to release the top up.</li>
            <li> Great for diluting your essential oils for topical use!</li>
            <li> I am a very fortunate individual in many things,I know this. I have been allowed the opportunity to sample the wares of companies for no cost except my unbiased opinion. This Invivo Essentials Fractionated Coconut Oil is another example of this. But now that leaves the question as to what the heck is fractionated coconut oil??? Well, fear not! We have the answer right here. As the name implies, fractionated coconut oil is a fraction of the full spectrum of the natural oil. A refining process leaves behind 100% saturated oil loaded with beneficial medium chain triglycerides. The resulting product remains liquid, even at room temperature. It&#x27;s highly stable as a result of the refining distillation process, so it&#x27;s shelf life is nearly indefinite. It&#x27;s odorless and colorless and penetrates the skin quickly and completely. Unlike other oils, fractionated coconut oil will not go rancid over time. So there we have it, That&#x27;s what it means. But what is it used for? It&#x27;s used for a carrier oil for essential oils like when they are too strong, massage oil, face &amp; body oil, a hair conditioning oil &amp; many other things. I tried it in place of my good old stand by Morocan oil on my hair as a conditioning/ taming treatment. It is colorless &amp; not quite as thick which may certainly be an appealing thing to those of you with light hair as the other is a darker color &amp; a thicker more syrupy consistency. It does have a slight scent to it but is almost unscented. It is like that of other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; products. It did help to control the winter static &amp; fly aways that always happens this time of year. I think that I may have needed to put more on overnight &amp; let it soak in to get the full effect that I desired but it was not awful. It would be fantastic on a lighter summer day I think when maybe I don&#x27;t need quite as much moisture. The other use that I tried it for was as a carrier oil for a essential oil in a warmer. Often times essential oils can be a bit too strong on their own without something to help with that &amp; this product does that job beautifully. I added a splash of this to my warmer cup &amp; then added a few drops of my essential oil before I lit my tea candle. This really tempered the scent nicely to make what would have been far too much a really beautiful experience.n without something to help with that &amp; this product does that job beautifully.

            <li> This is a wonderful product!  I am looking forward to all the uses I will have with this Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly as it was described!  Fast delivery!  I will definitely do business again!</li>
            <li> Love this FCO! Great product!</li>
            <li> came quickly and bottle was full.  no leaks.  would do business with again.</li>
            <li> I love how this soaks into the skin. It does not leave any oily residue. I put peppermint essential oils in the Fractionated Coconut Oil. I use it right on my skin, as well as my son&#x27;s after bath time at night. We both love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it came with another nozzle for spraying it on. That would be great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> I am a chronic user of essential oils, and this is by far the best base oil that I own. It is light weight and does not smell bad or strong, honestly it&#x27;s practically odorless. It is hard to use an oil that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling &#x27;oily&#x27;, but this does not leave any oily feeling after use. Perfect for diluting EO with and all over everyday use.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected it to be. I purchased to make my own essential oil blends for a roller ball bottle and it works perfectly. Great that the pump is included. This brand was a great price and I will definitely order this item again.</li>
            <li> Love it!. It goes on light and absorbs quickly.  It is a perfect carrier oil!</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Great price and delivered just as promised.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  I purchased this as a carrier oil and also received a very informative guide to the oil through a follow up email. Will be ordering again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I was mixing it with cumin oil for ibs- it didn&#x27;t work, smelled awful</li>
            <li> So far I am really enjoying this product. It is completely fragrance-free and absorbs really well. Overall, much easier to use for skin/hair care than hard, cold-pressed coconut oil. I would give the product five stars, but I noticed some oil leaking from the bottle, and I have only had it a couple of days. I love the pump and the product though.</li>
            <li> Best price, love the pump bonus!</li>
            <li> Coconut is the perfect oil and really the only oil you need.  The oil works in a variety of ways and can be used in a variety of methods.  I will definitely buy more.  My wife is currently pregnant and she loves using the oil</li>
            <li> Awesome, will for sure order more.</li>
            <li> Really nice carrier oil for my essential oils! I love using coconut oil in making my bath and body products, as I find its the best quality and best for my skin. It&#x27;s really moisturizing and helps with all my really dry skin. This is a really large bottle, so it&#x27;s a great value. It was packaged well and the lid was tightly on, which was great to me as I have bought carrier oils from other brands before and they came covered in oil and half empty. I am happy to have picked this up during a discount promotion to review. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the PDF files on Fractionated Coconut Oil and uses.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Oil dried quickly, no greasy residue left. The bottle is a nice size, dark tinted, plastic bottle. The main problem is the mouth of the bottle has nothing to help it pour slower. If there was some kind of slow flow cap on the bottle it&#x27;d be great. I&#x27;ve used it after a shower to moisturize my legs and arms. I attempted to use it IN the shower to shave my legs. It was a slippery hot mess, pintrest lied. Don&#x27;t try it. The oil is great, just the packaging needs some help.</li>
            <li> I really like this . I had a rash , and started putting it on it and within a week it is gone. and I had this rash for months</li>
            <li> Using for homemade soap, and exactly what I had hoped for</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to get this at a promotional discount! The bottle is very generous and I will be using this for many of my beauty needs. I was told that you can use coconut oil not only in cooking, but you can use it by rubbing in on your cuticles to help keep them soft and moisturized. You can also use it on your body by rubbing on your dry skin to also moisturize it. Oh, another thing you can do is put it on your lips.. it will help in healing those chapped and dry lips! There are so many things to do with Coconut oil that I am looking forward to using it daily as part of my regimen. Thank you so much for this opportunity to try this product out and use for myself and my family.</li>
            <li> Just received this oil and so far I really like it, I use it in place of face serum, so far so good!</li>
            <li> Mine did not come with a pump.  I use it with my essential oils.  First time purchase of this brand as I ran out of the one I had.  Cheaper price and I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this one and another brand I used.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this as a massage oil for me during my pregnancy and it has made my skin incredibly soft and smooth. It&#x27;s completely scent free so I&#x27;ve split it into separate bottles and added different essential oils to help with relaxation and muscle aches. It&#x27;s not greasy at all doesn&#x27;t leave stains on or sheets or clothing. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love it! I&#x27;ve tried several different brands and this one is definitely too of the line!! The pump is super convenient!!</li>
            <li> All things coconut oil are wonderful.  This is as well.  Very fine and will make your skin softer than&lt;br /&gt;any cream you could spend hundreds for.</li>
            <li> I love this coconut oil, but my bottle leaks!  There is always a ring of oil on my counter after I use the product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I was paying more for less of another brand when I discovered Invivo and decided to give it a try. So glad I did!</li>
            <li> Great. Perfect for making my roller bottle oil recipes!</li>
            <li> First off, the ONLY reason I&#x27;m giving 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the lid. I would prefer a flip-top with a smaller hole for easier pour control. The oil itself is so versatile. I have used it to make sugar scrubs (adding essential oil for scent); Make roll-on perfume (again with essential oils); I put a small amount on after showing (while still wet), then towel dry - wonderful way to keep skin soft and moist! When using on skin, the oil completely soaks in and does not leave a greasy film. When using as a carrier oil, it;s great because it has absolutely no scent! The company sends some helpful information after order via email which really helps if you are new to using fractionated coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased with the product. Everything is as advertized. Quick delivery too!!!</li>
            <li> Item as described. I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it has a nice feel and no smell. Large quantity for a great price and item came on time!  Very happy with purchase and with item. Plan on purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Very soothing to the skin! It&#x27;s like silk and as others have stated there isn&#x27;t some sticky residue left behind like some other oils or lotions. I do happen to love scented oils so I simply added some of my favorite essential oil scents to the bottle to make my own blend of aromatherapy. I like that about this oil, if you don&#x27;t like scented oils then this is great for you, if you do like scented oils this is a fantastic product in which you can transfer some of the oil into smaller containers and make a multitude of scented oils for your body or hair, or like me, play around with a mixture of scents to make your own special blend! As with others, my only complaint is that the large bottle of oil isn&#x27;t easy to pour without making a mess unless you plan ahead using a funnel or if you find a top that will fit correctly and has a pouring nozzle. If they put a device to pour this oil easily and with little to no mess it&#x27;d be a 5 star rating all the way! I WILL get more again! This company was also fast and wanted to be sure the product came to me in a timely manner and that I was happy with the product, as a company goes, they go above and beyond to assure customer satisfaction!!</li>

Rawr!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.&lt;br /&gt;Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I did some research, and this was the best price I could find on a good FCO.  I have already ordered and begun using a second bottle, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the price, the Amazon shipping, or the product - it&#x27;s perfect for diluting essential oils for topical application!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that the company is donating $10 to St. Jude&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Research Hospital for each product review - that&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Good amount for the price. It kind of feel like they took all the fat out of it: no sense of oiliness, which is weird, for oil. Holds scents well.&lt;br /&gt;Is a non-greasy way to lock in skin&#x27;s moisture after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;My hair definitely prefers regular coconut oil, and this type is simply not as versatile.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s main use is as a carrier for essential oils, or to be a base for other stuff.</li>
            <li> Once I got notice that I would be receiving Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil to review I started looking into all the possibilities of using coconut oil.  Oh my, was I impressed!  It almost seems endless!  I picked a few to try out with this coconut oil.  The Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil is different from regular coconut oil.  Beings that it is fractionated it stays as a liquid and doesn’t need to be warmed up to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did was shave my legs with it.  If I don’t have shaving cream around I usually use conditioner or just water and a razor.  Conditioner works well but the fractionated coconut oil works so much better.  It didn’t leave a film on my razor and left my legs smooth like baby’s skin.  I just dabbed a few drops on my legs spread with my hands and got to shaving.  I works wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next use was as a mask for my hair.  I live in Louisiana and the humidity does bunches of damage to my hair.  I washed my hair as usual then put a quarter size amount of fractionated coconut oil in my palm and spread it throughout my hair paying more attention to my ends.  I twisted my hair in a bun and let it sit.  After about 5 minutes I took my hair out of the bun and rinsed the fractionated coconut out of my hair.  It left my hair soft, shiny and feeling alive again.  I do this about twice a week and it not only makes my hair healthier but it seems to protect my hair from the weather and my blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried it as a makeup remover.  I took a few cotton pads and soaked them in a little plastic container with a few drops of fractionated coconut oil on each pad.  I then removed 1 pad and swiped it across my face and it removed all the makeup in that area with 1 swipe.  It left my face feeling soft and smooth!  It’s great to clean my face and moisturize it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty more ways to use this Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.  With the size of this bottle I’m sure it will go along way with trying anything else I stumble upon using Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this evaluation are solely my own.s bottle I’m sure it will go along way with trying anything else I stumble upon using Invivo Essential Fractionated Coconut Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review.

            <li> There was an initial issue with getting the free info download, but the company made good on it.  Hopefully the glitch is fixed for future buyers.  The product itself I only used once so far but I really liked the way it felt.  Not excessively greasy had had a lasting effect while doing the massage session.  I will get imput from client on next visit. Sue.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product and great customer service.  Definitely a product I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the best coconut oil I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve used a lot as I make my own skin products).  This oil has done amazing things for my skin, especially my face!  No smell, absorbs fast, and this quality is unbeatable.  Great price and I love the dilution guide, so helpful.</li>
            <li> I loved my fractionated coconut oil! Thank you,</li>
            <li> Love having this In a pump. Makes it so easy to apply</li>
            <li> Great Customer service! Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite oils.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, I use it as a base in a facial moisturizer I have made with essential oils. Will keep using this one as it is reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful!  I will be using it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this for essential oils and it works great! The owner reached out via email to make sure I was satisfied and pass along some information on the product. That&#x27;s awesome customer service which is appreciated!</li>
            <li> Fractionated Coconut Oil has a wealth of wonderful properties and so many uses! It can be used as a carrier oil, for applying other essential oils directly to the body. It can also be used as a massage oil. I like to put just a drop in my foundation when applying my makeup in the morning. It makes my foundation look much smoother and more skin-like, as opposed to just sitting on top of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fractionated coconut oil has no scent, which I appreciate; I just do not like the smell of coconut! The oil is also a nice consistency and absorbs quickly into my skin. It doesn’t leave a greasy residue. Product provided for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Great oil at a good price!  Have been using it to mix with essential oils to make natural remedies.</li>
            <li> Using this with my Essential oils, love it</li>
            <li> came fast, fast, fast, and it is so nice to have the pump so I can control the portion.  has nothing to do with quality, but I kind of miss the coconutty smell that you get with regular coconut oil, I&#x27;m guessing all fractionated coconut oil looses that smell.  Good Job.</li>
            <li> Love it...received it super fast.</li>
            <li> Love the oil! It is great for blending with essential oils. I just wish somewhere it would say how many teaspoons 1 pump is.</li>
            <li> Packaged perfectly and is one of the best therapeutic grade oils out there!!</li>
            <li> This is very nice coconut oil. It is very light. I am keeping it in the bathroom and dip my finger into the bottle and put oil on my face. I am also using it to mix with essential oils for applications.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is pretty good.. Works fabulous for massages and dry skin however I find it has an after smell (rancid like). The pump top leaks even with the seal in place.  Not sure I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Well my other half is a truck driver and when she gets home off the road she is worn out sore and all.  I got this product to review for my honest and unbiased opinion and decided to try it on her.  I massaged her for an hour and that oil was great!!!  it&#x27;s not scented which for her is a plus. It was a great idea and she agreed.  I have to say though that her skin felt soft that next day!!!  I will continue to use this item.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> awesome product!  Great company!  I was looking for a 100% pure cold pressed fractionated coconut oil to use as a carrier oil for my doTerra Essential Oils, and this product meets all the requirements necessary for mixing CPTG oils.  Don&#x27;t let the label misguide you, as it does not state that it is cold pressed, however the Guide that was emailed to me by the company confirms it as such.  Invivo also sent me a pdf Dilution Guide too which is very helpful.  The cost was very economical as well.  I would highly recommend this company to others.</li>
            <li> My first time to experience coconut oil. I am new to using oils so I welcomed the opportunity to review this coconut oil. It&#x27;s a large bottle that will last for many uses. I have so far used it to mix with peppermint oil for my oil diffusers and for skin application. For the diffusers it has worked beautifully to supply my favorite scent of peppermint and it has lasted much longer than I thought it would. I also blended the coconut oil with some peppermint and lemon oils and rubbed it onto my skin when I was having some pain. I was surprised to find that it gave me relief. I know in some instances you want to use virgin coconut oil, but for the uses when fractionated oil can do the job or you don&#x27;t want any added coconut scent, this is great. I&#x27;ll definitely be exploring more of the many uses for coconut oil I have read about.</li>
            <li> good stuff!  very happy with the product and it is a very good value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of essential oils, but had read that a quality carrier oil was &amp;#34;essential&amp;#34; (sorry; I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve never heard THAT one before...) to safely dilute oils for skin application. I have used solid coconut oil before, both topically and internally, but didn&#x27;t know that fractionated oil existed. Old dogs apparently can indeed learn a new trick now and again. Besides putting out a great product at a very competitive price, this company makes customer service a priority, supplying pdf instructions on how to most effectively use the product. An added bonus is that they support St. Jude Hospital. Score!</li>
            <li> Love this FCO! A great price for the amount you get! So many of my oily buddies use a different &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; however, they are getting less product for a higher price. I am definetely suggesting this to everyone I know who uses EO&#x27;s. I also love the label. Very retro ;)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great quality, good price, and packaged well!  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The oil has no scent, works great, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  Will buy this one again.</li>
