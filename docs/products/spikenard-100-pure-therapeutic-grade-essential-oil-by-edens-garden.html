    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Very good product. Nicely packaged and quick delivery. Very please with purchase.</li>
            <li> This oil is very high quality and has tremendous staying power. I am very pleasantly surprised at the affordability. Excellent company!</li>
            <li> Love Eden Gardens Oils. They are always delivered fast and are of very fine quality.</li>
            <li> Spikenard 100% Pure Therapeutic Grade Essential Oil - 10ml&lt;br /&gt;This is great stuff.. very potent, very powerful scent.  A drop is plenty.</li>
            <li> I adore Spikenard, which I use for spiritual purposes, peace and deoderant.  It&#x27;s not available locally, so I am so grateful to find a source that is not only affordable, but of exceptional quality.  The last brand that I ordered on-line did not compare with this one.  I love the bottle too.</li>
            <li> just started will update</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for Maunday Thursday services at church. It goes a long way as the scent is sumptuous and powerful</li>
            <li> Using Essential Oils can have a great healing and calming effect to the body. You can use them in various ways but I like to add Essential Oils to a bath or just smell the oils and let the calming effect take place. They are so relaxing.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping! It doesn&#x27;t smell like Spikenard. I know what true Spikenard smells like. I thought it smelled kind of like stale cigarettes. I got some on my hands which it even smelled worse and I couldn&#x27;t get the smell off fast enough. I will not be purchasing Spikenard from Edens Garden again. I will purchase other oils, just not Spikenard. 3 stars for extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect addition to my work with classical aromas for ritual application. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of it&#x27;s significance in Scripture. I wore it each day during Lent as a reminder. The quality is excellent; one drop is all I needed each day. I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> There is something sacred about this oil; when I put it in a steamer to send it into the air in my home, I find it promotes a sense of peace. It arrived early, securely packaged.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find this product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for it for years. Finally! Haven&#x27;t really used it other than to anoint my home once, when receiving it. The aroma is what I expected after reading the reviews. It&#x27;s a treasure to have!!</li>
            <li> This does have a very strange smell to it. I will try other therapeutic oils instead that have a more pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t used the item yet it is exactly what I needed for a project with aromatherapy. Looking forward to future purchases.</li>
            <li> This spikenard oil is indeed therapeutic. Used it a couple of times in homemade hair oil and worked very nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with Eden&#x27;s Garden oils.  Spikenard has such a distinct smell, makes a great addition to the essential oil collection.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! received it in no time. Burned it during prayer and meditation. Very pleasant, aroma. I Would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this one! It&#x27;s got a deep-woods, musky scent that is fantastic for aromatherapy. Very masculine scent! You can even use it in your homemade moisturizer for aging skin.</li>
