            <li>I really was not too impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>It creates a nice surface that does not create static when I use the dryer</li>
            <li>This product smells so good too, it smells refreshing and clean.</li>
            <li>Moisturises my hair and the smell is just LOVELY</li>
            <li>I love how it isn&#x27;t oily</li>
            <li>This is more for hair taming, though.</li>
            <li>but I like this even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>Love Garnier products they deliver what they promise.</li>
            <li>Feels more healthy</li>
            <li>Good product- does exactly what it says it does.  </li>
            <li>Compared to a day where I use nothing on my hair, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.  </li>
            <li>In hot humid weather, my ponytail does  not frizz and not one tangle, its amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite hair products EVER!  </li>
            <li>Love it in conjunction with the Curl Calm</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is really good.</li>
            <li>Love it takes tangles out of my hair so I can brush it right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Shampoo, conditioners, smoothing milk then a flat&lt;br /&gt;iron gives smooth and silky straight hair.</li>
            <li>Worth the Money.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair tangle-free and soft for easy management.</li>
            <li>I am African-American with long relaxed hair which tangled very easily after washing and when wearing in a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>This product not only smells amazing but also makes my hair feel 10x soft!!</li>
            <li>I use all Garnier products and all work great for my thick frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I would say that this works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I put it on before blow-drying or before flat ironing and there are no fly-aways and has more moisture.</li>
            <li>Then I first apply to the top of my head mainly hear my forehead then back.  </li>
            <li>Well let me say that I have absolutely noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>This helps me be my wide tooth comb through the top</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really do that.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t damage my hair or really help it</li>
            <li>each section was bouncy, shiny and smelled real good.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>and it makes detangling so much easier.</li>
            <li>After towel drying my hair, I put this on my damp hair, and it combs out very easily with less breakage.  </li>
            <li>My afro-texured hair is long, relaxed straight, baby fine, and prone to dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li>Its the only product that can truly calm my unruly frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>B003JN4URY Mane N Tail Conditioner 32 oz]], rinsed and styled as normal!</li>
            <li>The brown is still smooth but the grey is wiry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning with SILKY, SOFT, BOUNCY hair, no frizz, and it stayed silky soft and frizz free for three days!</li>
            <li>Wow really?!</li>
            <li>If I added more to my hair, it would just weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Helps the curls be more defined but not so frizzy and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li>This works very well and leaves my hair feeling and looking soft!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I have highly damaged hair, and its embarrassing how thinned out</li>
            <li>It really leaves hair shiny and soft also it helps prevent my hair from tangles.</li>
            <li>and I expected it to smooth my hair and take the frizz away</li>
            <li>Normally my hair is curly with a bit of frizziness</li>
            <li>I make two sections - right and left side.  </li>
            <li>Then I wrapped it into a loose bun on top of my head and secured with a big clip.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft and sleek.</li>
            <li>Works better than a lot more expensive products such as Matrix and Nexxis!</li>
            <li>I used to have smooth slightly wavy hair until it started greying.</li>
            <li>After I used this product, I woke up the following day and my hair was soft, straight</li>
            <li>, I washed/conditioned my hair and before it airdried completely, I put a couple dallops of this stuff in it then</li>
            <li>Did not make it soft or shiney in any way.....</li>
            <li>My natural hair is Wavy and frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It tames my hair, makes it stay in place without fizzing, and makes it shine and feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I applied this to my straight hair continuously until my curls came back and they all did.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which of course loves to frizz</li>
            <li>I use it each time after towel drying and drying with the hair dryer a little first, then applying about a quarter size or a little more halfway out from the scalp and to the ends.  </li>
            <li>Just a little dab through wet hair before you blow dry it, or a little after it&#x27;s dry, keeps my hair so smooth, shiny, and virtually frizz-free (except on exceptionally humid days, but you can&#x27;t fight Mother Nature!</li>
            <li>I usually have to moisturize it twice a day, but I&#x27;m not even sure if that is necessary, now that I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am an African American with natural hair and it works wonders on keeping my hair straight .</li>
            <li>Also you can put it on dry hair, but not to much or it would make it greasy.</li>
            <li>i only wish maybe they had a larger bottle I seem to be going through it fast.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, but fine, hair, so flyaway hair is always an issue, but</li>
            <li>This milk didn&#x27;t cause my hair any dryness or damage, my hair was soft and very moist w/o that wet feeling, but dry.</li>
            <li>I used this product first, blow dried, then applied my heat protectant [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It might help to know that my hair is long, straight, but exceptionally fine, and is very susceptible to that ugly, frumpy frizziness because of the fineness.</li>
            <li>It is hard to manage but this stuff makes it very manageable and very soft.</li>

            <li> It is hard to manage but this stuff makes it very manageable and very soft.</li>
            <li> Generally I flat iron my hair before I go to bed after I&#x27;ve washed it and blow</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> B0058CJV50 Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Perfector</li>
            <li> After using the Mizani, to each section before flat ironing</li>
            <li> My hair ends up flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> Because of this, my hair has grown very long because I am not constantly breaking my hair off getting the tangles out!!</li>
            <li> I jumped at this because I am african american and I have thick coarse natural hair</li>
            <li> I have tried about every product out there from cheap to expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have very long wavy frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> have not used it on dry hair...and wouldn&#x27;t because it is water based and that would defeat the purpose)</li>
            <li> anytime I don&#x27;t have the time to blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii and live on the windward side of the island- needless to say</li>
            <li> so i use this product when my hair is wet and then blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair which gets very dry at times.</li>
            <li> but I have learned that when it comes to my hair a little extra money is well spent on product</li>
            <li> (I used this product on my wet hair-</li>
            <li> Either way, at around $3, it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I put it in while my hair was still wet</li>
            <li> my frizz is extremely minimal.  </li>
            <li> My hair has blossomed and I&#x27;d hate to have to battle damage after such a rewarding journey.</li>
            <li> This stuff tames the grey down without greasiness or heaviness.</li>
            <li> She said it will cut down my time consumed by half and make my flat ironing my hair a breeze and no heat damage.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this product to try and help me tame my bout w/blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> , they sent me the wrong product, i sent an e-mail staying the wrong item was received TWICE, i ordered 3 bottles the first time, they sent me the wrong product, the second time i orderer 4 bnottles again and one more time</li>
            <li> When it was all dried it didn&#x27;t even look dry....</li>
            <li> Down Anti-Frizz Cream.</li>
            <li> Calms my hair down and does not look greasy.  </li>
            <li> because it does weight down my hair just a bit.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a little over a week ago.  </li>

            <li> This works very well and leaves my hair feeling and looking soft!  It has a great smell as well.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is really good. I bought this a week ago in a family dollar store. My afro-texured hair is long, relaxed straight, baby fine, and prone to dryness and frizz. I usually have to moisturize it twice a day, but I&#x27;m not even sure if that is necessary, now that I found this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I washed/conditioned my hair and before it airdried completely, I put a couple dallops of this stuff in it then let it airdry the rest of the way. Then I wrapped it into a loose bun on top of my head and secured with a big clip. I woke up the next morning with SILKY, SOFT, BOUNCY hair, no frizz, and it stayed silky soft and frizz free for three days!</li>
            <li> Moisturises my hair and the smell is just LOVELY</li>
            <li> Love it in conjunction with the Curl Calm Down Anti-Frizz Cream.</li>
            <li> wrong product, the one i ordered never got it, they sent me the wrong product, i sent an e-mail staying the wrong item was received TWICE, i ordered 3 bottles the first time, they sent me the wrong product, the second time i orderer 4 bnottles again and one more time i got the wrong item, i did not authorize to exchange my product for a similar, so i decided not to buy anymore from your site, i sent an e-mail to arrange the return of the wrong product and exchange for the correct one, NOBODY ever responded to me.  There are PLENTY sites that i can buy products from...</li>
            <li> Love it takes tangles out of my hair so I can brush it right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair tangle-free and soft for easy management.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair which gets very dry at times. I put it on before blow-drying or before flat ironing and there are no fly-aways and has more moisture. Also you can put it on dry hair, but not to much or it would make it greasy.</li>
            <li> I received this product within it&#x27;s time range and I am very pleased with it. I have no complaints and will definitely be trying it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a little over a week ago.  I live in Hawaii and live on the windward side of the island- needless to say, I don&#x27;t have A/C since it&#x27;s not needed on this side of the island and the humidity has made managing my hair nearly impossible.  I am biracial and have relaxed hair but regardless its still frizzy and hard to tame.  I have tried about every product out there from cheap to expensive.  I bought this on a whim when I saw the claims to be humidity resistant.  Well let me say that I have absolutely noticed a difference.  Generally I flat iron my hair before I go to bed after I&#x27;ve washed it and blow dried it and after I wake up in the morning, the humidity has destroyed it and it looks like a poof.  After I used this product, I woke up the following day and my hair was soft, straight and I had no poof.  Wow really?! I really am shocked at how well it has worked.  This will be my go-to product from here out for humidity control.  Also- I wash my hair about once a week and my hair lasted all the way up until the next wash.  Good product- does exactly what it says it does.  (I used this product on my wet hair- have not used it on dry hair...and wouldn&#x27;t because it is water based and that would defeat the purpose) Aloha!</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Used it for years now! Works better than a lot more expensive products such as Matrix and Nexxis!</li>
            <li> I love how it isn&#x27;t oily it&#x27;s perfect and amazing smell. It really leaves hair shiny and soft also it helps prevent my hair from tangles.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a bunch of hair-care products and decided to pick this up along with the Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine Moroccan Oil and Leave-in Conditioner. I prefer the latter 2 products over this, as I like the shine (as the name implies) they produce and the overall feel of my hair afterward. Either way, at around $3, it was money well spent. This is more for hair taming, though.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a product that would resist humidity and keep my hair from expanding and poofing up along with controlling frizz. This was not it. I put it in while my hair was still wet and before I could even test it out in the humidity, it made my hair look EXTREMLEY greasy, flat, and weighed down, which really annoyed me because it takes me FOREVER to dry my hair because of how thick it is! When it was all dried it didn&#x27;t even look dry....it looked greasy and sticky and I didn&#x27;t even put a lot of product in. Did not make it soft or shiney in any way..... grr</li>
            <li> I love this product! My natural hair is Wavy and frizzy hair so i use this product when my hair is wet and then blow dry my hair. It makes my hair very soft and sleek. Sometimes after I curl my hair and put hair spray on it i also use this product to soften it. This product smells so good too, it smells refreshing and clean. It also protects your hair against getting ruined by humidity. I totally recommend that you try this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Calms my hair down and does not look greasy.  I was already a fan of the sleek and shine but I like this even better.  i only wish maybe they had a larger bottle I seem to be going through it fast.  I run it through my hair after the shower from roots to tips and comb through and I&#x27;m set.  will purchase again</li>
            <li> This with the curl sculpting gel is great and it smells great as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is my favorite hair product.  It tames my hair, makes it stay in place without fizzing, and makes it shine and feel so soft.  It does not make my hair feel stiff or oily.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> delivered as described</li>
            <li> I use all Garnier products and all work great for my thick frizzy hair.  Shampoo, conditioners, smoothing milk then a flat&lt;br /&gt;iron gives smooth and silky straight hair.</li>
            <li> I will never get this stuff again it didnt help at all in smoothing or controlling the frizz like it shoud</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair and have used this product for 7 years. I love it! It takes the frizz away and softens the hair. All I have to do is add this to damp hair and I know my frizz will go away. I recommend this to every one with frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> One of the best products ever! Ellis great and works wonders on my hair. I have long blonde hair. It is hard to manage but this stuff makes it very manageable and very soft. Plus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it finally started raining here in California.  When the rain hits, my curly hair just explodes.  It becomes a frizzy mess and looks terrible.  Normally my hair is curly with a bit of frizziness but when there is tons of moisture in the air, it&#x27;s a horror show.  I bought this because I hate the feeling of hair spray, and it doesn&#x27;t work for me anyhow because I allow my hair to dry naturally.  I don&#x27;t apply heat to my hair, and I haven&#x27;t found anything to help fight frizz on moist days.  I would say that this works pretty well.  On a day where I washed my hair that morning, applied this smoothing milk to my damp hair and went about my day (and it rained)…my frizz is extremely minimal.  Compared to a day where I use nothing on my hair, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.  My hair looks like it&#x27;s summer outside!  I took off a star because it does weight down my hair just a bit.  Also, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a 24 hour hold as the bottle promises.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle product.  It does what is promises and that&#x27;s all you can ask for.</li>
            <li> It holds and smells great.</li>
            <li> For the price, I think this product works well.  It has a nice fragrance and smooths out curls nicely.  When Amazon has it on sale, I tend to buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she was very satisfied with it. I would recommend that others buy it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite hair products EVER!  I have very long wavy frizzy hair.  After getting out of the shower I apply about a dime size amount into the palms of my hands and rub together.  Then I first apply to the top of my head mainly hear my forehead then back.  This helps me be my wide tooth comb through the top so I can part it.  I make two sections - right and left side.  Then I do the same thing and apply working from the ends upward.  This makes my hair very smooth and silky and NOT GREASY!  This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that I can use on my roots without it causing an oily residue.  I pray they never discontinue this.  I will cry my eyes out! lol</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I am an African American with natural hair and it works wonders on keeping my hair straight . Shipping was fast. And the product is a must have!</li>
            <li> This product is a must for my hair every day. I have highly damaged hair, and its embarrassing how thinned out I let it get. This smooths out my frizz, and I can still shape my hair for a big 80&#x27;s rock look.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Its the only product that can truly calm my unruly frizzy hair! lol</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair every night to moisturze it. It greats rid of the frizz and dryness. I just dont like the smell though. But this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Helps straighten my thick puffy hair. Smells so good.</li>
            <li> I used to have smooth slightly wavy hair until it started greying. The brown is still smooth but the grey is wiry and frizzy. Even so, I won&#x27;t color it. This stuff tames the grey down without greasiness or heaviness.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly. I really was not too impressed with this product. I smoothed it over my hair after a shower and I expected it to smooth my hair and take the frizz away but it didn&#x27;t really do that. If I added more to my hair, it would just weigh it down. I didn&#x27;t notice any shine and after a while I was basically just using it to use it up. It didn&#x27;t damage my hair or really help it so I just used it up. I won&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a year ago.  I am African-American with long relaxed hair which tangled very easily after washing and when wearing in a ponytail.  After using the smoothing milk, I can forego a conditioner and just shampoo.  After towel drying my hair, I put this on my damp hair, and it combs out very easily with less breakage.  In hot humid weather, my ponytail does  not frizz and not one tangle, its amazing.  Because of this, my hair has grown very long because I am not constantly breaking my hair off getting the tangles out!!</li>
            <li> I recently was recommended this product by a friend @ work. She told me she used this as well as the[[ASIN:B0058CJV50 Garnier Fructis Style Sleek &amp; Shine Flat Iron Perfector Straightening Mist 24 Hour Finish, 6 Fluid Ounce]]. My friend told me about this product to try and help me tame my bout w/blow drying and flat ironing. She said it will cut down my time consumed by half and make my flat ironing my hair a breeze and no heat damage. I jumped at this because I am african american and I have thick coarse natural hair and I am 7 months post big chop. My hair has blossomed and I&#x27;d hate to have to battle damage after such a rewarding journey. But, i didn&#x27;t have to! I used this product first, blow dried, then applied my heat protectant [[ASIN:B000NRE6P0 Mizani Thermastrength Heat-Protecting Serum 5 oz.]] and brushed that through each section. This milk didn&#x27;t cause my hair any dryness or damage, my hair was soft and very moist w/o that wet feeling, but dry. After using the Mizani, to each section before flat ironing I used the sleek/shine perfector and each section was bouncy, shiny and smelled real good.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the washing out everything. I used [[ASIN:B000143K2A Mane &#x27;n Tail Deep Moisturizing Conditioner, 12 oz.]] ONLY. I applied this to my straight hair continuously until my curls came back and they all did. And then I shampoo&#x27;d twice w/[[ASIN:B0041LR0QG Mane &#x27;n Tail Shampoo 32 oz.]] and DC&#x27;d w/[[ASIN:B003JN4URY Mane N Tail Conditioner 32 oz]], rinsed and styled as normal! Hope this helps. Worth the Money. Paid only 3 bucks!</li>
            <li> made my hair greasy and oily looking... I am not really sure what this is supposed to do but I have learned that when it comes to my hair a little extra money is well spent on product</li>
            <li> Smoothes hair and adds shine.</li>
            <li> This product not only smells amazing but also makes my hair feel 10x soft!! After using this my hair feels less knotted, frizzy, and damaged! SO RECOMMEND  THIS!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair which of course loves to frizz anytime I don&#x27;t have the time to blow dry it. I bought this because it was on sale and I was running out of the Garnier Fructis leave-in conditioner. This does NOT replace the leave-in conditioner. It is good for replenishing frizz control during the day, but I will be using it IN ADDITION to the conditioner from now on.</li>
            <li> I like that this product tames my hair and shines it up.  I have thick, but fine, hair, so flyaway hair is always an issue, but not when I use this.  It creates a nice surface that does not create static when I use the dryer and I never have control issues.  I use it each time after towel drying and drying with the hair dryer a little first, then applying about a quarter size or a little more halfway out from the scalp and to the ends.  No rinse. I make sure never to run out.</li>
            <li> I have used this for YEARS, and I love it. Nothing else compares. Just a little dab through wet hair before you blow dry it, or a little after it&#x27;s dry, keeps my hair so smooth, shiny, and virtually frizz-free (except on exceptionally humid days, but you can&#x27;t fight Mother Nature! Nothing else would work on those days, either.) Of all the products I&#x27;ve tried, this is by far the best, and I think the scent is very pleasant, too. I get numerous compliments on how &amp;#34;smooth and shiny&amp;#34; my hair is, and it&#x27;s literally because of this product. It might help to know that my hair is long, straight, but exceptionally fine, and is very susceptible to that ugly, frumpy frizziness because of the fineness. I am so grateful to have found this, and I hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> great product but they support genocide. I can no longer buy garnier. BOYCOTT GARNIER they support genocide and apartheid in GAZA</li>
            <li> Love Garnier products they deliver what they promise.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair.  Feels more healthy</li>
            <li> This is a great product that wont leave gunk on your head. Your hair will stay in place and not feel hard at all.</li>
            <li> My hair ends up flat and greasy. This product might be good for some but not others.</li>
            <li> this is a great product</li>
            <li> I run this through my daughter&#x27;s crazy curly hair while it&#x27;s damp and it makes detangling so much easier. Helps the curls be more defined but not so frizzy and keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair in the Midwest humidity.  It doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy feeling either.</li>
