            <li> I have thin, fine hair and always struggle to give it body/texture.</li>
            <li> Oh that&#x27;s another thing, you only want to use a tiny bit at a time, so it&#x27;ll last for a long time!</li>
            <li> When I had short hair, this was the only product I used after my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> It does not take much and I usually mix it with another product.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently about 5 inches long at</li>
            <li> I dry my hair with a blow dryer on low.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or too dry and holds shape.</li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair and distribute what is probably about a level tablespoon of Tousle Whip evenly through my hair.</li>
            <li> After I blow dry my hair, I use this product at the bottom of my hair to seal in the curls.</li>
            <li> I apply a styling lotion to my wet hair, and blow it almost dry using a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Too bad Redken does not make it any more.</li>
            <li> I find Tousle Whip to be completely non-greasy, weightless and not in the least sticky.  </li>
            <li> My hair has always been straight and on the thin side.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair just enough lift and hold without feeling stiff or tacky.</li>
            <li> I just add a tiny amount around the roots after blow-drying, and then a few dabs at the ends of my hair, and voila!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first until I tried it.</li>
            <li> If I style it wet it does leave it a little crunchy but other</li>
            <li> Light-weight and does not weight down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> Was hoping for shiny less frizz.</li>
            <li> It might even be a little less than that amount.  </li>
            <li> This product feels a bit too heavy on my hair and weighs it down.</li>
            <li> away hatr needed to tame it down.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever dried my hair without it.</li>
            <li> not to stiff.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like this.</li>
            <li> I PUT A SMALL AMOUNT ON TIPS OF FINGERS</li>
            <li> I run a very small small amout over my hair</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I put a very small amout into my hair after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> so I think it was not a good notice for me.</li>
            <li> Too Expensive and hard to find</li>
            <li> With the wrong product, my hair will go one of two ways, either frizzy or limp.&lt;br /&gt;Redken</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Leaves it with a crazy shine.</li>
            <li> Was unhappy with the purchase, and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff like crazy.</li>
            <li> Made my hair sticky and very difficult to style with or without a hairdryer.</li>

            <li> Bummed that redken discontinued this stuff, but glad I was able to find it on amazon. Love the scent and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product. I have curly hair and tousle whip manages it perfectly! It does not take much and I usually mix it with another product.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like this. Only tried it on my dried , colored ends of my hair and disnt so much. Was hoping for shiny less frizz. I Love love the Redken 01 shine for my cokor treated damaged hair though!! Leaves it with a crazy shine. Soooo pretty!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy this product at the Hair Cuttery any longer. I&#x27;m so glad I can still get this product on Amazon. I love the way it works on my hair. It&#x27;s not greasy or too dry and holds shape.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I put a very small amout into my hair after I get out of the shower.,then I blowdry and style it.it just makes my hair look so much better.Gives it a little more texture,and aftet my hair is dry if there is any frizz I run a very small small amout over my hair ends and frizz is gone.</li>
            <li> Great light-weight styling product.  It gives nice texture without making your hair feel crispy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I think that this product is excellent and therefore have ordered another jar from Amazon.  My hair has a medium amount of natural curl and I want to encourage that in a natural-looking hairstyle.  A small amount of Tousle Whip encourages the curl and allows for just the right amount of separation and definition of the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I find Tousle Whip to be completely non-greasy, weightless and not in the least sticky.  I towel dry my hair and distribute what is probably about a level tablespoon of Tousle Whip evenly through my hair. It might even be a little less than that amount.  You&#x27;ll no doubt need more if your hair is long.  My hair is currently about 5 inches long at it&#x27;s longest point.  I dry my hair with a blow dryer on low.  I could also use a diffuser.  I encourage the curl with my hands as my hair is drying.  There is no time that I feel that I have too much product in my hair or that my hair isn&#x27;t touchable.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and always struggle to give it body/texture. I&#x27;m very picky about products because it is so easily weighed down. In fact, I dye my blonde hair with a lighter blonde, partly because by damaging it, it appears thicker. A hairstylist recommended this product to me last year and I LOVE it. I just add a tiny amount around the roots after blow-drying, and then a few dabs at the ends of my hair, and voila! That perfect textured look without the weight or greasiness. It looks totally natural, no crunch or anything. I went to the hair salon for more today and discovered they&#x27;d discontinued it. Oh no!! Thank goodness for Amazon! I just bought 3. Oh that&#x27;s another thing, you only want to use a tiny bit at a time, so it&#x27;ll last for a long time!</li>
            <li> use all their products and love them</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair. I like the smell and I like the way it gives my hair volume.  I am sure it will help my hair stand up to summer.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the easiest product to find, so I was happy to track it down here.  Great for styling but not looking overworked.....</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPMENT AND SUPER PACKAGING</li>
            <li> Not so great - it weighed down my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t make a difference except it gives my hair a slightly greasy look.</li>
            <li> he likes it a lot and won’t be with out it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just need to add more words, but he really likes it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!  Light-weight and does not weight down your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works really well with fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> WHY oh why is this product going off the market. It is the BEST!!</li>
            <li> An awesome peoduct! It is exactly what my fly- away hatr needed to tame it down. Plus it gives my hair a very healthy shine. I love this product!! I give this a 5 star rating!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have thick/wavy hair and I always have a problem with frizzy hair when I wear my hair natural.  This helps me be happy with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this because the Redken Electrowax 11 I used got discontinued. I was skeptical at first until I tried it. This product provides the perfect hold. Not too heavy or greasy. It&#x27;s light and keeps my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> was happy with the shipping, and delivered as promised. will order again; i love this product. so glad i could find it again. thanks so much....</li>
            <li> It seemed as though the product was not the same...felt different. Was unhappy with the purchase, and threw it away.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because my hairdresser used it and I really liked what it did for my hair. My hair finally haad body,</li>
            <li> Works very well give lively texture and body to hairs. Was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> this product was very runny. not at all like when i bought it from the salon. it also made my hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I have hair that&#x27;s curly, and at times, temperamental.  If I don&#x27;t use the right product, I see results that are heartbreaking (especially considering what I pay for my haircuts!)  With the wrong product, my hair will go one of two ways, either frizzy or limp.&lt;br /&gt;Redken&#x27;s Tousle Whip was recommended by a hairdresser, and It took only one application to know I&#x27;d found a product that sets my curly hair with just the right amount of hold.&lt;br /&gt;Styling Tips:  I apply a styling lotion to my wet hair, and blow it almost dry using a diffuser.  I then gently rub about a teaspoon of Tousle Whip between my palms, and lightly &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; my hair.  Like I said, it provides the perfect amount of hold for my curls -- they sit nicely in place all day, and still feel soft to the touch.  It&#x27;s heavenly.  (Just the right amount of scent too -- pleasant without being overpowering.)</li>
            <li> puts body in hair and leaves hair soft , not sticky. Good for short hair that you want to have body but still blow in the wind</li>
            <li> I use this stuff like crazy. Now it is discontinued. I have to stock up big time.</li>
            <li> Love this product....redkin is not making it anymore!  Grab what you can...</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Just a tiny little bit helps to calm any frizies and set the whispies in my haircut.  It sets the styling of my hair wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I just love this product!  My hair has always been straight and on the thin side. With aging, my hair is even thinner. I have tried many products over the years and this one is the best. It&#x27;s unfortunate it has been discontinued. It gives my hair just enough lift and hold without feeling stiff or tacky. After I wash and style my hair, I rub a dime size amount on my hands and into my hair. It gives it the best lift and &amp;#34;piece-e-ness&amp;#34; to the style. One jar will last many months. Get it while you can!</li>
            <li> I have received soooo many compliments on my hair since using this product. My friends notice something different and ask me what it is. I have very fine hair and this makes it so smooth and silky. I bought it on Amazon based on the reviews and they are right!! This product is amazing!! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Too bad Redken does not make it any more.</li>
            <li> If I style it wet it does leave it a little crunchy but other than that it makes my waves look great.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this product until I found it on the internet.  It gives my hair body without making my hair gummy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  AFTER BLOW DRYING MY HAIR I PUT A SMALL AMOUNT ON TIPS OF FINGERS&lt;br /&gt;AND RUN IT THROUGH MY HAIR.  IT TAMES THE FLYAWAYS AND KEEPS HAIR IN PLACE WITHOUT&lt;br /&gt;HAVING TO USE HAIR SPRAY.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Does not weigh hair down and it gives you just right texture</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores so I stocked up.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to play with your hair to get the spiral curls I wanted, but the out come was great.</li>
            <li> This product was okay.  I have very long hair so I think it was not a good notice for me.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with prompt delivery and the product.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> This is so good for my fine, thin hair!  It&#x27;s practically weightless but gives really good hold and root lift.</li>
            <li> i ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT! i HAVE FINE HAIR AND THIS GIVES HE MUCH MORE BODY! tHANKS FOR THE FAST SHIPMENT!</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Too Expensive and hard to find</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product and delivery time</li>
            <li> When I had short hair, this was the only product I used after my hair was dry. It smells incredible. It&#x27;s not crunchy or greasy. It has a TINY bit of sparkle, so it makes your hair look really healthy and bright. Perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing hair care product that was ever invented. I have no idea why Redken decided to discontinue it. After I blow dry my hair, I use this product at the bottom of my hair to seal in the curls. I don&#x27;t know how I ever dried my hair without it.</li>
            <li> Stuff works perfectly, and it never leaves hair looking greasy or stiff. Good product for the price. Wish the manufacturer hadn&#x27;t quit making it.</li>
            <li> This product feels a bit too heavy on my hair and weighs it down.</li>
            <li> not to stiff. Love the smell and it gives your hair some sparkle.</li>
            <li> I have finer hair, so this is perfect to add fullness.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over two years, and still love it!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this, but I really didn&#x27;t see too much body or texture from this product. I had better luck with Joico hair texturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.....have been using it for couple months now and it does exactly as described.  It was recommeded to me by my good friend and hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I have finally found a hair product I can&#x27;t live without. I love how my curls are not affected by the humidity. I use it showers and after straightening.</li>
            <li> Works great for me and even my 12 year old grandson love it. Awesome fragrance</li>
            <li> Made my hair sticky and very difficult to style with or without a hairdryer.Ordering it was a big mistake on my part.</li>
