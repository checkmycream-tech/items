            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth!</li>
            <li>It works best on deep cystic acne which I got when i stopped birth control</li>

            <li>My 2 favorite adjectives when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always touching my face.</li>
            <li>, the next day he woke up and his skin looked flawless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a good smell and stings a bit when you first put it on but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li>when i rinse it off, my skin feels super bright and clean.</li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t really beat a good product from a well-known brand that specializes in skincare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike other kaolin (clay) derived masks this one has the perfect consistency</li>
            <li>: This is the first mask that I&#x27;ve tried and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure the whole line is great</li>
            <li>Easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best face mask I have ever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it has a warm tingling feeling when you first apply it to your clean face, so I figure that it&#x27;s doing something</li>
            <li>It cleared up my skin and using it 2-3 nights a week has me pimple free.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been free of pimples and now it is.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product, I use it twice a week</li>
            <li>smooth clean and refreshed</li>
            <li>i love this mask so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not found anything that does such a good job at such a great price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my breakouts, although my skin felt fresh and looked nice after using it.</li>
            <li>After venturing off into products that are more natural and have safe ingredients.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li>I would see results almost immediately afterwards every night but to get real lasting results that make my face look good longer than 30 minutes after I take this off</li>
            <li>It is a mild formula.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing you can feel the detox working my skin is clear and looking fresh</li>
            <li>Our new favorite mask</li>
            <li>Personally, I think this mask has an amazing smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what has changed about my skin, but it responds better to natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and healthy, and makes it look healthier too.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to get off in the shower and leaves my skin super soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a fresh, citrusy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My skin was so smooth and very soft after the first time using it.</li>
            <li>We all know that Vitamin C is important for boosting the immune system but not many truly realize the amazing effects it has on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I washed off the mask for the first time my skin was almost glowing.  </li>
            <li>Bergamot (a lemon looking orange) is a fantastic (and natural) antiseptic, antibiotic and disinfectant.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of the cute packaging and low price tag.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I woke up to better skin the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also brightens your skin after using it a week or two consistently.</li>
            <li>This product worked for me when I used it initially and surely it will work for someone else.</li>
            <li>I got these for a couple of my girlfriends and myself, I really like it!</li>
            <li>I love this facial mask.</li>
            <li>You most definitely won&#x27;t be wasting your money with the this.</li>
            <li>10.0.6 does exactly what it says on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>When I washed it off it left my skin super soft and clean!</li>
            <li>and then I might use my Clean &#x27;n Clear spot treatment after toning and moisturizing, but I find I really don&#x27;t need to that often with this.</li>
            <li>It made me breakout even more, I&#x27;ve got dry skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really trust this as a cleansing mask.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting something this cheap to actually work</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and the oily parts are very oily.</li>
            <li>This really worked overnight for me.  </li>
            <li>I will say I don&#x27;t notice much of a change in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>my acne scars and pore have cleared so much</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really bug me</li>
            <li>Like I said it has really helped get rid of my nodule acne that popped up around my jawline and some of the newer scarring.  </li>
            <li>Shipping  was fast...</li>
            <li>This mask helps clear up my blackheads which I love since blackheads are a constant struggle for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great feeling knowing that every time I use DDP I&#x27;m going to see salon quality results for less than $6!</li>
            <li>I love it plain and simple and if smells lovely.</li>
            <li>does the job, I don&#x27;t have much more to say in the matter other than it does the job</li>
            <li>Since using this in combination with my other acne care, I&#x27;ve experienced way less breakouts.</li>
            <li>I considered giving DDP 4 stars instead of 5 but quickly changed my mind as, as I mentioned, I&#x27;ve only ever come across one product that literally sucked the blackheads out of my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try it because it was not only cheap, but also came highly recommended on a skincare/beauty review site I frequent called Makeupalley.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for as long as I remember and this stuff takes the redness away and you can see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>The ONLY mask that I&#x27;ve come across that acts as a true detox is the Aztec Healing Clay and while I LOVE that mask it can be quite messy as it&#x27;s of the mix yourself</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend this to anyone who has problem skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I use other Formula 10.0.6 products for every day use, but this mud mask really helps brighten my face and give it a really smooth complexion.</li>
            <li>and I got breakouts mostly on my chin area with a little bit on my forehead as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually using this right now as I type.  </li>
            <li>Slight tingling at first but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll leave your face sparkling and brand new.</li>
            <li>I was surprised but shouldn&#x27;t have been considering the high ratings it has received, but then again, seeing is believing.  </li>
            <li>I have normal/dry skin, with a moderate case of acne, and its very very touchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of mud masks over the years and this is the first one that I&#x27;ve actually seen results with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>When you first initially put the mask on it stings/</li>
            <li>Keeping this on your skin for a full 15-20 minutes can make your face tight and slightly itchy if you try to speak or laugh (as expected of most mud masks), but despite this, upon washing it off, my skin is not tight or stripped-feeling.</li>
            <li>This mask leaves my skin soooo soft and clear!</li>
            <li>I will say though, I didn&#x27;t buy this hoping it would clear my skin up.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really like this facial mask.</li>
            <li>This product has SOME natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This mask has done wonders at managing my oil production without ridding my face completely of the oil it needs to stay balanced.</li>
            <li>I guess this mask is designed  for people  with sensitive  skin or something.  </li>
            <li>First time using it, I could only wear it for about 1 minutes &amp; then it starting burning.</li>
            <li>That was my main objective with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was quite alarming at first</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clear up ONLY when I use a product if the product is natural.</li>
            <li>No other face mask I have tried using even came close to the results from this one.</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far, and I can tell a difference</li>
            <li>This mask takes the extra oil away but doesn&#x27;t completely strip my skin of moisture like some do.</li>
            <li>It does take some extra elbow grease to rinse it off completely...</li>
            <li>I was nervous to try this brand because my face is usually pretty sensitive but after a few times of using the mask I could see results.</li>
            <li>All of the properties listed above are what one should want in a detox mask and lucky for us, Formula 10.0.6 has packaged it in a little orange tube for the world to benefit from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and then I might use my Clean &#x27;n Clear spot treatment after toning and moisturizing, but I find I really don&#x27;t need to that often with this.</li>
            <li> It made me breakout even more, I&#x27;ve got dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really trust this as a cleansing mask.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting something this cheap to actually work</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and the oily parts are very oily.</li>
            <li> This really worked overnight for me.  </li>
            <li> I will say I don&#x27;t notice much of a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> my acne scars and pore have cleared so much</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really bug me</li>
            <li> Like I said it has really helped get rid of my nodule acne that popped up around my jawline and some of the newer scarring.  </li>
            <li> Shipping  was fast...</li>
            <li> This mask helps clear up my blackheads which I love since blackheads are a constant struggle for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great feeling knowing that every time I use DDP I&#x27;m going to see salon quality results for less than $6!</li>
            <li> I love it plain and simple and if smells lovely.</li>
            <li> does the job, I don&#x27;t have much more to say in the matter other than it does the job</li>
            <li> Since using this in combination with my other acne care, I&#x27;ve experienced way less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I considered giving DDP 4 stars instead of 5 but quickly changed my mind as, as I mentioned, I&#x27;ve only ever come across one product that literally sucked the blackheads out of my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it because it was not only cheap, but also came highly recommended on a skincare/beauty review site I frequent called Makeupalley.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for as long as I remember and this stuff takes the redness away and you can see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> The ONLY mask that I&#x27;ve come across that acts as a true detox is the Aztec Healing Clay and while I LOVE that mask it can be quite messy as it&#x27;s of the mix yourself</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend this to anyone who has problem skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I use other Formula 10.0.6 products for every day use, but this mud mask really helps brighten my face and give it a really smooth complexion.</li>
            <li> and I got breakouts mostly on my chin area with a little bit on my forehead as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using this right now as I type.  </li>
            <li> Slight tingling at first but goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll leave your face sparkling and brand new.</li>
            <li> I was surprised but shouldn&#x27;t have been considering the high ratings it has received, but then again, seeing is believing.  </li>
            <li> I have normal/dry skin, with a moderate case of acne, and its very very touchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of mud masks over the years and this is the first one that I&#x27;ve actually seen results with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive, and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> When you first initially put the mask on it stings/</li>
            <li> Keeping this on your skin for a full 15-20 minutes can make your face tight and slightly itchy if you try to speak or laugh (as expected of most mud masks), but despite this, upon washing it off, my skin is not tight or stripped-feeling.</li>
            <li> This mask leaves my skin soooo soft and clear!</li>
            <li> I will say though, I didn&#x27;t buy this hoping it would clear my skin up.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really like this facial mask.</li>
            <li> This product has SOME natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This mask has done wonders at managing my oil production without ridding my face completely of the oil it needs to stay balanced.</li>
            <li> I guess this mask is designed  for people  with sensitive  skin or something.  </li>
            <li> First time using it, I could only wear it for about 1 minutes &amp; then it starting burning.</li>
            <li> That was my main objective with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was quite alarming at first</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear up ONLY when I use a product if the product is natural.</li>
            <li> No other face mask I have tried using even came close to the results from this one.</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far, and I can tell a difference</li>
            <li> This mask takes the extra oil away but doesn&#x27;t completely strip my skin of moisture like some do.</li>
            <li> It does take some extra elbow grease to rinse it off completely...</li>
            <li> I was nervous to try this brand because my face is usually pretty sensitive but after a few times of using the mask I could see results.</li>
            <li> All of the properties listed above are what one should want in a detox mask and lucky for us, Formula 10.0.6 has packaged it in a little orange tube for the world to benefit from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do plan on going out and purchasing something specifically to even skin tone because I have had uneven tone ever since high school when I started breaking out</li>
            <li> short (after, of course, the long version)</li>
            <li> I purchased Deep Down Detox after seeing that despite its low cost it yielded 4-5 stars across the board on numerous and reliable beauty websites.  </li>
            <li> Definitely work the couple of dollars I spent on it.</li>
            <li> Texture is odd, but I like the mask overall.</li>
            <li> It actually worked as in it cleansed away those stubborn black head on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I grabbed this at a local Ulta.</li>
            <li> It was not really what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I occasionally suffer from hormonal breakouts collecting groupings of small pimples on my forehead, chin and jawline.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using it every other day.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other products yet</li>
            <li> It aids in lightening dark spots, healing acne scars, preventing pimples and blackheads, evening out skin tone and controlling oil production.  </li>
            <li> Down</li>
            <li> Apply for about 20 minutes twice a week and you&#x27;ll notice brighter, less oily, healthier-looking skin.</li>
            <li> It tingles a little</li>
            <li> so I think some scarring is a little deeper than this mask can get.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I had expected to see at least some improvement</li>
            <li> Everything I&#x27;ve tried is either too severe or not strong at all.</li>
            <li> And unlike other clay masks, the instructions state to apply a thin layer compared to the typical thick</li>
            <li> I happened across this mask in a store and have been buying it in multiples for the past 5</li>

            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve purchased a Clarisonic which has helped a lot with my acne</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s thick without being overly so.  </li>
            <li> I applied the semi thick mask, I experience tingling for about 10 minutes.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This works great.  It does have a slight tingle, but I was having bad acne on my jaw-line/neck area, and I could tell a difference in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> Texture is odd, but I like the mask overall. It is a mild formula. This is the only product I have bought from this line, but after this I plan on trying another.</li>
            <li> I purchased Deep Down Detox after seeing that despite its low cost it yielded 4-5 stars across the board on numerous and reliable beauty websites.  After just 2 uses I knew why.  It works and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other kaolin (clay) derived masks this one has the perfect consistency - it&#x27;s thick without being overly so.  And unlike other clay masks, the instructions state to apply a thin layer compared to the typical thick, a simple change that makes washing it off a breeze.  Some have reported tingling upon application that lasts anywhere from seconds to the recommended 15-30 minutes of wearing time; I am the oddball out here as I didn&#x27;t experience any tingling whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I washed off the mask for the first time my skin was almost glowing.  I was surprised but shouldn&#x27;t have been considering the high ratings it has received, but then again, seeing is believing.  I occasionally suffer from hormonal breakouts collecting groupings of small pimples on my forehead, chin and jawline.  The morning after initial use those had diminished in size.  After the second use (2 nights later) they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have not seen a difference in my blackheads.  With a name like \\&quot;Deep Down Detox\\&quot; I had expected to see at least some improvement (I am on my 2nd tube of this mask) but instead I saw none.  The ONLY mask that I&#x27;ve come across that acts as a true detox is the Aztec Healing Clay and while I LOVE that mask it can be quite messy as it&#x27;s of the mix yourself variety.  I considered giving DDP 4 stars instead of 5 but quickly changed my mind as, as I mentioned, I&#x27;ve only ever come across one product that literally sucked the blackheads out of my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the ingredients and the stars of this mask: orange oil and bergamot.  We all know that Vitamin C is important for boosting the immune system but not many truly realize the amazing effects it has on the skin.  Whether consuming an actual orange or using an orange oiltopically, the Vitamin C contained within aids in smoothing skin, restoring collagen, exfoliating (remember, it&#x27;s an acid), reducing wrinkles and cleansing pores.  Bergamot (a lemon looking orange) is a fantastic (and natural) antiseptic, antibiotic and disinfectant.  It kills off harmful bacteria without stripping the skin.  It aids in lightening dark spots, healing acne scars, preventing pimples and blackheads, evening out skin tone and controlling oil production.  All of the properties listed above are what one should want in a detox mask and lucky for us, Formula 10.0.6 has packaged it in a little orange tube for the world to benefit from!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short (after, of course, the long version): this mask should be in everyone&#x27;s household and especially for those with acne, combination, oily skin.  It&#x27;s such a great feeling knowing that every time I use DDP I&#x27;m going to see salon quality results for less than $6!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the cute packaging and low price tag. I used it as soon as I got home and the strong, sickly scent literally made me nauseous and feel sick for 5+ hours after removing this mask. It also began to burn my face! I washed it off almost immediately after putting it on and returned it the next day. I have sensitive skin but I&#x27;ve never had an experience like this. I definitely WOULD NOT recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This mask helps clear up my blackheads which I love since blackheads are a constant struggle for me. It has a very pleasant smell as well.</li>
            <li> does the job, I don&#x27;t have much more to say in the matter other than it does the job and I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it up to 3x a week and it has worked wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really trust this as a cleansing mask. It didn&#x27;t do much for my breakouts, although my skin felt fresh and looked nice after using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this facial mask. I have skin problems (eczema) and it did not break me out.  I only used it once so far, and I can tell a difference&lt;br /&gt;already.  I will use it again later this month. I will buy this mask again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for oily/acne-prone skin. Apply for about 20 minutes twice a week and you&#x27;ll notice brighter, less oily, healthier-looking skin. I have also used it for spot treatment for sudden acne and it has definitely worked.</li>
            <li> Perfect mask for you.  Promise.  It&#x27;ll leave your face sparkling and brand new.</li>
            <li> This mask did wonders for my skin! I have normal/dry skin, with a moderate case of acne, and its very very touchy. Probably from years of slathering on make up and not washing it off at night. Everything I&#x27;ve tried is either too severe or not strong at all. This mask definitley clears up my zits and my skin feels softer. I recommend using it every other day.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing you can feel the detox working my skin is clear and looking fresh I use this every other day after my workout.</li>
            <li> 2 thumbs up. It actually worked as in it cleansed away those stubborn black head on my nose and chin. I love it plain and simple and if smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I was nervous to try this brand because my face is usually pretty sensitive but after a few times of using the mask I could see results. My skin was so smooth and very soft after the first time using it. It has reduced breakouts and I&#x27;m beginning to notice my acne scars fading. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Got it as a gift 2 years ago &amp; have been using it ever since.  Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Awful. It burns while on my face. First time using it, I could only wear it for about 1 minutes &amp; then it starting burning.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at ulta a few weeks ago and I am obsessed. I&#x27;ve tried tons of mud masks over the years and this is the first one that I&#x27;ve actually seen results with. The first time I used it I woke up to better skin the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a good smell and stings a bit when you first put it on but nothing unbearable. Easy to wash off. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling dry and dirty.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting something this cheap to actually work but it does! I have combination skin and the oily parts are very oily. This mask takes the extra oil away but doesn&#x27;t completely strip my skin of moisture like some do. I also had some pesky acne and the next day it was almost gone. I&#x27;ll keep buying this.</li>
            <li> My face burned when I put it on for about a minute or so but then went away. When I washed it off it left my skin super soft and clean!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. It&#x27;s a must for those who want to reduce redness, brighten skin, and tighten pores. I use it before the weekend and never fail to get compliments on how great my skin looks. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I was delighted to discover that this product was still available.  I have used since the 1960s!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Its perfect for blemished skin and acne prone skin. It is refreshing and moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and can&#x27;t say I see any noticeable difference, however, my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> Initial review: This is the first mask that I&#x27;ve tried and I LOVE IT! This really worked overnight for me.  It cleared up my skin and using it 2-3 nights a week has me pimple free. Not a bump in sight. It has a pleasant smell and it leaves your skin so smooth. My skin has never been free of pimples and now it is. If I don&#x27;t use this for a couple of days, they will start to show back up because the pores are clogging back up. Nothing 10.0.6 can&#x27;t handle. It also brightens your skin after using it a week or two consistently. I will highly recommend this to anyone who has problem skin. I will forever use this and have already ordered me another one. Finally, something that works!!! Good stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review (May 2016): After venturing off into products that are more natural and have safe ingredients. I no longer use this product. This product has SOME natural ingredients. It has A LOT of ingredients that my skin doesn&#x27;t need. I don&#x27;t know what has changed about my skin, but it responds better to natural ingredients. My face stays clearer longer as well. It doesn&#x27;t clear up ONLY when I use a product if the product is natural. This product worked for me when I used it initially and surely it will work for someone else. I am just more cautious of what I put on my skin. I have changed my rating from 5 stars to 4.</li>
            <li> It really is as good as everyone says it is. I&#x27;ve noticed it has a warm tingling feeling when you first apply it to your clean face, so I figure that it&#x27;s doing something right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product now for about 4 weeks, 2-3 times each week. I use other Formula 10.0.6 products for every day use, but this mud mask really helps brighten my face and give it a really smooth complexion. Especially with my skin type (combination).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this. For the price, you can&#x27;t really beat a good product from a well-known brand that specializes in skincare.</li>
            <li> I got these for a couple of my girlfriends and myself, I really like it! Makes my skin feel smooth!</li>
            <li> I have used this product about 3 times since I got it. I will say I don&#x27;t notice much of a change in my skin. I have oily skin and I got breakouts mostly on my chin area with a little bit on my forehead as well. I can&#x27;t say I noticed my skin getting any clearer. But, it does feel really good after you take it off. It cools your face off and leaves a nice menthol feelings without it stinging your skin at all. I will say though, I didn&#x27;t buy this hoping it would clear my skin up. I just like to use masks late at night when I&#x27;m trying to unwind from the day to get a cheap spa experience lol. It&#x27;s not expensive, and I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great mask.  Slight tingling at first but goes away quickly. Great at reducing oil and blemishes  Great price !!  Our new favorite mask</li>
            <li> i love this mask so much! i always use it after the shower. when i rinse it off, my skin feels super bright and clean. it helps my oily face from being too oily. my aunt is in her 40s and she also uses this! this works wonders .</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves my skin soft</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It makes my skin feel soft and healthy, and makes it look healthier too. Since using this in combination with my other acne care, I&#x27;ve experienced way less breakouts. And I like the orangy smell!</li>
            <li> I love this facial mask. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for as long as I remember and this stuff takes the redness away and you can see a significant difference. The smell is also really good.</li>
            <li> Nice mask for a nice price.  I use several times a week and it keeps in oil in control.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It works best on deep cystic acne which I got when i stopped birth control</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a pharmacy in  Vancouver and it was perfection for me skin my acne scars and pore have cleared so much</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best face mask I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seborrheic dermatitis, and part of this condition causes a lot of oil to be produced on the face. It&#x27;s only in the last year of my life I&#x27;ve ever even had an acne or oily skin problems and I turn 29 next week. I can use face wash and a scrub and still would get oil coming off on blotting paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this product? AMAZING. It gets all of the oil out. No other face mask I have tried using even came close to the results from this one. If you have oily skin, you MUST try this product!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product, I use it twice a week and it leaves me skin feelin smooth clean and refreshed</li>
            <li> I love this product! If you already have good skin i recommend using this 1-2 times per week! I bought 5!!!!</li>
            <li> It was not really what I was expecting. My friends thought it was kind of itchy but I did not think it was bad</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face mask. It tingles a little but I like that bec then I know it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I would say the smell is the best part. I use this about twice a week and it works great. It is super easy to get off in the shower and leaves my skin super soft and moisturized. I orginally bought this to get rid of my acne around my chin and the &amp;#34;triangle&amp;#34;. I wouldn&#x27;t say it takes care of the acne as well as I would have hoped, but it feels like it removes the excess oil and dirt from my face. I would make sure to use a moisturizer afterwards to not overdry your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask it works great, I can see the difference and in my pores which where big now their small. And it smells greatb</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the acne skin care classification scare you away if you&#x27;re over 30.  My middle-aged skin is still congested! I happened across this mask in a store and have been buying it in multiples for the past 5+ years whenever I find a deal. I&#x27;ve not found anything that does such a good job at such a great price.</li>
            <li> glowing. i love this product.</li>
            <li> Like a previous reviewer, I grabbed this at a local Ulta. I wanted to try it because it was not only cheap, but also came highly recommended on a skincare/beauty review site I frequent called Makeupalley.  Personally, I think this mask has an amazing smell. I really love it. I have used masks that smell dreadful, and it really makes it difficult to keep them on for the allotted time, but this is just great. It&#x27;s a bit of a fresh, citrusy fragrance.  Keeping this on your skin for a full 15-20 minutes can make your face tight and slightly itchy if you try to speak or laugh (as expected of most mud masks), but despite this, upon washing it off, my skin is not tight or stripped-feeling. This mask has done wonders at managing my oil production without ridding my face completely of the oil it needs to stay balanced. It does take a bit of an effort to get off, but I recommend being patient and not to scrub at it, which can be rough on sensitive skin. I like to put this on 15-20 minutes before I jump in the shower, that way it&#x27;s a breeze to wash off!  This, coupled with my exfoliator on a once-a-week basis has done wonders at managing my acne. Every now and then I might use my Clean &#x27;n Clear spot treatment after toning and moisturizing, but I find I really don&#x27;t need to that often with this.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great for the skin and reasonable. You most definitely won&#x27;t be wasting your money with the this. I haven&#x27;t tried the other products yet but I&#x27;m pretty sure the whole line is great</li>
            <li> great mask for anyone</li>
            <li> My 2 favorite adjectives when it comes to beauty products. No one likes spending lots of money on a product and it isnt effective. I was searching for an affordable mask to try because I neglect my skin. I admit it...I wear makeup but sometimes, I forget to wash it off at night...I&#x27;m always touching my face. So I decided to pamper my skin and Formula 10.0.6 does exactly what it says on the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Once I applied the semi thick mask, I experience tingling for about 10 minutes. It was quite alarming at first but, it started to go away after awhile. I wear the mask for approx 20 min and I rinse it off. It does take some extra elbow grease to rinse it off completely... But, be patient and dont scrub. This mask leaves my skin soooo soft and clear! Definitely work the couple of dollars I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually using this right now as I type.  I picked this up a while ago but never used it religiously, only once or twice since I purchased it.  Lately I&#x27;ve purchased a Clarisonic which has helped a lot with my acne but I still have problems with big painful nodule like acne popping up around my jawline.  I decided to try using a mask with my regular nightly ritual.  Every night I Clarisonic with Philosophy face wash and moisturize with Clinique moisturizer...I still managed to get nodules and then to make things worse I would pick at them and it would leave scarring.  Then this mask came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:  After using this mask every night between washing and moisturizing I definitely see a difference in both my cystic like acne on my jawline and also my scarring.  I would see results almost immediately afterwards every night but to get real lasting results that make my face look good longer than 30 minutes after I take this off it&#x27;s been about a week of using it every night.  It smells nice and works!  I will say that even though it has helped with my scarring I do plan on going out and purchasing something specifically to even skin tone because I have had uneven tone ever since high school when I started breaking out so I think some scarring is a little deeper than this mask can get.  I&#x27;m very happy it helped with my acne on my jawline though!  That was my main objective with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:  This doesn&#x27;t really bug me but I can see where some people may not like it.  When you first initially put the mask on it stings/burns/tingles for a minute or two.  It&#x27;s nothing you can&#x27;t handle but it is somewhat uncomfortable.  It only lasts a short time though and not the entire time the mask is on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I would recommend this if you don&#x27;t mind the burning at the beginning.  Like I said it has really helped get rid of my nodule acne that popped up around my jawline and some of the newer scarring.  Definitely will have to use it religiously for a while though.  I hope this helps!  Happy masking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was going to try that Aztec mud mask that is so popular on here and I probably will if this ever stops working.  However, this is nice because you don&#x27;&#x27;t need to mix it up with anything...just squeeze it out of the bottle and rub it on!</li>
            <li> It made me breakout even more, I&#x27;ve got dry skin and when I try to moisturize I break out, I as hoping this would keep my skin moisturized and help the breakouts but it made it worse. I had my fiance do it with me and he has oily skin, the next day he woke up and his skin looked flawless. Not so great for me, but it worked for him.</li>
            <li> I guess this mask is designed  for people  with sensitive  skin or something.  It is NOT a sea mud mask. It didn&#x27;t  work for me.  Shipping  was fast... But then agsin i payed  for 2 day  shipping. I used it 2x and that was it</li>
