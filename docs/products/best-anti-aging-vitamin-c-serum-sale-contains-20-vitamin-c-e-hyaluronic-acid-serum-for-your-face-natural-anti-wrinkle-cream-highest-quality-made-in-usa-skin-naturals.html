            <li>Not my favorite serum.  </li>
            <li>I have tried others that worked much better than this one.  </li>
            <li>This serum is okay.</li>
            <li>which is super nice and</li>
            <li>Its consistency makes it easy to apply and my skin does not feel oily after use.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use good facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So excited that I got the  anti aging vitamin c serum for free so far so good,  I do like it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>I really got it for free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for only 3 days and my skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li>Most recently I have read up on the powers of Vitamin C in helping to tighten skin and lessen the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Personally I have found it better to apply and leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li>This product was my most recent purchase of a HLA.</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks, this 53 Year old women, a Nature Photographer, who works &amp; plays outdoor, can honestly say it works!</li>
            <li>I have already ordered the Pure Swiss again and will keep this in case I run out and don&#x27;t have another product on hand.</li>
            <li>Maybe after a few more uses!</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>My skin took very well to it and after two weeks of use that is still the case.</li>
            <li>The consistency of the other products was much more liquid.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quick and after only one application I see results</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, easy to use (simply add it into your regular eating routine) &amp; you&#x27;ll notice a difference within around a month or so before a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>Reading the product directions one of the 1st things I read was to keep it in a cool dry place</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter, healthier, and the wrinkles are becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not sure ,its seems ok</li>
            <li>I have used Oz Naturals and 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss (when I purchased it originally it was in a blue bottle and just Pure Swiss) in the past.</li>
            <li>I had noticed visible stretch marks on my face near my lower cheeks &amp; near my mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stick to a daily hygiene routine, stick to a daily meal routine &amp; of course, stick to a daily exercise routine, with the excepts for of adding this supplement &amp; you&#x27;ll notice a younger fresh face every morning in the mirror!</li>
            <li>In two week I could see major improvement.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my face, nor is it so oily that it clogs my pores.</li>
            <li>fast shipping to Alaska, my skin is younger looking and this does NOT make me break out like other products.  </li>
            <li>Could be better if not in such a bad container,  it&#x27;s glad and at end of use you waste a lot of serum because it&#x27;s all around the edges.</li>

            <li> Purchased it for my wife, here is what she says: “This product is affordable and a very good fit for my combination skin. It does not dry out my face, nor is it so oily that it clogs my pores. Very happy with the purchase.&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Could be better if not in such a bad container,  it&#x27;s glad and at end of use you waste a lot of serum because it&#x27;s all around the edges.</li>

            <li> The package was very big and it was open (torn) but was glade that the item was still in the package.  So excited that I got the  anti aging vitamin c serum for free so far so good,  I do like it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I hate my forehead wrinkles, and so have been trying out different “miracle” solutions for years. Most recently I have read up on the powers of Vitamin C in helping to tighten skin and lessen the appearance of wrinkles. I am so glad that I stumbled on this Skin Naturals serum. This serum works! I noticed my skin is getting smoother and brighter. Love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely, smooth on the skin with a great feel and nice glow. Love it! It&#x27;s arrival was preceded by an email with recommended instructions for best how to apply and use in conjunction with your moistuizer.</li>
            <li> I like it becuse my skin is getting ligter &amp; I will give to my sister. I will buy again...</li>
            <li> This product works well! I really got it for free which is super nice and my face is clear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I got to sample this!</li>
            <li> Have used it for a couple of weeks, and already notice a difference in the texture of my skin, it appears to be brighter also.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this serum, try it, I think you&#x27;ll be satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, delivery and packaging was excellent.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like this product!  I&#x27;m having problems with the dropper, but I like the product.  Works nice with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Dropper was not work.  No changed.  I stop using it.  Do not buy.  Can in a plastic bag with hard to read directions.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It really works.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure ,its seems ok but i paid extra for 2 day shipping (mistake) it came by UPS &amp; when it arrived the package was dirty &amp; extremely HOT! Reading the product directions one of the 1st things I read was to keep it in a cool dry place so I don&#x27;t know if the product was damaged or just doesn&#x27;t work &amp; produce the results it claims</li>
            <li> While the high viscosity of the material makes me feel moisturized, its so hard to even get it to aspirate into the tube/tip. Not sure yet if I will be re-purchasing it.</li>
            <li> LOVE the way this makes my skin feel!  fast shipping to Alaska, my skin is younger looking and this does NOT make me break out like other products.  Also there is no strong oder</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Feels really good on face.Will definitively buy again.</li>
            <li> I am always hesitant when buying things online, and have got to say that this vitamin c serum was a delightful surprise! Its consistency makes it easy to apply and my skin does not feel oily after use. Price is always an issue for me, but in this case it was money well spent. I do not find myself needing a great deal of the serum, so my need to purchase more of the product is prolonged! In two week I could see major improvement. Personally I have found it better to apply and leave it on overnight. In the morning my skin feels refreshed, and my foundation seems to hold better. Make sure to use good facial moisturizer. I will keep using this serum.</li>
            <li> it was what was promissed, i cant use it though, it contains aloe vera, so i will give it to my daughter to try</li>
            <li> Using it as suggestion, rated with &amp;#34;lean &amp; regular healthy&amp;#34; daily meals, drinking lots of water, please try adding this supplement into your diet:  Hyaluronic Acid &amp;#34;taken orally as suggestion.&amp;#34; I bet you&#x27;ll be smiling just like I&#x27;m smiling as I write this review. Within a few weeks, this 53 Year old women, a Nature Photographer, who works &amp; plays outdoor, can honestly say it works! Non-greasy, easy to use (simply add it into your regular eating routine) &amp; you&#x27;ll notice a difference within around a month or so before a noticeable difference. In my experience I&#x27;ve noticed less &amp; less of the patchwork of wrinkles around each eye.&lt;br /&gt;I have recently lost around 100 lbs-happy to see the lbs go, be sad I had noticed visible stretch marks on my face near my lower cheeks &amp; near my mouth. Yup, you guessed it, those are fading too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a nutritionist or doctor. I am outside daily, often in harsh climates not kind to my face, but this supplement has helped my skin appear less wrinkled &amp; instead fresh &amp; younger.&lt;br /&gt;Stick to a daily hygiene routine, stick to a daily meal routine &amp; of course, stick to a daily exercise routine, with the excepts for of adding this supplement &amp; you&#x27;ll notice a younger fresh face every morning in the mirror!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so buying anything with a strong chemical base is out of the question. The Skin Naturals serum is an AMAZING alternative to a lot of the department store brands and am so glad that I tried it!!! My skin took very well to it and after two weeks of use that is still the case. My skin feels and looks healthier, and I have seen a smoothing effect on my wrinkles, especially those under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and I like it.</li>
            <li> I can see an immediate difference in my skin when I use this product. I tried a different Vitamin C serum and did not get the same results. My skin looks brighter, healthier, and the wrinkles are becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve been using it for more than a week now and I can already tell the difference in my face. I love what I see in the mirror. I will order more for my maintenance beauty regimen. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite serum.  I have tried others that worked much better than this one.  I gave a bottle to my daughter who is under 30 and she loved it.  I am over 50 and did not.  It was advertised for over 40.  The consistency is very thick.  It is hard to get the rest out of the bottle when you reach the bottom.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Has a dropper that won&#x27;t pick up product since product is a gel.</li>
            <li> The product is great. Absorbs quick and after only one application I see results</li>
            <li> This serum is okay. I haven&#x27;t seen any results what so ever yet! Maybe after a few more uses! It also leaves a sticky feeling on your fingers after applying.</li>
            <li> It feels soft, it is a little watery</li>
            <li> I have used Oz Naturals and 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss (when I purchased it originally it was in a blue bottle and just Pure Swiss) in the past. They were good and did the job. This product was my most recent purchase of a HLA. Let me just say I hate it. It is like a gel. They  package it in a dropper type bottle and I&#x27;m not sure why. It&#x27;s just a big glob. The consistency of the other products was much more liquid. I have to admit I tried this product because of the ad. It was marketed toward women over 40, which I am. I have already ordered the Pure Swiss again and will keep this in case I run out and don&#x27;t have another product on hand. I would return it but have used for 3 days and will continue until I get the other product.</li>
