            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so clean and refreshing!</li>
            <li>I went to the store and bought a suitable sprayer bottle to use, and it works just fine with the product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very clean and does not conflict with parfume or cologne.</li>
            <li>I will always use this wonderful stuff so long as I can get it</li>
            <li>Great on newly washed hair.</li>
            <li>Excellent for those who have dry scalp scaling.</li>
            <li>Love the light breeze fragrance.</li>

            <li>Light spraying on face is so refreshing, even on the beach or after getting off a plane..  </li>
            <li>Easy to spray on and leave in .</li>
            <li>The smell was so strong I had to give it away.  </li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this product keeps my curls soft and frizz free!!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use - fine spray.  </li>
            <li>It feels cool and refreshing in the AZ heat.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, color-processed hair and my stylist here in NYC recommended this product.</li>
            <li>Works great as a body moisturizer in the summer, too, but too light to stand alone in the harsher/dryer winters as a sole body moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is great for getting your moisturizer to actually go in your skin cells.  </li>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this magical potion since the early 90&#x27;s and now use it on my own kiddos&#x27; tangly tresses.  </li>
            <li>refreshing clean scent...always brings back good memories...</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh reminds me of the beach!</li>
            <li>No perfume, just a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Love the product and it is also good to use on dry skin.</li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>First used it many years ago.</li>
            <li>Anyway, first off, most safety seals are foil under the cap and wouldn&#x27;t show on a picture anyway</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s changed, but I hope the company can find the original formula...</li>
            <li>Great product...spray it on your hair to hydrate, use it as a skin refresher, clean a minor wound.</li>
            <li>and then put it into a regular 12oz container, more cost effective.</li>
            <li>loved the smell at first,  quickly became too much and rarely use the product.</li>
            <li>I keep a small spray bottle in my purse most of the time to add moisture to my skin anywhere, and it has a very mild &amp; pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is a tried and true product for our hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much I sent my friends in Ca.</li>
            <li>Great for hair and body as a light moisturizer and does not weigh hair down!</li>
            <li>It is a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>They sent it quickly and it arrived in one piece.</li>
            <li>a quick spritz over the face helps set makeup.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>I found it at my local beauty supply store recently, its good to know I can  order it here on amazon if I ever need too!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and smelling very clean.</li>
            <li>Instead, it is balanced, delivering the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>if I did use it right after tanning, the &#x27;itchiness&#x27; did not occur.  </li>
            <li>it was right side up</li>
            <li>I would have preferred the description to be more clear, but all turned out well, and I highly recommend this seller.  </li>
            <li>Prevents the fine wrinkles that come from postmenopausal hot flashes, heat breaks down collagen and salty sweat drys, this product counteracts these symptoms, love it.</li>
            <li>I have not found a better skin moisturizing spray--and I have looked extensively.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years, although I have only been able to buy it at a beauty store in Castro Valley.  </li>
            <li>and I always have a bottle of it with me when Im in hot climates.</li>
            <li>The scent, the crisp feeling, and all that.</li>
            <li>We were glad to find it here in Amazon... and in a bigger size!</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my hair stylist...</li>
            <li>-until now...great for rehydrating skin in hot weather ...</li>
            <li>Leaves hair and skin silky without heavy byproducts.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good for the amount.</li>
            <li>It is also good if you get a little too much sun on your skin.</li>
            <li>You can tell its working and its very soothing, I suggest anyone try this it makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li>Sea Plasma was recommended and it certainly did help the dryness and discoloration.  </li>
            <li>At first, the smell took me a while to get into, but all of the other clients at the salon love the aroma.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Red Carpet Company (the ones I bought mine from, the others are probably just fine)</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference in how my hair feels and looks.  </li>
            <li>zed that since my ordering depends so much upon what others write and review (and</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Light, fresh and doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It not only controls  the static, it also allows my hair volume that it loses when I put most conditioners on it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Sea Plasma.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I spray this onto my hair while wet either before blow-drying or air-drying, and it provides a light, non-greasy moisture that keeps my ends from feeling like straw.</li>
            <li>Most conditioners leave my hair too limp, but this does not.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very fine hair, and in the winter it become full of static electricity and drives me crazy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve moved around quite a lot, and it can be tricky to find this product locally, but now that I&#x27;ve started buying it from amazon.com, the price is cheaper and the product comes right to my door.</li>
            <li>I use it several times a day, I use it on my face before and after makeup, on my hair right out of the shower and as a conditioning treatment before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>and they E-mailed back right away</li>
            <li>He had grayed over these many years and the Sea Plasma has helped to tame his hair and keep it manageable.</li>
            <li>BRAND NEW</li>
            <li>and I live in AZ ...</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t tell me its fine there isn&#x27;t one when I DONT KNOW if they watered it down or added something to it or let it spoil in their non-airconditioned garage!?!&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>Both my significant other</li>
            <li>I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t fell that it adds very much moisture on its own.</li>
            <li>We live in Arizona, dry, hot climate, so this really helps put moisture back into the skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy on your hair or skin.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re odor sensitive at all I&#x27;d stay clear.</li>
            <li>Except Twinlabs seems NATURAL with</li>
            <li>Not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate so this product is appreciated.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for my skin instead of the na-pca spray I usually use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years to wet my hair and make it a little more manageable.</li>
            <li>Sea Plasma is a good product but difficult to find in local stores</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I love this product !</li>
            <li>This is the time of year that you get busy doing outside work...and (I forgot to put on sunscreen) sunburn happens.</li>
            <li>the only thing that makes my hair soft like a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Item arrived in a few days and was exactly as described.  </li>

            <li> This seaplasma was introduced to me years ago when I had gotten a sunburn, and it is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> but you get WAY more and for cheaper so its all good.</li>
            <li> The nice thing about it is that you dont have to protect your face when you spray it on your hair.</li>

            <li> Really great stuff and much more economical than buying the spray bottle in the store.</li>
            <li> but the cool spray feels good.</li>
            <li> I spray on right after a shower and the comb goes right through my hair and is a perfect prep for styling product.</li>

            <li> This was a product I used to love in the 1980s.</li>
            <li> Needs to be more concentrated - too watery.</li>

            <li> Of course many women use a leave-in product, and I like it on my hair, but my husband swears by the product.</li>
            <li> I get a better deal.  </li>
            <li> totally love it ...</li>
            <li> I love Sea Plasma.  </li>

            <li> I love this stuff, I used it years ago and was elated that I found it once again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years and can never find it in stores anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so clean and refreshing!</li>
            <li> I went to the store and bought a suitable sprayer bottle to use, and it works just fine with the product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very clean and does not conflict with parfume or cologne.</li>
            <li> I will always use this wonderful stuff so long as I can get it</li>
            <li> Great on newly washed hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent for those who have dry scalp scaling.</li>
            <li> Love the light breeze fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how light it is.</li>
            <li> Light spraying on face is so refreshing, even on the beach or after getting off a plane..  </li>
            <li> Easy to spray on and leave in .</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong I had to give it away.  </li>
            <li> strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this product keeps my curls soft and frizz free!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use - fine spray.  </li>
            <li> It feels cool and refreshing in the AZ heat.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, color-processed hair and my stylist here in NYC recommended this product.</li>
            <li> Works great as a body moisturizer in the summer, too, but too light to stand alone in the harsher/dryer winters as a sole body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is great for getting your moisturizer to actually go in your skin cells.  </li>
            <li> Light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this magical potion since the early 90&#x27;s and now use it on my own kiddos&#x27; tangly tresses.  </li>
            <li> refreshing clean scent...always brings back good memories...</li>
            <li> The scent is light and fresh reminds me of the beach!</li>
            <li> No perfume, just a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Love the product and it is also good to use on dry skin.</li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> First used it many years ago.</li>
            <li> Anyway, first off, most safety seals are foil under the cap and wouldn&#x27;t show on a picture anyway</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s changed, but I hope the company can find the original formula...</li>
            <li> Great product...spray it on your hair to hydrate, use it as a skin refresher, clean a minor wound.</li>
            <li> and then put it into a regular 12oz container, more cost effective.</li>
            <li> loved the smell at first,  quickly became too much and rarely use the product.</li>
            <li> I keep a small spray bottle in my purse most of the time to add moisture to my skin anywhere, and it has a very mild &amp; pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is a tried and true product for our hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much I sent my friends in Ca.</li>
            <li> Great for hair and body as a light moisturizer and does not weigh hair down!</li>
            <li> It is a clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> They sent it quickly and it arrived in one piece.</li>
            <li> a quick spritz over the face helps set makeup.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I found it at my local beauty supply store recently, its good to know I can  order it here on amazon if I ever need too!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and smelling very clean.</li>
            <li> Instead, it is balanced, delivering the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> if I did use it right after tanning, the &#x27;itchiness&#x27; did not occur.  </li>
            <li> it was right side up</li>
            <li> I would have preferred the description to be more clear, but all turned out well, and I highly recommend this seller.  </li>
            <li> Prevents the fine wrinkles that come from postmenopausal hot flashes, heat breaks down collagen and salty sweat drys, this product counteracts these symptoms, love it.</li>
            <li> I have not found a better skin moisturizing spray--and I have looked extensively.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, although I have only been able to buy it at a beauty store in Castro Valley.  </li>
            <li> and I always have a bottle of it with me when Im in hot climates.</li>
            <li> The scent, the crisp feeling, and all that.</li>
            <li> We were glad to find it here in Amazon... and in a bigger size!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my hair stylist...</li>
            <li> -until now...great for rehydrating skin in hot weather ...</li>
            <li> Leaves hair and skin silky without heavy byproducts.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good for the amount.</li>
            <li> It is also good if you get a little too much sun on your skin.</li>
            <li> You can tell its working and its very soothing, I suggest anyone try this it makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li> Sea Plasma was recommended and it certainly did help the dryness and discoloration.  </li>
            <li> At first, the smell took me a while to get into, but all of the other clients at the salon love the aroma.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I contacted Red Carpet Company (the ones I bought mine from, the others are probably just fine)</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference in how my hair feels and looks.  </li>
            <li> zed that since my ordering depends so much upon what others write and review (and</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh and doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances.  </li>
            <li> It not only controls  the static, it also allows my hair volume that it loses when I put most conditioners on it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Sea Plasma.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I spray this onto my hair while wet either before blow-drying or air-drying, and it provides a light, non-greasy moisture that keeps my ends from feeling like straw.</li>
            <li> Most conditioners leave my hair too limp, but this does not.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine hair, and in the winter it become full of static electricity and drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve moved around quite a lot, and it can be tricky to find this product locally, but now that I&#x27;ve started buying it from amazon.com, the price is cheaper and the product comes right to my door.</li>
            <li> I use it several times a day, I use it on my face before and after makeup, on my hair right out of the shower and as a conditioning treatment before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> and they E-mailed back right away</li>
            <li> He had grayed over these many years and the Sea Plasma has helped to tame his hair and keep it manageable.</li>
            <li> BRAND NEW</li>
            <li> and I live in AZ ...</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t tell me its fine there isn&#x27;t one when I DONT KNOW if they watered it down or added something to it or let it spoil in their non-airconditioned garage!?!&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> Both my significant other</li>
            <li> I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t fell that it adds very much moisture on its own.</li>
            <li> We live in Arizona, dry, hot climate, so this really helps put moisture back into the skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy on your hair or skin.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re odor sensitive at all I&#x27;d stay clear.</li>
            <li> Except Twinlabs seems NATURAL with</li>
            <li> Not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate so this product is appreciated.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for my skin instead of the na-pca spray I usually use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years to wet my hair and make it a little more manageable.</li>
            <li> Sea Plasma is a good product but difficult to find in local stores</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I love this product !</li>
            <li> This is the time of year that you get busy doing outside work...and (I forgot to put on sunscreen) sunburn happens.</li>
            <li> the only thing that makes my hair soft like a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a few days and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> hard to find product thanks!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it help my skin much</li>
            <li> The amount seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, regarding the smell, I slowly started adding and added almost a quarter bottle of pure orange fragrance oil to it to try to help with the smell</li>
            <li> I apply this to my face and hair after I shower, and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to find in smaller beauty supply places.</li>
            <li> mine smelled completely spoiled, like some kind of BAD rotten eggs!</li>
            <li> Anybody could open it and put some other stuff in there.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use this spray, my skin and scalp feel dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes the dry frizzy look away.</li>
            <li> This product softens and hydrates my hair through the dry winters into the summer.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry scalp will take care of that too.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t fair of me to NOT at least warn others of the really bad companies out</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t fair of me to NOT at least warn others of the really bad companies out</li>
            <li> When I ordered, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was a refill bottle, so I expected a sprayer to come with it.  </li>
            <li> Minus 1 star because the bottle has no seal.</li>
            <li> He is now saying he thinks they need to offer this as an option to his other</li>
            <li> I would have to buy from other vendors ..</li>
            <li> hate wasting this much time writing these things, but I realized that since my ordering depends so much upon what others write and review (and since I am disabled, I have to do almost all my shopping online and have bought hundreds of items off websites</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the frizziness of my hair in the winter.</li>
            <li> It cools down the skin and helps take some of the stinging out.</li>
            <li> This is the product I have been using for a long time but is now hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> few ingredients &amp; Sea plasma has like twenty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> since I am disabled, I have to do almost all my shopping online and have bought hundreds of items off websites just this</li>
            <li> or it ALL would have went to waste.</li>
            <li> I showed the seaplasma to my doctor and asked if I could use this instead of the usual cream they give their patients.  </li>
            <li> My usual supplier decided to increase their prices ( and shipping charges ) by 40%</li>
            <li> Am a little disappointed that the price was so high, or it would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If you dont wash your hair in the morning, along with a spray bottle of water and plasm you can do your hair without getting all the build up that other products leave behind.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from really dry skin and he uses Sea Plasma everyday along with Eucerin Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find</li>
            <li> I Hope this feedback helps at least someone.  </li>
            <li> I Hope this feedback helps at least someone.  </li>
            <li> but actually I personally wouldn&#x27;t expect a bad attitude like that from that company or any company.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough that they add fragrance at all, but the smell of it gags me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Rite Aid stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> For years I bought this through my hair salon....very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Very unfortunate.</li>
            <li> So bad</li>
            <li> And do you know what they told me, they basically told me too bad!</li>
            <li> I was disgusted to find it is loaded with fragrance.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is good stuff,I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> My mother has used this product for years.  It is great for getting your moisturizer to actually go in your skin cells.  Helps maintain a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Item arrived in a few days and was exactly as described.  Wife says it does wonders for her skin and recommends it to her friends. She is a thorough judge on any product value so if she says it&#x27;s good; it is.</li>
            <li> FOCUS 21 Sea Plasma is a great hydrator for both skin and hair.  It also has a very refreshing aroma.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B0002PCH2M Focus 21 Sea Plasma All Purpose Skin and Hair Moisturizing Spray 12 Oz]] for many years, and I love it. The fragrance is mild and subtle, not overly flowery or feminine, so it works well for men. I have not found a better skin moisturizing spray--and I have looked extensively. There are lots of creams and lotions out there, and they all leave my skin feeling greasy. I apply this to my face and hair after I shower, and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated all day long. When I don&#x27;t use this spray, my skin and scalp feel dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve moved around quite a lot, and it can be tricky to find this product locally, but now that I&#x27;ve started buying it from amazon.com, the price is cheaper and the product comes right to my door.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sea Plasma spray for over 20 years! It has an awesome light, beachy fragrance that I love! Not only does it smell wonderful, it moisturizes my hair and skin. I used to find it in most markets out here in So. California but not anymore. I found it at my local beauty supply store recently, its good to know I can  order it here on amazon if I ever need too! I will not and can not go without this product!</li>
            <li> I will always use this wonderful stuff so long as I can get it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years for sunburn.  I am now a breast cancer patient and going through radiation.  I showed the seaplasma to my doctor and asked if I could use this instead of the usual cream they give their patients.  I am now 4 weeks into my treatment and the doctor is amazed.  He calls me his clinical trial.  He is now saying he thinks they need to offer this as an option to his other patients.&lt;br /&gt;Seaplasma is awesome.  I wish I could find it locally but I am thankful I can get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ran out of product and gradually&lt;br /&gt;My scalp started drying out again. Won&#x27;t run out again.</li>
            <li> We love this product and have used it for 20 or more years. Feels great in your hair; refreshing to the skin. Both my significant other and I use it.  He loves it too! We&#x27;d definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Focus 21 Sea Plasma for about 30 years. Needless to say, I love this product ! I use it as a skin refresher. It smells just like the beach, and refreshes and revives me. After not finding it in my local beauty supply stores, I was happy to find it on Amazon for a great price and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> When I ordered, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was a refill bottle, so I expected a sprayer to come with it.  I went to the store and bought a suitable sprayer bottle to use, and it works just fine with the product.  I would have preferred the description to be more clear, but all turned out well, and I highly recommend this seller.  The shipping was fast, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for 25 years, it always smells&lt;br /&gt;like we are on vacation, smells like the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;He says it makes his hair thicker and I like it in the summer on my skin&lt;br /&gt;when I am outside in the sun.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find that someone carried this Focus 21 Sea Plasma. They sent it quickly and it arrived in one piece. Will order from the provider again!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years to wet my hair and make it a little more manageable. It smells nice and it&#x27;s also good for the skin to prevent dryness after being out in the sun. I buy the 32oz. size and then put it into a regular 12oz container, more cost effective. (my wife hates the smell, but I like it)</li>
            <li> This product is well known for quite some time.  It is not heavy on your hair or skin.  Instead, it is balanced, delivering the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> not as good as \\&quot;its a ten\\&quot; leave in spray but you get WAY more and for cheaper so its all good.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color-processed hair and my stylist here in NYC recommended this product. At first, the smell took me a while to get into, but all of the other clients at the salon love the aroma. I spray this onto my hair while wet either before blow-drying or air-drying, and it provides a light, non-greasy moisture that keeps my ends from feeling like straw. Works great as a body moisturizer in the summer, too, but too light to stand alone in the harsher/dryer winters as a sole body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Best smelling stuff ever!! So glad I could find it again. It is hard to find but well worth it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and am lost without it.  I use it to keep static electricity out of my hair and on my face to keep it moisturized.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every day in my hair. It leaves my hair soft and smelling very clean. I have very curly hair and this product keeps my curls soft and frizz free!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel soft &amp; smooth.  Best leave-I conditioner I have used.  Great for curly hair like mine.  :-)</li>
            <li> Introduced to this product by a cosmetologist.  It is an excellent moisturizer and keeps your scalp healthy.  Excellent for those who have dry scalp scaling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this magical potion since the early 90&#x27;s and now use it on my own kiddos&#x27; tangly tresses.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. First used it many years ago. The scent is light and fresh reminds me of the beach! Great for hair and body as a light moisturizer and does not weigh hair down! Also works for flyaway hair and detangler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the best ever period!!!!! Thank you for having it. Hopeing it says the low price. You can use it on everything....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, although I have only been able to buy it at a beauty store in Castro Valley.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it in Amazon.  It really makes a difference in how my hair feels and looks.  Love the light breeze fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sea Plasma for years. It&#x27;s not sticky and it feels really good on my face. The nice thing about it is that you dont have to protect your face when you spray it on your hair. This doesnt work as a detangler but it helps your hair look healthy and I always have a bottle of it with me when Im in hot climates. If you dont wash your hair in the morning, along with a spray bottle of water and plasm you can do your hair without getting all the build up that other products leave behind.</li>
            <li> This is the time of year that you get busy doing outside work...and (I forgot to put on sunscreen) sunburn happens. This seaplasma was introduced to me years ago when I had gotten a sunburn, and it is amazing stuff. The fact that you can spray it on is great because then you don&#x27;t have to touch your skin that is already screaming &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;!!! It&#x27;s cooling sensation and moisturizers work wonders, and you can spray it in your hair as a leave in conditioner too. I recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong I had to give it away.  If you&#x27;re odor sensitive at all I&#x27;d stay clear.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;It is a Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I recommend instead buying:&lt;br /&gt;Twinlab Na-PCA Non-Oily&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought both these (they&#x27;re similar) Except Twinlabs seems NATURAL with few ingredients &amp; Sea plasma has like twenty chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;And mine smelled completely spoiled, like some kind of BAD rotten eggs! So bad so, I dont think i can use it.&lt;br /&gt;Worse,&lt;br /&gt;I received it and it was WITHOUT a safety seal on it! what doesn&#x27;t have a safety seal on it. If I&#x27;m buying something BRAND NEW well then I want a safety seal on those things, especially when I don&#x27;t know who these companies i am buying from are.&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who sells on amazon and her &#x27;company&#x27; is in her garage. So don&#x27;t tell me its fine there isn&#x27;t one when I DONT KNOW if they watered it down or added something to it or let it spoil in their non-airconditioned garage!?!&lt;br /&gt;So&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Red Carpet Company (the ones I bought mine from, the others are probably just fine) And do you know what they told me, they basically told me too bad! They wrote me \\&quot;well did you see a safety seal on the picture of the product\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I guess they must charge extra for that.  Anyway, first off, most safety seals are foil under the cap and wouldn&#x27;t show on a picture anyway but actually I personally wouldn&#x27;t expect a bad attitude like that from that company or any company.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I&#x27;ll  just cut and copy that letter for you now so here it is for you to read yourself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;we have been selling 30 to 40 a days of this product and we never had this issue. There was no seal as you can see even on Amazon photo, and regarding the smell, we never tamper any of our product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously that&#x27;s what they wrote me!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, regarding the smell, I slowly started adding and added almost a quarter bottle of pure orange fragrance oil to it to try to help with the smell and you won&#x27;t believe it but even that DIDN&#x27;T COVER THE SMELL OF ROTTING SPOILED PRODUCT!  YUCKY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate wasting this much time writing these things, but I realized that since my ordering depends so much upon what others write and review (and since I am disabled, I have to do almost all my shopping online and have bought hundreds of items off websites just this year)&lt;br /&gt;That it isn&#x27;t fair of me to NOT at least warn others of the really bad companies out there!&lt;br /&gt;And I should share some of the good deals I&#x27;ve found here I think too.&lt;br /&gt;So I Hope this feedback helps at least someone.  Take Care.  &#x3D;)zed that since my ordering depends so much upon what others write and review (and since I am disabled, I have to do almost all my shopping online and have bought hundreds of items off websites just this year)&lt;br /&gt;That it isn&#x27;t fair of me to NOT at least warn others of the really bad companies out there!&lt;br /&gt;And I should share some of the good deals I&#x27;ve found here I think too.&lt;br /&gt;So I Hope this feedback helps at least someone.

            <li> Very nice well wrapped</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because my husband has used this product for years. Buying from the comfort of your own home through Amazon is amazing!!  I would recommend this product to anyone who uses this kind of product!!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It is all you need for your hair. It controls frizz and smells great to!</li>
            <li> This was a product I used to love in the 1980s. The scent, the crisp feeling, and all that. But something has happened or changed since them. This time around, when I used it once, I had an allergic reaction to it. Very unfortunate. Also my girlfriend, who loves the smell of sea salts and such, could not stand to be around me when I had it on. The scent made her gag for some reason. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s changed, but I hope the company can find the original formula... OR, we simply have acquired an allergy to something inside this product. I wish I could use it again.</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff</li>
            <li> Easy to use - fine spray.  I use it on my skin and also on my hair after shampooing.  I live in a dry climate so this product is appreciated. The amount seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. Not sure if it help my skin much but the cool spray feels good. This 32 oz is a refiller and the price was low. Shipping was fast. All good.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The fragrance is so clean and refreshing! I especially like it because it  moisturizes/re-hydrates without clogging my pores like lotions...very light!</li>
            <li> Sea Plasma is a good product but difficult to find in local stores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was shipped directly to my physical address as requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Needs to be more concentrated - too watery.</li>
            <li> I use this to refill my spray bottles and have one in each bathroom. I use the spray multiple times a day and it is soothing and cooling. I would not be without this spray, I carry it on all of my trips as well. I love it!</li>
            <li> Used to use this product many years ago. Had forgotten about it, then found it! Summer in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It smells like the beach. It cuts down on the frizziness of my hair in the winter. I like it.</li>
            <li> Using this product for 6 years, spray the face 2-3 times daily. Prevents the fine wrinkles that come from postmenopausal hot flashes, heat breaks down collagen and salty sweat drys, this product counteracts these symptoms, love it.</li>
            <li> Focus 21 Sea Plasma is great,have been buying their products for years. Am a little disappointed that the price was so high, or it would have gotten 5 stars. Highly recommend,</li>
            <li> Leaves hair and skin silky without heavy byproducts.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good for the amount. The shipping was timely.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. Easy to spray on and leave in . I kept a smaller bottle and use this size to refill.</li>
            <li> the only thing that makes my hair soft like a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Most conditioners leave my hair too limp, but this does not. Tames the frizzies but leaves some body.</li>
            <li> I love this hair and skin moisturizer; I will continue to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> The smell is so good, you can use it like a body spray, as well as a leave in hair conditioner.  I highly recommend Sea Plasma.  People will compliment you on how your hair smells &amp;#34;so good and clean.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love it. I used to use this product about twenty years ago, and suddenly they discontinued the line. I have very long, very fine hair, and in the winter it become full of static electricity and drives me crazy. The conditioners I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t control that, but the sea plasma moisturizing spray is perfect. It not only controls  the static, it also allows my hair volume that it loses when I put most conditioners on it. I was happy I decided to look to see if it was still even around, excited when I found that it is. I highly recommend it. Its also great on the skin. No perfume, just a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li> loved the smell at first,  quickly became too much and rarely use the product.</li>
            <li> hard to find product thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! The best thing ever made!  My very first hairdresser introduced me to this product!!! Great detangler/leave in conditioner, smells amazing, great for beach, makes hair healthy, protects it and doesn&#x27;t let it frizz up!!!! It&#x27;s AMAZING!!! Can even use it condition your skin! On legs, face, everywhere!!!  Awesome product! I hadn&#x27;t found it anywhere and then I found it on amazon extremely happy customer!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years as a body spray after my shower to moisturize my skin.  I discovered its benefits when I used to use a tanning booth.  If I didn&#x27;t spray it on after I tanned and before I dressed, my skin felt &#x27;itchy&#x27; for the rest of the day, but if I did use it right after tanning, the &#x27;itchiness&#x27; did not occur.  That&#x27;s how I know it moisturizes my skin.  I do not use it on my hair, as I  did not notice any benefit of that.  I used this to refill my spray bottle.</li>
            <li> We live in Arizona, dry, hot climate, so this really helps put moisture back into the skin and hair.  I use it on our dogs, (Irish Setters), and they look wonderful. It takes the dry frizzy look away.</li>
            <li> This is the product I have been using for a long time but is now hard to find in stores. Great deal in volume and you just grab a spritzer bottle from the dollar store and voila!</li>
            <li> A versatile and refreshing product.  Great for protection of fly away hair and blow dryer heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;Also a quick spritz over the face helps set makeup.  The smell is very clean and does not conflict with parfume or cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from really dry skin and he uses Sea Plasma everyday along with Eucerin Aquaphor. Unfortunately, Rite Aid stopped carrying it. We were glad to find it here in Amazon... and in a bigger size! Minus 1 star because the bottle has no seal. Anybody could open it and put some other stuff in there. Hopefully the manufacturer, Focus21, reads my review.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Life saver.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It is great for hair and skin. I spray on right after a shower and the comb goes right through my hair and is a perfect prep for styling product. I often was my face in the afternoon and spritz this on; it is very refreshing. Really great stuff and much more economical than buying the spray bottle in the store. I just refill mine.</li>
            <li> Greatest product ever for a leave in hair conditioner!  Not greasy.  Not heavy.  Light refreshing smell.  You will love it I promise.  Quick delivery and great packaging.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sea Plasma since 1982 and would never use anything dffferent&lt;br /&gt;Sea Plasma leaves your skin ~ hair fragerence of Ocean Breeze I just love it and it last all day with me..</li>
            <li> Great product...spray it on your hair to hydrate, use it as a skin refresher, clean a minor wound.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it several times a day, I use it on my face before and after makeup, on my hair right out of the shower and as a conditioning treatment before I go to bed. I love the smell and how light it is. You can tell its working and its very soothing, I suggest anyone try this it makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li> i like this product  use it often  has a delightful scent and leave hair and skin feeling very soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was prompt</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have been using Sea Plasma for over 20 years. Of course many women use a leave-in product, and I like it on my hair, but my husband swears by the product. He had grayed over these many years and the Sea Plasma has helped to tame his hair and keep it manageable. It is a tried and true product for our hair. It is also good if you get a little too much sun on your skin. It cools down the skin and helps take some of the stinging out.</li>
            <li> The best for hair and skin!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair. This product softens and hydrates my hair through the dry winters into the summer.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my hair stylist...that was back in 2006.  For years I bought this through my hair salon....very expensive.  Now I buy through Amazon...I get a better deal.  I use this product on my hair and spray on my skin.  It has a very clean smell!  I also use the Focus 21 Sea Plasma Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using Focus 21 since 1988 and can&#x27;t imagine what could replace it.  My usual supplier decided to increase their prices ( and shipping charges ) by 40% so I decided to search elsewhere for it.  I found it through Amazon and was very happy and relieved to do so. Great product, great price, great supplier!</li>
            <li> Our family has used Sea Plasma for years!  Both of our children were swimmers and had swimmers hair.  Sea Plasma was recommended and it certainly did help the dryness and discoloration.  I am now a Senior Citizen and do receive permanents now and again.  I use the Sea Plasma to help with the dryness.  Love the product and it is also good to use on dry skin.</li>
            <li> The greatest product ever! I&#x27;ve been using this for over 30 years! Love&lt;br /&gt; it!</li>
            <li> My daughter turned me on to this ...a product that we used to buy at a drug store in Seattle and when they dropped out of site we no longer could get this -until now...great for rehydrating skin in hot weather ...refreshing clean scent...always brings back good memories...totally love it ...my go to when out doors ...and I live in AZ ...so I use it a bunch !!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much I sent my friends in Ca. a big bottle..the only thing was shipping info..I E-mailed the co and they E-mailed back right away but still that part was not up to par 100% ..to say I would buy from this Co again  I would have to buy from other vendors ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thomas W</li>
            <li> I love Sea Plasma.  It is a clean fresh scent.  I spray it on lots of things to freshen them or the air, besides on myself.  I can&#x27;t use perfume so I use this on my skin, hair and clothes.</li>
            <li> I have used Sea Plasma for years.  It is the best product for putting moisture back into your hair.  If you have dry scalp will take care of that too.  I have been looking for it in the stores but can&#x27;t find so I will be buying from here from now on.  Just love the product.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Good price prompt service.....no complaints</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for my skin instead of the na-pca spray I usually use. I was disgusted to find it is loaded with fragrance. Nothing that is intended to go on your skin should have fragrance. If I want fragrance I will use cologne. I used it once and will never use it again. It&#x27;s bad enough that they add fragrance at all, but the smell of it gags me. It smells like a beauty parlor. Might have been a good product without the fragrance. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> I love Seapasma! I just wish it was easier to find these days. If you want a nice refreshing smell this is the product for you!!</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s harder to find in smaller beauty supply places.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago, then the beauty supply store stopped carrying it.  Found it online, got one for me and one for my daughter.  Will continue to order it.  It feels cool and refreshing in the AZ heat.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I love the way the skin feels when applied.  The smell is like the oceanside.</li>
            <li> This is a good humectant moisturizing spray for on the go, for both hair and skin. If I use it before hair coloring, it seems to help with fading. I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t fell that it adds very much moisture on its own.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  Light spraying on face is so refreshing, even on the beach or after getting off a plane..  I keep a small spray bottle in my purse most of the time to add moisture to my skin anywhere, and it has a very mild &amp; pleasant fragrance. Good for hair and body, too.  One of my most beloved products!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I used it years ago and was elated that I found it once again. I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Focus 21 Sea Plasma All Purpose Skin and Hair is the best conditioner!  I use it on my face and my hair.  Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for many years and can never find it in stores anywhere.  Great on newly washed hair.</li>
            <li> Except the Cap was busted when it arrived...good thing it was right side up or it ALL would have went to waste.</li>
            <li> Focus 21  Great Stuff</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years on my hair. It&#x27;s great. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Light, fresh and doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances.  Great all over moisturizer, even on my hair.  Love it as a mid-day spritz refresher!</li>
