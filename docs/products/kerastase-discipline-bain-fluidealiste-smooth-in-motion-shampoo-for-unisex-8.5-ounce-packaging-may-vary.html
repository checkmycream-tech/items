            <li> Is there anything I can do to get a new bottle?</li>
            <li> Even on wet hair it makes it feel totally manageable and silky.</li>
            <li> left a film on my hair - kerastase shampoos are all I use, but this one was apparently too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> were your hair can get extremely Dry!!</li>
            <li> and instead I use any other conditioning mask.</li>
            <li> I appreciate not having to work hard on detangling my hair once I leave the shower, I also use the heat protector from this same line.</li>
            <li> So I switch them up every few days and pair either the shampoo or conditioner with another Kerastase product.</li>
            <li> This product is either extremely old or fake.</li>
            <li> Not sure if product is old or just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> my hair feels heavy, sticky and looks dirty after washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I have gotten a old batch of shampoo because it smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> Terrible - I have used this product before and it was good.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
