    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>On this front I am happy to report that this Rembrandt toothpaste does seem to work well</li>
            <li>so my recommendation is you need to use both for great results.</li>
            <li>Flavor is good, however I bought it for whitening.  </li>
            <li>The taste is good and there is no after lingering taste.  </li>
            <li>any way good product.</li>
            <li>This paste does not seem to have the chemicals which fight tartar so effectively.  </li>
            <li>I liked wintergreen taste that leaves minty flavor after brushing.  </li>
            <li>The wintergreen flavor was also quite nice.</li>
            <li>The consistency is good and it spreads easily with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste took some getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong minty taste and contains peroxide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my teeth /</li>
            <li>Most toothpaste tubes will compress and stay compressed as you use the product.</li>
            <li>I love mint flavored toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Keeping one&#x27;s teeth healthy is an invaluable investment.  </li>
            <li>In life, we tend to be more faithful (and caring) to those things in which we have invested more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>In life, we tend to be more faithful (and caring) to those things in which we have invested more money.      </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smoke, and I don&#x27;t drink more than one cup of coffee a day, so it&#x27;s not as if my teeth are beyond the capabilities of a whitening toothpaste...</li>
            <li>So it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about effectiveness, but in a market as crowded as that for whitening fluoride toothpaste, one can do better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the taste, which may be a turnoff for many, the tube also puffed up -- which I may be mistaken in presuming</li>
            <li>The packaging of this product was appropriate, and there was no damage to the contents.</li>
            <li>The flavor is okay.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a refreshing mint taste.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It has a fancy texture and an interesting taste sensation.</li>
            <li>I took pictures of my teeth before and will give it a couple more weeks, then take another picture for comparison.</li>
            <li>The taste is pleasant, yet always \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like a clinical dental product rather than a \\&quot;yummy\\&quot; one or others that taste of too much spice.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are the most important feature to me.</li>
            <li>Since that time, I&#x27;ve tried my best to check toothpaste and other oral hygiene products to find out if they&#x27;re made in the US.</li>
            <li>Other than that the toothpaste is awesome!</li>
            <li>The paste does make a foamy lather and it was easy to spread</li>
            <li>Normally, I use fluoride rinse for health of my teeth and adding whitening solution toothpaste seemed like a good addition to my oral hygene.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below.</li>
            <li>I was sent a free tube of this product to review.  </li>
            <li>I will not be repurchasing, and am not eager to finish the free tube I received.</li>
            <li>The proof is in the smile!</li>
            <li>I have used Rembrandt products from Amazon in the past and was very happy with everything however, not the case this time.  </li>
            <li>Will update review (and rating) if the \\&quot;after\\&quot; pictures show significant improvement.</li>
            <li>I used this and while my teeth did feel great and the desired effect of slightly more whitening was achieved (I think...), the price to pay was a suds like/peroxide like aftertaste that lasted a little longer than I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>** clean, because I kept brushing and brushing to try to get that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling -- but that clean feeling never</li>
            <li>I did not get that clean feeling when I ran my tongue across my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothpaste works well to clean the teeth and whitens well.</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of soda and coffee and can say it does help really clean those superficial stains off well.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full of air.  </li>
            <li>(One shouldn&#x27;t swallow toothpaste anyway, but a more pleasing flavor might have made that more likely.)  </li>
            <li>Also, the taste is so mild, that I began to feel my breath was never as fresh as when I used Crest or Colgate products.  </li>
            <li>In terms of the generally popular brands, I use colgate and sensodyne, arm and hammer, and lastly, crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The consistency of the toothpaste was nice -- not too gritty.</li>
            <li>These are probably good things, as there is a warning label cautioning users against swallowing this toothpaste due to the peroxide.  </li>
            <li>Rembrandt always seems to have gotten it right.  </li>
            <li>In the long run, the prevention of cavities is more important than appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is strange to put it nicely.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a nice-tasting, not particularly sweet or overpowering toothpaste, and it does a rather good job of cleaning up my teeth every time I brush.</li>
            <li>However, I was more interested in how the Rembrandt actually works.  </li>
            <li>I am a smoker and drink lots of coffee, so keeping my teeth the whitest possible is top priority to me.</li>
            <li>Well, when I first got this toothpaste and opened it up a lot of the product spurted out of the tube, and I wasn&#x27;t even squeezing it.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use Rembrandt toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I am able to maintain very white teeth with this regimen despite that</li>
            <li>At first this toothpaste seemed good, with it&#x27;s pearly-look and pleasant taste, but at the end of the tube, I was sick of it.  </li>
            <li>This product does whiten your teeth to their personal best - not as good as dentist visit results, but it sure tastes terrible.</li>
            <li>My teeth look very clean and white.  </li>
            <li>I agree with others that the tube does contain lots of air, which certainly makes it feel like you&#x27;re getting more than what it actually contains.</li>
            <li>While this certainly doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the product will always be safe, it definitely makes me feel safer.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasing flavor that doesn&#x27;t remind you of toilet bowl cleaner like many toothpastes do.  </li>
            <li>However, I also note that the whitening power of my usual brand of whitening toothpaste (which starts with \\&quot;Cre\\&quot;) is just about as good.    </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it&#x27;s done a decent job of whitening my teeth, but I&#x27;ve never brushed my teeth before with a toothpaste that I tried to avoid touching my tongue</li>
            <li>If you desire cleaner, whiter teeth, then I strongly recommend using a peroxide-based toothpaste such as Rembrandt.  </li>
            <li>I used this toothpaste for several weeks, and while I actually liked the taste (I am a fan of wintergreen in general) and the breath-freshening qualities, I didn&#x27;t notice much whitening effect.</li>
            <li>The taste and texture are not as pleasant as other whitening toothpastes (such as Colgate).</li>
            <li>Personally, I have seen a huge difference in my dental health when I began to do so.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product ...</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the tube of paste seems inflated with much air.  </li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re not even getting all that much toothpaste -</li>
            <li>if you think, when you hold it in your hand that it&#x27;s too light, it actually is.  </li>
            <li>The taste does not bother me much.</li>
            <li>If you want real whitening, try whitening strips or get Zoom whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li>I regularly enjoy  coffee, tea, red, tomato sauce, and soy sauce.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s too much peroxide for that.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell if it helped or not.</li>
            <li>It also has a smooth texture that doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty film on your teeth like some of the whitening toothpastes can do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not all that concerned with whitening as a perk of my toothpaste, though I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference either way.</li>
            <li>I have long been interested in Rembrandt toothpaste, but was put off by the price, so have made do with more modest whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li>Teeth looked whiter after some use and it can complement teeth cleaning done by professional dentist to make sure white color remains longer.  </li>
            <li>It lacks the strong, exhilarating taste and bubbly feeling of the other mint-flavored whitening toothpastes that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>but it also has more peroxide than the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li>(Rembrandt&#x27;s mint flavor is very light and doesn&#x27;t mask the slight peroxide taste.)  </li>
            <li>, is that the tube &#x27;looks&#x27; full, but surprise surprise, it actually isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I threw the tube out before it was completely empty so as to get back to my good old Colgate tartar control paste.  </li>
            <li>For this reason, I would recommend it to those for whom this is the main aim.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend using tartar-control products.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend Rembrandt.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality toothpaste product.</li>
            <li>I read so many reviews thinking i will get a beautiful white, so far not that bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure this toothpaste cleans any better nor does it really whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>I believe it is because this product seems to carry a too high amount of peroxide for a toothpaste, especially if you try to clean your tongue very well because the product gets closer to the back of the throat.</li>
            <li>I realize other folks enjoy this product, but I&#x27;m rating it as \\&quot;blech\\&quot; and giving it one star.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that with continuous use, this toothpaste would have an important edge over other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li>But my mouth never really felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li>but in all honesty I get much better results using regular toothpaste with some regular household baking soda mixed in.    </li>
            <li>And there are also questions regarding the potential effectiveness of this product as compared to whitening strips, so users should do their research first.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other peroxide products for teeth and this is the only one that carried this side effect.</li>
            <li>The question you have to answer is: Are you willing to suffer a tad bit to get your teeth white?</li>
            <li>Purchasing a more expensive whitener may provide someone an extra incentive to brush more frequently.  </li>
            <li>Purchasing a more expensive whitener may provide someone an extra incentive to brush more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>The peroxide taste and feel is palpable, and peroxide is the main active ingredient in most commercial whitening strips.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you want a decent alternative to gels and chalky pastes!</li>
            <li>There was a clear \\&quot;poof\\&quot; of escaping air under pressure when I opened the tube, which remained distended.</li>
            <li>To prevent cavities, one must brush and floss FREQUENTLY.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really whitens your teeth at all - it just gives you the illusion it is doing so because of the look of the white suds it makes.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve not noticed any whitening effect.</li>
            <li>However the taste is not unpleasant, unlike other whitening toothpastes I have used.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt is a reliable brand that is more expensive but it also has more peroxide than the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li>the peroxide taste and this particular brand will have your mouth feeling as if it has just left a doctor&#x27;s office...</li>
            <li>That said, I think this particular toothpaste actually tastes moldy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if whitening is your main aim, I believe this toothpaste will likely take you closer to that goal than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>At first opening, the 2.6 ounce tube was already mostly devoid of product.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is very thick, goopy and sticky, kind of repulsive to me actually.</li>
            <li>I drink a Chinese black tea called Pu-erh daily, and so it&#x27;s easy for me to evaluate the whitening effect of any toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers have mentioned, once I unscrewed the cap a force of air came out, so the tube is actually not full of the product.</li>
            <li>(One of the major ingredients in the whitening strips is peroxide.)  </li>
            <li>If the apocalypse happened, and I survived, and there was no other toothpaste anywhere, I might go ahead and use it, or maybe not.</li>
            <li>though I didn&#x27;t like this toothpaste after the first week, out of fairness I forced myself to keep with it for a few more weeks, thinking maybe it would grow on me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only maybe about half full of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s brand-new, you can roll it from the bottom (like you do when a normal tube of toothpaste is half empty) and see the tube is mainly full of air.</li>
            <li>The mint flavoring was not strong enough to mask the hydrogen peroxide taste nor was it strong enough to even freshen my breath.</li>
            <li>sometimes they don&#x27;t always completely remove the brownish plaque from the crooked tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as appearances are concerned, my teeth look as though I&#x27;ve recently used whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>He likes the toothpaste well, just have to be careful to release the &amp;#34;gas&amp;#34; as not to lose the content too fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be switching back to my toothpaste for sensitive teeth as soon as this tube is used up.</li>
            <li>Frankly, with the high cost of Rembrandt toothpaste, balanced against the very minor effectiveness, I will opt for treatments from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First is the price of over $6 per tube for less than 3 ounces of paste.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of other whitening toothpastes that cost much, much less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if I&#x27;m not willing to brush with it to begin with, its whitening capability really doesn&#x27;t matter, does it?</li>
            <li>It basically is only half air and half product, it also has a strong taste of peroxide.</li>
            <li>Also, my teeth feel very slick and clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am a smoker and drink lots of coffee, so keeping my teeth the whitest possible is top priority to me.</li>
            <li> Well, when I first got this toothpaste and opened it up a lot of the product spurted out of the tube, and I wasn&#x27;t even squeezing it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use Rembrandt toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I am able to maintain very white teeth with this regimen despite that</li>
            <li> At first this toothpaste seemed good, with it&#x27;s pearly-look and pleasant taste, but at the end of the tube, I was sick of it.  </li>
            <li> This product does whiten your teeth to their personal best - not as good as dentist visit results, but it sure tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> My teeth look very clean and white.  </li>
            <li> I agree with others that the tube does contain lots of air, which certainly makes it feel like you&#x27;re getting more than what it actually contains.</li>
            <li> While this certainly doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the product will always be safe, it definitely makes me feel safer.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasing flavor that doesn&#x27;t remind you of toilet bowl cleaner like many toothpastes do.  </li>
            <li> However, I also note that the whitening power of my usual brand of whitening toothpaste (which starts with \\&quot;Cre\\&quot;) is just about as good.    </li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it&#x27;s done a decent job of whitening my teeth, but I&#x27;ve never brushed my teeth before with a toothpaste that I tried to avoid touching my tongue</li>
            <li> If you desire cleaner, whiter teeth, then I strongly recommend using a peroxide-based toothpaste such as Rembrandt.  </li>
            <li> I used this toothpaste for several weeks, and while I actually liked the taste (I am a fan of wintergreen in general) and the breath-freshening qualities, I didn&#x27;t notice much whitening effect.</li>
            <li> The taste and texture are not as pleasant as other whitening toothpastes (such as Colgate).</li>
            <li> Personally, I have seen a huge difference in my dental health when I began to do so.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product ...</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the tube of paste seems inflated with much air.  </li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re not even getting all that much toothpaste -</li>
            <li> if you think, when you hold it in your hand that it&#x27;s too light, it actually is.  </li>
            <li> The taste does not bother me much.</li>
            <li> If you want real whitening, try whitening strips or get Zoom whitening from your dentist.</li>
            <li> I regularly enjoy  coffee, tea, red, tomato sauce, and soy sauce.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s too much peroxide for that.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it helped or not.</li>
            <li> It also has a smooth texture that doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty film on your teeth like some of the whitening toothpastes can do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not all that concerned with whitening as a perk of my toothpaste, though I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference either way.</li>
            <li> I have long been interested in Rembrandt toothpaste, but was put off by the price, so have made do with more modest whitening toothpaste</li>
            <li> Teeth looked whiter after some use and it can complement teeth cleaning done by professional dentist to make sure white color remains longer.  </li>
            <li> It lacks the strong, exhilarating taste and bubbly feeling of the other mint-flavored whitening toothpastes that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> but it also has more peroxide than the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li> (Rembrandt&#x27;s mint flavor is very light and doesn&#x27;t mask the slight peroxide taste.)  </li>
            <li> , is that the tube &#x27;looks&#x27; full, but surprise surprise, it actually isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I threw the tube out before it was completely empty so as to get back to my good old Colgate tartar control paste.  </li>
            <li> For this reason, I would recommend it to those for whom this is the main aim.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend using tartar-control products.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality toothpaste product.</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews thinking i will get a beautiful white, so far not that bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure this toothpaste cleans any better nor does it really whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I believe it is because this product seems to carry a too high amount of peroxide for a toothpaste, especially if you try to clean your tongue very well because the product gets closer to the back of the throat.</li>
            <li> I realize other folks enjoy this product, but I&#x27;m rating it as \\&quot;blech\\&quot; and giving it one star.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that with continuous use, this toothpaste would have an important edge over other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> But my mouth never really felt clean after using it.</li>
            <li> but in all honesty I get much better results using regular toothpaste with some regular household baking soda mixed in.    </li>
            <li> And there are also questions regarding the potential effectiveness of this product as compared to whitening strips, so users should do their research first.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other peroxide products for teeth and this is the only one that carried this side effect.</li>
            <li> The question you have to answer is: Are you willing to suffer a tad bit to get your teeth white?</li>
            <li> Purchasing a more expensive whitener may provide someone an extra incentive to brush more frequently.  </li>
            <li> Purchasing a more expensive whitener may provide someone an extra incentive to brush more frequently.  </li>
            <li> I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> The peroxide taste and feel is palpable, and peroxide is the main active ingredient in most commercial whitening strips.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you want a decent alternative to gels and chalky pastes!</li>
            <li> There was a clear \\&quot;poof\\&quot; of escaping air under pressure when I opened the tube, which remained distended.</li>
            <li> To prevent cavities, one must brush and floss FREQUENTLY.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really whitens your teeth at all - it just gives you the illusion it is doing so because of the look of the white suds it makes.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve not noticed any whitening effect.</li>
            <li> However the taste is not unpleasant, unlike other whitening toothpastes I have used.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is a reliable brand that is more expensive but it also has more peroxide than the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li> the peroxide taste and this particular brand will have your mouth feeling as if it has just left a doctor&#x27;s office...</li>
            <li> That said, I think this particular toothpaste actually tastes moldy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if whitening is your main aim, I believe this toothpaste will likely take you closer to that goal than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> At first opening, the 2.6 ounce tube was already mostly devoid of product.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is very thick, goopy and sticky, kind of repulsive to me actually.</li>
            <li> I drink a Chinese black tea called Pu-erh daily, and so it&#x27;s easy for me to evaluate the whitening effect of any toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers have mentioned, once I unscrewed the cap a force of air came out, so the tube is actually not full of the product.</li>
            <li> (One of the major ingredients in the whitening strips is peroxide.)  </li>
            <li> If the apocalypse happened, and I survived, and there was no other toothpaste anywhere, I might go ahead and use it, or maybe not.</li>
            <li> though I didn&#x27;t like this toothpaste after the first week, out of fairness I forced myself to keep with it for a few more weeks, thinking maybe it would grow on me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only maybe about half full of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s brand-new, you can roll it from the bottom (like you do when a normal tube of toothpaste is half empty) and see the tube is mainly full of air.</li>
            <li> The mint flavoring was not strong enough to mask the hydrogen peroxide taste nor was it strong enough to even freshen my breath.</li>
            <li> sometimes they don&#x27;t always completely remove the brownish plaque from the crooked tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as appearances are concerned, my teeth look as though I&#x27;ve recently used whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> He likes the toothpaste well, just have to be careful to release the &amp;#34;gas&amp;#34; as not to lose the content too fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be switching back to my toothpaste for sensitive teeth as soon as this tube is used up.</li>
            <li> Frankly, with the high cost of Rembrandt toothpaste, balanced against the very minor effectiveness, I will opt for treatments from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First is the price of over $6 per tube for less than 3 ounces of paste.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other whitening toothpastes that cost much, much less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if I&#x27;m not willing to brush with it to begin with, its whitening capability really doesn&#x27;t matter, does it?</li>
            <li> It basically is only half air and half product, it also has a strong taste of peroxide.</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth feel very slick and clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so thin that more goes down my throat than stay in my mouth on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I realize that the same item, toothpaste, food, or other, can taste totally different to two different people, just as pheromones may affect the attraction of those same two to totally different people.</li>
            <li> I do not particularly notice a brightening of my teeth yet, but this would likely take several weeks to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use and get paste out of the tube and tube is only partially filled.</li>
            <li> As a result, over time, my teeth become stained, especially the crooked tooth on the bottom row nearest the center.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it taste better, but it is much, much less expensive.</li>
            <li> and it can remove the tea stain, as long as I keep up with the routine of brushing within an hour of drinking.</li>
            <li> But make no mistake, the supposed wintergreen flavor only partially masks the underlying peroxide taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of the oxygenarator or something in it, it may squirt out at you like a big geyser and become empty.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it gets thicker and harder to squeeze out as you use the tube.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe exactly what&#x27;s wrong with the taste, and to be fair I have tasted worse from other toothpaste and this one does rinse out well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, the product smells just like Pepto-Bismal ... not exactly a smell I want to experience when starting my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might make for a standardized appearance and look nicer on a bathroom counter (and therefore also serve as an ongoing advertisement for the company), but for practical purposes it&#x27;s hard to tell when the tube is running low, and it becomes more difficult to squeeze out product as you</li>
            <li> In most retail stores, this toothpaste is very expensive and for that reason alone I had reservations about making a purchase.  </li>
            <li> However, this tube is made of a thick plastic that returns to its normal shape after you squeeze out what you want.</li>
            <li> It says it&#x27;s mint flavored, but I can only describe the odd taste as something between rotten fruit, meat, with a hint of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I won&#x27;t buy it due to the taste alone, though if I see it on discount I would not hesitate to try some other taste from Rembrandt in the future.</li>
            <li> I estimate actual toothpaste volume was only about half the volume of the air-filled package, or perhaps a bit less.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of use, increasing effort was required to squeeze the paste onto the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have used Rembrandt Plus for several years now and since I began using it everyday I have never needed any additional whitening products.</li>
            <li> One caution, if you tend to swallow some of the toothpaste when you brush, be careful.</li>
            <li> for the whitening: I noticed very little change in the short time I used this paste.  </li>
            <li> difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But two other things concern me with this product.</li>
            <li> I also have to say that the size of the tube is extremely misleading...</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was that the tube is bulky and the paste is really difficult to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> was due to the bubbly reactions of the peroxide inside.</li>
            <li> Also, this is pretty expensive compared to other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> then other toothpaste</li>
            <li> I do drink Diet Coke like it may disappear tomorrow, and this seems to keep the stains at bay longer than any other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I got the toothpaste and the tubes were half empty.</li>
            <li> It was so hard to squeeze that whenever I let go of the force squeezing the tube, it would suck back into the tube!</li>
            <li> I get asked at least once a week if I recently whitened my teeth.  </li>
            <li> This led to a feeling of being cheated -- a big tube masking a very small amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes in fancy packaging, is expensive, tastes gross, and doesn&#x27;t do enough of what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It foams up, I assume because of the peroxide, and has a slightly peroxide taste that may bother some people.  </li>
            <li> Since very few consumers look at the weight of the product, placing very little product into a larger than required container borders on deceptive marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertised</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure I would recommend this to anyone over any other brand, though I would not say \\&quot;don&#x27;t buy it\\&quot; either.</li>
            <li> It does foam a little which makes you feel like it is getting between the teeth and closer to the gum lines.</li>
            <li> This product does what it advertises, but could use a little stronger mint accent.</li>
            <li> Every day, I put it in my green, Earth-friendly bag and take it to work.  </li>
            <li> Initially, it took me some time adapting to the thin, watery paste.  </li>
            <li> Also I did not enjoy the hydrogen peroxide taste.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I generally love anything Wintergreen, but this is just plain nasty tasting!  </li>
            <li> as Wintergreen, there is very little mint flavor to this product.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen any change in whiteness and the texture and taste are not particularly appealing.</li>
            <li> However, keep in mind that toothpaste, no matter how expensive, is ineffective if not properly used.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are noticeably whiter after a just a few days of using it!  </li>
            <li> The taste is bland, bordering on unpleasant, and there is a gritty texture.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad toothpaste, it just doesn&#x27;t live up to expectation.</li>
            <li> but it left my mouth feeling numb.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a matter of personal taste and just how badly you want to whiten your teeth low-cost at home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this may be a personal taste, but I hate the flavor of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is on the thin, watery side.  </li>
            <li> The tube is made of thick rigid plastic and difficult to squeeze the product out.</li>
            <li> The tube is made of a stiff plastic which makes dispensing a bit awkward.   </li>
            <li> I am not impressed in any way with this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is when I have to report that I do not like the taste of this Wintergreen Rembrandt at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad though</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the worst part of it is that I woke up to a sore throat the morning after I used it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product ... I really did. But my mouth never really felt clean after using it. I&#x27;m sure my teeth / mouth **were** clean, because I kept brushing and brushing to try to get that \\&quot;clean\\&quot; feeling -- but that clean feeling never came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, while considering the overall product, I also didn&#x27;t care for the tube design.  Most toothpaste tubes will compress and stay compressed as you use the product. However, this tube is made of a thick plastic that returns to its normal shape after you squeeze out what you want. My question: For what purpose?  It might make for a standardized appearance and look nicer on a bathroom counter (and therefore also serve as an ongoing advertisement for the company), but for practical purposes it&#x27;s hard to tell when the tube is running low, and it becomes more difficult to squeeze out product as you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, the product smells just like Pepto-Bismal ... not exactly a smell I want to experience when starting my day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I didn&#x27;t like this toothpaste after the first week, out of fairness I forced myself to keep with it for a few more weeks, thinking maybe it would grow on me.  It didn&#x27;t.  I realize other folks enjoy this product, but I&#x27;m rating it as \\&quot;blech\\&quot; and giving it one star.</li>
            <li> At first opening, the 2.6 ounce tube was already mostly devoid of product.  After only a few days of use, increasing effort was required to squeeze the paste onto the toothbrush.  Since very few consumers look at the weight of the product, placing very little product into a larger than required container borders on deceptive marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advertised as Wintergreen, there is very little mint flavor to this product.  The taste is bland, bordering on unpleasant, and there is a gritty texture.  These are probably good things, as there is a warning label cautioning users against swallowing this toothpaste due to the peroxide.  (One shouldn&#x27;t swallow toothpaste anyway, but a more pleasing flavor might have made that more likely.)  In my opinion, children should not have access to this product under any circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whitening: I noticed very little change in the short time I used this paste.  Frankly, with the high cost of Rembrandt toothpaste, balanced against the very minor effectiveness, I will opt for treatments from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning to my preferred brand of toothpaste: [[ASIN:B000MNJHYK Tom&#x27;s of Maine]].</li>
            <li> I love mint flavored toothpaste. In terms of the generally popular brands, I use colgate and sensodyne, arm and hammer, and lastly, crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure this toothpaste cleans any better nor does it really whiten my teeth. After using it for almost a month, twice daily, I don&#x27;t see a difference. I use an oral-B electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this may be a personal taste, but I hate the flavor of this toothpaste. It says it&#x27;s mint flavored, but I can only describe the odd taste as something between rotten fruit, meat, with a hint of mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure I would recommend this to anyone over any other brand, though I would not say \\&quot;don&#x27;t buy it\\&quot; either.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste took some getting used to because it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong minty taste and contains peroxide. After using it for about a month, I haven&#x27;t noticed any big difference in the whitening of my teeth, which is what it claims to do. Perhaps by the time I finish the tube I will see some noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But two other things concern me with this product. First is the price of over $6 per tube for less than 3 ounces of paste. I agree with others that the tube does contain lots of air, which certainly makes it feel like you&#x27;re getting more than what it actually contains. There are plenty of other whitening toothpastes that cost much, much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing that concerns me is where this is manufactured. The label states that it is \\&quot;Distributed by...\\&quot;, so my guess is that it is made overseas someplace. Remember the toothpaste scare three years ago from the stuff made in China? Since that time, I&#x27;ve tried my best to check toothpaste and other oral hygiene products to find out if they&#x27;re made in the US. While this certainly doesn&#x27;t guarantee that the product will always be safe, it definitely makes me feel safer. I will pass on future purchases of this product and stick with American made Aquafresh. Not only does it taste better, but it is much, much less expensive.</li>
            <li> As someone who has smoked, drinks coffee and red wine, discolored teeth have always been a concern.  Everyone wantas white teeth and over the years all manner of companies have touted fancily packaged pastes, creams and powders, few really delivering the goods.  Rembrandt always seems to have gotten it right.  The taste is pleasant, yet always \\&quot;feels\\&quot; like a clinical dental product rather than a \\&quot;yummy\\&quot; one or others that taste of too much spice.  And you know what?  It works.  The proof is in the smile!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t what you expect from something claiming to be Wintergreen.  I generally love anything Wintergreen, but this is just plain nasty tasting!  I gave it two stars because it&#x27;s done a decent job of whitening my teeth, but I&#x27;ve never brushed my teeth before with a toothpaste that I tried to avoid touching my tongue so I wouldn&#x27;t have to taste it!  Nasty stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - Writing reviews has become an accidental hobby for me, and it always makes my day to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.) Also, if you have any questions, clarifications, or comments please feel free to leave a comment below. I usually respond pretty quickly and almost always within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed in any way with this product. I have not seen any change in whiteness and the texture and taste are not particularly appealing. I find it defies purpose, but someone else might disagree.</li>
            <li> I am faithful when it comes to brushing and flossing my teeth after each meal.  I even brush and floss at work.  Unfortunately, I drink a lot of coffee to stay awake.  As a result, over time, my teeth become stained, especially the crooked tooth on the bottom row nearest the center.  I sometimes use whitening strips.  The Crest ones actually work well except sometimes they don&#x27;t always completely remove the brownish plaque from the crooked tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  About a month ago, I had my teeth cleaned.  Since then, I have been religiously using the Rembrandt Plus Peroxide Toothpaste.  (See my posted photograph on this web site.)  Every day, I put it in my green, Earth-friendly bag and take it to work.  Initially, it took me some time adapting to the thin, watery paste.  It lacks the strong, exhilarating taste and bubbly feeling of the other mint-flavored whitening toothpastes that I have used in the past.  (Rembrandt&#x27;s mint flavor is very light and doesn&#x27;t mask the slight peroxide taste.)  Furthermore, the tube of paste seems inflated with much air.  However, I was more interested in how the Rembrandt actually works.  Since using it, the stain on the crooked tooth has not reappeared.  Also, my teeth feel very slick and clean throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As far as appearances are concerned, my teeth look as though I&#x27;ve recently used whitening strips.  (One of the major ingredients in the whitening strips is peroxide.)  My teeth look very clean and white.  My only problems with Rembrandt are its cost and availability.  However, keep in mind that toothpaste, no matter how expensive, is ineffective if not properly used.  To prevent cavities, one must brush and floss FREQUENTLY.  Doing this only at night before going to bed isn&#x27;t enough.  In the long run, the prevention of cavities is more important than appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you desire cleaner, whiter teeth, then I strongly recommend using a peroxide-based toothpaste such as Rembrandt.  Rembrandt is a reliable brand that is more expensive but it also has more peroxide than the other leading brands.  Keeping one&#x27;s teeth healthy is an invaluable investment.  Purchasing a more expensive whitener may provide someone an extra incentive to brush more frequently.  In life, we tend to be more faithful (and caring) to those things in which we have invested more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B.

            <li> I used this toothpaste for several weeks, and while I actually liked the taste (I am a fan of wintergreen in general) and the breath-freshening qualities, I didn&#x27;t notice much whitening effect. I don&#x27;t smoke, and I don&#x27;t drink more than one cup of coffee a day, so it&#x27;s not as if my teeth are beyond the capabilities of a whitening toothpaste... but in all honesty I get much better results using regular toothpaste with some regular household baking soda mixed in.    I also have to say that the size of the tube is extremely misleading... it&#x27;s only maybe about half full of toothpaste. When it&#x27;s brand-new, you can roll it from the bottom (like you do when a normal tube of toothpaste is half empty) and see the tube is mainly full of air.</li>
            <li> Teeth are the most important feature to me. I am a smoker and drink lots of coffee, so keeping my teeth the whitest possible is top priority to me. I have been using Crest Whiting Toothpaste for some time now and decided to give Rembrandt a try. First thing I noticed was that the tube is bulky and the paste is really difficult to squeeze out. Like many other reviewers have mentioned, once I unscrewed the cap a force of air came out, so the tube is actually not full of the product. It was so hard to squeeze that whenever I let go of the force squeezing the tube, it would suck back into the tube! The taste is strange to put it nicely. It reminds me of the paste that dentist uses when cleaning your teeth. The paste does make a foamy lather and it was easy to spread but it left my mouth feeling numb. I did not get that clean feeling when I ran my tongue across my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different tastes, so this might work for you but I am going to stick with my Crest Toothpaste for now.</li>
            <li> I drink a Chinese black tea called Pu-erh daily, and so it&#x27;s easy for me to evaluate the whitening effect of any toothpaste. On this front I am happy to report that this Rembrandt toothpaste does seem to work well and it can remove the tea stain, as long as I keep up with the routine of brushing within an hour of drinking. However, I also note that the whitening power of my usual brand of whitening toothpaste (which starts with \\&quot;Cre\\&quot;) is just about as good.    I hope we can all agree that taste is a very personal preference. Unfortunately this is when I have to report that I do not like the taste of this Wintergreen Rembrandt at all. It&#x27;s hard to describe exactly what&#x27;s wrong with the taste, and to be fair I have tasted worse from other toothpaste and this one does rinse out well. But let&#x27;s just put it this way: I won&#x27;t buy it due to the taste alone, though if I see it on discount I would not hesitate to try some other taste from Rembrandt in the future.</li>
            <li> This product does whiten your teeth to their personal best - not as good as dentist visit results, but it sure tastes terrible. The consistency is very thick, goopy and sticky, kind of repulsive to me actually. I guess it&#x27;s a matter of personal taste and just how badly you want to whiten your teeth low-cost at home.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste works well to clean the teeth and whitens well. I drink a lot of soda and coffee and can say it does help really clean those superficial stains off well. It does foam a little which makes you feel like it is getting between the teeth and closer to the gum lines. The consistency is good and it spreads easily with the toothbrush. My only actual con to the toothpaste is it has a chemically smell and taste, which is probably the peroxide. I notice it as I brush but my husband says he doesn&#x27;t notice it once I rinse. So it isn&#x27;t overwhelming. This product does what it advertises, but could use a little stronger mint accent. Of course if you don&#x27;t like mint this would be a plus.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is known for this... the peroxide taste and this particular brand will have your mouth feeling as if it has just left a doctor&#x27;s office... you know, with the smell of antiseptic, sterilization and cleaners.  I used this and while my teeth did feel great and the desired effect of slightly more whitening was achieved (I think...), the price to pay was a suds like/peroxide like aftertaste that lasted a little longer than I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad though, is that the tube &#x27;looks&#x27; full, but surprise surprise, it actually isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s full of air.  So you&#x27;re not even getting all that much toothpaste - if you think, when you hold it in your hand that it&#x27;s too light, it actually is.  It isn&#x27;t a bad toothpaste, it just doesn&#x27;t live up to expectation.</li>
            <li> At first this toothpaste seemed good, with it&#x27;s pearly-look and pleasant taste, but at the end of the tube, I was sick of it.  I don&#x27;t think it really whitens your teeth at all - it just gives you the illusion it is doing so because of the look of the white suds it makes.  Also, the taste is so mild, that I began to feel my breath was never as fresh as when I used Crest or Colgate products.  I threw the tube out before it was completely empty so as to get back to my good old Colgate tartar control paste.  I also highly recommend using tartar-control products.  Personally, I have seen a huge difference in my dental health when I began to do so.  This paste does not seem to have the chemicals which fight tartar so effectively.  It doesn&#x27;t say so on the label anyway.</li>
            <li> I realize that the same item, toothpaste, food, or other, can taste totally different to two different people, just as pheromones may affect the attraction of those same two to totally different people. That said, I think this particular toothpaste actually tastes moldy. If the apocalypse happened, and I survived, and there was no other toothpaste anywhere, I might go ahead and use it, or maybe not. So if I&#x27;m not willing to brush with it to begin with, its whitening capability really doesn&#x27;t matter, does it?</li>
            <li> I was sent a free tube of this product to review.  The taste and texture are not as pleasant as other whitening toothpastes (such as Colgate). The tube is made of a stiff plastic which makes dispensing a bit awkward.   I have no complaints about effectiveness, but in a market as crowded as that for whitening fluoride toothpaste, one can do better. I will not be repurchasing, and am not eager to finish the free tube I received.</li>
            <li> I have long been interested in Rembrandt toothpaste, but was put off by the price, so have made do with more modest whitening toothpaste products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that with continuous use, this toothpaste would have an important edge over other whitening toothpastes. The peroxide taste and feel is palpable, and peroxide is the main active ingredient in most commercial whitening strips. The taste does not bother me much. If you&#x27;ve ever used peroxide as a mouthwash, you&#x27;ll be used to it. But make no mistake, the supposed wintergreen flavor only partially masks the underlying peroxide taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the taste, which may be a turnoff for many, the tube also puffed up -- which I may be mistaken in presuming was due to the bubbly reactions of the peroxide inside. There was a clear \\&quot;poof\\&quot; of escaping air under pressure when I opened the tube, which remained distended. I estimate actual toothpaste volume was only about half the volume of the air-filled package, or perhaps a bit less. This led to a feeling of being cheated -- a big tube masking a very small amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if whitening is your main aim, I believe this toothpaste will likely take you closer to that goal than others I have tried. For this reason, I would recommend it to those for whom this is the main aim. Still, I would not expect any noticeable whitening effect after one or two tubes. And there are also questions regarding the potential effectiveness of this product as compared to whitening strips, so users should do their research first.</li>
            <li> I have used Rembrandt products from Amazon in the past and was very happy with everything however, not the case this time.  I got the toothpaste and the tubes were half empty. On the plus side, my teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> Well, when I first got this toothpaste and opened it up a lot of the product spurted out of the tube, and I wasn&#x27;t even squeezing it. It basically is only half air and half product, it also has a strong taste of peroxide. But the worst part of it is that I woke up to a sore throat the morning after I used it. I did some research and this toothpaste caused irritation of my oral mucosa, which is caused from the peroxide itself. I have tried many other peroxide products for teeth and this is the only one that carried this side effect. I believe it is because this product seems to carry a too high amount of peroxide for a toothpaste, especially if you try to clean your tongue very well because the product gets closer to the back of the throat.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is on the thin, watery side.  Flavor is good, however I bought it for whitening.  It is so thin that more goes down my throat than stay in my mouth on my teeth.  Save your money and get something that stays applied to where it belongs, or you may gag using this.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use Rembrandt toothpaste.  Normally, I use fluoride rinse for health of my teeth and adding whitening solution toothpaste seemed like a good addition to my oral hygene.  In most retail stores, this toothpaste is very expensive and for that reason alone I had reservations about making a purchase.  With Vine offer I have received one (not three) 2.6oz tube to sample.  I liked wintergreen taste that leaves minty flavor after brushing.  Teeth looked whiter after some use and it can complement teeth cleaning done by professional dentist to make sure white color remains longer.  For people who cannot afford $7/toothpaste it is a solution to consider for once in a while consumption for added esthetic look.</li>
            <li> This review is for Rembrandt Plus Peroxide Toothpaste, Wintergreen Flavor, 2.6-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3). The packaging of this product was appropriate, and there was no damage to the contents. The consistency of the toothpaste was nice -- not too gritty. The wintergreen flavor was also quite nice. I do not particularly notice a brightening of my teeth yet, but this would likely take several weeks to see a difference. To be updated!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste did not deliver any noticeable whitening for me. Also I did not enjoy the hydrogen peroxide taste. The mint flavoring was not strong enough to mask the hydrogen peroxide taste nor was it strong enough to even freshen my breath. The tube is made of thick rigid plastic and difficult to squeeze the product out. Also, this is pretty expensive compared to other toothpastes. If you want real whitening, try whitening strips or get Zoom whitening from your dentist. I get Zoom from my dentist when I need instant whitening. Then I use Crest White Strips to maintain my teeth&#x27;s whiteness afterwards. I am able to maintain very white teeth with this regimen despite that I regularly enjoy  coffee, tea, red, tomato sauce, and soy sauce. I don&#x27;t see the point of this toothpaste. It comes in fancy packaging, is expensive, tastes gross, and doesn&#x27;t do enough of what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Overall, I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Rembrandt Plus for several years now and since I began using it everyday I have never needed any additional whitening products.</li>
            <li> My husband used this brand. Because of the oxygenarator or something in it, it may squirt out at you like a big geyser and become empty. He likes the toothpaste well, just have to be careful to release the &amp;#34;gas&amp;#34; as not to lose the content too fast.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for 6 years, along with the mouthwash.  I get asked at least once a week if I recently whitened my teeth.  This is the best toothpaste.  It may be pricier then other toothpaste but this will make your teeth white.  The taste is good and there is no after lingering taste.  I have never used without the Rembrandt mouthwash so my recommendation is you need to use both for great results.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is a toothpaste and tooth whitening brand I trust. And this Rembrandt Plus Peroxide Toothpaste, Wintergreen Flavor is no exception. Within 5 days, my teeth were noticeably whiter and I usually only brush once a day. I have sensitive teeth so I can use this for just about a week before I need to alternate with a different paste. One caution, if you tend to swallow some of the toothpaste when you brush, be careful. This does upset your stomach. The flavor is okay. Don&#x27;t expect a refreshing mint taste. There&#x27;s too much peroxide for that. But it does what it claims to do and I highly recommend Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> Only received a sample of 2.6 oz, used up in two weeks. Can&#x27;t really tell if it helped or not.</li>
            <li> So I am a coffee drinker and when I saw this toothpaste I was definitely going to try it!  Well, I can say that it DOES work for whitening your teeth. My teeth are noticeably whiter after a just a few days of using it!  However, the hydrogen peroxide in the toothpaste makes me kinda gaggy when I am brushing with it. The question you have to answer is: Are you willing to suffer a tad bit to get your teeth white? :)  Other than that the toothpaste is awesome!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this toothpaste.  It makes a definite improvement on whiteness on the teeth.  It also has a pleasing flavor that doesn&#x27;t remind you of toilet bowl cleaner like many toothpastes do.  It also has a smooth texture that doesn&#x27;t leave a gritty film on your teeth like some of the whitening toothpastes can do.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality toothpaste product. It has a fancy texture and an interesting taste sensation. It seems to whiten teeth, but you still probably need to use separate teeth whitening products or get whitening treatments from your dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste for about two weeks. So far, I&#x27;ve not noticed any whitening effect. However the taste is not unpleasant, unlike other whitening toothpastes I have used. I took pictures of my teeth before and will give it a couple more weeks, then take another picture for comparison. So far, I&#x27;m not impressed. I&#x27;ll be switching back to my toothpaste for sensitive teeth as soon as this tube is used up. Will update review (and rating) if the \\&quot;after\\&quot; pictures show significant improvement.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste seems to help keep my teeth whiter longer between dentist whitening.  I do drink Diet Coke like it may disappear tomorrow, and this seems to keep the stains at bay longer than any other toothpaste.  It foams up, I assume because of the peroxide, and has a slightly peroxide taste that may bother some people.  Personally I like the taste and the foam, but YMMV.  The only issue I have is that it gets thicker and harder to squeeze out as you use the tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not all that concerned with whitening as a perk of my toothpaste, though I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference either way. However, it&#x27;s a nice-tasting, not particularly sweet or overpowering toothpaste, and it does a rather good job of cleaning up my teeth every time I brush. So I&#x27;d definitely recommend it if you want a decent alternative to gels and chalky pastes!</li>
            <li> Difficult to use and get paste out of the tube and tube is only partially filled. Also question the cleaning ability</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews thinking i will get a beautiful white, so far not that bad. any way good product.</li>
