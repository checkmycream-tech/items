            <li>, aromatherapy can be paired with steam and this device is designed to create a wonderful session.</li>
            <li>This steamer is awesome.</li>
            <li>Steam is great, however, because it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;floor&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sweating and that&#x27;s good for the skin and hair.</li>
            <li>It does amazing wonder for my face as well.</li>
            <li>- this is where I notice it shut off,  If my head bumped it or moved just gotta find the perfect spot if your head is too far up</li>
            <li>Everything is as described and worked great the first time.</li>
            <li>Simply adding the scent desired to the water will establish a wonderful mood.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;i had the hardest time with my delivery crew but once my steamer arrived i opened it to make sure everything was in the package and that nothing was broken(others said the product arrived cracked).</li>
            <li>Well one of the things the instructions leaves out is you have to lock the water cup in place by screwing it into the top.</li>
            <li>Think I like it more as I type.</li>
            <li>but it also relaxes and lifts the cuticle so that products, like conditioners, can better penetrate.</li>
            <li>If you have longer hair, it&#x27;s best to lift it up and pin it so it can benefit from the steam, especially the ends that tend to be them most damaged.</li>
            <li>It is designed so that the steam is spread out around the hood and doesn&#x27;t just shoot up to the top.</li>
            <li>I love the steam.</li>
            <li>Upon first use i put the product together perfectly poured spring water in the container because the instructions say not to use distilled or pure water, turned on the unit</li>
            <li>But all in all, pretty good for an at-home steamer.</li>
            <li>idk how i ever survived w/o a steamer and so far this one is holding up great.</li>
            <li>The product was easy to assemble as well.</li>
            <li>When it worked, it worked fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sensitive to moving and adjustments which I think is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks I&#x27;m enjoying the product NOW!</li>
            <li>Essential oils are a great place to start.  </li>
            <li>After that, it makes a high-pitched squealing sound then cuts itself off.</li>
            <li>The Ivation 2-in-1 Tabletop Hair &amp; Facial Steamer W/ozone is a great product for those who want the salon experience at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>in the original box, used filtered water, drained and cleaned according to instruction...</li>
            <li>Treat it like a baby, clean after each use and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you get the right height, the product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, and set up is super easy.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m underneath steamer and it&#x27;s full steam.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to set up and steam surrounds the head but doesn&#x27;t get uncomfortably hot.</li>
            <li>thing is very sensitive.place on a secure surface.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Face - really great steam rotate your face around or center yourself in the middle for a neutral stream I love it</li>
            <li>Steam is an incredibly powerful thing.  </li>
            <li>Now if I could only get the spouse to provide a nice massage, life will be glorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So worth buying.</li>
            <li>I will feel like I got my monies worth....</li>
            <li>This steamer is easy to set up (my 10-year old did it) and starts to work quickly.</li>
            <li>For my hair, moisture from steam gently and fully absorbs into the cells of each hair making them thicker, fuller, stronger and more vibrant.  </li>
            <li>then i have to find the right chair.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>face steamer part is even better, it opens pores to get rid of impurities, then you can use a toner or splash with cool water to close the pores back</li>
            <li>It can power machinery, heat cities, homes and provide light, but best of all, in my humble opinion, it can do so much for one, personally.  </li>
            <li>It is hard to judge, but O3 is supposed to help whatever treatment that has been applied to the hair &#x27;soak in&#x27; more effectively.</li>
            <li>My dad begged to use it first</li>
            <li>I love lavender essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had never heard of a hair steamer so after some research I felt it would be great for my dry short hair.</li>
            <li>For the face, it just feels and smells good, especially if you add a drop or two of an essential oil like tea tree.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to assemble and operate.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and I&#x27;ve used it about twice a week w/o any problems.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Negatives out of the way, I really like this \\&quot;spa at home\\&quot; device.</li>
            <li>to know If you have fine antiques and live in a dry climate, the introduction of daily steam to the house can keep precious items moist and prevent cracking and dehydration of wood, plaster and fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>mode, there is not enough length in the &amp;#34;connective&amp;#34; pipe for comfort (which doesn&#x27;t allow for full coverage  of one&#x27;s head: the nap/neck area).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just purchased this steamer about 2 1/2 weeks ago and it arrived quick and was really simple to set up.</li>
            <li>It goes off too quickly and then you can&#x27;t turn it back on.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a simple steamer to moisturize natural hair or if you are looking for a steamer to use for your face, it&#x27;s a cheap buy that does what its designed to do.</li>
            <li>There is an automatic shut off but it also turns on if you plug it back in, so make sure you don&#x27;t count on just that and actually turn off</li>
            <li>Make sure that the water cup is locked tightly in place or else the steamer won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>The steam reached all of my hair (but i have been told i have a little head idk), but i still pinned up my ends to the top of my head.</li>
            <li>The O3 (ozone) feature really puts this in the professional realm.</li>
            <li>I never knew about hair steaming but from what I&#x27;ve read about it is is more beneficial for really curly and especially black hair.</li>
            <li>Flimsy construction, but works well so far.  </li>
            <li>The results were soft conditioned 4c hair.</li>
            <li>but it does make my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>the attachements are at a fixed height.</li>
            <li>B00P6L1OXA Ivation 2-in-1 Tabletop Hair &amp; Facial Steamer]] is an incredibly useful, helpful and easy-to-handle accessory for home and personal care.</li>
            <li>I typically like to sit under the steamer for about 25-30 minutes for a full deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>Bam that&#x27;s done, but now the deep conditioner has been in my hair way to long; but I went through way to much not to steam my hair so 10 mins was what i decided to do.</li>

            <li> so idk I need to keep it on a flat surface and NOT move it while its on.</li>
            <li> how long I should steam</li>
            <li> I deep conditioned my hair with shea moisture raw deep treatment mask and added olive oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll first start off by saying I was concerned from the negative reviews about the product not working after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I do wish the product came with maintenance instructions (cleaning) but other than that  </li>
            <li> Cracked due to over heating of device</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to send it back</li>
            <li> Afterwards, just wipe it all down after use and empty any remaining water.</li>
            <li> I was very careful with assembly and storage...</li>
            <li> in all I rate the hair apparatus a 7/10 and the face 9/10....for an average of say 8, 8.5.</li>
            <li> If this thing last me at least one year...</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m about to sit down</li>
            <li> I have a little over a week and a half now</li>
            <li> so i wanted to wait until i used this a few times to review so here</li>
            <li> The steam does a few things, it hydrates the hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a water sterilizer built in, though I don&#x27;t have trouble with our water.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why my review is so late.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get at least 20 minutes out of it.</li>
            <li> Treat it delicate and</li>
            <li> Mine came broken on the hood</li>
            <li> The gel plug is difficult to remove and insert.</li>
            <li> The warning tone when the session is over is a bit annoying, but just shut the unit off and it disappears.</li>
            <li> very bad quality, almost got burned ..</li>

            <li> Steam is an incredibly powerful thing.  It can power machinery, heat cities, homes and provide light, but best of all, in my humble opinion, it can do so much for one, personally.  Steam can moisturize the skin and hair, humidify the air, and scent your lair (pun intended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my skin, moisturizing with simple steam, preferably combined with a moisturizing cream, can open the pores, allowing both the steam and the cream to reach deep into the skin.  For my hair, moisture from steam gently and fully absorbs into the cells of each hair making them thicker, fuller, stronger and more vibrant.  For those with brittle hair, steam helps prevent cracking, and thus loss of hair.  I notice this steamer helps emulate what my &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; shampoo can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the home, aromatherapy can be paired with steam and this device is designed to create a wonderful session. Simply adding the scent desired to the water will establish a wonderful mood.  Essential oils are a great place to start.  Now if I could only get the spouse to provide a nice massage, life will be glorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to know If you have fine antiques and live in a dry climate, the introduction of daily steam to the house can keep precious items moist and prevent cracking and dehydration of wood, plaster and fabrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the [[ASIN:B00P6L1OXA Ivation 2-in-1 Tabletop Hair &amp; Facial Steamer]] is an incredibly useful, helpful and easy-to-handle accessory for home and personal care. Get steamed today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Everything is as described and worked great the first time.</li>
            <li> So worth buying. Thank you!</li>
            <li> okay so i wanted to wait until i used this a few times to review so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i had the hardest time with my delivery crew but once my steamer arrived i opened it to make sure everything was in the package and that nothing was broken(others said the product arrived cracked). Upon first use i put the product together perfectly poured spring water in the container because the instructions say not to use distilled or pure water, turned on the unit and it just beeped. Well one of the things the instructions leaves out is you have to lock the water cup in place by screwing it into the top. well that&#x27;s done so i&#x27;m about to sit down and of course the unit isn&#x27;t adjustable.so then i have to find the right chair. Bam that&#x27;s done, but now the deep conditioner has been in my hair way to long; but I went through way to much not to steam my hair so 10 mins was what i decided to do. The steam reached all of my hair (but i have been told i have a little head idk), but i still pinned up my ends to the top of my head. once i was done my curls was poppin. i have noticed some white build up on the metal piece but i just wipe with a paper towel. the blue plastic part of the hood started to separate but i just popped it back in place. I do wish the product came with maintenance instructions (cleaning) but other than that  idk how i ever survived w/o a steamer and so far this one is holding up great.</li>
            <li> Using it now. It&#x27;s very sensitive to moving and adjustments which I think is a good thing. Had difficulty setting it up. All parts were in place and it didn&#x27;t work. Now I&#x27;m underneath steamer and it&#x27;s full steam. Think I like it more as I type. Kept looking for the steam it was no show until the water started boiling. Duh. I don&#x27;t know the outcome or how long I should steam but I&#x27;m sweating and that&#x27;s good for the skin and hair. Wish the cord was longer. Found an extension cord in the house to connect it. Use a cup or something to catch the dripping water. My dad begged to use it first so that&#x27;s why my review is so late. About to open a hair salon with this. Thanks I&#x27;m enjoying the product NOW!</li>
            <li> I have now used this twice - the second time with a stopwatch. It takes 3 minutes to boil water and begin producing steam. But it only steams for 15 minutes. After that, it makes a high-pitched squealing sound then cuts itself off. So you can only do a 15 minute treatment before the device overheats. Maybe this is sufficient for you. I was hoping to get at least 20 minutes out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this steamer about 2 1/2 weeks ago and it arrived quick and was really simple to set up. It heats up fast and I&#x27;ve used it about twice a week w/o any problems. Make sure that the water cup is locked tightly in place or else the steamer won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Flimsy construction, but works well so far.  Keeping my fingers and toes crossed for its longevity.</li>
            <li> Between 3 and 4 Stars - until....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see the attached pictures: THIS IS NOT INNOVATION that I received. Matter of fact I think I want my money back, this is bait and switch. This O&#x27;Hair Steamer...is not what shows in the description or picture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll first start off by saying I was concerned from the negative reviews about the product not working after a few uses. I have a little over a week and a half now and I have used it for both my hair and face. Treat it delicate and kind!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is very sensitive.place on a secure surface. I noticed the cord and wiring shuts it off its unbalanced and what not....but it worked later on when I did my face so idk I need to keep it on a flat surface and NOT move it while its on. Treat it like a baby, clean after each use and hope for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face - really great steam rotate your face around or center yourself in the middle for a neutral stream I love it I use it 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair - this is where I notice it shut off,  If my head bumped it or moved just gotta find the perfect spot if your head is too far up I think it shuts off..the steam also rotates so if you don&#x27;t feel it at one spot its working its way around it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I rate the hair apparatus a 7/10 and the face 9/10....for an average of say 8, 8.5. If this thing last me at least one year...I will feel like I got my monies worth....I do see and feel results. Nonetheless I am gonna contact the seller to see why the bait and switch!</li>
            <li> very bad quality, almost got burned .. DONT BUY IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money, and set up is super easy. I deep conditioned my hair with shea moisture raw deep treatment mask and added olive oil. The results were soft conditioned 4c hair. Only issue is it didn&#x27;t seem to reach the back of my hair.... Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I never knew about hair steaming but from what I&#x27;ve read about it is is more beneficial for really curly and especially black hair. The steam does a few things, it hydrates the hair but it also relaxes and lifts the cuticle so that products, like conditioners, can better penetrate. If you have longer hair, it&#x27;s best to lift it up and pin it so it can benefit from the steam, especially the ends that tend to be them most damaged. This steamer is easy to set up (my 10-year old did it) and starts to work quickly. It is designed so that the steam is spread out around the hood and doesn&#x27;t just shoot up to the top. I like that it has the ability to be a facial steamer as well because investing in this for just the hair steamer might be a stretch for some. Having both features is an added benefit.

            <li> Steam is great, however, because it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;floor&amp;#34; mode, there is not enough length in the &amp;#34;connective&amp;#34; pipe for comfort (which doesn&#x27;t allow for full coverage  of one&#x27;s head: the nap/neck area). The gel plug is difficult to remove and insert.</li>
            <li> Cracked due to over heating of device</li>
            <li> It goes off too quickly and then you can&#x27;t turn it back on. I typically like to sit under the steamer for about 25-30 minutes for a full deep conditioning treatment. But all in all, pretty good for an at-home steamer. Not salon quality though.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. I didn&#x27;t have to refill it or anything and I would say that it ran for thirty minutes without using the entire container. Mine came broken on the hood but it was still usable. I&#x27;m too lazy to send it back but it does make my hair soft and moisturized. If you&#x27;re looking for a simple steamer to moisturize natural hair or if you are looking for a steamer to use for your face, it&#x27;s a cheap buy that does what its designed to do.</li>
            <li> This steamer is awesome. It does just what was promised. It does amazing wonder for my face as well. I love the steam. It is so invigorating and calming. The product was easy to assemble as well.</li>
            <li> This would be a 5-star review but for two things. 1) the attachements are at a fixed height. This means you have to either have a chair that can be raised or lowered, or you have to somehow move the entire unit so that it is placed just right. 2) the water reservior holds only enough water for about a 20 minute treatment, I think it could have been larger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives out of the way, I really like this \\&quot;spa at home\\&quot; device. A product like this is what some salons would use for either facial steaming or for hair treatments. The O3 (ozone) feature really puts this in the professional realm. You don&#x27;t have to have it on, but it is there via a separate button. It is hard to judge, but O3 is supposed to help whatever treatment that has been applied to the hair &#x27;soak in&#x27; more effectively. For the face, it just feels and smells good, especially if you add a drop or two of an essential oil like tea tree. Once you get the right height, the product is easy to use. You can fill it via the back dispenser or by removing the cup in the front. Afterwards, just wipe it all down after use and empty any remaining water. The warning tone when the session is over is a bit annoying, but just shut the unit off and it disappears. The Ivation 2-in-1 Tabletop Hair &amp; Facial Steamer W/ozone is a great product for those who want the salon experience at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> Easy enough to assemble and operate. When it worked, it worked fine. After about ten uses, the heating element no longer worked. At this cost, this is not a throwaway product, so I am giving two stars. I was very careful with assembly and storage...in the original box, used filtered water, drained and cleaned according to instruction... so I know this was not the issue. Mine was probably defective.</li>
            <li> We are send this product back we plugged it up and it does not work</li>
            <li> I had never heard of a hair steamer so after some research I felt it would be great for my dry short hair. The steam opens the follicles and help increase absorption of conditioners, oil treatments etc. It&#x27;s easy to set up and steam surrounds the head but doesn&#x27;t get uncomfortably hot. It&#x27;s pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face steamer part is even better, it opens pores to get rid of impurities, then you can use a toner or splash with cool water to close the pores back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if that isn&#x27;t enough you can put in essential oil and turn your room into a spa like retreat with humidity and scent. I love lavender essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a water sterilizer built in, though I don&#x27;t have trouble with our water. This feature would be helpful depending on water quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual is short on verbal directions but walks you through it manually. There is an automatic shut off but it also turns on if you plug it back in, so make sure you don&#x27;t count on just that and actually turn off the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
