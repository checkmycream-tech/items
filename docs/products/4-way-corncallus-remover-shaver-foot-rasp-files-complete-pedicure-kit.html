            <li>unless you have princess feet and only plan on retouching perfect feet.</li>
            <li>I was expecting them to be of better quality.</li>
            <li>so if you plan to get some work out of the product, consider a better quality version.</li>
            <li>I could construct a better product myself ......</li>
            <li>It handles fall off easily</li>
            <li>Item cheaply made and fell apart before I even got it out of the package.</li>
            <li>The sandpaper was stuck with cheap glue and it came apart.</li>
            <li>Handles don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>this product is very cheap and you will throw it away the first time you intend to use it.</li>
            <li>and I was not using full strength.</li>
            <li>My feet overall feel much better and a lot more ready for summertime.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t send this back because it would be more pain than it is worth</li>
            <li>The first time I attempted to use this tool, the pad came right off on the first swipe.</li>

            <li>The blade on the callus shaver fell off as soon as I took it out of package, the remover top also came off and after one sand down the embory board on the sander fell off.</li>
            <li>This works in a pinch if you really don&#x27;t want to pay for a professional pedicure, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you want salon quality.</li>
            <li>I used each tool in the order it suggested and then using the last one (pictured 3rd to the right), it broke.</li>
            <li>It fell apart the first time I used it, and could have possibly caused minor injuries because of the sharp metal pieces.</li>

            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Used the other piece to rub callouses.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a big deal because one of the other tools has a similar surface but considering it was fist time using it, it&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The other pieces (including the snapping head function, which is supposed to attach the pieces) were broken before I completed one foot.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I used them once and then threw them away, they were not a good quality and they kept dismantling by pieces.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money !</li>
            <li> This item was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> to so you end up using your hand behind the tool instead of on the wand itself.</li>
            <li> It has a plastic interchangeable handle which would not have been so bad if it did not fall off of the other attachments.  </li>
            <li> Poor construction and no real utility Picking up the blade that always falls off is dangerous!</li>
            <li> One of the tools was broken when I received it; the rest are made of poor quality materials and badly made</li>

            <li> Set did a good job for one pedicure and then fell apart. Kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> 2 of the 4 pieces fell apart on the first use. I do not recommend you buy this product! CHEAP!</li>
            <li> The connections don&#x27;t properly</li>
            <li> One of the tools was broken when I received it; the rest are made of poor quality materials and badly made</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your money this product is very cheap and you will throw it away the first time you intend to use it. unless you have princess feet and only plan on retouching perfect feet.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today. I used each tool in the order it suggested and then using the last one (pictured 3rd to the right), it broke. The filing surface fell off the plastic. It&#x27;s not really a big deal because one of the other tools has a similar surface but considering it was fist time using it, it&#x27;s pretty annoying. My feet overall feel much better and a lot more ready for summertime. This works in a pinch if you really don&#x27;t want to pay for a professional pedicure, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you want salon quality.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. I was expecting them to be of better quality. They do not even work. I would expect this quality from the $1 store</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY I don&#x27;t know why this has such bad reviews and why people are saying it broke right away. I have been using mine once a week in the shower. It works great and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product on several occasions and found that the razor does not work and keeps popping off. The emery strip has peeled back and the other parts have just broken off. Maybe I am too rough with it. But, it did not work for me. Will consider another product. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. The cutter blade falls apart. Poor construction and no real utility Picking up the blade that always falls off is dangerous!</li>
            <li> This set was horrible!!  It has a plastic interchangeable handle which would not have been so bad if it did not fall off of the other attachments.  The foot file actually fell apart in my hand after 2 minutes of use and the metal files did nothing.  I was so upset that I ended up throwing it away.  Don&#x27;t buy this item!!</li>
            <li> does what it is suppose to do and does it well. No worries with buying this product of from this retailer</li>
            <li> Bad!!! The product came defected and then when I used broke!&lt;br /&gt;Horrible product!!! Don&#x27;t Buy it!</li>
            <li> The blade on the callus shaver fell off as soon as I took it out of package, the remover top also came off and after one sand down the embory board on the sander fell off. My feet are not that messed up and I was not using full strength. I brought this kit to do home maintenance during the two week period from my next visit to the nail salon, but it is trash.</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap!!!  Opened it, and the little scrubber thingy fell apart.  Used the other piece to rub callouses.  It fell apart.  Talk about CHINA CHEAP~!!!!  Do NOT purchase this.  You would be better off rubbing your heals along the carpet then using this piece of crap.  Useless.</li>
            <li> Doesnt fit together properly</li>
            <li> I used them once and then threw them away, they were not a good quality and they kept dismantling by pieces. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> Handle and shaver are flimsy material.</li>
            <li> great to keep your feet in shape</li>
            <li> does not work as described.</li>
            <li> This item was broken when I received it. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this crap. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Very good ...but need a bit of improvements</li>
            <li> This is a very cheaply made product.  It handles fall off easily so if you plan to get some work out of the product, consider a better quality version.</li>
            <li> Worst pedicure set ever. Broke on first use. Simply fell apart in my hands. Don&#x27;t waste your money. ;(</li>
            <li> wife likes it seems to be doing the trick. no more rough heels rubbing me at night</li>
            <li> This product does not work very disappointed. Would not recommend to anyone. One piece that goes into the handle doesnt stay together.</li>
            <li> The foot rasper was broken before it even left the package. The other pieces (including the snapping head function, which is supposed to attach the pieces) were broken before I completed one foot. Seriously. This entire item is a big waste of plastic. The last foot scraper I had my Mom bought me and it came from a dollar store and lasted 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t send this back because it would be more pain than it is worth, I&#x27;m sure another unit would be just as big a piece of junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap !!!! DO NOT BUY !!!! Save your hard earned money ! I could construct a better product myself ...... This lousy piece of junk shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be sold</li>
            <li> Must have for a medical bag.</li>
            <li> this is not what I wanted, and soon as I opened it, two of the attachment just broke apart, before I even had a chance to use it.  This is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> this item is cheaply made and fell apart the second I tried to use it! Do not buy this! The handle comes out of the heads when yo are trying to use it</li>
            <li> Save your money two things broke</li>
            <li> Item cheaply made and fell apart before I even got it out of the package.</li>
            <li> There were parts of this product that worked great from the start. The scraper, for example. However, the attachments don&#x27;t actually attach to the wand like they&#x27;re supposed to so you end up using your hand behind the tool instead of on the wand itself. Also, the smoothing pads are attached by adhesive. The first time I attempted to use this tool, the pad came right off on the first swipe. I paid for all of the tools but only one actually works as it was professed to do. Very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> The sandpaper was stuck with cheap glue and it came apart. Handles don&#x27;t fit. Very cheap product. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> It fell apart the first time I used it, and could have possibly caused minor injuries because of the sharp metal pieces.</li>
