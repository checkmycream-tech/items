            <li>It&#x27;s smells OK but doesn&#x27;t seem to really moisturize my hair as well as wanted.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it-Cantu is a good affordable brand for African Americans like my self.very</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>The next day I just spray wateron my hair and detangle it, don&#x27;t feel like I need to re-apply, which is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to see more natural products for those of us that love our natural kinks.</li>
            <li>I tried the original Cantu products when I first went natural because alot of people love their products.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it, I also use it on my 2 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li>and I was glad to see something just for natural people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about this product but it helps  my curls a lot  when it comes to keeping them moist and shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is my favorite leave-in conditioner so far.</li>
            <li>I started to use it in these dry locs and boom never looked better!</li>
            <li>overall i&#x27;m really satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I was expecting 5 star moisture coming from this product after using for the first time</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find good leave in.</li>
            <li>First,I was curious to try this after seeing it in an Essence magazine-I must say that once I tried it I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>But I really needed something for my hair</li>
            <li>I really</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this particularly moisturizing and I felt that it just sat on my hair.</li>
            <li>I try many products and this one does not calm my friz, or keep my curls soft.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair moisturerized but be careful if you are sensitive to fragrances it has a strong scent.</li>
            <li>But this is my new bff</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for fine curly hair its very thick and leaves behind a film which doesn&#x27;t feel very good.</li>
            <li>it will not work properly if you don&#x27;t apply while it&#x27;s damp first.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair moisturize and soft.</li>
            <li>hair type is a 3c and this moisture last in my hair for about 7-8 hours straight.</li>
            <li>She uses all natural products that she creates herself.</li>
            <li>As expected Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I loveeee this entire natural hair</li>
            <li>I never reviews I brought this for my daughter who has left her hair in its natural state.</li>
            <li>Im disappointed because these products are easy to find and easy on the wallet</li>

            <li> NATURAL THOUGH) but weighed my 3b hair texture down after co washing</li>
            <li> loose curls at the back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy because I mostly don&#x27;t care about any type of magazine advertisement because I think they edit the model&#x27;s hair with photo-shop or their hair may be a lace front or something.</li>
            <li> I was astounded that I didn&#x27;t have to re-moisturize for that long.</li>
            <li> which was strange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but won&#x27;t leave my short natural hair feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that when I combed and brushed my hair that the brush just slid through so smoothly like it was air or something.</li>
            <li> and i was sooo disgusted and quite wierded out ,has alot of great ingredients in it (NOT ALL</li>
            <li> I could have just done a plain water rinse and got the same results.</li>
            <li> Just remember ladies you only need a small amount of this product.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other night</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me except make my hair hard and matted.</li>

            <li> I have really thick hair that LOVES moisture.</li>
            <li> Like seriously it felt like baby&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This has saved my hair. I&#x27;m so glad to see more natural products for those of us that love our natural kinks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it, I also use it on my 2 year old daughters hair.</li>
            <li> As stated,. As expected Fast shipping.Great exchange of info..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cantu products before. It&#x27;s smells OK but doesn&#x27;t seem to really moisturize my hair as well as wanted.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Keeps hair moisturize and soft. Smells good</li>
            <li> For $12 this is damn good.First,I was curious to try this after seeing it in an Essence magazine-I must say that once I tried it I was completely satisfied.It&#x27;s crazy because I mostly don&#x27;t care about any type of magazine advertisement because I think they edit the model&#x27;s hair with photo-shop or their hair may be a lace front or something.But I really needed something for my hair and I was glad to see something just for natural people.Let&#x27;s face it-Cantu is a good affordable brand for African Americans like my self.very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair type is a 3c and this moisture last in my hair for about 7-8 hours straight.Trust me I was astounded that I didn&#x27;t have to re-moisturize for that long.I also noticed that it made my hair softer and easier to manage-THANK GOD.After moisturizing it I was shocked that when I combed and brushed my hair that the brush just slid through so smoothly like it was air or something.Like seriously it felt like baby&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we know that Shea butter is very good.On the container I think it said 100% Shea butter-and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this but I think it&#x27;s true.I really do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---However it will not work properly if you don&#x27;t apply while it&#x27;s damp first.This product is dependent on water.Don&#x27;t damp your hair after you apply-always do it BEFORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can go to you dollar store and purchase a spray bottle and put water on your hair.Every morning before you apply you can spray your hair with water to have the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall i&#x27;m really satisfied with this product.It&#x27;s very good to be $12.Good job Cantu!</li>
            <li> This makes my curles pop. It makes my hair super soft I loveeee this entire natural hair line.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find good leave in. But this is my new bff</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out after using their regular leave in conditioner for about 2 years or so and i wanted to see what cantu naturals was working with because i LOVED the co wash . I was expecting 5 star moisture coming from this product after using for the first time and i was sooo disgusted and quite wierded out ,has alot of great ingredients in it (NOT ALL NATURAL THOUGH) but weighed my 3b hair texture down after co washing although when i was applying it it felt like i needed more which was strange. It literally felt like i had a gel on my hair. I would not recommend for fine curly hair its very thick and leaves behind a film which doesn&#x27;t feel very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this product but it helps  my curls a lot  when it comes to keeping them moist and shine.</li>
            <li> Good product does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. Just remember ladies you only need a small amount of this product. This is great for natural beauties who use the LOC method.</li>
            <li> I have 4b/4c hair and it worked well for me. I have really thick hair that LOVES moisture. My hair doesn&#x27;t need a lot to detangle so I can&#x27;t talk about its &#x27;slip&#x27; properties. I use it a lot on my twists aka my go to style. After a couple days I rinse my hair with water and use this product just on my hair. It keeps my hair moisturerized but be careful if you are sensitive to fragrances it has a strong scent. I prefer the regular Cantu Shea Butter instead of the &#x27;naturals&#x27; version.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with extremely curly hair.  I try many products and this one does not calm my friz, or keep my curls soft.  Another product in the trash.  I bought it because of the reviews but my hair is difficult.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair moisturized and smelling great.&lt;br /&gt;I get lots of compliments on how good my hair smells when I used the Cantu products.</li>
            <li> That gives me strength to say NO to relaxer. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> 3c/4a low porosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dot enjoy the smell of this product, i don&#x27;t have a frame of reference to compare it to but it&#x27;s overpowering and lingers. I didn&#x27;t find this particularly moisturizing and I felt that it just sat on my hair.</li>
            <li> leaves my locks soft, feels good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is my favorite leave-in conditioner so far. It&#x27;s thick, but won&#x27;t leave my short natural hair feeling oily. Tub kinda smells like fruit soaked in alcohol (or maybe it&#x27;s just me) but when I actually apply it to my hair it simply smells like pina colada. I wash my hair every other night and I normally only apply it after I&#x27;ve washed my hair. The next day I just spray wateron my hair and detangle it, don&#x27;t feel like I need to re-apply, which is good.</li>
            <li> Make my hair look nice and curly</li>
            <li> I tried the original Cantu products when I first went natural because alot of people love their products. It did nothing for me except make my hair hard and matted.My hair is &amp;#34;4a&amp;#34; with &amp;#34;3a&amp;#34; loose curls at the back.I used the Cantu co-wash conditioner,(which wasnt great) towel-dried my hair and applied a generous amount of the leave-in (as per directions). As I applied the leave-in it I noticed that the product did not penetrate my hair so I put on a plastic cap for about an hour to see if that would help. It didnt. I had to end up paper toweling off the most of product becuase it just sat on my hair and my hair didnt feel the least bit conditioned. It didnt make my hair hard or matted like the orignial Cantu leave in, but it didn&#x27;t dooo anything at all.  I could have just done a plain water rinse and got the same results. Im disappointed because these products are easy to find and easy on the wallet but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Your results may vary.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> I never reviews I brought this for my daughter who has left her hair in its natural state. She uses all natural products that she creates herself. I have locs; we always use products that we either can cook with or nothing else. However I tried cantu because a friend of mine uses it and my daughters hair was amazing shiny, has a fullness to it, luxurious and it smells good! I started to use it in these dry locs and boom never looked better! I am a CANTU FAN FOR LIFE!</li>
