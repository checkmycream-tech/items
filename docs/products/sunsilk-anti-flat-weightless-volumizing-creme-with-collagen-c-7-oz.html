            <li>I love Sunsilk.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product because i couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.  </li>
            <li>Used to be able to  comb through your hair easier after applying.</li>
            <li>So happy I found this here at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product,only one that puts a bounce to my fine,limp hair.  </li>
            <li>maybe it works better on thinner hair,</li>
            <li>I love that I could find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to wean myself from it since I probably won&#x27;t be able to get it any more.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and thinner now</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it is a lightweight product that helps me style my hair.</li>
            <li>Please keep it available.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair and have struggled to find safe products that make my hair look its best.</li>
            <li>The bottle is full of a water like liquid not at all like the original product.</li>
            <li>My hair is light, full, controlled and fun.</li>
            <li>This was not a disappointment despite some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to pay such a high price but loved it</li>
            <li>Could I be right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries this product since no other retail drug store carries this brand.</li>
            <li>It seems though that the product in regular bottles is not as potent as the original sample; the results are not even close to that spectacular results of little sample...</li>
            <li>so when I finally ran out and went to the store, it was discontinued(cost 7 or 8).</li>
            <li>i used this when it first came out,</li>
            <li>When I have received the little sample of the product and tried it, I was very happy with results; my hair was as promised: full and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>After endless searching in regular stores, I realized, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so was really happy</li>
            <li>Needless to say I was very delighted to find it online.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if your hair is beginning to thin.  </li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;m going to find something else and NOT pay the high price I was charged on Amazon again!</li>
            <li>so much thought I would try.</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot, and I wish that it was still being made.  </li>
            <li>This is a must-have product for people with fine and flat hair.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was still in the marketplace for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and you would recognize the brand if you&#x27;re over fifty years old!</li>
            <li>I finally found this product that I have not been able to find for a few years.</li>
            <li>I loved this product and was sad when they stopped selling it in stores.</li>
            <li>I have fine blond hair with little to no natural volume.</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with volume it is a light weight lift that isn&#x27;t sticky, just use a small amount after you shampoo, then dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works on my thin, fine, hair.  </li>

            <li> A little really goes a long way</li>

            <li> After finally trying a small sample that someone had given me, I decided to give this product a try instead of using the more expensive brands like PHYTO DAILY NOURISHING CREME.  </li>
            <li> This only takes a little bit and does a lot.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few years ago and only used it intermittently.</li>
            <li> I just rub a little into my dry hair and either style it with or without the blow dryer, it works either way.</li>

            <li> It does it all without making it feel heavy or at all weighed down.</li>

            <li> It works for me because I have thick, heavy hair and need something to give my hair body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find because the product is no longer sold in stores in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because I have thin hair, and want volume without the sticky in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this makes it easier to style.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product if your hair is beginning to thin.  It gives a lift and a feeling of volume that allows you to style your hair much better.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this product at my local stores and no one had it in stock.  Needless to say I was very delighted to find it online.  If you have a problem with volume it is a light weight lift that isn&#x27;t sticky, just use a small amount after you shampoo, then dry your hair.  Great lift.</li>
            <li> When I have received the little sample of the product and tried it, I was very happy with results; my hair was as promised: full and fluffy.  After endless searching in regular stores, I realized, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so was really happy I saw it on Amazon and bought a few bottles just in case they decide to &#x27;discontinue it&#x27;.  It seems though that the product in regular bottles is not as potent as the original sample; the results are not even close to that spectacular results of little sample... Could I be right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because I have thin hair, and want volume without the sticky in my hair. It&#x27;s hard to find because the product is no longer sold in stores in the U.S. So when I can find a deal on Amazon, I grab it. Great Product, and you would recognize the brand if you&#x27;re over fifty years old! I use to be a hair stylist and I wouldn&#x27;t put just anything on my hair.</li>
            <li> It does as it says ... Silky ...  Volumizing ... I really liked it.  I didn&#x27;t feel like I had put anything on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product for people with fine and flat hair.  After finally trying a small sample that someone had given me, I decided to give this product a try instead of using the more expensive brands like PHYTO DAILY NOURISHING CREME.  This was not a disappointment despite some of the reviews.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon carries this product since no other retail drug store carries this brand.</li>
            <li> A little really goes a long way so when I finally ran out and went to the store, it was discontinued(cost 7 or 8). I bought a 3 pack for $16 dollars on amazon a couple years ago. Why the heck is one little bottle almost $30? I&#x27;m hoping to see this product back soon because that is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I love Sunsilk.  I wish it was still in the marketplace for a decent price.  It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works on my thin, fine, hair.  But, I&#x27;m going to find something else and NOT pay the high price I was charged on Amazon again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because i couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any more.  It was disappointing as it surely doesn&#x27;t do what it used to. Used to be able to  comb through your hair easier after applying. Oh, well!! Another lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I have thin hair and this makes it easier to style.  So happy I found this here at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product,only one that puts a bounce to my fine,limp hair.  Does not weight my hair down.  Will keep a supply on hand at all times.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use product in my hair all the time and when I do I don&#x27;t like it to feel gunky. This only takes a little bit and does a lot. I just rub a little into my dry hair and either style it with or without the blow dryer, it works either way. It truly is a great product. Give it a try I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> i used this when it first came out, that was when my hair was a little thicker, it didn&#x27;t do anything for it. maybe it works better on thinner hair, idk, i havn&#x27;t used it since my hair thinned a bit</li>
            <li> I love that I could find this on Amazon.  They have stopped making it.  I am trying to wean myself from it since I probably won&#x27;t be able to get it any more.</li>
            <li> I finally found this product that I have not been able to find for a few years. It works for me because I have thick, heavy hair and need something to give my hair body. This works for me. Please keep it available.</li>
            <li> I have fine blond hair with little to no natural volume. I&#x27;ve always been looking for a product that will give me volume but not make my hair feel greasy or weighed down. This product is it! Too bad that, as usual, I find a product I like &amp; they discontinue it! :(</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair look.</li>
            <li> I will not use nothing else for now that I have found this product again. I like the way it makes my hair feel. It keeps the curl. I just think it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and have struggled to find safe products that make my hair look its best. I love the product. It controls my hair curls and keeps the friz away. It does it all without making it feel heavy or at all weighed down. My hair is light, full, controlled and fun. I will order it again &amp; will do so from this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few years ago and only used it intermittently. My hair is fine and thinner now and I have changed hairstyle to shorter look. I began using this product daily and what a difference it makes - hair has volume and body without any stiffness. When I looked for it in stores I couldn&#x27;t find it. I was so pleased to find it on Amazon.com. I bought a couple just in case.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and was sad when they stopped selling it in stores. I was hesitant to pay such a high price but loved it so much thought I would try. Big mistake. The bottle is full of a water like liquid not at all like the original product. I am one being told it&#x27;s not refundable. 32 dollars gone. I will never order from amazon again. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot, and I wish that it was still being made.  I have fine hair and it is a lightweight product that helps me style my hair.</li>
