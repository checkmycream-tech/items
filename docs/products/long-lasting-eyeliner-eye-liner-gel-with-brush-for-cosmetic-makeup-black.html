            <li>The dollar store could make better quality.</li>
            <li>Id of been better using something from the Dollar stores...</li>
            <li>i do love the eyeliner though.</li>
            <li>but it seems to never do that its more like a cream</li>
            <li>Beautiful and super easy to apply for first time gel eyeliner users!</li>
            <li>not the best but for the pprice better than I expected...</li>
            <li>I have not found an eyeliner that was this easy to apply.</li>
            <li>is too flimsy fortunately</li>
            <li>but it was defenetly worth it since i recived a M.A.C gel eyeliner which am compleatly in love with it .</li>
            <li>but it was cheap</li>
            <li>Does not go on smoothly at all.</li>
            <li>This went on smoothly and without a fuss.</li>
            <li>Seems to smudge super easy</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this product is the brush and that it easily applies.</li>
            <li>his product is ok it is not easy to apply  was a great price.</li>
            <li>It was cool.</li>
            <li>Cool.</li>
            <li>Its a good product, I only wish it lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li>NOT BAD.</li>
            <li>it dries quick</li>
            <li>Easy to use, Lasts long, looks amazing when applied.</li>
            <li>It is very bold in color, the brush I didn&#x27;t care to much for.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a plus also the price is good and shipping was fast as well overall</li>
            <li>I bought this because i read other customers write good reviews.</li>
            <li>i have eye allergies and it comes right of when my eyes tears up.</li>
            <li>Put it on and forget it.sharp black color and good price.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I did read the reviews first and people said theirs came in a mac packaging mine came in a box with the ANGELA on it.</li>
            <li>I received a MAC gel eyeliner looks exactly like in the photo &amp;</li>
            <li>and it comes with a pretty efficient brush</li>
            <li>so this came in all mac packaging firstly.</li>
            <li>you may have to touch up 6 hours after first app but for the price</li>
            <li>, I packed it with black eye shadow and after all was said and done, i love the gel liner!</li>
            <li>The brush applicator is super soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>and if you need it really matte</li>
            <li>very versatile.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t care because I wasn&#x27;t looking to get a real Mac eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Its mac product and sadly i really dont like this product.</li>
            <li>Gel liner dries fast after applying...</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product and look forward to purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li>very dissapointing.</li>
            <li>I love the black of this gel liner.</li>
            <li>Your better off buying a more expensive problem</li>
            <li>it is a decent product</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect high hopes.</li>
            <li>I have never used gel liner before, and wanted to try something new, This product went on smoothly and while I have never practiced before with gel liner, I had a little trouble at first keeping my lines straight (but this is obviously more user error than product)</li>
            <li>I expected a somewhat cheap eyeliner...</li>
            <li>You can go light lining or full on thick with the brush.</li>
            <li>The consultancy is watery when applied and doesn&#x27;t provide a smooth black line like you&#x27;d expect.</li>
            <li>This brush is hard to use and isn&#x27;t the type to use for this stuff, an angled brush (with a longer body) works so much better.</li>
            <li>Not like most of them that are hard and seem to tear at your eyelids while applying.</li>
            <li>You have to reapply it in areas multiple times to get the results you are looking for not to mention it does get on your eyelids if you do not allow it to dry first..  </li>
            <li>Also, it was a little expensive for something that is not that great.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Also, it was a little expensive for something that is not that great.</li>
            <li> I normally do my water and tight line!</li>
            <li> but a lot goes a long way</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on too long</li>
            <li> I am not sensitive to makeup at all and this burnt.</li>
            <li> when applying it is smears and is not definite and the color is faded and does not slick on thick (if that makes any sense).</li>
            <li> but personally this will only be a backup for me, gave 3 stars because I like the little brush.</li>
            <li> I recommend cream eyeliner or even liquid because the gel never seems to dry.</li>
            <li> So i reapplied and waited to dry</li>
            <li> After inspecting the box it looks very similar to real MAC boxes but it is slightly different so to my belief its a fake copy.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I can say about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t apply this enough to create that really dark black.  </li>
            <li> and the liner went on well a little sheer</li>
            <li> not what I expected at all</li>
            <li> but it is so not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and items arrived faster then expected.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small container with a solid liner.</li>
            <li> I usually have raccoon eyes after a short time.</li>
            <li> (and I am aware that i may be applying it wrong).</li>
            <li> but it wasnt so dark.</li>
            <li> So i would suggest not to spend your money on this unless you dont mind it not being so dark and smudges.</li>
            <li> Compared to my $10 L&#x27;oreal infallible gel liner it shouldn&#x27;t even be called black.</li>
            <li> just pat a little matte black shadow on it.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting thick and dark color.</li>
            <li> I mean its no mac black track</li>
            <li> not what i expected and one of the brushes were broken (I ordered two).</li>
            <li> This was obviously a fake M.A.C from the second I looked at the product</li>
            <li> and it only ended up smudging on my upper eyelid somehow because it runs :(</li>
            <li> Just got this today, it&#x27;s very dried out.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner smudged everywhere and was very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong</li>
            <li> The brush is useless.</li>
            <li> The brush broke and the coloration of the liner is weird.</li>
            <li> The gel liner, despite being very black as i wanted smudges terribly.</li>
            <li> I have however found some use for it, instead of using it by itself, I use it as a base for my liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> If I wanted to buy crap, Id buy manure for my garden.</li>
            <li> It stung and burned my eyes,cit made them water and just was all around a terrible product</li>
    </ol>

            <li> did ok for awhile but after that it got clumpy.</li>
            <li> not what i expected and one of the brushes were broken (I ordered two). not what I expected at all</li>
            <li> This glides on amazingly I&#x27;m so impressed with the quality! Beautiful and super easy to apply for first time gel eyeliner users!</li>
            <li> I do like this product BUT...&lt;br /&gt;I did read the reviews first and people said theirs came in a mac packaging mine came in a box with the ANGELA on it. Sooo... I don&#x27;t really care. When it comes to quality its a good liner it stays on all day and is smooth but you cannot apply it with the brush they give the brush is too flimsy fortunately I have angle brushes laying around so I used that and the liner went on well a little sheer but a lot goes a long way and if you need it really matte just pat a little matte black shadow on it. it dries quick but if you have oily lids wash up and put some shadow on because oil will make it rub off on. Allaround I like the product not the best but for the pprice better than I expected...</li>
            <li> It stung and burned my eyes,cit made them water and just was all around a terrible product</li>
            <li> Easy to use, Lasts long, looks amazing when applied. very versatile. I will definitely get another one and tell my friends to buy one too</li>
            <li> I loved it. It is very bold in color, the brush I didn&#x27;t care to much for. Although over all great gel-liner!</li>
            <li> The gel liner, despite being very black as i wanted smudges terribly. especially on the lower lashes! Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong but it is so not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t worth the money it&#x27;s a small container with a solid liner. The brush is useless. Your better off buying a more expensive problem</li>
            <li> very nice, easy to use and smooth textured</li>
            <li> I received a MAC gel eyeliner looks exactly like in the photo &amp; perfect first time gel eyeliner user though but did a great purchase for being first time.</li>
            <li> This was obviously a fake M.A.C from the second I looked at the product but I didn&#x27;t care because I wasn&#x27;t looking to get a real Mac eyeliner. However it does not look good. The consultancy is watery when applied and doesn&#x27;t provide a smooth black line like you&#x27;d expect.

It&#x27;s ok for it&#x27;s price but personally this will only be a backup for me, gave 3 stars because I like the little brush.</li>
            <li> am not going to lie , it took weeks to arrived probably like 3 or 4 . but it was defenetly worth it since i recived a M.A.C gel eyeliner which am compleatly in love with it . i dont know if it was  because of the shipping but they sure did send me a great product. .</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this item.The price was awesome. and items arrived faster then expected. i cant complain i was pleased</li>
            <li> This eyeliner gel is alright I mean its no mac black track but it gets the job done and it comes with a pretty efficient brush so that&#x27;s a plus also the price is good and shipping was fast as well overall it is a decent product</li>
            <li> I used it ONE time and within 10 minutes it had smeared all over my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> It was cool. It doesn&#x27;t stay on too long but it was cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect high hopes. Cool.</li>
            <li> not water prrof and smears a lot... i have eye allergies and it comes right of when my eyes tears up.</li>
            <li> Goes on beautifully! But I have had problems with it not staying put. Seems to smudge super easy I usually have raccoon eyes after a short time. I recommend cream eyeliner or even liquid because the gel never seems to dry.</li>
            <li> so this came in all mac packaging firstly. It&#x27;s NOT a mac product so i didnt understand that at all. secondly it smuged not just on my eyelid but MY ENTIRE EYE AREA. I couldnt believe it. NEVER buying this again. Its in my trash can.</li>
            <li> price is perfect and a genuine MAC liner its the best ive used..doesnt make my eyes water like every other liner ive tried</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting thick and dark color. Honestly, I don&#x27;t see the appeal in gel (and I am aware that i may be applying it wrong). when applying it is smears and is not definite and the color is faded and does not slick on thick (if that makes any sense). Also, it was a little expensive for something that is not that great. I have however found some use for it, instead of using it by itself, I use it as a base for my liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> his product is ok it is not easy to apply  was a great price. i would reccommend  it others to try</li>
            <li> This eyeliner smudged everywhere and was very hard to use. The brush broke and the coloration of the liner is weird. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I expected a somewhat cheap eyeliner... but what i got was a M.A.C. product.It is amazing. It came only 4 days after I ordered it. There was a lot more product too. All over amazing product, I recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> Just got this today, it&#x27;s very dried out. Does not go on smoothly at all. The dollar store could make better quality. Well never buy again. I&#x27;m just gonna toss it out.</li>
            <li> Its mac product and sadly i really dont like this product. It is so smashy and i dont like it</li>
            <li> Good liner, nice glide with the brush. You can go light lining or full on thick with the brush. Gel liner dries fast after applying...you may have to touch up 6 hours after first app but for the price NOT BAD. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have never used gel liner before, and wanted to try something new, This product went on smoothly and while I have never practiced before with gel liner, I had a little trouble at first keeping my lines straight (but this is obviously more user error than product), I packed it with black eye shadow and after all was said and done, i love the gel liner!</li>
            <li> If I wanted to buy crap, Id buy manure for my garden. Shipping was poor,and so was the product.I normally do my water and tight line! And this product will not stick and burned my eyes.I am not sensitive to makeup at all and this burnt.I couldn&#x27;t even get it to stick with powder,and the brush was all over the place.Id of been better using something from the Dollar stores...infact  the brand I suggest is maybeline.Put it on and forget it.sharp black color and good price.My lesson was learned on this..never again.Its in the trash.</li>
            <li> This brush is hard to use and isn&#x27;t the type to use for this stuff, an angled brush (with a longer body) works so much better. i do love the eyeliner though. it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I love the black of this gel liner. Its a good product, I only wish it lasted a bit longer.</li>
            <li> The product came in the mail absolutely perfectly packaged and looked great.  To my surprise it was a MAC product which I was unaware of which just made my purchase so much greater! Love Mac! The brush applicator is super soft. Not like most of them that are hard and seem to tear at your eyelids while applying. This went on smoothly and without a fuss. The only problem that I can say about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t apply this enough to create that really dark black.  You have to reapply it in areas multiple times to get the results you are looking for not to mention it does get on your eyelids if you do not allow it to dry first..  Considering it is gel that is understandable though. Overall. I enjoy this product and look forward to purchasing it in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i read other customers write good reviews. After reciving it i was happy because it was \\&quot;MAC\\&quot; supposebly, but after i tried it i liked how it it easily it was to apply but it wasnt so dark. So i reapplied and waited to dry but it seems to never do that its more like a cream and it only ended up smudging on my upper eyelid somehow because it runs :( very dissapointing. So thats why i question the aunthentity of the ptoduct and i dont believe its MAC but a china copy. After inspecting the box it looks very similar to real MAC boxes but it is slightly different so to my belief its a fake copy. So i would suggest not to spend your money on this unless you dont mind it not being so dark and smudges. The only good thing about this product is the brush and that it easily applies.</li>
            <li> Works well and my grandaughter thinks it is the best.  I have not found an eyeliner that was this easy to apply.</li>
