    <ol>
            <li>This product is wonderful</li>
            <li>but then ALL DHC products that I have tried are awesome!  </li>
            <li>Both the Pore Cleansing Oil and the Olive Oil Cleanser have been excellent products for my skin.</li>
            <li>Best cleanser I have found for my combination dry/oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best.  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels great.  </li>
            <li>This does a great job of dissolving the oil off my face and cleaning out the pores.  </li>
            <li>They are great for people with skin allergies.</li>
            <li>Great Product .I have been using this for years.  </li>
            <li>It works just as well but has an awesome fresh citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Honestly, my skin has improved dramatically since I started using DHC products.  </li>
            <li>Works well, nice scent.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the BEST make-up remover ever!</li>
            <li>a damp, warm, washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight with a nice grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li>This  makes my skin feel squeaky clean and appears to be good for it without drying it.</li>
            <li>but I like this even better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love DHC products and their excellant ingredient listings.</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing oil</li>
            <li>I have used DHC products for years &amp; love them.</li>
            <li>but I get better shipping at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much better than the original.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for extremely oily skin like mine;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>, however, it is more pricey compared to the original olive oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>Just massage it into your face and neck; it goes on smooth and easy.  </li>
            <li>my skin types, this is even far better than DHC&#x27;s most popular and original Olive cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used DHC&#x27;s Velvet Skin Coat primer and it was fantastic, too, so</li>
            <li>It goes on with your fingertips and kinda feels like light olive oil.  </li>
            <li>I do still have blackheads, but they are not nearly as obvious as they were and my face is still super oily, but as a cleanser this one is great and does what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I have always used the original cleansing oil &amp; decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it didn&#x27;t make my very ooily skin break out.</li>
            <li>Yes my face is clean</li>
            <li>It has a mild citrus scent.</li>
            <li>It cleanses your skin and leaves it refreshing, soft and clean</li>
            <li>Highly recommend DHC Pore cleaning Oil!!!</li>
            <li>Then rinse it off with warm water--NO oily film or residue left.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and huge pores (from years of biore strips maybe?), and this does a great job of removing the oil and makeup and leaves my skin so soft and not tight and dry feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my first bottle of the DHC Pore Cleansing Oil</li>
            <li>Gentle but thorough and does not irritate.</li>
            <li>This one really cleans my skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle makeup remover</li>
            <li>Similar thickness of the original DHC olive oil cleanser</li>
            <li>They use high quality ingredients at reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>Removed ALL make up and left my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I used to buy direct from DHC</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>One to remove make up and the second to clean deep into skin then my regular cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it has an effect on the pores of the skin, since I used other products (moistruizers) that may well counter any reduction in pore size, and I use the DHC olive oil cleanser at night, because of the dry skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow! I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the MAC Cleanse Off oil but I like this even better. Your skin feels even cleaner. I&#x27;ve used DHC&#x27;s Velvet Skin Coat primer and it was fantastic, too, so I&#x27;m not surprised I like this so well.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful but then ALL DHC products that I have tried are awesome!  It goes on with your fingertips and kinda feels like light olive oil.  Just massage it into your face and neck; it goes on smooth and easy.  It totally dissolves the makeup in your pores and all over your face/neck.  Then rinse it off with warm water--NO oily film or residue left.  Your skin feels great.  Afterwards you can use toner on a cotton ball and you will not find a trace of leftover make-up.  Makes my pores less noticeable and my make-up look smoother.  Highly recommend DHC Pore cleaning Oil!!!</li>
            <li> This  makes my skin feel squeaky clean and appears to be good for it without drying it. I&#x27;m 65, with dry skin, and I use it in the mornings before getting into the shower. It has no scent that I can detect. I don&#x27;t really know if it has an effect on the pores of the skin, since I used other products (moistruizers) that may well counter any reduction in pore size, and I use the DHC olive oil cleanser at night, because of the dry skin. Both the Pore Cleansing Oil and the Olive Oil Cleanser have been excellent products for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to their products. This and their other cleansing oil is the only thing I use to wash my face.</li>
            <li> This pore cleansing oil removes makeup eaisly. It has a mild citrus scent. Most importantly it didn&#x27;t make my very ooily skin break out.</li>
            <li> I can not good effect.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have found for my combination dry/oily skin.  Gentle but thorough and does not irritate.</li>
            <li> do not recommend for oil skin doesnt work at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my first bottle of the DHC Pore Cleansing Oil and I love it.  I have no idea how I went without an oil cleanser for so long.  This does a great job of dissolving the oil off my face and cleaning out the pores.  I have very oily skin and huge pores (from years of biore strips maybe?), and this does a great job of removing the oil and makeup and leaves my skin so soft and not tight and dry feeling.

            <li> Works well for my oily skin. Removed ALL make up and left my skin smooth and soft. Love DHC products and their excellant ingredient listings.</li>
            <li> Honestly, my skin has improved dramatically since I started using DHC products.  This one really cleans my skin.</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle . I love this cleansing oil</li>
            <li> This product is the best.  I recommend it highly. It cleanses your skin and leaves it refreshing, soft and clean</li>
            <li> Works well, nice scent.</li>
            <li> Gentle makeup remover</li>
            <li> I have used DHC products for years &amp; love them. They are great for people with skin allergies. They use high quality ingredients at reasonable prices. I have always used the original cleansing oil &amp; decided to try this one. I like it so much better than the original. It works just as well but has an awesome fresh citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for extremely oily skin like mine;&lt;br /&gt;For my skin types, this is even far better than DHC&#x27;s most popular and original Olive cleansing oil. If price was lower, I would use this as scalp massaging too.</li>
            <li> Great Product .I have been using this for years.  I used to buy direct from DHC but I get better shipping at Amazon.  I ran out and tried another brand.  3/4 of that bottle is under my vanity.  Too oily and won&#x27;t emulsify with water so I am back to DHC.  I do two cleanses with the product.  One to remove make up and the second to clean deep into skin then my regular cleanser.  Yes my face is clean but if I don&#x27;t I get sebum build up due to medication and health conditions.</li>
            <li> Similar thickness of the original DHC olive oil cleanser but with a grapefruit scent which I prefer.  Takes off all make-up, including waterproof and eye make-up, like a dream.  So far I like it, however, it is more pricey compared to the original olive oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST make-up remover ever! Just massage into skin-including eye area, and remove with a damp, warm, washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;Light weight with a nice grapefruit smell.</li>
