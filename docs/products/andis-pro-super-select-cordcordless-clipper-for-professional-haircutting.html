            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Extremely happy.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper.</li>
            <li>Not having to deal with a cord is great too.</li>
            <li>have used it before and loved it</li>
            <li>I am sure this product would have been great (2 years ago).  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a great product and I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>I had to go through Amazon directly to be able to return the product.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is great, heavy duty construction, they cut great, make sure to oil them once in a while</li>
            <li>Great professional type clipper.  </li>
            <li>The attachments snap into place more securely than my Wahl.  </li>
            <li>I use mine mostly for trimming facial hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>It is light, easy to use and cuts well.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>But for personal and family they are great.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it cut, but the battery did not last for one month.  </li>
            <li>and they replaced it fast, but after 2 months the battery was not holding a charge for more than 15 minutes, so I had to go fast</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful and the charge lasts longer than I need it.  </li>
            <li>I ended up giving the Wahl to my wife to trim our Golden Retrievers</li>
            <li>These clippers seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>it is great but just the battry does not last long</li>
            <li>I have had professional clippers as I have cut hair for many years, for the price I was surprised at how well they cut.</li>
            <li>I gave them 4 instead of five stars as I would have to be blown away by a product, I was fine with the clippers as a person using them for personal use.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointing.</li>
            <li>Clipper works very well seems to be holding a charge and recharging well.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a cordless</li>
            <li>Red light was lit to indicate charging.  </li>
            <li>I might have preferred a charging station but the plug in the bottom works very well.  </li>
            <li>The Andis cordless is much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>These are powerful, quiet and fast.  </li>
            <li>Battery life could be a little better.</li>
            <li>I do find myself going over the head a few more times though.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they catch in the hair and pull it, but other than that they are fine.</li>
            <li>Very professional unit, a must for all home grooming.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old corded one.</li>
            <li>They are not for someone who cuts all day because the charge wont last long enough for more that a few hair cuts.</li>

            <li> I also have a professional Wahl but fighting the stiff cord every time I use it is a nuisance.  </li>
            <li> , the Wahl is a very well made and reliable clipper I just got tired of fighting the cord.  </li>
            <li> but this is not worth your money</li>
            <li> I used it for about 6 times and it was really hard to use it afterwards.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> BTW, Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> But when you put any type of attachments, it pulls on hair and becomes very painful.</li>

            <li> It will not hold enough charge.  I have to finish with the charger connected.</li>
            <li> Battery life is great, heavy duty construction, they cut great, make sure to oil them once in a while that&#x27;s all they need</li>
            <li> Great clippers.  I&#x27;ve tried norelco ones that had to be cleaned every 15 seconds before they would work again.  Not these.  These are powerful, quiet and fast.  Great product.  Extremely happy.</li>
            <li> Very professional unit, a must for all home grooming.  Charge lasts for several uses&gt;</li>
            <li> received timely and intact</li>
            <li> I liked the way it cut, but the battery did not last for one month.  Sent it back to Andis and they replaced it fast, but after 2 months the battery was not holding a charge for more than 15 minutes, so I had to go fast which means I made embarrassing mistakes on the cut.  Then after 6 months the electrical cord shorted out so I couldn&#x27;t even plug it in the wall anymore.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  on my third one.  had to replace each (after couple years use) because charger blew out.  on fifth charger.  reason for deduction of one star.</li>
            <li> These clippers seem to work pretty well. Sometimes they catch in the hair and pull it, but other than that they are fine.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Stills works after a long time of ownership. I will say the blade starts to loosen and it rattles and starts to pull on your hair.</li>
            <li> it is great but just the battry does not last long</li>
            <li> Without the heads, it cuts well. But when you put any type of attachments, it pulls on hair and becomes very painful. Very dissappointing.</li>
            <li> Battery life could be a little better. Overall it is a great product and I am extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper. It is light, easy to use and cuts well. I do find myself going over the head a few more times though. Not having to deal with a cord is great too.</li>
            <li> Clipper works very well seems to be holding a charge and recharging well. Wouldbuy this product again if in nned of a clipper.</li>
            <li> Not enough power. I went back to my old corded one. I really wanted a cordless but this is not worth your money</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay charged and they pull the hair</li>
            <li> I used it for about 6 times and it was really hard to use it afterwards. The thing didn&#x27;t cut as well and the battery kept dying.</li>
            <li> I have had professional clippers as I have cut hair for many years, for the price I was surprised at how well they cut. They are not for someone who cuts all day because the charge wont last long enough for more that a few hair cuts. But for personal and family they are great. I gave them 4 instead of five stars as I would have to be blown away by a product, I was fine with the clippers as a person using them for personal use.</li>
            <li> If they allow me to put zero stars I would definitely go for it. Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Purchased item going off the description given.  I followed the directions and fully charged the batteries like the manual said and didn&#x27;t even get 15 minutes of life out of the battery.  Charged it again and now maybe get one to two minutes of use.</li>
            <li> have used it before and loved it</li>
            <li> I am sure this product would have been great (2 years ago).  Got mine in the mail.  Waited over 12 hours to turn it on as per the instructions.  Red light was lit to indicate charging.  After 16 hours turned it on and nothing!!!  Used it with the power cord plugged in and it worked fine. Defective battery.  Seller told me I could not return it because it is under warranty from Andis.  I call Andis and they said they haven&#x27;t made that model for 2 years and it only had a 1 year warranty on it so they couldn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I had to go through Amazon directly to be able to return the product.  The seller would not refund my shipping.  I did get Amazon to do so though.  WARNING THIS PRODUCT COMES WITH NO WARRANTY FROM ANDIS.</li>
            <li> Great professional type clipper.  I use mine mostly for trimming facial hair and it works great. I might have preferred a charging station but the plug in the bottom works very well.  I also have a professional Wahl but fighting the stiff cord every time I use it is a nuisance.  The Andis cordless is much easier to use.  The motor is powerful and the charge lasts longer than I need it.  The attachments snap into place more securely than my Wahl.  I would say if you&#x27;re looking for a cordless clipper, consider the Andis.... BTW, Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the Wahl is a very well made and reliable clipper I just got tired of fighting the cord.  I ended up giving the Wahl to my wife to trim our Golden Retrievers</li>
