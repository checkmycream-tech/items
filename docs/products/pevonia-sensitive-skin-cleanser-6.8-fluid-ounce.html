    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a good product, just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li> This cleanse works well and the price is affordable. I will be buying it again as it does not irritate my skin and removes the grease effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Professional product - great results.</li>
            <li> Fairly inexpensive cleanser but does not seem to do wonders for my skin- however did not irritate either.  Unlikely to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! IT makes my skin look flawless</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for many years now. It eliminated a skin issue on my eyelids that I had dealt with for years that even dermatologists and eye doctors couldn&#x27;t help me with. If you have sensitive skin try this cleanser. It is very light, no obnoxious odors, leaves your skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I am a esthetician and I love Pevonia!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes your face feel wonderful.  It is by far the best cleanser that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with t his cleanser and am reordering today.  My skin seems improved and there was absolutely zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/11/2014, I just reordered again and I have to say, I&#x27;ve not had a single breakout since I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a year with great results. I have very sensitive skin and this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Very gentle on the skin and highly recommended by my salon.  I use it daily and at 67, my skin looks and feels wonderful.  I will be reordering this product for sure!</li>
            <li> This is my first review and the only time I have ever had a bad experience with anything from Amazon. When the cleanser came the bottle was dirty, it looked like the seller had put a different SKU sticker on it and when I smelled the product it didn&#x27;t smell like the one I bought from the spa</li>
            <li> I like the product but the pump was broken.</li>
            <li> The product is a great product I ordered the wrong kind.  Sensitive instead of for oily.  But I love their products.</li>
            <li> Used product for years and is the best.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this cleanser.  I have multiple allergies, rosacea and acne prone skin.  This is the best out there, light and never harsh.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive, oily or combination skin. No break outs in years. No ruddiness and NO hideous gaping pores. (and you know what I mean) WHAT could be better than that?</li>
            <li> I have sensitivie skin that will breakout with most products.This has been the only brand I can use daily and consistantly.</li>
            <li> Smelled really chemical and didn&#x27;t work well at all. Had to throw it out. I&#x27;ve used this before and it was great.  Too old?  Last time I buy skincare&lt;br /&gt;products over Amazon.  Can&#x27;t trust the freshness or quality.</li>
