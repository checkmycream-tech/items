            <li>LOVED THE BRIGHT COLORS  </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for then this isn&#x27;t a good product for you.</li>
            <li>Also there&#x27;s a good variety of color and shades</li>
            <li>Good for kids to play around with though.</li>
            <li>i loved the colors and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li>good for a one time event.</li>
            <li>However, after you use the very top of a color, all the glitter is gone &amp; it&#x27;s just oil</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Awesome colors and timely delivery ;)</li>
            <li>Colors are very bright and bold just looking at it.  </li>
            <li>but from just finger testing it its going to be a nice glitter palette.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s nice if you just want to wear glitter,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>All thoughts, opinions and ratings are my own.</li>
            <li>and i really liked that</li>
            <li>I wanted glittery eyeshadow &amp; at first appearance this product looks very good.</li>
            <li>Vivid and beautiful colors!</li>
            <li>i would of liked it much more</li>
            <li>Some people are saying that it&#x27;s like wax, and feels like lip gloss, which isn&#x27;t all way true!!</li>
            <li>Did the trick for very cheap price.</li>
            <li>The pictures look amazing and when I first opened the product I thought it was perfect, however i was very dissapointed with the look when i used it.</li>
            <li>, EVEN COMES WITH GLITTER TOP COAT.</li>

            <li>I still use it because I love glitter though.</li>
            <li>I always purchase this glitter! :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>AND WHEN U USE THIS ALL THE SPRINKLES DISSAPPEAR TO WEAR U ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO USE IT AGAIN</li>
            <li>Save it for better quality glitter eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>thank you:)</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love glitter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely a cheap product!</li>
            <li>In no way is it a powder but more like a lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be more of an eye shadow, but it has the texture of like a vasaline with glitter in it.</li>
            <li>Loved it very much.</li>
            <li>the shimmer shadow that come&#x27;s with it works good for me just not the glitter shadow though which is why i got this in the first place.</li>
            <li>I loved how fast i received it though.</li>
            <li>The glitter part is a cream shadow and doesnt go on easy at all.</li>
            <li>it clumps up to easy.</li>
            <li>this is gel...not powered...not easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Leaves a beautiful streak for only room to shine and glitter.</li>
            <li>but this is smaller than expected but still works great but is amazing what u can get out of it for the price paid and tons of colors for a great variety.</li>
            <li>loved this very nice color&#x27;s and alot to choose from i only had to apply it one time for the whole day</li>
            <li>I got this in hopes it would leave a fine shimmery color with the glitter, sigh.</li>
            <li>This type of glitter shadow isn&#x27;t meant to be smothered on the whole top lid of your eye!</li>
            <li>They light up any eye make-up look with out being over done.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend using a light hand.</li>
            <li>Super precise when you apply it.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this product.</li>
            <li>It does look really good when you finally get it right!</li>
            <li>Stays bright &amp; deep all through out the day even with oily eye lids like mine.</li>
            <li>The Glitter is only lightly coated  on Top, when you remove the top layer ,  theres no glitter in the lower level of this pallet .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cool stuff</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors last a good while and are true to what they look like on their palette.</li>
            <li>the other hand, the powdery part is great.</li>
            <li>the other eyeshadows are great</li>
            <li>Can be better suited as body glitter arts and crafts but not as eye shadow not at all appealing when you finally get it on it</li>
            <li>Just as the previous eye shadows this is great too,wear in the day,evening, with clothing attire, parties,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just chunky glitter in wax which does not go on very well and wipes away too easily.</li>
            <li>The makeup came and it looks exactly like desrcibed and holds up fairly well considering the price I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t very much of it, so I save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be fun to have some glitter eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I instantly tried the glitter shadow to see if it really worked good.</li>
            <li>but still fun to wear.</li>
            <li>grate deal, you get beyond your moneys worth</li>
            <li>Migrates all over the place it really isn&#x27;t worth your money buying this.</li>
            <li>doesnt apply good and its very slimy and theres not much in each color.</li>
            <li>update pretty colors but to sticky tried putting on with brush</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>There really pretty</li>
            <li>But I still thought the price was pretty</li>
            <li>lovely I just wish the palats were larger</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast and it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>but it seems like the glitter is just on the top and its mostly some gummy paste underneath the shadow....so hard to get even coverage...</li>
            <li>I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually apply it with my fingers and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend wanted this, she says it wasn&#x27;t very high quality but for $3 who could complain?</li>
            <li>Just straight glitter, with the sticky stuff that dries leaving pure sparkles.</li>
            <li>Just got this today, shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>Havent really tried it yet</li>
            <li>Its really a glitter gel.</li>
            <li>I really like them a lot.</li>
            <li>picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>I really like these colors it has</li>
            <li>I really like the colors</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>it cause it doesn&#x27;t have much</li>
            <li>You need to use a proper eye brush to apply it or lightly dab it on with your finger and rub it in.  </li>
            <li>It is very sticky.</li>
            <li>you have to use almost a whole circle per use.</li>
            <li>THE COLORS ARE VERY PIGMENTED</li>
            <li>Washes off super easily without a sticky mess.</li>
            <li>This is more meant for the bottom lid of your eye, just a small line right below your bottom eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Very sticky, seems like more of a glue-like texture and less glitter.</li>
            <li>just not for African American Skin very cheap.</li>
            <li>These are just as vibrant on as in the tube.  </li>
            <li>I really liked, but brings little amount, I would much prefer if it were larger in size</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow didn&#x27;t go on like normal eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This is not like your normal eye shadow....</li>
            <li>She is new to wearing makeup and needed the glitter.</li>
            <li>love the colors but its hard to put on eyes , it does not stick if it was like a real eye shadow</li>
            <li>First off, I gave this only 3 stars because of the glitter part.</li>
            <li>I guess I don&#x27;t know exactly what I was expecting, but this wasn&#x27;t necessarily it.</li>
            <li>Only the first layer works some how....creamy glitters....not</li>
            <li>Product looks beautiful but on investigating the glitter is present on d surface so after a few uses u r down to a grease like substance u could use as lip gloss.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>Gave it to my 10 year old.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to put a whole lot on, just enough</li>
            <li>But its not messy or runny.</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by the consistency.</li>
            <li>WILD</li>
            <li>A HOT MESS DONT BYE IT AND WASTE YOUR MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY if i were you bye the nine dollar one and it will be better</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, works well enough, but the picture gives it a look of being a decent size...it actually is about as long as your hand, no bigger.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but i dont like that its a wet shadow.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter ordered this thinking that it had glitter mixed into the shadow.</li>
            <li>When it arrived it was just a thin layer of glitter on top.</li>
            <li>And the glitter will glob and dry much like glue if not properly applied.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A HOT MESS I BOUGHT IT FOR DANCE</li>

            <li> I really liked, but brings little amount, I would much prefer if it were larger in size</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow didn&#x27;t go on like normal eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This is not like your normal eye shadow....</li>
            <li> She is new to wearing makeup and needed the glitter.</li>
            <li> love the colors but its hard to put on eyes , it does not stick if it was like a real eye shadow</li>
            <li> First off, I gave this only 3 stars because of the glitter part.</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t know exactly what I was expecting, but this wasn&#x27;t necessarily it.</li>
            <li> Only the first layer works some how....creamy glitters....not</li>
            <li> Product looks beautiful but on investigating the glitter is present on d surface so after a few uses u r down to a grease like substance u could use as lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to put a whole lot on, just enough</li>
            <li> But its not messy or runny.</li>
            <li> I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the consistency.</li>

            <li> A HOT MESS DONT BYE IT AND WASTE YOUR MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY if i were you bye the nine dollar one and it will be better</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, works well enough, but the picture gives it a look of being a decent size...it actually is about as long as your hand, no bigger.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but i dont like that its a wet shadow.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter ordered this thinking that it had glitter mixed into the shadow.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was just a thin layer of glitter on top.</li>
            <li> And the glitter will glob and dry much like glue if not properly applied.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A HOT MESS I BOUGHT IT FOR DANCE</li>
            <li> if you are getting this item plz be sure to use a base color underneath the glitter first because it will not show well.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this because I LOVE glitter eye shadow, however the glitter eyeshadows in this are a nasty goo that I couldn&#x27;t get from the brush to my eye no matter</li>
            <li> you can not wear them a long time maybe just for photo shooting</li>
            <li> /&gt;this isnt a dry eye shadow...its a wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for loose glitter...</li>
            <li> I put some on and my eyelids stick to each other even if I let it dry for a while.</li>
            <li> I wanted to explain after reading all the bad reviews on this product,  that glitter eye shadow is normally more of a gel like stuff.  </li>
            <li> Glitter didn&#x27;t seem to be all the way through the gel as I had expected</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely sticky and rubs off on everything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really sad cause they look so pretty.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but it doesn&#x27;t play well with other makeup.</li>
            <li> 1) plan to use it in an area where it will not come in contact with any other makeup.</li>
            <li> this was a total waste of time and money please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> On the positive side it wasn&#x27;t expensive to try it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bummer there isn&#x27;t a lot here, they are rather shallow and the case is much smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> was so excited to try out these colors and was so disappointed when i did&lt;</li>
            <li> Seriously i was so disappointed in this product there was more goo in the glitter shadow</li>
            <li> ITS A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d expect with such bitterness it would have some color behind it.</li>
            <li> and I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s going on your eyes with very little glitter.</li>
            <li> The make up is very sticky :(</li>
            <li> Hard to make a mistake, i can&#x27;t explain it.</li>
            <li> how hard I tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they are hard to apply with just a finger or the applicator it came with.</li>
            <li> The glitter is waxy and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I thought these were going to be powder eyeshadows that were glittery, but instead they are sticky and hard to put on, makes my eyelids stick together..</li>
            <li> It is on a vasoline base I wanted pure eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Very sticky, even with a base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda like a thick honey.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay it smears all over the place not a good buy</li>
            <li> Was not happy at all and used it once...</li>
            <li> She was not happy.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely difficult to use, and when you put it on your eyes</li>
            <li> And then after blinking for half an hour or so, it all creases up and looks nasty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;thats disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexplicable</li>
            <li> i tried a number of things to get it to work because i wanted to like this product so badly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Glitter didn&#x27;t seem to be all the way through the gel as I had expected</li>
            <li> The glitter do not spread well. It clumps.</li>
            <li> if you are getting this item plz be sure to use a base color underneath the glitter first because it will not show well. The glitter is sticky almost feels like glue. Its a pain in the ass to take off but it stays on all day the glitter just doesn&#x27;t show well at all</li>
            <li> LOVED THE BRIGHT COLORS  STAYS ON ALL DAY !!! WOULD GREAT STARTER IT FOR ANYONE, EVEN COMES WITH GLITTER TOP COAT.</li>
            <li> These are just as vibrant on as in the tube.  They light up any eye make-up look with out being over done.  I do recommend using a light hand. And I did not get an Orange color liner.</li>
            <li> Very sticky, seems like more of a glue-like texture and less glitter.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be fun to have some glitter eyeshadows.The shipping was super fast and it was packaged very well. I instantly tried the glitter shadow to see if it really worked good. Seriously i was so disappointed in this product there was more goo in the glitter shadow then glitter it was a pain just to get the glitter on or to stay. i tried a number of things to get it to work because i wanted to like this product so badly but nothing worked. this was a total waste of time and money please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. the shimmer shadow that come&#x27;s with it works good for me just not the glitter shadow though which is why i got this in the first place.</li>
            <li> Just got this today, shipment was fast. Havent really tried it yet but from just finger testing it its going to be a nice glitter palette. Colors are very bright and bold just looking at it.  update pretty colors but to sticky tried putting on with brush didnt work, it just clumps. The glitter part is a cream shadow and doesnt go on easy at all.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted this, she says it wasn&#x27;t very high quality but for $3 who could complain? She ended up giving it to my daughter to play dress-up with.</li>
            <li> Didnt explain type ofeyeshadow well. Not eyeshadow at all. Its really a glitter gel.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The Glitter is only lightly coated  on Top, when you remove the top layer ,  theres no glitter in the lower level of this pallet .&lt;br /&gt;thats disappointing.  I will not be ordering from this maker ever.</li>
            <li> First off, I gave this only 3 stars because of the glitter part. It&#x27;s just horrible. I put some on and my eyelids stick to each other even if I let it dry for a while. And then after blinking for half an hour or so, it all creases up and looks nasty. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I can&#x27;t stand it.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the powdery part is great. The colors last a good while and are true to what they look like on their palette. I really like them a lot.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow didn&#x27;t go on like normal eyeshadow. It was sticky and clumpy. Gave it to my 10 year old.</li>
            <li> It is a lot smaller than what I was expecting. However I love the colors, I just wish I knew that it wasn&#x27;t very big.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, works well enough, but the picture gives it a look of being a decent size...it actually is about as long as your hand, no bigger.Moot what i was expecting...</li>
            <li> doesnt apply good and its very slimy and theres not much in each color. picture is very deceiving. i bought this for my cheerleaders for playoffs and didnt even use it</li>
            <li> amazing variety of colors !!</li>
            <li> This product is extremely difficult to use, and when you put it on your eyes it&#x27;s extremely sticky and rubs off on everything. I still use it because I love glitter though.</li>
            <li> I love this glitter!! Some people are saying that it&#x27;s like wax, and feels like lip gloss, which isn&#x27;t all way true!! This type of glitter shadow isn&#x27;t meant to be smothered on the whole top lid of your eye! If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for then this isn&#x27;t a good product for you. This is more meant for the bottom lid of your eye, just a small line right below your bottom eyelashes. Match the glitter to whatever color of shirt you&#x27;re wearing that day and it makes your eyes pop! You don&#x27;t need to put a whole lot on, just enough so you can seee a bit of color! Do it like that, and you will LOVE this product!! I always purchase this glitter! :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, best worn in the evenings like on a date, or to a party. What can I say ....I love it.</li>
            <li> love the colors but its hard to put on eyes , it does not stick if it was like a real eye shadow i would of liked it much more</li>
            <li> I really like these colors it has and it has a great variety of them. I would purchase again. Cool stuff</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE THIS IS A HOT MESS I BOUGHT IT FOR DANCE BUT I COULDN&#x27;T USE IT THIS IS A HOT MESS DONT BYE IT AND WASTE YOUR MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY if i were you bye the nine dollar one and it will be better</li>
            <li> THIS IS CRAP ITS STICKY AND WHEN U USE THIS ALL THE SPRINKLES DISSAPPEAR TO WEAR U ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO USE IT AGAIN JUST A ONE TIME COLOR AND THATS IT!!! ITS A WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> I love this product! it was exactly what I was looking for. I usually apply it with my fingers and it&#x27;s very easy to clean. Also there&#x27;s a good variety of color and shades</li>
            <li> Like it, bought as a gift</li>
            <li> Leaves a beautiful streak for only room to shine and glitter. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Horrible as eyeshadow . Can be better suited as body glitter arts and crafts but not as eye shadow not at all appealing when you finally get it on it doesn&#x27;t stay it smears all over the place not a good buy but I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s priced so inexpensive</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t buy this. I threw it the second it came in the mail. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Save it for better quality glitter eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d expect with such bitterness it would have some color behind it. Nope. Just straight glitter, with the sticky stuff that dries leaving pure sparkles. I got this in hopes it would leave a fine shimmery color with the glitter, sigh. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Washes off super easily without a sticky mess. Doesn&#x27;t fade away by the end of the day. Stays bright &amp; deep all through out the day even with oily eye lids like mine. As if i just applied it. Loved it very much. Super precise when you apply it. Hard to make a mistake, i can&#x27;t explain it. But its not messy or runny. Above the rest of the eye liners. This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this because I LOVE glitter eye shadow, however the glitter eyeshadows in this are a nasty goo that I couldn&#x27;t get from the brush to my eye no matter how hard I tried.&lt;br /&gt;Really sad cause they look so pretty.</li>
            <li> A terrible product. It&#x27;s just chunky glitter in wax which does not go on very well and wipes away too easily.</li>
            <li> It is on a vasoline base I wanted pure eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Awesome colors and timely delivery ;)</li>
            <li> I really like the colors but they are hard to apply with just a finger or the applicator it came with. I still like this, it&#x27;s nice if you just want to wear glitter,</li>
            <li> not what I was hoping for but it can still serve a purpose</li>
            <li> was so excited to try out these colors and was so disappointed when i did&lt;br /&gt;this isnt a dry eye shadow...its a wax.&lt;br /&gt;the glitter comes out all blotchy and does not spread evenly.&lt;br /&gt;feels like a lip gloss on your eyes.</li>
            <li> its like lip gloss. does not stick on well. just not for African American Skin very cheap. I don&#x27;t know if i will use it that much only like five colors.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter picked this out and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but i dont like that its a wet shadow. it clumps up to easy. I loved how fast i received it though. thank you:)</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this product. Was definitely A LOT smaller then it looks on pictures. The glitter is waxy and hard to use. the other eyeshadows are great though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love / hate relationship with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but hey for the price i aint complaining</li>
            <li> This glitter is not sparkly, it just looks like you have tiny spots on your face. Good for kids to play around with though.</li>
            <li> Product looks beautiful but on investigating the glitter is present on d surface so after a few uses u r down to a grease like substance u could use as lip gloss. seller delivered on time</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:b15908aab742c8c32256fd86b5be950c]] This is a great glitter palette. You will want to use it over a darker eye shadow, unless you are looking for lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use this for theatre, photo shoots and crafting. Who doesn&#x27;t love glitter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bummer there isn&#x27;t a lot here, they are rather shallow and the case is much smaller than I expected. Still, I should get some great use out of what I have!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out the video to see the full review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

            <li> I was looking for loose glitter... this is sticky stuff... oh well.. I&#x27;m wearing it anyway but disappointed in this product</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a bigger package. The make up is very sticky :( it&#x27;s definitely a cheap product!</li>
            <li> This product was PERFECT! I use it all the time. There isn&#x27;t very much of it, so I save it for special occasions. It&#x27;s a must have!!</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with this product. I was under the impression it was a powder. In no way is it a powder but more like a lip gloss. Very sticky, even with a base. Was not happy at all and used it once... Now my girls use it for their .dolls</li>
            <li> There really pretty but u probably use each twice n that&#x27;s it cause it doesn&#x27;t have much so it&#x27;s kinda a rip off</li>
            <li> Wore during Halloween. Did the trick for very cheap price.</li>
            <li> I thought these were going to be powder eyeshadows that were glittery, but instead they are sticky and hard to put on, makes my eyelids stick together..</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t know exactly what I was expecting, but this wasn&#x27;t necessarily it. I was expecting it to be more of an eye shadow, but it has the texture of like a vasaline with glitter in it. But I still thought the price was pretty and I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the consistency. It&#x27;s kinda like a thick honey. I would have given it 4 or 5 stars but it doesn&#x27;t play well with other makeup. I recommend 2 things. 1) plan to use it in an area where it will not come in contact with any other makeup. 2) dab it on because smearing seems inconsistent. It does look really good when you finally get it right!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t hesitate one bit at all to re-purchase but this is smaller than expected but still works great but is amazing what u can get out of it for the price paid and tons of colors for a great variety.</li>
            <li> I gave it five because it says its wax but it still works AWSOME but not for oil skin. If you have oily skin it will make your eyelid look like someone put lip gloss on your lid.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter ordered this thinking that it had glitter mixed into the shadow. When it arrived it was just a thin layer of glitter on top. She was not happy. She is new to wearing makeup and needed the glitter. Bummer!</li>
            <li> I wanted to explain after reading all the bad reviews on this product,  that glitter eye shadow is normally more of a gel like stuff.  You need to use a proper eye brush to apply it or lightly dab it on with your finger and rub it in.  As a makeup fenatic i have tried and used all types of makeup.  And the glitter will glob and dry much like glue if not properly applied.</li>
            <li> loved this very nice color&#x27;s and alot to choose from i only had to apply it one time for the whole day and i really liked that</li>
            <li> Only the first layer works some how....creamy glitters....not what I waited for....you can not wear them a long time maybe just for photo shooting</li>
            <li> Vivid and beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> Just as the previous eye shadows this is great too,wear in the day,evening, with clothing attire, parties,special&lt;br /&gt;occasions,you can look like runway model!.</li>
            <li> The pictures look amazing and when I first opened the product I thought it was perfect, however i was very dissapointed with the look when i used it. It is very sticky. I was expecting a powder and it came as a gel. you have to use almost a whole circle per use. I wouldnt get it if you are expecting a powder.</li>
            <li> i loved the colors and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it but it seems like the glitter is just on the top and its mostly some gummy paste underneath the shadow....so hard to get even coverage...guess I need to just purchase pigment glitter going forward..</li>
            <li> once you dip your finger into it, it&#x27;s gone. it&#x27;s litterly a slither of glitter cream. good for a one time event. but still fun to wear.</li>
            <li> The stuff smears and doesn&#x27;t stay in place. It gathers in the creases of my eyelids. I would not buy it again. On the positive side it wasn&#x27;t expensive to try it out.</li>
            <li> I wanted glittery eyeshadow &amp; at first appearance this product looks very good. However, after you use the very top of a color, all the glitter is gone &amp; it&#x27;s just oil that&#x27;s going on your eyes with very little glitter.</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE VERY PIGMENTED AND I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN..LET YOUR IDEAS GO WILD</li>
            <li> Just not what I expected</li>
            <li> beautiful colors, spectacular fantasy makeovers and dances. I really liked, but brings little amount, I would much prefer if it were larger in size</li>
            <li> lovely I just wish the palats were larger</li>
            <li> grate deal, you get beyond your moneys worth</li>
            <li> The makeup came and it looks exactly like desrcibed and holds up fairly well considering the price I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This was the worst makeup that I have ever bought. This is not like your normal eye shadow.... It&#x27;s inexplicable it&#x27;s so bad. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on it. Thank god mines was bought with a gift card!</li>
            <li> this is gel...not powered...not easy to put on. Left like I was putting lip gloss on my eyes</li>
            <li> Me and my wife purchased this you can come up with hundreds of combinations with the sparkles and colors  her eyes look model status. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I can see this working well on Halloween for children, but for women who want to use this it&#x27;s a no go. The glitter is based in a petroleum like product and moves all over the place, even when coupled with primer and finishing powder. The glitter is coarse in size. Migrates all over the place it really isn&#x27;t worth your money buying this.</li>
