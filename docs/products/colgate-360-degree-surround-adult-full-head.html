            <li>I feel that it helps me maneuver the brush better.</li>

            <li>I get a nice clean with this brush and it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I have the impression that this over sized head does clean better than most tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to cover every surface.  </li>
            <li>I did get more used to it over a couple of weeks of use, and it did make my mouth feel clean -</li>
            <li>The grip is fine.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush, Soft&amp;#34; is a very good all around toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I like the 360 Whole Mouth Clean as my favorite, but the Total Advanced brush might be a more favored choice for many.</li>
            <li>This brush is confortable to hold, seems well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Total® Advanced Floss-Tip† Bristles toothbrush provides 4x deeper</li>
            <li>This is a brush that boasts a collection of fancy perks while still remaining, quite comfortably, in the practical toothbrush category.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, and the ergonomics are good for me.</li>
            <li>I like the 360 Whole Mouth Clean as my favorite, but the Total Advanced brush might be a more favored choice for many.preference.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I am able to get the right amount of pressure on my teeth.</li>
            <li>The total advanced full head toothbrush does a great job of leaving my mouth and teeth thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After brushing my teeth feel clean and smooth as if I just visited the dentist.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has a nice handle that is easy to grip, soft bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums and a tongue and cheek cleaner that works.  </li>
            <li>Its unique features clean teeth and gums efficienly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean brush does not.</li>
            <li>Clean</li>
            <li>I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li>All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>There are lighter pink rubbery bristly areas designed for superior gripping by your thumb and forefinger.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s all sorts of levels and shapes of bristles, and I like the way it fits around the teeth and gets maximum surface clean.  </li>
            <li>So while I&#x27;m sure the unusual design would work wonders for some, it just wasn&#x27;t feasible for me.</li>
            <li>best for polishing - Mega bristles cleans entire tooth and gum at same time, and the Wraparound cheek and tongue cleaner</li>
            <li>I love about this particular line</li>
            <li>The Full Head covers more area, while the more compact head can reach places that are harder to get to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big tongue scraper, but I found that this toothbrush got my mouth clean and felt good on my teeth, which are my main criteria.  </li>
            <li>Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend</li>
            <li>I find it comfortable to use, and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Too many brush are just bigger than I can comfortably use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like it&#x27;s wearing out pretty quickly?  </li>
            <li>The tip of the brush is raised to better clean the back teeth and between teeth.</li>
            <li>* reach for a healthier whole mouth clean.</li>
            <li>And both are 5 star brushes and clean teeth really well.</li>
            <li>There are also different sizes, some are \\&quot;full head\\&quot;, others are more compact.</li>
            <li>The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  </li>
            <li>While the tongue scrapper on the back of the head is convenient, I feel that my actual tongue scraper is more effective.  </li>
            <li>I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.</li>
            <li>The larger head reaches areas that a smaller toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t, providing a good clean mouth after brushing.  </li>
            <li>There are enough extra gizmos to give my teeth a good scrubbing (some may argue there is too much scrubbing, but my gentle brushing regime has no problem with this) and I love the cheek/tongue/gum cleaners.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles are gentle on your gums while a built in tongue cleaner helps power away even more</li>
            <li>Where once my teeth never felt clean without my Sonicare, now I can see how these Colgate toothbrushes are a fine second place!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Full Head (this particular one) versus Compact</li>
            <li>I feel that they are too big and creates more abrasion on my gums.</li>
            <li>While it cleans normally well, I feel that the wider brush actually hinders me from cleaning as effectively.</li>
            <li>In the end which on comes out as the favorite will be personal preference.</li>
            <li>so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really pretty with orange on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on the Colgate Total Advanced brush are more tightly compacted together, and there appear to be more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With that said, this was not such an amazingly large brush, but I do feel that it is more than I need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Raised tip helps clean hard-to-reach areas of the mouth&lt;br /&gt;Available in soft and medium bristle firmness&lt;br /&gt;Available</li>
            <li>Moreover, the full-sized head gave me a super clean feeling that I did not believe was possible with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I prefer the full head and soft brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the full head and soft brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was gentle on the mouth and my mouth was left feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  </li>
            <li>We still prefer our Braun electric toothbrushes but will certainly use this Colgate toothbrush for traveling or recommend it to our visiting relatives/friends.</li>
            <li>This 360 Total Advanced Full Head Soft toothbrush has multi-height bristles and rubber cups/blades to help remove odorous bacteria and plaque.  </li>
            <li>The back of the head is a great tongue scrubber, too--effective, but easier and less gaggy</li>
            <li>It costs a little more than some brushes, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I liked the longer bristles for reaching around the back of teeth but without a smaller head I can&#x27;t get much benefit.</li>
            <li>One has to hold them up side by side to really see the differences.</li>
            <li>Whole Mouth</li>
            <li>This brush was entirely gentle on my gums (I selected this &amp;#34;soft-bristled&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Likewise, the flip-side really is efficient for cleaning one&#x27;s tongue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is reasonably priced, and lives up to the Colgate name.  </li>
            <li>However the bulkiness makes is harder to maneuver as it takes up most off the space between my teeth and my cheeks.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t really review a toothbrush for its colors...</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does both of these very well.</li>
            <li>For me, either a toothbrush is comfortable or it isn&#x27;t, and my initial reaction to this one was, \\&quot;Ouch</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had problems not holding on to my toothbrush, so can&#x27;t really comment on the handle grips.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>a found the multi-height soft surround bristles and rubber blades to be non-abrasive and removed more plaque than regular toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quick mega clean before running out the store, this is for you - it is the fastest brushing ever due to the size of the brush.</li>
            <li>The neck is significantly thinner, making it easier to get to the back teeth.</li>
            <li>the 360 Whole Mouth Clean and this 360 Total Advanced brushes are serious tooth brushes, having many more features than the average brush.</li>
            <li>It also  has bristles that are different heights to help clean my teeth and rounded bristles in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both clean equally well</li>
            <li>These appear to be designed to clean inner cheeks and tongue during the brushing</li>
            <li>The varying length bristles allow the brush to clean different areas at once.</li>
            <li>The back of the head has nubs on it designed to clean the inside of your cheeks and lips.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush has a large head, which was hard to get used to at first, but which I quickly came to appreciate.  </li>
            <li>The day after I first tried it, my mouth was bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The day after I first tried it, my mouth was bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li>After trying out so many different toothbrushes, I have come to a personal realization....</li>
            <li>I amvery particular when choosing a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an odd feeling at first, but one I&#x27;ve come to enjoy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of this design with bristles and things going in all directions, I prefer to use this style of toothbrushes with toothpastes that create a lot of foam (such as the Colgate Smartfoam line), as opposed to the more flat paste type of toothpastes.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it has special bristles which are different heights and rounded bristles in the center that clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles keep this gentle despite all the extras.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush end is a pretty standard good-quality toothbrush, but the texture all around the brush head is what makes for a really cleaning experience.</li>
            <li>There is also a useful textured cheek and tongue cleaner on the back and sides of the bristle head.  </li>
            <li>A nice thick handle for ease of holding.</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice thick ergonomic non-slip grip.</li>
            <li>I brush my teeth for a single purpose - to get them clean.</li>
            <li>And all kinds of other things (360 degrees, Optic, Advanced, etc).</li>
            <li>The polishing cups inside the Colgate Total Advanced brush is a little smaller than the cups inside the Whole Mouth Clean brush, but that appears to be because the Total Advanced bush has more bristles, so there&#x27;s less room for larger polishing cups.</li>
            <li>last difference I noticed is the handle of the Total Advanced brush</li>
            <li>The differences between the Colgate 360 Total Advanced and the Whole Mouth Clean versions are subtle.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles are soft enough not to damage gums, but strong enough to brush away the debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I had that same reaction when I first used an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I had that same reaction when I first used an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to clean my gums and other parts of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that the head of the brush is too large.</li>
            <li>but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And so far no bristles have fallen out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Purple-ended tapered bristles gently reach deep between teeth and along the gumline</li>
            <li>However, if you have sensitive gums you might want to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the back is a raised scraper for gentle cleaning of your tongue and cheeks.</li>
            <li>both brushes have soft rubber &amp;#34;polishing cups&amp;#34; inside of the bristles.</li>
            <li>I am completely devoted to my Sonicare, but when traveling to conferences or going on family vacations, I always pack a manual one that I can toss at the end of the stay.</li>
            <li>The medium bristled one gets all the stuck on stuff off the surface of my teeth and the soft bristled</li>
            <li>The soft one is a bit softer but still ends up stiffer than I like.</li>
            <li>, you have the Basic, the Sensitive with softer bristles, the Optic White with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and the Total Advanced which has longer bristles for a deeper reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the name and description indicates, this is a very flexible toothbrush for cleaning everything inside the mouth, not only the teeth but also cheeks, tongue, and gums.</li>
            <li>, overall, I don&#x27;t recommend this particular model from Colgate.</li>
            <li>I can live with this brush and never go back to ovepriced sonicare.</li>
            <li>looks to be just a tiny bit larger (wider) than that of the 360 Whole Mouth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind cheek/tongue cleaners in general, but something about the wraparound design doesn&#x27;t work well with how I brush.  </li>
            <li>I will often use the soft bristle for adding a final polish after cleaning with the electric or medium toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles provide just enough cleaning power without hurting tender gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My routine includes 2 different toothbrushes, a medium bristled one for the evening and a soft bristled one for the morning.  </li>
            <li>is apparent.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying a few of these toothbrushes that are equipped with the little rubber flaps in place of bristles, and I am discovering that these fancy features do nothing more than make it difficult to do a quick, simple clean.</li>
            <li>There are &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; down the center to brush your teeth and side bristles that help clean the gums.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to my gums and to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles are soft, however, the front row is slightly harder than soft, especially out of the box.</li>
            <li>There are a wide variety of new features on toothbrushes that claims deeper cleaning, plaque removal, reduced sensitivity, whitening, etc..  </li>
            <li>They both clean very well and are a serious step above the typical every day toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than average, and highly textured, so while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth, you&#x27;re also scrubbing your cheeks and tongue with the nubby rubber texture.</li>

            <li> The &amp;#34;Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush, Soft&amp;#34; is a very good all around toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like the 360 Whole Mouth Clean as my favorite, but the Total Advanced brush might be a more favored choice for many.</li>
            <li> This brush is confortable to hold, seems well made and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Total® Advanced Floss-Tip† Bristles toothbrush provides 4x deeper</li>
            <li> This is a brush that boasts a collection of fancy perks while still remaining, quite comfortably, in the practical toothbrush category.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, and the ergonomics are good for me.</li>
            <li> I like the 360 Whole Mouth Clean as my favorite, but the Total Advanced brush might be a more favored choice for many.preference.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I am able to get the right amount of pressure on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The total advanced full head toothbrush does a great job of leaving my mouth and teeth thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After brushing my teeth feel clean and smooth as if I just visited the dentist.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has a nice handle that is easy to grip, soft bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums and a tongue and cheek cleaner that works.  </li>
            <li> Its unique features clean teeth and gums efficienly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean brush does not.</li>
            <li> Clean</li>
            <li> I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li> All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li> There are lighter pink rubbery bristly areas designed for superior gripping by your thumb and forefinger.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s all sorts of levels and shapes of bristles, and I like the way it fits around the teeth and gets maximum surface clean.  </li>
            <li> So while I&#x27;m sure the unusual design would work wonders for some, it just wasn&#x27;t feasible for me.</li>
            <li> best for polishing - Mega bristles cleans entire tooth and gum at same time, and the Wraparound cheek and tongue cleaner</li>
            <li> I love about this particular line</li>
            <li> The Full Head covers more area, while the more compact head can reach places that are harder to get to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big tongue scraper, but I found that this toothbrush got my mouth clean and felt good on my teeth, which are my main criteria.  </li>
            <li> Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend</li>
            <li> I find it comfortable to use, and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Too many brush are just bigger than I can comfortably use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s wearing out pretty quickly?  </li>
            <li> The tip of the brush is raised to better clean the back teeth and between teeth.</li>
            <li> * reach for a healthier whole mouth clean.</li>
            <li> And both are 5 star brushes and clean teeth really well.</li>
            <li> There are also different sizes, some are \\&quot;full head\\&quot;, others are more compact.</li>
            <li> The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  </li>
            <li> While the tongue scrapper on the back of the head is convenient, I feel that my actual tongue scraper is more effective.  </li>
            <li> I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy.</li>
            <li> The larger head reaches areas that a smaller toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t, providing a good clean mouth after brushing.  </li>
            <li> There are enough extra gizmos to give my teeth a good scrubbing (some may argue there is too much scrubbing, but my gentle brushing regime has no problem with this) and I love the cheek/tongue/gum cleaners.  </li>
            <li> Soft bristles are gentle on your gums while a built in tongue cleaner helps power away even more</li>
            <li> Where once my teeth never felt clean without my Sonicare, now I can see how these Colgate toothbrushes are a fine second place!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Full Head (this particular one) versus Compact</li>
            <li> I feel that they are too big and creates more abrasion on my gums.</li>
            <li> While it cleans normally well, I feel that the wider brush actually hinders me from cleaning as effectively.</li>
            <li> In the end which on comes out as the favorite will be personal preference.</li>
            <li> so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really pretty with orange on it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the Colgate Total Advanced brush are more tightly compacted together, and there appear to be more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With that said, this was not such an amazingly large brush, but I do feel that it is more than I need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Raised tip helps clean hard-to-reach areas of the mouth&lt;br /&gt;Available in soft and medium bristle firmness&lt;br /&gt;Available</li>
            <li> Moreover, the full-sized head gave me a super clean feeling that I did not believe was possible with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I prefer the full head and soft brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the full head and soft brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was gentle on the mouth and my mouth was left feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  </li>
            <li> We still prefer our Braun electric toothbrushes but will certainly use this Colgate toothbrush for traveling or recommend it to our visiting relatives/friends.</li>
            <li> This 360 Total Advanced Full Head Soft toothbrush has multi-height bristles and rubber cups/blades to help remove odorous bacteria and plaque.  </li>
            <li> The back of the head is a great tongue scrubber, too--effective, but easier and less gaggy</li>
            <li> It costs a little more than some brushes, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I liked the longer bristles for reaching around the back of teeth but without a smaller head I can&#x27;t get much benefit.</li>
            <li> One has to hold them up side by side to really see the differences.</li>
            <li> Whole Mouth</li>
            <li> This brush was entirely gentle on my gums (I selected this &amp;#34;soft-bristled&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Likewise, the flip-side really is efficient for cleaning one&#x27;s tongue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is reasonably priced, and lives up to the Colgate name.  </li>
            <li> However the bulkiness makes is harder to maneuver as it takes up most off the space between my teeth and my cheeks.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t really review a toothbrush for its colors...</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does both of these very well.</li>
            <li> For me, either a toothbrush is comfortable or it isn&#x27;t, and my initial reaction to this one was, \\&quot;Ouch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems not holding on to my toothbrush, so can&#x27;t really comment on the handle grips.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> a found the multi-height soft surround bristles and rubber blades to be non-abrasive and removed more plaque than regular toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quick mega clean before running out the store, this is for you - it is the fastest brushing ever due to the size of the brush.</li>
            <li> The neck is significantly thinner, making it easier to get to the back teeth.</li>
            <li> the 360 Whole Mouth Clean and this 360 Total Advanced brushes are serious tooth brushes, having many more features than the average brush.</li>
            <li> It also  has bristles that are different heights to help clean my teeth and rounded bristles in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Both clean equally well</li>
            <li> These appear to be designed to clean inner cheeks and tongue during the brushing</li>
            <li> The varying length bristles allow the brush to clean different areas at once.</li>
            <li> The back of the head has nubs on it designed to clean the inside of your cheeks and lips.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush has a large head, which was hard to get used to at first, but which I quickly came to appreciate.  </li>
            <li> The day after I first tried it, my mouth was bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li> The day after I first tried it, my mouth was bit sensitive.  </li>
            <li> After trying out so many different toothbrushes, I have come to a personal realization....</li>
            <li> I amvery particular when choosing a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd feeling at first, but one I&#x27;ve come to enjoy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of this design with bristles and things going in all directions, I prefer to use this style of toothbrushes with toothpastes that create a lot of foam (such as the Colgate Smartfoam line), as opposed to the more flat paste type of toothpastes.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it has special bristles which are different heights and rounded bristles in the center that clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles keep this gentle despite all the extras.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush end is a pretty standard good-quality toothbrush, but the texture all around the brush head is what makes for a really cleaning experience.</li>
            <li> There is also a useful textured cheek and tongue cleaner on the back and sides of the bristle head.  </li>
            <li> A nice thick handle for ease of holding.</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice thick ergonomic non-slip grip.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth for a single purpose - to get them clean.</li>
            <li> And all kinds of other things (360 degrees, Optic, Advanced, etc).</li>
            <li> The polishing cups inside the Colgate Total Advanced brush is a little smaller than the cups inside the Whole Mouth Clean brush, but that appears to be because the Total Advanced bush has more bristles, so there&#x27;s less room for larger polishing cups.</li>
            <li> last difference I noticed is the handle of the Total Advanced brush</li>
            <li> The differences between the Colgate 360 Total Advanced and the Whole Mouth Clean versions are subtle.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are soft enough not to damage gums, but strong enough to brush away the debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I had that same reaction when I first used an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I had that same reaction when I first used an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to clean my gums and other parts of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that the head of the brush is too large.</li>
            <li> but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And so far no bristles have fallen out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Purple-ended tapered bristles gently reach deep between teeth and along the gumline</li>
            <li> However, if you have sensitive gums you might want to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the back is a raised scraper for gentle cleaning of your tongue and cheeks.</li>
            <li> both brushes have soft rubber &amp;#34;polishing cups&amp;#34; inside of the bristles.</li>
            <li> I am completely devoted to my Sonicare, but when traveling to conferences or going on family vacations, I always pack a manual one that I can toss at the end of the stay.</li>
            <li> The medium bristled one gets all the stuck on stuff off the surface of my teeth and the soft bristled</li>
            <li> The soft one is a bit softer but still ends up stiffer than I like.</li>
            <li> , you have the Basic, the Sensitive with softer bristles, the Optic White with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and the Total Advanced which has longer bristles for a deeper reach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the name and description indicates, this is a very flexible toothbrush for cleaning everything inside the mouth, not only the teeth but also cheeks, tongue, and gums.</li>
            <li> , overall, I don&#x27;t recommend this particular model from Colgate.</li>
            <li> I can live with this brush and never go back to ovepriced sonicare.</li>
            <li> looks to be just a tiny bit larger (wider) than that of the 360 Whole Mouth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind cheek/tongue cleaners in general, but something about the wraparound design doesn&#x27;t work well with how I brush.  </li>
            <li> I will often use the soft bristle for adding a final polish after cleaning with the electric or medium toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles provide just enough cleaning power without hurting tender gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My routine includes 2 different toothbrushes, a medium bristled one for the evening and a soft bristled one for the morning.  </li>
            <li> is apparent.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying a few of these toothbrushes that are equipped with the little rubber flaps in place of bristles, and I am discovering that these fancy features do nothing more than make it difficult to do a quick, simple clean.</li>
            <li> There are &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; down the center to brush your teeth and side bristles that help clean the gums.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to my gums and to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles are soft, however, the front row is slightly harder than soft, especially out of the box.</li>
            <li> There are a wide variety of new features on toothbrushes that claims deeper cleaning, plaque removal, reduced sensitivity, whitening, etc..  </li>
            <li> They both clean very well and are a serious step above the typical every day toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger than average, and highly textured, so while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth, you&#x27;re also scrubbing your cheeks and tongue with the nubby rubber texture.</li>
            <li> One small difference is the Total Advanced brush also has a little bit of textured rubber on the side of the brush head which they call their wrap around cleaner.</li>
            <li> These Colgate 360 toothbrushes feature an extra-wide, extra-deep head to brush both the back and front of your teeth clear down to the gum line at the same time.  </li>
            <li> brushes have staggered bristles for not just cleaning the outside of the teeth, but also in the crevices and additional long bristles for getting around the gum line.</li>
            <li> I bought a medium instead of soft to hopefully make it last a little longer.</li>
            <li> head itself is soft, with bristles of different heights, and little rubber cups that rub the toothpaste across the teeth and polish them.  </li>
            <li> B000OLE7PO Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft, Compact 34, 1 Toothbrush, (Case of 6)]] toothbrush over every toothbrush, so it&#x27;s hard to rate any other one a 5 after using that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, there is the usual Soft and Medium and such.</li>
            <li> Takes less effort to do the same type of brushing as with smaller heads.  </li>
            <li> The handle looks like rubber with an acrylic insert, and it has a design on the back etched in the softer rubber or latex that helps you grip it even if you have very wet</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is a bit different than conventional brushes.</li>
            <li> did have to be careful not to brush too long until my mouth got used the stimulation.  </li>

            <li> in blue, lime green, orange and purple</li>
            <li> I have no real complaints about this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Though that could just be me misunderstanding it due to the oversized head, which I&#x27;m not used to in a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Slimmer, lighter, cheaper than other powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the head is so deep and bulky.</li>
            <li> Note that the &amp;#34;polishing cups&amp;#34; are actually just small rubber pieces nestled in-between the bristles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other &amp;#34;tongue and cheek&amp;#34; scrapers on toothbrushes before, these aren&#x27;t any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has \\&quot;cups\\&quot; down the center, surrounded by longer bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dentists typically recommend softer bristles because harder bristles can damage the gums with aggressive brushing.  </li>
            <li> Because of this formation, you can feel the bristles reaching areas that a conventional toothbrush cannot reach as effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ridges on the back of the toothbrush are a bit shallow for one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the bristles were a little harsh for a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush, but they softened up after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I get a tooth brush I look for a few things.</li>
            <li> pink with blues in the bristles, pearlescent running stripes leading down the handle to a bulging clear window in the base.</li>
            <li> Been using expensive oral-b and sonicare since mid &#x27;00.</li>
            <li> Although Colgate has a number of studies to validate the effectiveness of the brushes (see their website), I failed to find evidence of the American Dental Association seal of approval.  </li>
            <li> The Medium brush has what seems to me to be very stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> I have been trying lots of toothbrushes lately.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m giving it three stars, but I never really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head of this toothbrush is a little weird - it looks like some sort of avant-garde art project.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a fairly small mouth, and I found this &amp;#34;full head&amp;#34; toothbrush uncomfortable to use and hard to maneuver into hard-to-reach areas.  </li>
            <li> I think I might be addicted to toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> As I brush, it would scratch against my lips and be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> This is a complicated toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> - Experts say that you should change out your toothbrush every three months whether it appears to need it or not - and also after you&#x27;ve had a cold, the flu or a strep infection.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s wearing out pretty quickly?  Though that could just be me misunderstanding it due to the oversized head, which I&#x27;m not used to in a toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve had it about three weeks now?  And so far no bristles have fallen out.  The grip is fine.  And I think I love the oversized head.  It&#x27;s easier to clean my gums and other parts of my mouth.  Takes less effort to do the same type of brushing as with smaller heads.  I&#x27;ll buy another one in this style.</li>
            <li> Vibrates 20,000 strokes/minute. My sonicare brushes vibrated 30,000s/m. Slimmer, lighter, cheaper than other powered toothbrushes. I can live with this brush and never go back to ovepriced sonicare. I didn&#x27;t know these brushes existed until now. Been using expensive oral-b and sonicare since mid &#x27;00. This brush is confortable to hold, seems well made and easy to clean. What i don&#x27;t like about it is the bulky non-replaceable head. It needs to be slimmer, more like sonicare proresults size. Rubberized wraparound cheek tongue cleaner is not needed. Non-replaceable head makes it disposable. I bought a medium instead of soft to hopefully make it last a little longer. My sonicare soft/medium heads lasted about a year.</li>
            <li> After trying out so many different toothbrushes, I have come to a personal realization....I do not prefer the wide bodied brush heads. I feel that they are too big and creates more abrasion on my gums. With that said, this was not such an amazingly large brush, but I do feel that it is more than I need. I like the handle and the grip, which makes it very comfortable. The tongue scraper, as with all the others I have tried, doesn&#x27;t domuch for me, and I just use the brush to brush my tongue. Because of my situation (extensive radiation to my head and neck) I amvery particular when choosing a toothbrush. I need to find as perfect a brush as I can. I feel that the 360 line is not for me. While it cleans normally well, I feel that the wider brush actually hinders me from cleaning as effectively.</li>
            <li> best for polishing - Mega bristles cleans entire tooth and gum at same time, and the Wraparound cheek and tongue cleaner does it&#x27;s thing too.  If you are looking for a quick mega clean before running out the store, this is for you - it is the fastest brushing ever due to the size of the brush. I mostly use the brushes for travel now and for when I don&#x27;t want the electric brush to wake the house. I will often use the soft bristle for adding a final polish after cleaning with the electric or medium toothbrush. The tip of the brush is raised to better clean the back teeth and between teeth. A nice thick handle for ease of holding. My family have used Colgate toothpaste and toothbrushes for almost 100 years. While I have always tried the newest product on the market I always find myself coming back to Colgate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Colgate: The Colgate® 360°® Total® Advanced Floss-Tip† Bristles toothbrush provides 4x deeper* reach for a healthier whole mouth clean.

            <li> This toothbrush is a bit different than conventional brushes. It has \\&quot;cups\\&quot; down the center, surrounded by longer bristles. When you use it, the cups brush your teeth and the bristles brush your gums. It&#x27;s an odd feeling at first, but one I&#x27;ve come to enjoy. However, if you have sensitive gums you might want to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the back is a raised scraper for gentle cleaning of your tongue and cheeks. While I&#x27;ve never felt a need to brush my cheeks, I like to brush my tongue, so it&#x27;s a handy feature.</li>
            <li> The total advanced full head toothbrush does a great job of leaving my mouth and teeth thoroughly clean. The brush head is fairly big and wraps around my teeth, cleaning front back and in between while the backside of it cleans the inside of my cheeks. The handle feels great in my hand and I feel like I am able to get the right amount of pressure on my teeth.</li>
            <li> The head of this toothbrush is a little weird - it looks like some sort of avant-garde art project.  There are &amp;#34;cups&amp;#34; down the center to brush your teeth and side bristles that help clean the gums.  A tongue cleaner wraps around the back to get every last bacteria in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got a fairly small mouth, and I found this &amp;#34;full head&amp;#34; toothbrush uncomfortable to use and hard to maneuver into hard-to-reach areas.  So while I&#x27;m sure the unusual design would work wonders for some, it just wasn&#x27;t feasible for me.</li>
            <li> I have been trying lots of toothbrushes lately. One thing that I have learned is that although I am a big mouth, I don&#x27;t have a big mouth. Too many brush are just bigger than I can comfortably use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those. I am not sure why the head is so deep and bulky. But it made my back teeth inaccessible. I liked the longer bristles for reaching around the back of teeth but without a smaller head I can&#x27;t get much benefit.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush end is a pretty standard good-quality toothbrush, but the texture all around the brush head is what makes for a really cleaning experience. It&#x27;s bigger than average, and highly textured, so while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth, you&#x27;re also scrubbing your cheeks and tongue with the nubby rubber texture. The back of the head is a great tongue scrubber, too--effective, but easier and less gaggy that scrubbing your tongue with the brush.</li>
            <li> The differences between the Colgate 360 Total Advanced and the Whole Mouth Clean versions are subtle. One has to hold them up side by side to really see the differences. They both clean very well and are a serious step above the typical every day toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both brushes have staggered bristles for not just cleaning the outside of the teeth, but also in the crevices and additional long bristles for getting around the gum line. Where the two versions start to vary is the alignment of the bristles on the brush head. The bristles on the Colgate Total Advanced brush are more tightly compacted together, and there appear to be more of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also both brushes have soft rubber &amp;#34;polishing cups&amp;#34; inside of the bristles. The polishing cups inside the Colgate Total Advanced brush is a little smaller than the cups inside the Whole Mouth Clean brush, but that appears to be because the Total Advanced bush has more bristles, so there&#x27;s less room for larger polishing cups. Note that the &amp;#34;polishing cups&amp;#34; are actually just small rubber pieces nestled in-between the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads of both brushes are nice and full in size. And both brushes have a rubber textured back on the brush head, which cleans the cheeks and can be used for cleaning the tongue. One small difference is the Total Advanced brush also has a little bit of textured rubber on the side of the brush head which they call their wrap around cleaner. Where as the 360 Whole Mouth Clean brush does not. It just has the rubber on the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the last difference I noticed is the handle of the Total Advanced brush looks to be just a tiny bit larger (wider) than that of the 360 Whole Mouth Clean brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the 360 Whole Mouth Clean and this 360 Total Advanced brushes are serious tooth brushes, having many more features than the average brush. And both are 5 star brushes and clean teeth really well. In the end which on comes out as the favorite will be personal preference. I like the 360 Whole Mouth Clean as my favorite, but the Total Advanced brush might be a more favored choice for many.preference.

            <li> This toothbrush has a nice handle that is easy to grip, soft bristles that clean my teeth and gums but do not hurt my gums and a tongue and cheek cleaner that works.  It also  has bristles that are different heights to help clean my teeth and rounded bristles in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get a tooth brush I look for a few things. I want the bristles to clean my teeth and gums but not hurt my gums.  I also want a toothbrush that is easy to hold after a long day of typing on a computer and writing and that has a shape that makes brushing easy. Finally, I like toothbrushes that have tongue cleaners because there are times when I eat something like chocolate or yogurt or drink tea or coffee and my tongue and even gums feel like they could use a cleaning.  This toothbrush has all the things for which I am looking plus it has special bristles which are different heights and rounded bristles in the center that clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li> I am completely devoted to my Sonicare, but when traveling to conferences or going on family vacations, I always pack a manual one that I can toss at the end of the stay. I gave this brush (and three others) a try on my last trip. This brush was entirely gentle on my gums (I selected this &amp;#34;soft-bristled&amp;#34; brush since it was the style my dentist recommended). Moreover, the full-sized head gave me a super clean feeling that I did not believe was possible with a manual brush. Likewise, the flip-side really is efficient for cleaning one&#x27;s tongue. Manual brushes have truly evolved in the last ten years! Where once my teeth never felt clean without my Sonicare, now I can see how these Colgate toothbrushes are a fine second place! Recommended!</li>
            <li> Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush has a large head, which was hard to get used to at first, but which I quickly came to appreciate.  The larger head reaches areas that a smaller toothbrush wouldn&#x27;t, providing a good clean mouth after brushing.  The soft bristles provide just enough cleaning power without hurting tender gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a toothbrush that I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the way this toothbrush makes my teeth feel after I brush.  It&#x27;s easy to cover every surface.  The soft bristles are soft enough not to damage gums, but strong enough to brush away the debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonably priced, and lives up to the Colgate name.  I still prefer the [[ASIN:B000OLE7PO Colgate 360 Degree Sensitive Toothbrush, Extra Soft, Compact 34, 1 Toothbrush, (Case of 6)]] toothbrush over every toothbrush, so it&#x27;s hard to rate any other one a 5 after using that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice toothbrush that easily gets the job done, give this one a try!</li>
            <li> I have been trying a few of these toothbrushes that are equipped with the little rubber flaps in place of bristles, and I am discovering that these fancy features do nothing more than make it difficult to do a quick, simple clean. I do like the lengthier bristles along the side, but perhaps that is only amplified by the lack of bristles in the middle.</li>
            <li> I think I might be addicted to toothbrushes.  My routine includes 2 different toothbrushes, a medium bristled one for the evening and a soft bristled one for the morning.  The medium bristled one gets all the stuck on stuff off the surface of my teeth and the soft bristled one massages my gums and gets into the nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this particular line is the silicone grip on both sides of the handle.  I feel that it helps me maneuver the brush better. The ergonomic shape of the handle is ok.  While the tongue scrapper on the back of the head is convenient, I feel that my actual tongue scraper is more effective.  The ridges on the back of the toothbrush are a bit shallow for one pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, recommended if you&#x27;re looking for a toothbrush with a better grip.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth for a single purpose - to get them clean. The Medium brush has what seems to me to be very stiff bristles. The soft one is a bit softer but still ends up stiffer than I like. The cups are supposed to hold the toothpaste in better to help whiten and shine your teeth. I guess they do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had other &amp;#34;tongue and cheek&amp;#34; scrapers on toothbrushes before, these aren&#x27;t any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a three - not my cup of tea (or my cleaning choice AFTER my cup of tea).</li>
            <li> All of the toothbrushes in the Colgate 360 line will effectively clean your teeth.  Although Colgate has a number of studies to validate the effectiveness of the brushes (see their website), I failed to find evidence of the American Dental Association seal of approval.  Perhaps it is too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal preference plays a role in which toothbrush design is most comfortable for you.  Some people prefer smaller, shorter heads while others find the larger, longer heads cover more ground when brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dentists typically recommend softer bristles because harder bristles can damage the gums with aggressive brushing.  Medium bristles are fine for younger people with healthy gums but the dentists I work with never recommend hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think manual toothbrushes are a good adjunct to powered toothbrushes but I prefer powered ones for daily use.  I use the manual ones at work and when traveling.  Both clean equally well but the powered one is easier for most people to use, help protect teeth from brushing too hard, and you tend to brush longer with the powered ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cultures promote tongue cleaning much more than do Americans so the textured back of the brush was an innovative way to introduce the process to our masses.  Tongue cleaning reportedly reduces bad breath and reduces bacteria known to contribute to periodontal problems, tooth decay, gum infection, gum recession, and tooth loss (Wikipedia). I have now added it to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The textured gel pad was a nice touch because it makes the brush easier to hold, particularly when wet and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the four designs from this line that I tried, you have the Basic, the Sensitive with softer bristles, the Optic White with whitening cups and polishing bristles, and the Total Advanced which has longer bristles for a deeper reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Colgate has made big jump forward in brush design with this brush.  I was surprised at how stimulating it felt to my gums and to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.  This brush was my favorite of the line.  I prefer the full head and soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to be careful not to brush too long until my mouth got used the stimulation.  The day after I first tried it, my mouth was bit sensitive.  But I had that same reaction when I first used an electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these 360&#x27;s will go into everyone&#x27;s Christmas stocking this year.t to my gums and to have the sides of my mouth brushed at the same time as my teeth.  This brush was my favorite of the line.  I prefer the full head and soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have to be careful not to brush too long until my mouth got used the stimulation.

            <li> I gave up looking for the perfect or ideal toothbrush. Instead I use a rotation of different toothbrushes, each with different designs and features. Colgate makes a variety of models with these \\&quot;surround bristles\\&quot;, arranged in different formations. There are also different sizes, some are \\&quot;full head\\&quot;, others are more compact. Also, there is the usual Soft and Medium and such. And all kinds of other things (360 degrees, Optic, Advanced, etc). The name and marketing terms on them is a railroad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft, however, the front row is slightly harder than soft, especially out of the box. They soften up over time. The sensitivity obviously may vary from person to person. Because of this formation, you can feel the bristles reaching areas that a conventional toothbrush cannot reach as effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush also has a tongue and cheek cleaning component. The handle has a nice thick ergonomic non-slip grip. The neck is significantly thinner, making it easier to get to the back teeth. The color scheme is nice although obviously it does not affect the cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Full Head (this particular one) versus Compact/Smaller heads is a trade off of sorts. The Full Head covers more area, while the more compact head can reach places that are harder to get to. That&#x27;s where my multiple toothbrush strategy comes in - I don&#x27;t have to pick, I rotate between them instead. But if I had to pick only one of the two, I would probably go with the compact head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of this design with bristles and things going in all directions, I prefer to use this style of toothbrushes with toothpastes that create a lot of foam (such as the Colgate Smartfoam line), as opposed to the more flat paste type of toothpastes.</li>
            <li> This is a brush that boasts a collection of fancy perks while still remaining, quite comfortably, in the practical toothbrush category.  There are enough extra gizmos to give my teeth a good scrubbing (some may argue there is too much scrubbing, but my gentle brushing regime has no problem with this) and I love the cheek/tongue/gum cleaners.  The soft bristles keep this gentle despite all the extras.  Top of the line!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice toothbrush. It has soft bristles that aren&#x27;t too rough on my teeth or gums. I get a nice clean with this brush and it is easy to hold. I also like the tongue and cheek cleaner on the head of the brush. My only problem is that the head of the brush is too large. I prefer compact toothbrush heads, but that is just personal preference.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Colgate toothbrushes over the years.  There are a wide variety of new features on toothbrushes that claims deeper cleaning, plaque removal, reduced sensitivity, whitening, etc..  This 360 Total Advanced Full Head Soft toothbrush has multi-height bristles and rubber cups/blades to help remove odorous bacteria and plaque.  There is also a useful textured cheek and tongue cleaner on the back and sides of the bristle head.  We tried it (several samples) for a week a found the multi-height soft surround bristles and rubber blades to be non-abrasive and removed more plaque than regular toothbrushes.  The wraparound tongue freshener scraper helps remove smelly plaque and buildup from tongue and cheeks.  We still prefer our Braun electric toothbrushes but will certainly use this Colgate toothbrush for traveling or recommend it to our visiting relatives/friends.</li>
            <li> I have the impression that this over sized head does clean better than most tooth brushes.  However the bulkiness makes is harder to maneuver as it takes up most off the space between my teeth and my cheeks. I think after a day or two I&#x27;ll get used to it.  Just plan on an extra 15-30 seconds to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> I really liked this toothbrush. I felt as though I was getting a good cleaning of my teeth and gums. I have no real complaints about this toothbrush. The circles may or may not be gimmicks but they feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.&lt;br /&gt;No ADA seal.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a nice bright (not garish) pink with blues in the bristles, pearlescent running stripes leading down the handle to a bulging clear window in the base. There are lighter pink rubbery bristly areas designed for superior gripping by your thumb and forefinger. There is also a sticky, almost adhesive area on the back of the head where one notices tiny dots, plus a similar roughened area all along the outer edge. These appear to be designed to clean inner cheeks and tongue during the brushing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t really review a toothbrush for its colors... just sayin&#x27;. What&#x27;s actually important to me is the design of both the handle - for optimum gripping and manipulation within the mouth - and of the head for maximum effectiveness in cleaning. This toothbrush does both of these very well.</li>
            <li> As the name and description indicates, this is a very flexible toothbrush for cleaning everything inside the mouth, not only the teeth but also cheeks, tongue, and gums. I tried it out and liked the flexibility. It was gentle on the mouth and my mouth was left feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head Toothbrush, Soft&amp;#34; is a very good all around toothbrush. The bristles are soft, and the ergonomics are good for me. I find it comfortable to use, and it cleans very well. The varying length bristles allow the brush to clean different areas at once. It costs a little more than some brushes, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush.  It doesn&#x27;t look or feel at all cheap, rather very good quality is apparent.  It&#x27;s well balance with a bit of tilt on the head.  The handle looks like rubber with an acrylic insert, and it has a design on the back etched in the softer rubber or latex that helps you grip it even if you have very wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;It has a tongue cleaner on the front and back. The back of the head has nubs on it designed to clean the inside of your cheeks and lips.&lt;br /&gt;The head itself is soft, with bristles of different heights, and little rubber cups that rub the toothpaste across the teeth and polish them.  I got a white one, it&#x27;s really pretty with orange on it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very nice to handle and use.</li>
            <li> I use a Sonicare electric toothbrush in the morning and bedtime, but for those in-between brushings, I use a manual toothbrush.  I like this Colgate 360 Total Advanced Full Head toothbrush.  The handle is nicely rounded and chunky, and it is easy to grip.  The full head is a bit too large for my mouth though.  To easily access my back teeth, I prefer a compact head.  I thought the bristles were a little harsh for a \\&quot;soft\\&quot; toothbrush, but they softened up after a few uses.  I would buy this type of toothbrush again, but with the compact head.</li>
            <li> These Colgate 360 toothbrushes feature an extra-wide, extra-deep head to brush both the back and front of your teeth clear down to the gum line at the same time.  Soft bristles are gentle on your gums while a built in tongue cleaner helps power away even more bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - Experts say that you should change out your toothbrush every three months whether it appears to need it or not - and also after you&#x27;ve had a cold, the flu or a strep infection. Germs can hide in those bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> I use an electric toothbrush in the mornings, but I use a manual brush at work after lunch and in the evenings at home.  My favorite brush for years has been the [[ASIN:B003UZTF9E Oral-B Pro-Health All-In-One Toothbrush]] because I like the thicker handle, the comfortable bristles, and the clean feeling that I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush also has a nice handle that fits my hand well, and I like the bristles on this model.  The thing that I don&#x27;t like is the wraparound cheek/tongue cleaner.  As I brush, it would scratch against my lips and be uncomfortable.  I don&#x27;t mind cheek/tongue cleaners in general, but something about the wraparound design doesn&#x27;t work well with how I brush.  For me, either a toothbrush is comfortable or it isn&#x27;t, and my initial reaction to this one was, \\&quot;Ouch, I don&#x27;t like it.\\&quot;  I did get more used to it over a couple of weeks of use, and it did make my mouth feel clean - so I&#x27;m giving it three stars, but I never really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, I don&#x27;t recommend this particular model from Colgate.</li>
            <li> This is a complicated toothbrush.  There&#x27;s all sorts of levels and shapes of bristles, and I like the way it fits around the teeth and gets maximum surface clean.  There&#x27;s also all sorts of grips and nubs, on the handle, as well as on the head.  I&#x27;ve never had problems not holding on to my toothbrush, so can&#x27;t really comment on the handle grips.  The ones on the head are meant to be for tongue cleaning.  I&#x27;m not a big tongue scraper, but I found that this toothbrush got my mouth clean and felt good on my teeth, which are my main criteria.  I&#x27;d buy one of these again.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothbrush of all time.  After brushing my teeth feel clean and smooth as if I just visited the dentist.  Also, it&#x27;s gentle on my gums.</li>
