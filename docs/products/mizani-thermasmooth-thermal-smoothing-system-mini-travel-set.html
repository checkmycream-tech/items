            <li> It was still frizzy the first few days.</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn thick hair that is basically the same texture as steel wool.  </li>
            <li> I ended up wearing my hair in a ponytail because the end result was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I can get the same if not better results with Garnier Fructis sleek &amp; Shine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it works on nappy, I mean, natural hair, but as a Black woman with a relaxer after using the shampoo and conditioner it extends the life of your relaxer.  </li>
            <li> it was a mess.</li>
            <li> The shine extend had a very heavy alcohol fragrance due to all the alcohol thats in it.</li>
            <li> I used all the steps and no more frizz !</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner as well its very thick and has some slip.</li>

            <li> I have colored treated hair with highlights. I don&#x27;t use relaxers. I absolutely love this product. I used it immediately upon arrival. This was the best thing for my fine hair. Made my hair soft, with shine, and frizz free. So, I ordered the larger sizes. I plan to stick to this regimen of using the four products. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed! I absolutely love this product!! It seems like I know my hair and what products I need better than my hair salon. This is definitely a keeper. Mizani was spot on with this one! Thanks for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product was just okay for me. I wanted something to use on my hair since I don&#x27;t have a relaxer. I expected more with it being Mizani.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem to work at all for my hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an African descendant with natural or transitioning hair, then this product is for you. I have very stubborn thick hair that is basically the same texture as steel wool.  Mizani Thermasmooth makes my hair so soft and silky, with only a blow dryer and flat iron. I haven&#x27;t used a chemical relaxer in 2 years, and this stuff makes my hair bone straight.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to perfect how the stylist made my hair feel with these products but it still comes out soft. Worth the buy if you don&#x27;t want to go all out for the full bottles!</li>
            <li> I like the size which allows me to try the products before committing. Arrived on time without damage. I have used it but the results varied.  I have coily/kinky hair and can attest humidity was not blocked completly. Summer has just started in New York-hot and humid.  For work I style my hair straight but mid day it will start to curl.  I will continue to use until finished because to o like how the products soften the hair.</li>
            <li> Mizani should use this line as their flag ship product.  I don&#x27;t know how well it works on nappy, I mean, natural hair, but as a Black woman with a relaxer after using the shampoo and conditioner it extends the life of your relaxer.  It makes your hair feel straight, soft and simply delightful.  This smoothing line absolutely works!!!!</li>
            <li> Not for transitioning. Maybe for extending time between relaxer.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy hair so after day 3, my hair would stay straight. It was still frizzy the first few days. go figure.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. I&#x27;m glad I bought the travel size to test it out before I bought the full size. I can get the same if not better results with Garnier Fructis sleek &amp; Shine. I have curly/Coily (3c 4a) hair. They have the same exact step system and at a cheaper price.the only thing I can say I like about this product is the scent. The shine extend had a very heavy alcohol fragrance due to all the alcohol thats in it. I like the conditioner as well its very thick and has some slip. The straightening serum didn&#x27;t have that much slip when I went to blow drying it was a mess. Overall I would invest in the shampoo and conditioner but I can do with out the last two steps</li>
            <li> My mother laughed after I used these and my hair was still wavy and the GA humidity totally voided its promises.  Lol</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS!! I used all the steps and no more frizz ! Must buy! Especially cause my hair dresser uses it !</li>
            <li> This product did not work. I have been natural for about 2 year and I have 4B/A texture hair.  The spritz spray made my hair hard and crunchy and flat ironing my hair wasn&#x27;t enjoyable. I ended up wearing my hair in a ponytail because the end result was not what I expected. The volume of my hair was reduced but my hair was still frizzy and didn&#x27;t flow freely.</li>
            <li> Works very well..would&#x27;ve been better if i had finished styling my hair in the same day, but the system worked really nicely...no frizz, no puffiness, just constant smoothness :)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. I am transistioning from years of relaxing my hair and this product has made the transistion so much easier,</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This is one of the greatest products that any company has made that I have tried.  My hair was bone straight, which is the way that I love it.  I will definitely get the larger set.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Beautiful results. My hair is type 4B. I followed the instructions and the results were amazing. Believe me!.</li>
