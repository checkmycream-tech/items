            <li>soft perfect color and hair can&#x27;t wait to buy more... easy to style and care for</li>

            <li>this is my favorite wig ever.</li>
            <li>I love wearing it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I was Expecting it to look a bit more real, then again the price is actually pretty good for the quality ^_^</li>
            <li>But it is cute for a fun wear.</li>
            <li>so much fun love it...</li>
            <li>, I enjoy wearing it, it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>it arrived earlier than estimated and was in great condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bangs are long but make great swooped side bangs</li>
            <li>It looks the most natural of all my wigs and the length is just adorable.</li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this wig, it&#x27;s very soft and matches my skin tone very well</li>
            <li>First of all, let me start by saying I&#x27;ve ordered a LOT of wigs here on Amazon, and even though this one is a pastel pink, it&#x27;s probably the best-styled and most convincing looking one I own.</li>
            <li>Soooo many people ask me how much this cost.</li>
            <li>My new favorite.</li>
            <li>the hooks really helped to make it fit my head</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is EXACTLY like the picture.</li>
            <li>I feel like I would like it even better if I could style the bangs differently.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s pink, has a beautiful and fun, bouncy curl and is the softest, muted, multi-toned pink I have ever seen in a wig.  </li>
            <li>so the netting underneath doesn&#x27;t show other than that it is nice.</li>
            <li>Two Tone Short Straight BOB Stylish Kanekalon Highlight Wig&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, looks somehow like real hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality wig, the hair feels real, not at all like a synthetic wig from a costume shop.</li>
            <li>People often make comments like it&#x27;s my real hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great price, kanekalon so it doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as other synthetic wigs, was able to use my straitner without any problems, fits my big head, my boyfriend loves it, he said it looks so natural I could wear it without a hat, I LOVE the color very classy and tasteful shade for pink</li>
            <li>so you can kind of your real hair, and it does look pretty fake</li>
            <li>This wig came more grayish pink than cotton candy pink, it actually made the girl wearing it look like an old lady.  </li>
            <li>New Kanekalon Short BOB Style Wavy Heat Resistant Kanekalon Hair Wig</li>
            <li>Turns out it&#x27;s not the perfect shade of pink for my skin tone, but that&#x27;s just too bad for me.  </li>
            <li>It is a little thinner at the top, but even with my dark hair, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable if you wear a light colored wig cap.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s kind of sad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more muted than the photo and on my tanned olive skin it looks really pale.</li>
            <li>Super soft, pale pink wig.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it is a slight bit thin up around where the bangs part, but that&#x27;s easy enough to fix by holding the bangs to the side with your fingers and combing straight down the part with a fine toothed comb.</li>

            <li> New Fashion Ladies&#x27; Fluffy Personality Kanekalon Long Wavy Human Hair Wig</li>
            <li> I have a really small head that is one of the reasons I chose the wig the other is because it really is heat resistance I straightened it</li>
            <li> If you look closely, you can see individual blonde-ish hairs in the mix, so it definitely helps give it a little multi-tone</li>
            <li> Even my conservative grandma, who chastised me to no end when I had pink streaks in my hair, adores this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is not straight pink</li>
            <li> it is pink steaks with  caramel blond type color streaks</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig few months ago, i even brushed it with wig brush and it didn&#x27;t freeze.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is where the bangs and hair that frames your face has a small patch that shows the cap of the wig.</li>
            <li> the only  two down sides are the back is really thin</li>
            <li> and you need to tease and mess with the hair in the front</li>
            <li> A little too fakey looking.</li>
            <li> I even got a few wears out of it without having to style it.</li>
            <li> but I felt it was too stiff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit thin</li>
            <li> Usually wigs that have too-long bangs end up looking weird if you try to part them, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m using it for cosplay, and I cannot.</li>
            <li> I usually hate the pepto bismol color</li>

            <li> I bought 3 hair pieces to wear while going through chemo.&lt;br /&gt;1. 2013 Two Tone Short Straight BOB Stylish Kanekalon Highlight Wig&lt;br /&gt;2. 2013 New Kanekalon Short BOB Style Wavy Heat Resistant Kanekalon Hair Wig&lt;br /&gt;3. New Fashion Ladies&#x27; Fluffy Personality Kanekalon Long Wavy Human Hair Wig&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like #2 but I felt it was too stiff. Maybe after I rinse it out it will be softer. It&#x27;s a little more muted than the photo and on my tanned olive skin it looks really pale. But it is cute for a fun wear.</li>
            <li> so much fun love it... soft perfect color and hair can&#x27;t wait to buy more... easy to style and care for</li>
            <li> This wig exceeded my expectations! It looks the most natural of all my wigs and the length is just adorable. I even got a few wears out of it without having to style it. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me start by saying I&#x27;ve ordered a LOT of wigs here on Amazon, and even though this one is a pastel pink, it&#x27;s probably the best-styled and most convincing looking one I own. If you look closely, you can see individual blonde-ish hairs in the mix, so it definitely helps give it a little multi-tone look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is EXACTLY like the picture. Same color, curls, and everything. The only complaint I have is that it is a slight bit thin up around where the bangs part, but that&#x27;s easy enough to fix by holding the bangs to the side with your fingers and combing straight down the part with a fine toothed comb. Usually wigs that have too-long bangs end up looking weird if you try to part them, but not this one. Even my conservative grandma, who chastised me to no end when I had pink streaks in my hair, adores this wig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically if you&#x27;re on the fence about this...don&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> This wig surpassed my expectations.  It&#x27;s exactly as pictured, looks somehow like real hair even though it&#x27;s pink, has a beautiful and fun, bouncy curl and is the softest, muted, multi-toned pink I have ever seen in a wig.  My new favorite.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this wig, it&#x27;s very soft and matches my skin tone very well, I enjoy wearing it, it is comfortable. The only problem I have is where the bangs and hair that frames your face has a small patch that shows the cap of the wig.</li>
            <li> I wore this to a murder mystery party and loved it. It doubled as a great Effie Trinket wig. Looks just like the picture. It&#x27;s a quality wig, the hair feels real, not at all like a synthetic wig from a costume shop.</li>
            <li> This wig is adorable! I feel like I would like it even better if I could style the bangs differently. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m using it for cosplay, and I cannot. But this wig is really gorgeous, just how it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> The color is nice but the wig it self it&#x27;s a little bit thin so you can kind of your real hair, and it does look pretty fake so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s kind of sad I was Expecting it to look a bit more real, then again the price is actually pretty good for the quality ^_^</li>
            <li> This is a great wig.  Turns out it&#x27;s not the perfect shade of pink for my skin tone, but that&#x27;s just too bad for me.  The wig itself is a great value, nice body and shaping.  A great look.  Not fuzzy a the crown like so many cheep wigs, can get lot&#x27;s of wear and enjoyment from this wig.  I would purchase again (but make a smarter color choice for my skin tone).  :0)</li>
            <li> So cute, and perfect for my steampunk costume!</li>
            <li> Super soft, pale pink wig. Love the feminine curls. It is a little thinner at the top, but even with my dark hair, it&#x27;s hardly noticeable if you wear a light colored wig cap. It kinda gives you a Marilyn Monroe feel.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite wig ever. and I have about 100 now. I usually hate the pepto bismol color but I just had to buy this. it arrived earlier than estimated and was in great condition.</li>
            <li> Cons: seller boasts that the package will get there sooner than the amazon arrival date but mine didn&#x27;t even SHIP till the amazon arrival date&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, kanekalon so it doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as other synthetic wigs, was able to use my straitner without any problems, fits my big head, my boyfriend loves it, he said it looks so natural I could wear it without a hat, I LOVE the color very classy and tasteful shade for pink hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bangs are long but make great swooped side bangs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will post pics later today</li>
            <li> Soooo many people ask me how much this cost. They all think it was $100+</li>
            <li> This wig came more grayish pink than cotton candy pink, it actually made the girl wearing it look like an old lady.  Not flattering.  Nice cut and easy to style.  It also came shorter than the picture shows.</li>
            <li> great wig will add pictures.. the only  two down sides are the back is really thin and you need to tease and mess with the hair in the front so the netting underneath doesn&#x27;t show other than that it is nice. the hooks really helped to make it fit my head I have a really small head that is one of the reasons I chose the wig the other is because it really is heat resistance I straightened it and it looks real nice. The color is not straight pink it is pink steaks with  caramel blond type color streaks</li>
            <li> This wig makes me feel classic-gorgeous, like Marilyn Monroe. People often make comments like it&#x27;s my real hair.  I love wearing it.</li>
            <li> A little too fakey looking. I know it&#x27;s a wig and it&#x27;s pinkish, but it looks just a bit more fake than I was even expecting.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wig few months ago, i even brushed it with wig brush and it didn&#x27;t freeze. great price for a great wig, and it looks just like how it does in the picture. would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> love it it looks great i got lots of complimants on it. I wore it to a lady gaga concert</li>
