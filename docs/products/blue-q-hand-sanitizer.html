            <li>Hilarious Gag gift!</li>
            <li>Looks like it can be discrete, but also, you can bring attention to how hilarious the copy on the bottle is!</li>
            <li>I gave this to my husband as a stocking stuffer, he thought it was hilarious!  </li>
            <li>my dads been needing this for a while, he cant go more than 5 seconds without messing with his boys!</li>
            <li>This was without a doubt the most talked about stocking stuffer ever!</li>
            <li>:) merry christmas uncle tony!</li>
            <li>I guess the product is OK however opened it since it is a gift!</li>
            <li>And as a gag gift, it&#x27;s hilarious!  </li>
            <li>Nice gag gift.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not the kind of person who&#x27;s squeamish about genitals.</li>
            <li>It delivered in good time and he thought it was hilarious.  </li>
            <li>tell you hes keeping them warm, but i wont let him touch me till he washes his hands, but now he can just put on some \\&quot;maybe</li>
            <li>In all the excitement, I&#x27;ve kind of lost track myself.</li>
            <li>In any case, this is a nice pocket size bottle of hand sanitizer to carry around and get some laughs out of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a trial size item and for a trial size product, it is not cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Everyone laughed because it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li>very funny and works great</li>
            <li>Was a fun and great gift.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also fun to pull out of your purse to use at happy hour.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is suitable for all ages</li>
            <li>Everyone got a good laugh when a couple of the guys opened this gift!  </li>
            <li>She enjoys a good practical joke and this is handy (no pun intended)  to carry along and get a laugh.</li>
            <li>This product is hilarious.  </li>
            <li>I sure could use something like that in my classroom.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for better customer service.</li>
            <li>It was a good laugh.  </li>
            <li>I\\&quot;m sure it will get a lot of laughs.</li>
            <li>I ran some tests (on myself, of course), and found the results interesting.</li>
            <li>we know they&#x27;re all touching their genitals.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased even if it&#x27;s a bit over-priced for hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Many laughs from family and friends.</li>
            <li>Also, there were many LOLs when son posted pic on line.</li>
            <li>We had a really good laugh over it.</li>
            <li>This is in my friends bathroom and it always gets people laughing when they use the bathroom we love it</li>
            <li>everyone got a good laugh out of it.</li>
            <li>Although he won&#x27;t be carrying this around, he thinks it is absolutely hilarious.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hilarious.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had touched...</li>
            <li>Sure you can buy germ-x cheaper but</li>
            <li>The guy that received it had a good laugh</li>
            <li>My favorite part is how it says &amp;</li>
            <li>Husband has shown this to all of his &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34; friends. :-)</li>
            <li>Ok, so it&#x27;s a bit irreverent, but perfect for ex- or recovering Catholics (or, I guess, anyone whose religious background was a bit, well, prudish).  </li>
            <li>If he walked out of the bathroom after peeing without washing his hands one more time, I was going to cut them off.</li>
            <li>Have had so many people ask where they can get this product.  </li>
            <li>and she had a good laugh</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;First thing I did was wash my hands with soap and water and then proceeded to order this product, it was a life saver for sure..</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>

            <li>The hand sanitizer is good to keep on hand, I just thought the label was funny...</li>
            <li>Both the giver and receiver had a great laugh and it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It works functionally and is an important, if humorous, reminder about retail hygiene. :)</li>

            <li>I have no access to laboratory testing of this hand sanitizer, but I feel that my hands are clean after I used this item.  </li>

            <li>(her and most of the other people I showed loved it too</li>
            <li>I love gifts that are funny but useful ...</li>

            <li>Cute, good for a few laughs.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;ve got to ask yourself one question: do you feel lucky?</li>

            <li>nothing special, but the laughs were well worth it</li>
            <li>We both thought it was very funny but have not seen it opened.  </li>
            <li>Super funny gag gift!</li>
            <li>Super fun gag gift-</li>
            <li>stuff smells good &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.</li>
            <li>because of how many times I see her have her hand in her pants when she lays down because \\&quot;it&#x27;s warm in there\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Funny and functional!  </li>
            <li>FUNNY!</li>
            <li>If someone doesn&#x27;t think this is funny when you hand it to them, then they probably touched their genitals!</li>
            <li>OMG, this is sooooo funny!  </li>
            <li>Everyone thought it was funny!</li>
            <li>So funny!</li>
            <li>Made everybody in my office crack up when it came here first!</li>
            <li>this is a funny item...and clean to boot...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun little product that would be great for decorating your desk space at work.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for the joke value and it always makes people laugh.</li>
            <li>and I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to report it, but a co worker said the process was painless.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a date near the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>and it brought out a laugh</li>
            <li>well pay backs are fun also when I seen him playing pool pocket I handed it to him</li>
            <li>I never used it but doesn&#x27;t matter, was in it for the laugh.</li>
            <li>So I felt it not only appropriate, but also ethical, to give this as a birthday gift to one of my more mysophobic office workers...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Strangely enough, you don&#x27;t have to touch your own genitals to get the product to work.</li>
            <li>Got a laugh each time.  </li>
            <li>So worth the money for the laughs.</li>
            <li>I have this on my desk and when people see it the get a chuckle out if it its almost as much fun as tiddies</li>
            <li>This was just a silly gift I got my best friend for her birthday (obviously along with a real gift lol)</li>
            <li>Made her laugh.</li>
            <li>This gift made her smile, confirming what I already suspected were inside those thoughts</li>
            <li>Always brings a smile and/or laugh to anyone who uses it.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s overpriced for what basically amounts to a custom label &amp; backing board, but the laughs were worth it.</li>
            <li>The right size for your pocket, purse or desk.</li>
            <li>um well the title says it all right?</li>
            <li>Husband thought it was pretty funny!</li>
            <li>but this product is not only good for when you touch your own naughty parts but also after you have touched someone else&#x27;s parts!</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gag gift for a girl I was seeing, luckily she got the joke and thought it was pretty funny.</li>
            <li>We were extremely pleased with the effectiveness with which this product removed ball smell and general funk from our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really funny and worth the price</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just funny and made a fun gift.</li>
            <li>partner however experienced severe burning sensation in the mouth and throat, left eye and a possibly unrelated rash so the burning was probably</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast and it is as advertised.</li>
            <li>Even the words on the packaging was funny.</li>
            <li>Funny description that got a lot of laughs.</li>
            <li>For you to see this product and immediately assume it&#x27;s mocking people with OCD shows exactly where your mind is.  </li>
            <li>It really is hand sanitizer and label says what we are probably thinking!  </li>
            <li>She thought it was funny as hell</li>
            <li>and she thought it was funny (but not solving the problem).</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so funny.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend as a gag gift, since the saying is funny.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>But the idea is funny.</li>
            <li>I would have purchased more but the shipping made this tiny gag bottle of hand sanitizer a bit too expensive, but the laughs were priceless.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the hilarious title but for the money, the bottle was ridiculously small.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li>My son gave this gift to his friend and he thought the gift was funny</li>
            <li>He thought it was funny too.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s of practical use, it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li>and it delivered on the first day of the estimated delivery timespan</li>
            <li>funny gag gift for a nurse in the ER</li>
            <li>Hilarious white elephant Xmas gift.  </li>
            <li>As a teacher of teenage boys, there is no \\&quot;Maybe\\&quot; when it comes to touching genitals; it&#x27;s only a question of how many times in the last say 2 minutes, so I keep plenty of this product available in my classroom.</li>
            <li>He is now on board with sanitation since I put one of these in every bathroom of our home and he is able to use it freely (as long as he uses it).</li>
            <li>But some genital bacteria is powerful enough to blow your hand clean off.</li>
            <li>For Certain Touched Your Genitals: Hand Sanitizer&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It is certainly a conversation piece.</li>
            <li>Funny gag gift, decent size, not too runny.</li>
            <li>Nice little stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>Bought this for little brother because he&#x27;s starting to like girls and the family got a kick out of this for him.. Lol</li>
            <li>It is a fun item and now the friend is a little more cautious on putting things on FB because he just might get them in the mail.</li>
            <li>My bf laughed so hard when he was this, and it still is a running joke in our house.</li>
            <li>He laughed as hard as we did.</li>
            <li>Came fast.</li>
            <li>I emailed the vendor and he responded immediately, was very apologetic and sent a replacement.</li>
            <li>Very passive-aggressive way to tell others to wash their hands.</li>
            <li>And really, isn&#x27;t that what you&#x27;re paying for?</li>
            <li>Gave this to a friend who is a flight attendant and she found it halarious.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would assume haha.</li>
            <li>The recipient appreciated the humor.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t check to see if this is real hand sanitizer</li>
            <li>and everybody got a real kick out of it.</li>
            <li>He had a big laugh!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it is just like any other hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I know you totally touched your junk, so just clean your freakin&#x27; hands already.</li>
            <li>Aldo it shipped very fast even right around Christmas time last year</li>
            <li>But I really do not see the need to do so just because I want clean hands!</li>
            <li>Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 14 yr old son...cute and funny</li>
            <li>&quot; my hands are free of any loose knuckle drippin&#x27;s and I&#x27;m ready to shake hands</li>
            <li>funny - got the biggest laugh - in brother&#x27;s bathroom with Obama toilet tissue and hillbilly plunger</li>
            <li>Better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing that would have made it better would be some additional humor on the back of the package.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t want to take out of the packaging because the stuff of the back was just as funny as the bottle itself!  </li>
            <li>I love to give it to teenaged kids when they come out of the bathroom, because you know those little punks don&#x27;t wash their hands.</li>
            <li>Wish the price was a little better.  </li>
            <li>Definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this.</li>
            <li>Boy this not only gave her a laugh</li>
            <li>While product has a necessary purpose, it is also a fun gift that brings lots of laughs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just blahblahblah normal stuff.  </li>
            <li>It also made a great point with my teenage guys, to not forget to wash your hands after using the bathroom, or at least use hand sanitizer!</li>
            <li>She laughed so hard for ten minutes and then proceeded to show all of her family members the bottle.</li>
            <li>Was a big hit on Christmas for my younger brother, very funny - and functional!</li>
            <li>So funny right down to the directions on package.</li>
            <li>When I left the party, no one was aware that I had touched ANY genitals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a funny gift, and</li>
            <li>got a few of them as easy Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in gallon jugs, because I&#x27;m pretty sure that a gallon a day is not an overestimate of the amount we need.</li>
            <li>Whether it be the television remote, light switch, refrigerator handle, door knob, or our children; he has now gotten his penis germs all over that item for the next person to pick up (makes you think twice about hand washing now, doesn&#x27;t it?).</li>
            <li>What a sigh of relief for our whole family to finally have some sort of peace of mind.</li>
            <li>; - but the &amp;#34;Maybe&amp;#34; version seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li>My daughter has yet to open hers and wants to preserve it forever.</li>
            <li>However, an unanticipated negative downside was my developing a sexual fetish toward culture swabs.</li>
            <li>The product is simply a hand-sanitizer, but for the \\&quot;special\\&quot; someone it makes for an extremely reasonable gift that they will NEVER get from anyone else.</li>
            <li>It really is your standard alcohol based hand sanitizer, but the name helps you remember why you need to use it!!!</li>
            <li>This is the Essential stocking filler for him&lt;br /&gt;While it is much appreciated by her</li>
            <li>I always give my son hand sanitizer to keep with him at school, because kids are icky :)</li>
            <li>(they are all 12-13 years old).</li>
            <li>Really this is just hand sanitizer with a quirky label.</li>
            <li>Instantly neutralizes the foul odor given off by Hooker Generated Bacteria, and leaves behind the pleasant scent of Non-Hooker related bacteria...</li>
            <li>Even if you&#x27;re not a teacher I highly recommend this product to all women because, teenage boys just turn into grown men who can&#x27;t keep their hands off their peckers.</li>
            <li>Obviously a little overpriced but worth it for the laughs.</li>
            <li>you barely know where your hands have been.</li>
            <li>This brightened up Christmas considerably when it rolled out of the teenage son&#x27;s stocking.  </li>
            <li>This has caused no little embarrassment in medical settings.</li>

            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> So this fit her perfectly..</li>
            <li> Although it did say at the bottom \\&quot;Smells like innocence\\&quot; which was good for a chuckle.  </li>
            <li> He took it to school, the friends cracked up &amp; even his teachers laughed &amp; asked where he got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Hilarious Gag gift!</li>
            <li> Looks like it can be discrete, but also, you can bring attention to how hilarious the copy on the bottle is!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband as a stocking stuffer, he thought it was hilarious!  </li>
            <li> my dads been needing this for a while, he cant go more than 5 seconds without messing with his boys!</li>
            <li> This was without a doubt the most talked about stocking stuffer ever!</li>
            <li> :) merry christmas uncle tony!</li>
            <li> I guess the product is OK however opened it since it is a gift!</li>
            <li> And as a gag gift, it&#x27;s hilarious!  </li>
            <li> Nice gag gift.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not the kind of person who&#x27;s squeamish about genitals.</li>
            <li> It delivered in good time and he thought it was hilarious.  </li>
            <li> tell you hes keeping them warm, but i wont let him touch me till he washes his hands, but now he can just put on some \\&quot;maybe</li>
            <li> In all the excitement, I&#x27;ve kind of lost track myself.</li>
            <li> In any case, this is a nice pocket size bottle of hand sanitizer to carry around and get some laughs out of.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a trial size item and for a trial size product, it is not cost effective.  </li>
            <li> Everyone laughed because it&#x27;s true!  </li>
            <li> very funny and works great</li>
            <li> Was a fun and great gift.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s also fun to pull out of your purse to use at happy hour.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is suitable for all ages</li>
            <li> Everyone got a good laugh when a couple of the guys opened this gift!  </li>
            <li> She enjoys a good practical joke and this is handy (no pun intended)  to carry along and get a laugh.</li>
            <li> This product is hilarious.  </li>
            <li> I sure could use something like that in my classroom.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for better customer service.</li>
            <li> It was a good laugh.  </li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m sure it will get a lot of laughs.</li>
            <li> I ran some tests (on myself, of course), and found the results interesting.</li>
            <li> we know they&#x27;re all touching their genitals.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased even if it&#x27;s a bit over-priced for hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Many laughs from family and friends.</li>
            <li> Also, there were many LOLs when son posted pic on line.</li>
            <li> We had a really good laugh over it.</li>
            <li> This is in my friends bathroom and it always gets people laughing when they use the bathroom we love it</li>
            <li> everyone got a good laugh out of it.</li>
            <li> Although he won&#x27;t be carrying this around, he thinks it is absolutely hilarious.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hilarious.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had touched...</li>
            <li> Sure you can buy germ-x cheaper but</li>
            <li> The guy that received it had a good laugh</li>
            <li> My favorite part is how it says &amp;</li>
            <li> Husband has shown this to all of his &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34; friends. :-)</li>
            <li> Ok, so it&#x27;s a bit irreverent, but perfect for ex- or recovering Catholics (or, I guess, anyone whose religious background was a bit, well, prudish).  </li>
            <li> If he walked out of the bathroom after peeing without washing his hands one more time, I was going to cut them off.</li>
            <li> Have had so many people ask where they can get this product.  </li>
            <li> and she had a good laugh</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;First thing I did was wash my hands with soap and water and then proceeded to order this product, it was a life saver for sure..</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Saw this product &amp; thought he &amp; his friends would get a good laugh</li>
            <li> Love the looks I get when people figure out what it says.  </li>
            <li> I love getting gag gifts for my husband every christmas.</li>
            <li> Most don&#x27;t notice but that&#x27;s their loss.</li>
            <li> Worth it for a good laugh!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a great, fun way to get kids to want to clean their hands.</li>
            <li> i love this, it is a must have for every anal retentive clean freak!</li>
            <li> It was wildly funny and everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> The hand sanitizer is good to keep on hand, I just thought the label was funny...</li>
            <li> Both the giver and receiver had a great laugh and it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It works functionally and is an important, if humorous, reminder about retail hygiene. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun conversation piece for sure!</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my husband and we&#x27;re still sharing the laughs, with clean hands!</li>
            <li> :) huge hit at Christmas</li>

            <li> And its good to know that it is real sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly, and as described and pictured.  </li>
            <li> fine gag gift.  </li>

            <li> It was a huge hit when given as a gag gift to a friend.</li>
            <li> Even though this product was not actually used, it was a great gag gift.</li>
            <li> makes a perfect gift or something you just set on your desk, or carry it with you for heavy handshaking situations.</li>
            <li> It works like regular hand sanitizer, even after he touches his genitals lol</li>

            <li> Great for a white elephant gift!!</li>
            <li> Great laughs for stocking stuffer, especially with a husband who uses hand sanitizer all the time.  </li>
            <li> Given the right situation, I&#x27;ll touch more than my share.</li>
            <li> Very funny but possibly true!</li>
            <li> He was embarassed at first, but then was ok with the joke.  </li>
            <li> Fun for all!</li>
            <li> I have no access to laboratory testing of this hand sanitizer, but I feel that my hands are clean after I used this item.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the makers of this fine product I can now go anywhere without being sniffed out as a groper!</li>
            <li> (her and most of the other people I showed loved it too</li>
            <li> I love gifts that are funny but useful ...</li>
            <li> It was a huge hit at the xmas party, I will most likely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> He loved it and saved the bottle till his business started back up for the year</li>
            <li> fun and enjoy life...</li>
            <li> He loved it and hung it on the cork board in his office and still shows guys and talks about it a year later.</li>
            <li> she not only laughed about it, but used it.</li>
            <li> Good enough.</li>
            <li> not bad for a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> She loved it, and laughed so hard!</li>
            <li> Nothing like a useful laugh!</li>
            <li> Not only did my friend get a good laugh out of it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a worthy recipient yet.</li>
            <li> Cute, good for a few laughs.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;ve got to ask yourself one question: do you feel lucky?</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;ll be a huge hit and they shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> nothing special, but the laughs were well worth it</li>
            <li> We both thought it was very funny but have not seen it opened.  </li>
            <li> Super funny gag gift!</li>
            <li> Super fun gag gift-</li>
            <li> stuff smells good &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.</li>
            <li> because of how many times I see her have her hand in her pants when she lays down because \\&quot;it&#x27;s warm in there\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Funny and functional!  </li>
            <li> FUNNY!</li>
            <li> If someone doesn&#x27;t think this is funny when you hand it to them, then they probably touched their genitals!</li>
            <li> OMG, this is sooooo funny!  </li>
            <li> Everyone thought it was funny!</li>
            <li> So funny!</li>
            <li> Made everybody in my office crack up when it came here first!</li>
            <li> this is a funny item...and clean to boot...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun little product that would be great for decorating your desk space at work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for the joke value and it always makes people laugh.</li>
            <li> and I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to report it, but a co worker said the process was painless.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a date near the top of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> and it brought out a laugh</li>
            <li> well pay backs are fun also when I seen him playing pool pocket I handed it to him</li>
            <li> I never used it but doesn&#x27;t matter, was in it for the laugh.</li>
            <li> So I felt it not only appropriate, but also ethical, to give this as a birthday gift to one of my more mysophobic office workers...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Strangely enough, you don&#x27;t have to touch your own genitals to get the product to work.</li>
            <li> Got a laugh each time.  </li>
            <li> So worth the money for the laughs.</li>
            <li> I have this on my desk and when people see it the get a chuckle out if it its almost as much fun as tiddies</li>
            <li> This was just a silly gift I got my best friend for her birthday (obviously along with a real gift lol)</li>
            <li> Made her laugh.</li>
            <li> This gift made her smile, confirming what I already suspected were inside those thoughts</li>
            <li> Always brings a smile and/or laugh to anyone who uses it.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s overpriced for what basically amounts to a custom label &amp; backing board, but the laughs were worth it.</li>
            <li> The right size for your pocket, purse or desk.</li>
            <li> um well the title says it all right?</li>
            <li> Husband thought it was pretty funny!</li>
            <li> but this product is not only good for when you touch your own naughty parts but also after you have touched someone else&#x27;s parts!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gag gift for a girl I was seeing, luckily she got the joke and thought it was pretty funny.</li>
            <li> We were extremely pleased with the effectiveness with which this product removed ball smell and general funk from our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really funny and worth the price</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just funny and made a fun gift.</li>
            <li> partner however experienced severe burning sensation in the mouth and throat, left eye and a possibly unrelated rash so the burning was probably</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast and it is as advertised.</li>
            <li> Even the words on the packaging was funny.</li>
            <li> Funny description that got a lot of laughs.</li>
            <li> For you to see this product and immediately assume it&#x27;s mocking people with OCD shows exactly where your mind is.  </li>
            <li> It really is hand sanitizer and label says what we are probably thinking!  </li>
            <li> She thought it was funny as hell</li>
            <li> and she thought it was funny (but not solving the problem).</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so funny.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gag gift, since the saying is funny.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> But the idea is funny.</li>
            <li> I would have purchased more but the shipping made this tiny gag bottle of hand sanitizer a bit too expensive, but the laughs were priceless.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the hilarious title but for the money, the bottle was ridiculously small.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what it looks like.</li>
            <li> My son gave this gift to his friend and he thought the gift was funny</li>
            <li> He thought it was funny too.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s of practical use, it&#x27;s funny</li>
            <li> and it delivered on the first day of the estimated delivery timespan</li>
            <li> funny gag gift for a nurse in the ER</li>
            <li> Hilarious white elephant Xmas gift.  </li>
            <li> As a teacher of teenage boys, there is no \\&quot;Maybe\\&quot; when it comes to touching genitals; it&#x27;s only a question of how many times in the last say 2 minutes, so I keep plenty of this product available in my classroom.</li>
            <li> He is now on board with sanitation since I put one of these in every bathroom of our home and he is able to use it freely (as long as he uses it).</li>
            <li> But some genital bacteria is powerful enough to blow your hand clean off.</li>
            <li> For Certain Touched Your Genitals: Hand Sanitizer&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It is certainly a conversation piece.</li>
            <li> Funny gag gift, decent size, not too runny.</li>
            <li> Nice little stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for little brother because he&#x27;s starting to like girls and the family got a kick out of this for him.. Lol</li>
            <li> It is a fun item and now the friend is a little more cautious on putting things on FB because he just might get them in the mail.</li>
            <li> My bf laughed so hard when he was this, and it still is a running joke in our house.</li>
            <li> He laughed as hard as we did.</li>
            <li> Came fast.</li>
            <li> I emailed the vendor and he responded immediately, was very apologetic and sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> Very passive-aggressive way to tell others to wash their hands.</li>
            <li> And really, isn&#x27;t that what you&#x27;re paying for?</li>
            <li> Gave this to a friend who is a flight attendant and she found it halarious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would assume haha.</li>
            <li> The recipient appreciated the humor.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t check to see if this is real hand sanitizer</li>
            <li> and everybody got a real kick out of it.</li>
            <li> He had a big laugh!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it is just like any other hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I know you totally touched your junk, so just clean your freakin&#x27; hands already.</li>
            <li> Aldo it shipped very fast even right around Christmas time last year</li>
            <li> But I really do not see the need to do so just because I want clean hands!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 14 yr old son...cute and funny</li>
            <li> &quot; my hands are free of any loose knuckle drippin&#x27;s and I&#x27;m ready to shake hands</li>
            <li> funny - got the biggest laugh - in brother&#x27;s bathroom with Obama toilet tissue and hillbilly plunger</li>
            <li> Better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing that would have made it better would be some additional humor on the back of the package.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to take out of the packaging because the stuff of the back was just as funny as the bottle itself!  </li>
            <li> I love to give it to teenaged kids when they come out of the bathroom, because you know those little punks don&#x27;t wash their hands.</li>
            <li> Wish the price was a little better.  </li>
            <li> Definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this.</li>
            <li> Boy this not only gave her a laugh</li>
            <li> While product has a necessary purpose, it is also a fun gift that brings lots of laughs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just blahblahblah normal stuff.  </li>
            <li> It also made a great point with my teenage guys, to not forget to wash your hands after using the bathroom, or at least use hand sanitizer!</li>
            <li> She laughed so hard for ten minutes and then proceeded to show all of her family members the bottle.</li>
            <li> Was a big hit on Christmas for my younger brother, very funny - and functional!</li>
            <li> So funny right down to the directions on package.</li>
            <li> When I left the party, no one was aware that I had touched ANY genitals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a funny gift, and</li>
            <li> got a few of them as easy Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in gallon jugs, because I&#x27;m pretty sure that a gallon a day is not an overestimate of the amount we need.</li>
            <li> Whether it be the television remote, light switch, refrigerator handle, door knob, or our children; he has now gotten his penis germs all over that item for the next person to pick up (makes you think twice about hand washing now, doesn&#x27;t it?).</li>
            <li> What a sigh of relief for our whole family to finally have some sort of peace of mind.</li>
            <li> ; - but the &amp;#34;Maybe&amp;#34; version seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> My daughter has yet to open hers and wants to preserve it forever.</li>
            <li> However, an unanticipated negative downside was my developing a sexual fetish toward culture swabs.</li>
            <li> The product is simply a hand-sanitizer, but for the \\&quot;special\\&quot; someone it makes for an extremely reasonable gift that they will NEVER get from anyone else.</li>
            <li> It really is your standard alcohol based hand sanitizer, but the name helps you remember why you need to use it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the Essential stocking filler for him&lt;br /&gt;While it is much appreciated by her</li>
            <li> I always give my son hand sanitizer to keep with him at school, because kids are icky :)</li>
            <li> (they are all 12-13 years old).</li>
            <li> Really this is just hand sanitizer with a quirky label.</li>
            <li> Instantly neutralizes the foul odor given off by Hooker Generated Bacteria, and leaves behind the pleasant scent of Non-Hooker related bacteria...</li>
            <li> Even if you&#x27;re not a teacher I highly recommend this product to all women because, teenage boys just turn into grown men who can&#x27;t keep their hands off their peckers.</li>
            <li> Obviously a little overpriced but worth it for the laughs.</li>
            <li> you barely know where your hands have been.</li>
            <li> This brightened up Christmas considerably when it rolled out of the teenage son&#x27;s stocking.  </li>
            <li> This has caused no little embarrassment in medical settings.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item if you need a few laughs.  </li>
            <li> Everyone thought it was so funny, we were all laughing so hard.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it really does as it was never even opened.</li>
            <li> As expected, it got big laughs from all those around!</li>
            <li> I wrapped it so nice that I thought he may be disappointed when he actually saw what was in the box</li>
            <li> but it seems similar to other hand sanitizers in that regard.</li>
            <li> I was sick of chasing him around the house with lysol and can&#x27;t always be home to make sure that he is sanitized before putting his penis germs on our kids when tucking them in or making them a meal (gross).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no special formula in this bottle, it&#x27;s just regular hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Everything is what I expected to be.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know where other peoples hands have been.</li>
            <li> , I waited for 72 hours, not touching my genitals the entire time, and the product STILL DISPENSED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what other products they come out with for this years Christmas Gags.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just as well as any other hand sanitizer, with the added bonus of humor.  </li>
            <li> Was taking a dump the other day and thought \\&quot;maybe had touched myself (and</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t always \\&quot;remember\\&quot; to wash their hands after coming in contact with other people.</li>
            <li> and she nearly &amp;#34;had an accident&amp;#34; due to laughing so hard!</li>
            <li> After making a mess in the men&#x27;s room, this stuff always does the trick.</li>
            <li> Gave this to a few co-worker&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It got a few laughs which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Also, the title made the friends ask to use it, so now there are a half-dozen less icky kids at school.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any time things get &#x27;funky&#x27;, i just rub little on the genitals and WHAM!</li>
            <li> But seriously, come down on the price.</li>
            <li> was truly hard to tell.</li>
            <li> My daughter took a picture of it and put it on Facebook and called me to say she got a huge response from people hysterical saying her mom &amp;#34;rocks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> No more fish smell!</li>
            <li> I work where there are lots and lots of hard working, and hard scratching, gentlemen and I am one of them!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I gave this to my sister who has a hand-washing-fetish.</li>
            <li> #34;don&#x27;t take life to seriously because</li>
            <li> Instead, I was disappointed when I discovered how small the product was and how much I actually paid for it.  </li>
            <li> This little bottle was a hit at the Christmas Dirty Santa party.  </li>
            <li> Or maybe worse..</li>
            <li> Even my husband who is a very serious man was laughing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of wasting money on useless stuff.</li>
            <li> We gave these as stocking stuffers and just as random gifts to friends.  </li>
            <li> Got this as a random gift for an acquaintance.</li>
            <li> It could have been an awkward moment if it weren&#x27;t for &amp;#34;Maybe</li>
            <li> , maybe you didn&#x27;t... sanitize yourself, you dirty b*stard!&lt;br</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, was very very expensive for a bottle of hand santizer.  </li>
            <li> Stupid gag gift that did the trick of continuously providing laughs for the person I gave it to.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this as a gag gift for a girl I was seeing, luckily she got the joke and thought it was pretty funny. Probably want to have a good bead on someone&#x27;s sense of humor before presenting this to them though.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best gag gifts I&#x27;ve run across. Not only did my friend get a good laugh out of itâ€™s (her and most of the other people I showed loved it too) buts itâ€™s also a functional gift. That&#x27;s the best part since itâ€™s actually a useful item to have.</li>
            <li> Great Bachelorette Party gift. It was a hit!</li>
            <li> Totally bought it as a gag gift. I haven&#x27;t found a worthy recipient yet. Can&#x27;t wait to meet my next OCD friend!</li>
            <li> Hilarious gift! The product is great and it&#x27;s a genius gift !</li>
            <li> Came fast. Nice gag gift. Even the words on the packaging was funny. My friend loved it</li>
            <li> Gag gift. Funny description that got a lot of laughs.</li>
            <li> very funny and works great</li>
            <li> I use hand sanitizer regularly and I don&#x27;t have OCD.  For you to see this product and immediately assume it&#x27;s mocking people with OCD shows exactly where your mind is.  It&#x27;s hand sanitizer.     This product is hilarious.  Get over yourself with your wounded attitude.  It&#x27;s not always about you.</li>
            <li> Funny and functional!  It really is hand sanitizer and label says what we are probably thinking!  LMAO!</li>
            <li> the name says it all...</li>
            <li> If you are like me, and suffer &amp;#34;StinkD***&amp;#34;, and you find yourself ostracized from your friends and family because your hands smell like the $100 hooker you had in your hotel room last night, this product is a MUST. Instantly neutralizes the foul odor given off by Hooker Generated Bacteria, and leaves behind the pleasant scent of Non-Hooker related bacteria... Seriously, I gave this to my sister who has a hand-washing-fetish. She thought it was funny as hell</li>
            <li> As a teacher of teenage boys, there is no \\&quot;Maybe\\&quot; when it comes to touching genitals; it&#x27;s only a question of how many times in the last say 2 minutes, so I keep plenty of this product available in my classroom. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in gallon jugs, because I&#x27;m pretty sure that a gallon a day is not an overestimate of the amount we need. I think the makers of this product could also do well to offer a \\&quot;balls away\\&quot; air freshener. I sure could use something like that in my classroom. Even if you&#x27;re not a teacher I highly recommend this product to all women because, teenage boys just turn into grown men who can&#x27;t keep their hands off their peckers.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a birthday gift for a treat bag for my sister.  She enjoys a good practical joke and this is handy (no pun intended)  to carry along and get a laugh.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it listed anywhere in the product description but this product is not only good for when you touch your own naughty parts but also after you have touched someone else&#x27;s parts! It&#x27;s like a two-in one thing. Um 5 in one. 3...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for the joke value and it always makes people laugh. It also is a really good hand sanitizer and the package size is perfect. My initial order was lost in the mail and I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to report it, but a co worker said the process was painless. I emailed the vendor and he responded immediately, was very apologetic and sent a replacement. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better customer service.</li>
            <li> I put this in my brother&#x27;s stocking.  It was a good laugh.  We both work in places that require us to use a lot of hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> My wife has a problem at work. She has co-workers who don&#x27;t wash their hands after they use the rest room. So she was the lucky recipient of this gem and of the hilarious book [[ASIN:0452297664 How to Poo at Work]]. I gave this as a gag gift and she thought it was funny (but not solving the problem). I told her that it will be a great conversation starter... :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gag gift for my brother for Christmas. I thought it would be bigger, but that&#x27;s my fault for not noticing the size. The shipping was very fast and it is as advertised. Looking forward to his reaction when he opens it!</li>
            <li> Generates lots of laughs.</li>
            <li> Very passive-aggressive way to tell others to wash their hands. I love it!</li>
            <li> Hilarious gag gift! Husband thought it was pretty funny! This will be passed around from person to person for awhile!</li>
            <li> I have no access to laboratory testing of this hand sanitizer, but I feel that my hands are clean after I used this item.  The bottle has a date near the top of the bottle.  I&#x27;m thinking its the duration of its potency.  I can still refill the bottle with another hand sanitizer, using the bottle as a comedy relief before dinner or any hand sanitizing occasion.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my brother, lol</li>
            <li> I brought this in to work and gave it to the guys as a joke. Did the job. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gag gift for my husbands stocking. Product was delivered in a timely manner and was perfect for what I needed it for</li>
            <li> We were extremely pleased with the effectiveness with which this product removed ball smell and general funk from our hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner however experienced severe burning sensation in the mouth and throat, left eye and a possibly unrelated rash so the burning was probably karma related.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would still advise anyone using this product to only use on you hands!</li>
            <li> As expected, it got big laughs from all those around!</li>
            <li> This got a ton of laughs at Christmas when it was part of a white elephant package. Obviously a little overpriced but worth it for the laughs.</li>
            <li> What a sigh of relief for our whole family to finally have some sort of peace of mind. This was a gift to my brother who has needed a product like this for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normal hand sanitizer just didn&#x27;t do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this product a 5-star rating if they sold &amp;#34;You For Certain Touched Your Genitals: Hand Sanitizer&amp;#34; - but the &amp;#34;Maybe&amp;#34; version seems to be working so far.</li>
            <li> We never took it out of the packaging- it was a novelty stocking stuffer for my husband. It was a good chuckle, but I can&#x27;t speak to the quality of the contents or anything.</li>
            <li> Bought this to give as stocking stuffers.  Everybody absolutely loved them.  They are great!  My daughter has yet to open hers and wants to preserve it forever.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my germophobe best friend for Christmas along with another gift. She laughed so hard for ten minutes and then proceeded to show all of her family members the bottle. It is certainly a conversation piece. The price is nice too, so your wallet isn&#x27;t hurting just to get a laugh out of someone. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Big hit, put it in my sons Christmas stocking</li>
            <li> Even though this product was not actually used, it was a great gag gift. Both the giver and receiver had a great laugh and it was definitely worth the price. There&#x27;s no special formula in this bottle, it&#x27;s just regular hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son.  It arrived faster than I thought.  Everything is what I expected to be.  I can&#x27;t wait to give it to my son.</li>
            <li> I love gifts that are funny but useful ... I&#x27;m not a fan of wasting money on useless stuff. This is perfect - laugh every time you sanitize your hands !</li>
            <li> Used as a gag gift. FUNNY!</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gag gift for a 50th birthday.  We both thought it was very funny but have not seen it opened.  I\\&quot;m sure it will get a lot of laughs.</li>
            <li> Got some of this as a gag gift from a friend. Cute, good for a few laughs. But being of an inquisitive nature, I began to wonder about the relative amounts and types of bacteria found on both hands and genitals. I ran some tests (on myself, of course), and found the results interesting. However, an unanticipated negative downside was my developing a sexual fetish toward culture swabs. This has caused no little embarrassment in medical settings. In fact, just last week I was in to see my PCP for a routine check-up, and he told me that I would have to stop masturbatingâ€¦.</li>
            <li> Front:  Maybe You Touched Your Genitals Back: The #1 After-Genital-Contact Hand Sanitizer  It&#x27;s a fun little product that would be great for decorating your desk space at work. It looks just like the photo.  It would be functional too if you know someone who doesn&#x27;t wash their hands after using the restroom.  (fact:  50% of people at work, yep, 1 out 2 people do not wash their hands or does not use soap and just plays pretend with the faucet)</li>
            <li> My brother joking said he wanted some of this for Christmas - so I gave it to him. Everyone thought it was so funny, we were all laughing so hard. The funniest part is he put it in his guest bathroom!</li>
            <li> This got a ton of laughs at our white elephant party. Plus they can actually use it! Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gag gift. Got a lot of laughs out of it.</li>
            <li> purchased for a deployed friend. we know they&#x27;re all touching their genitals. it&#x27;s all good and it brought out a laugh so I&#x27;m pleased even if it&#x27;s a bit over-priced for hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Put this in my sisters Christmas stocking and she nearly &amp;#34;had an accident&amp;#34; due to laughing so hard! Loved it!</li>
            <li> Great response to this gift! Many laughs from family and friends. Also, there were many LOLs when son posted pic on line.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a quirky friend of mine who screamed with delight and laughter when she opened it.  It was a huge hit at the xmas party, I will most likely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i love this, it is a must have for every anal retentive clean freak! makes a perfect gift or something you just set on your desk, or carry it with you for heavy handshaking situations. you don&#x27;t know where other peoples hands have been. you barely know where your hands have been.</li>
            <li> I got this for my bf and he loved it. We had a really good laugh over it. Prompt delivery! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I touched my genitals, and the product dispensed as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I waited for 72 hours, not touching my genitals the entire time, and the product STILL DISPENSED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called Amazon, I was reminded that the product was named &amp;#34;MAYBE You touched your genitals&amp;#34;, not &amp;#34;You DEFINITELY Touched Your Genitals&amp;#34;, and while I understand this line of thought, I am still convinced this was a misleading product name.</li>
            <li> I know you totally touched your junk, so just clean your freakin&#x27; hands already.</li>
            <li> This is in my friends bathroom and it always gets people laughing when they use the bathroom we love it and so do they</li>
            <li> This is a great gift!  It&#x27;s so funny. If someone doesn&#x27;t think this is funny when you hand it to them, then they probably touched their genitals!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend as he always playing jokes on me well pay backs are fun also when I seen him playing pool pocket I handed it to him everyone got a good laugh out of it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a stocking stuffer or funny birthday gift. My bf laughed so hard when he was this, and it still is a running joke in our house.</li>
            <li> Was a fun and great gift. I never used it but doesn&#x27;t matter, was in it for the laugh. So inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gag gift, since the saying is funny.  It works like regular hand sanitizer, even after he touches his genitals lol</li>
            <li> The manufacturer put a lot of effort into this product. It was wildly funny and everyone loved it. Can&#x27;t wait to see what other products they come out with for this years Christmas Gags.</li>
            <li> Every guy needs this!</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  Kills genital juice and/or germs</li>
            <li> Everyone got a good laugh when a couple of the guys opened this gift!  It also made a great point with my teenage guys, to not forget to wash your hands after using the bathroom, or at least use hand sanitizer!</li>
            <li> Hilarious Gag gift! I should have bought more of them because everyone thought it was great :) huge hit at Christmas</li>
            <li> Maybe they were mine, maybe they were someone else&#x27;s, in a room as crowded as the one I was in it was truly hard to tell. But this sanitizer did the trick! When I left the party, no one was aware that I had touched ANY genitals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which was especially helpful at church when we shake hands and say &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34;... It could have been an awkward moment if it weren&#x27;t for &amp;#34;Maybe You Touched Your Genitals Hand Sanitizer&amp;#34;! Thanks to the makers of this fine product I can now go anywhere without being sniffed out as a groper! ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all in the labeling.  The product is simply a hand-sanitizer, but for the \\&quot;special\\&quot; someone it makes for an extremely reasonable gift that they will NEVER get from anyone else.</li>
            <li> Got this as a stocking stuffer for my man. He&#x27;s a germ o phobe so I thought it would suit well. He loved it and saved the bottle till his business started back up for the year so he could make his employees use it. Lol</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great. But the idea is funny. However, I dropped it once and the bottle cracked. Bummer. Makes for a good gag gift.</li>
            <li> This was part of a gag gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday. Although he won&#x27;t be carrying this around, he thinks it is absolutely hilarious. Worth it for a good laugh!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son, and he laughed and enjoyed it, then re-gifted it to his cousin, who loved it also.  His cousin then re-gifted it to his girl friend, and she loved it, and so......on and on.  Definitely get your money&#x27;s worth out of this.</li>
            <li> I work where there are lots and lots of hard working, and hard scratching, gentlemen and I am one of them! So I felt it not only appropriate, but also ethical, to give this as a birthday gift to one of my more mysophobic office workers... Boy this not only gave her a laugh, the amusement keeps coming when she hands it to the guys that come into her office to work on paperwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give 6 stars I would!</li>
            <li> After making a mess in the men&#x27;s room, this stuff always does the trick. The rotten fish smell that follows me around is no longer an issue. Any time things get &#x27;funky&#x27;, i just rub little on the genitals and WHAM! No more fish smell!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know what to think about this product. This hand-sanitizer appears to be self-aware. It refuses to dispense itself to me unless I touch my genitals before hand. It just will not come out of the container unless I touch them. Now, mind you, I&#x27;m not the kind of person who&#x27;s squeamish about genitals. Given the right situation, I&#x27;ll touch more than my share. But I really do not see the need to do so just because I want clean hands! I have free will and I choose not to handle my tallywacker before cleaning my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely enough, you don&#x27;t have to touch your own genitals to get the product to work.</li>
            <li> Being one with a reputation for always handling my nardle dangles, (I&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t go 20 minutes without a trip to genitalia) nobody ever wanted to shake my hand. That was before I tried \\&quot;Maybe You Touched Your Genitals\\&quot; hand sanitizer! Now every time I done \\&quot;squeezing a wad out\\&quot; I squeeze out a wad of \\&quot;Maybe You Touched Your Genitals\\&quot;, and quicker than you can say \\&quot;spank the monkey\\&quot; my hands are free of any loose knuckle drippin&#x27;s and I&#x27;m ready to shake hands again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because of it doesn&#x27;t come in larger sizes, I can go through one of these bottles in an hour. So, if you never know when you&#x27;ll be whipping up a batch by hand, always keep some \\&quot;Maybe You Touched Your Genitals\\&quot; with you.</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s hilarious. got a few of them as easy Christmas gifts. I think they&#x27;ll be a huge hit and they shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gag gift and it worked!  A must for your next White Elephant party.  Lots of laughs.</li>
            <li> Was a big hit on Christmas for my younger brother, very funny - and functional! Looks like it can be discrete, but also, you can bring attention to how hilarious the copy on the bottle is!</li>
            <li> I gave my three grown children this item as a stocking stuffer.  They all laughed and showed it to their friends who also laughed.  My daughter took a picture of it and put it on Facebook and called me to say she got a huge response from people hysterical saying her mom &amp;#34;rocks&amp;#34;.  Even my husband who is a very serious man was laughing...especially at the picture on the bottle with the woman shaking the man&#x27;s hand.  Great gift if you want a lot of laughs!</li>
            <li> I have a girlfriend who works in a hospital.  She has a great sense of humor and this did not fail to make her laugh.  HOWEVER, was very very expensive for a bottle of hand santizer.  Plus shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for little brother because he&#x27;s starting to like girls and the family got a kick out of this for him.. Lol</li>
            <li> have had a blast seeing the look on friends faces when they read it. thank you for such a great product.</li>
            <li> This brightened up Christmas considerably when it rolled out of the teenage son&#x27;s stocking.  He laughed as hard as we did.</li>
            <li> We gave these as stocking stuffers and just as random gifts to friends.  Got a laugh each time.  They&#x27;re just so wrong and totally hilarious.</li>
            <li> It was a Great white elephant for the family that has everything.&lt;br /&gt;A fine gag gift.  THank you for the order.</li>
            <li> An awesome gift for someone who is a germafobe.  The right size for your pocket, purse or desk. Love it.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband as a stocking stuffer, he thought it was hilarious!  He instantly started sending pictures of it to some work friends.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine sent a picture of this product and as a joke I happen to find it on Amazon and sent it to him.  It was funny...and his wife wanted to know if there was a problem.  It is a fun item and now the friend is a little more cautious on putting things on FB because he just might get them in the mail. &lt;G&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have fun and enjoy life...this is a funny item...and clean to boot...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I had touched... um... them, but since it was possible, I thought I should get this product, because... well... what if I touched my genitals? I could give myself some kinda disease, or something. I don&#x27;t want to make Jebus sad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe you touched them, maybe you didn&#x27;t... sanitize yourself, you dirty b*stard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or get some gloves!</li>
            <li> Funny gag gift, decent size, not too runny. Sure you can buy germ-x cheaper but germ-x doesn&#x27;t say genitals. And really, isn&#x27;t that what you&#x27;re paying for?</li>
            <li> Took this with me to the Pearly Gates after the Mayan Calendar Apocalypse.&lt;br /&gt;Saint Peter was very happy for this gift with so many people coming through.</li>
            <li> While product has a necessary purpose, it is also a fun gift that brings lots of laughs. I purchased it for my husband and we&#x27;re still sharing the laughs, with clean hands!</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a white elephant gift for a Christmas party.  It was a hoot!  It really is your standard alcohol based hand sanitizer, but the name helps you remember why you need to use it!!!</li>
            <li> I pirchased this for my teenage son as a stocking stuffer.  He was embarassed at first, but then was ok with the joke.  He has shown it to some of his guy friends and they all loved the joke!</li>
            <li> This little bottle was a hit at the Christmas Dirty Santa party.  I would have purchased more but the shipping made this tiny gag bottle of hand sanitizer a bit too expensive, but the laughs were priceless.</li>
            <li> I ordered it as a gag gift for my boyfriend.  It delivered in good time and he thought it was hilarious.  The hand sanitizer is good to keep on hand, I just thought the label was funny...not bad for a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to take out of the packaging because the stuff of the back was just as funny as the bottle itself!  The slogan &amp;#34;Smells like Innocence&amp;#34; is priceless!</li>
            <li> You never know - be prepared.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic gag gift.  The guy that received it had a good laugh and it&#x27;s also fun to pull out of your purse to use at happy hour.  Tons of laughs every time.</li>
            <li> Super fun gag gift- the sanitizer is your every day run of the mill alcohol- nothing special, but the laughs were well worth it</li>
            <li> Gave this to a friend who is a flight attendant and she found it halarious.&lt;br /&gt;As a very wise person once said &amp;#34;don&#x27;t take life to seriously because none&lt;br /&gt;of us are getting out of it alive&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> This was the perfect Christmas gift for the germ-a-phobe friend.  I wrapped it so nice that I thought he may be disappointed when he actually saw what was in the box but no, he laughed and thought it was awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gag gift for a friend.  Enjoyed the hilarious title but for the money, the bottle was ridiculously small. Would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> We had a blast with this.  I highly recommend this item if you need a few laughs.  I think there are a whold line of these products.</li>
            <li> really funny and worth the price</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for one of the guys at work because of an ongoing joke that i think they all have peepee fingers. He loved it and hung it on the cork board in his office and still shows guys and talks about it a year later. So worth the money for the laughs. My favorite part is how it says &amp;#34;SMELLS LIKE INNOCENCE&amp;#34; on the back, but I&#x27;m not sure if it really does as it was never even opened.</li>
            <li> Embarrassing to comment on this one but it was a joke for my Husbands Birthday, went over well and he tells me that the hand sanitizer works very great, smells good and he&#x27;s &amp;#34;shiny clean&amp;#34; lol!  With everything in great working order and awesome fast service from the seller (as well as my Husband) hey work rather well! ;)  I was very happy with this purchase (and &amp;#34;again&amp;#34; after 25 years happy with Hubby too)! :)</li>
            <li> funny - got the biggest laugh - in brother&#x27;s bathroom with Obama toilet tissue and hillbilly plunger</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a germophobe friend. she not only laughed about it, but used it. Nothing like a useful laugh!</li>
            <li> my dads been needing this for a while, he cant go more than 5 seconds without messing with his boys! of course if you ask him what hes doing hell tell you hes keeping them warm, but i wont let him touch me till he washes his hands, but now he can just put on some \\&quot;maybe you touched your genitals hand sanitizer\\&quot; and all will be well! this product is genius!</li>
            <li> Gave this to a few co-worker&#x27;s. .....who are total purrell freaks......great for laughs!</li>
            <li> I have this on my desk and when people see it the get a chuckle out if it its almost as much fun as tiddies</li>
            <li> This was without a doubt the most talked about stocking stuffer ever! Loved it. Husband has shown this to all of his &amp;#34;guy&amp;#34; friends. :-)</li>
            <li> Ok, so it&#x27;s a bit irreverent, but perfect for ex- or recovering Catholics (or, I guess, anyone whose religious background was a bit, well, prudish).  Got lots of laughs as a stocking stuffer  Great paired with &amp;#34;Wash Away Your Sins&amp;#34; soap!  Gotta have a sense of humor, folks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. If he walked out of the bathroom after peeing without washing his hands one more time, I was going to cut them off. Working in the medical field, I know the importance of hand washing. So every time he would walk out without washing his hands, a person has to touch something. Whether it be the television remote, light switch, refrigerator handle, door knob, or our children; he has now gotten his penis germs all over that item for the next person to pick up (makes you think twice about hand washing now, doesn&#x27;t it?). I was sick of chasing him around the house with lysol and can&#x27;t always be home to make sure that he is sanitized before putting his penis germs on our kids when tucking them in or making them a meal (gross). He is now on board with sanitation since I put one of these in every bathroom of our home and he is able to use it freely (as long as he uses it).</li>
            <li> Great Gag Gift for germaphobe!</li>
            <li> OMG, this is sooooo funny!  I put it in my husband&#x27;s stocking one year.</li>
            <li> Definitely cracks me up every time I use this sanitizer!</li>
            <li> Great white elephant gift at my family&#x27;s Christmas party! Was a hit and cause everyone to uncomfortably laugh LOL!</li>
            <li> Had to put this in my grandsons Christmas stocking-since he is a nut about germs!  Everyone thought it was funny!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 14 yr old son...cute and funny and maybe he&#x27;ll use it now</li>
            <li> Got this as a random gift for an acquaintance. It is exactly what it looks like. It got a few laughs which is what I bought it for. I cannot attest to the sanitizing properties of the product but it seems similar to other hand sanitizers in that regard.</li>
            <li> omg, i got this as a stocking stuffer for my bestie! he is gonna die!  :) merry christmas uncle tony!</li>
            <li> Have had so many people ask where they can get this product.  It was a huge hit when given as a gag gift to a friend.</li>
            <li> This was just a silly gift I got my best friend for her birthday (obviously along with a real gift lol) because of how many times I see her have her hand in her pants when she lays down because \\&quot;it&#x27;s warm in there\\&quot;. So this fit her perfectly.. and she had a good laugh :) Oh yeah... and the hani sani works too I would assume haha.</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my hubby.  He had a big laugh!  It&#x27;s a fun conversation piece for sure!</li>
            <li> We bought this item as a gag gift for a friend. She loved it, and laughed so hard! Fun for all!</li>
            <li> I know what you&#x27;re thinking: Did he or didn&#x27;t he? In all the excitement, I&#x27;ve kind of lost track myself. But some genital bacteria is powerful enough to blow your hand clean off. So you&#x27;ve got to ask yourself one question: do you feel lucky? Well do ya, punk? Go ahead, make my day.</li>
            <li> Or maybe someone else did.  Seems to work just as well as any other hand sanitizer, with the added bonus of humor.  Gave this as part of a bachelorette gift and it got one of the biggest laughs.  Not to mention, hey, you never know if that guy in the business meeting just touched his junk.  Better safe than sorry.</li>
            <li> Was taking a dump the other day and thought \\&quot;maybe had touched myself (and perhaps my genitals)\\&quot; when cleaning up..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I did was wash my hands with soap and water and then proceeded to order this product, it was a life saver for sure..</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic gag gift.  Shipped very quickly, and as described and pictured.  Cannot WAIT to give this to my sister in law for Christmas.  The ONLY thing that would have made it better would be some additional humor on the back of the package.  It&#x27;s just blahblahblah normal stuff.  Although it did say at the bottom \\&quot;Smells like innocence\\&quot; which was good for a chuckle.  In any case, this is a nice pocket size bottle of hand sanitizer to carry around and get some laughs out of.  \\&quot;Maybe you Touched Your Genitals Hand Sanitizer\\&quot; could possibly be my best purchase of 2012.</li>
            <li> Super funny gag gift! Everyone laughed because it&#x27;s true!  Have it to my some for his 18th birthday!  It was great!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gag joke to put in the downstairs bathroom for when company comes over or we are having a party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big hit.  Lots of laughs.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> My son gave this gift to his friend and he thought the gift was funny and that is the only reason I gave 5 stars</li>
            <li> This product delivered the intended responses. Gratitude was not necessarily among them.</li>
            <li> Great for a white elephant gift!! I guess the product is OK however opened it since it is a gift!</li>
            <li> Good enough. Does the trick while I wait for them to get my &amp;#34;definitely you touched your genitals hand sanitizer&amp;#34; back in stock. This one isn&#x27;t quite as fool proof but it will have to do.</li>
            <li> The hit of stocking stuffers this year. So funny right down to the directions on package. Perfect gag gift for anyone who needs a laugh.</li>
            <li> As a gag gift- this is a 5-star item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the price- it only deserves a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a trial size item and for a trial size product, it is not cost effective.  For instance, if they sold this trial size product for $2.99, I&#x27;d probably buy a truckload of this for gags.  Instead, I was disappointed when I discovered how small the product was and how much I actually paid for it.  For example, a 56 oz refill of Germ-X runs $5.97.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I doubt anyone is using this as their standard hand sanitizer. It&#x27;s meant to be a gag gift.  And as a gag gift, it&#x27;s hilarious!  But seriously, come down on the price.</li>
            <li> This is the Essential stocking filler for him&lt;br /&gt;While it is much appreciated by her&lt;br /&gt;This is suitable for all ages</li>
            <li> So funny! I love to give it to teenaged kids when they come out of the bathroom, because you know those little punks don&#x27;t wash their hands.</li>
            <li> Very funny stocking stuffer and very funny add on gift for any one with a good sense of humor. Aldo it shipped very fast even right around Christmas time last year</li>
            <li> Gag gift for a friend. Made her laugh.</li>
            <li> Great Gag Gift for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I always give my son hand sanitizer to keep with him at school, because kids are icky :) Saw this product &amp; thought he &amp; his friends would get a good laugh (they are all 12-13 years old). He took it to school, the friends cracked up &amp; even his teachers laughed &amp; asked where he got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells good &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands. Also, the title made the friends ask to use it, so now there are a half-dozen less icky kids at school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are in flu season now &amp; kids don&#x27;t always \\&quot;remember\\&quot; to wash their hands after coming in contact with other people. This stuff is a great, fun way to get kids to want to clean their hands.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Again, gifts like these have value-in the novelty. The recipient appreciated the humor. Really this is just hand sanitizer with a quirky label.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t check to see if this is real hand sanitizer, it&#x27;s just funny and made a fun gift.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many laughs and smiles over these given as gifts!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely a good gag gift / stocking stuffer.  Wish the price was a little better.  Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet, but I&#x27;m sure it is just like any other hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Great laughs for stocking stuffer, especially with a husband who uses hand sanitizer all the time.  Made everybody in my office crack up when it came here first!</li>
            <li> Love the looks I get when people figure out what it says.  Makes my day.</li>
            <li> We got looks of laughs over this product.  I gave it to my husband for Christmas as a gag gift.  He thought it was funny too.</li>
            <li> Got these for my friends in healthcare. Such a funny gift, and they thought so too. Would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a joke gift for my daughter who works in retail. It works functionally and is an important, if humorous, reminder about retail hygiene. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gag gift for a friend of mine who is a nurse. As a borderline germophobe I always ask her, how can you touch that? This gift made her smile, confirming what I already suspected were inside those thoughts she kept inside her head... Hand shake? Maybe you touched your genitals.. Or maybe worse.. Who knows?</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gag gift and it was a hit!</li>
            <li> I still had this in my cart when it was on sale for about $3. it&#x27;s of practical use, it&#x27;s funny and it delivered on the first day of the estimated delivery timespan</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer or a great gag gift.  Always brings a smile and/or laugh to anyone who uses it.  Very funny but possibly true!</li>
            <li> funny gag gift for a nurse in the ER</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife, who loves her hand sanitizer. Nice little stocking stuffer. I think it&#x27;s overpriced for what basically amounts to a custom label &amp; backing board, but the laughs were worth it.</li>
            <li> um well the title says it all right? I love getting gag gifts for my husband every christmas.</li>
            <li> Hilarious white elephant Xmas gift.  Everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend as a gag gift in his stocking for Christmas. He took it to work (he works a t a country club) and everybody got a real kick out of it.</li>
            <li> I knew this would be a hit with people. And its good to know that it is real sanitizer. Do not raise the price on this.</li>
            <li> 10/10 touched my genitals and it solved all my problems.</li>
            <li> Stupid gag gift that did the trick of continuously providing laughs for the person I gave it to.</li>
            <li> A great gag for the guest bathroom. We&#x27;ve gotten lot of laughs from observant guests. Most don&#x27;t notice but that&#x27;s their loss.</li>
