            <li>This is a great product and I would recommend anyone to try it...</li>
            <li>It is a great oil for my hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Argan oil and found it to be great for shine and protection for the ends of your hair.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>The product may be good</li>
            <li>This product is good for keeping your skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on your face</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>This oil is great for so many things.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product to keep your skin smooth and more youthful looking</li>
            <li>I should know better!  </li>
            <li>However, if you, like me, prefer to give your money to worthwhile causes and not to fraudulent thieves, then look around for another company that sells argan oil!</li>
            <li>This 100% pure organic morroccan oil is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results...</li>
            <li>Feels nice on skin.  </li>
            <li>argon oil is very healing.this is the perfect size for travel fast shipping very pleased with</li>
            <li>To sum up, I&#x27;m so impressed with the results of this oil that I not only bought another container that&#x27;s 60 ml, but I also told my friends about it.</li>
            <li>She says she&#x27;s extremely happy with it, as it leaves her skin feeling soft like rose petals.</li>
            <li>so many producers dilute their oil...</li>
            <li>Reduced wrinkles and a smoother more even tone.  </li>
            <li>After clicking on a free trial link on my facebook page, I received a sample, however, it was EXPIRED!</li>
            <li>Perhaps purchasing this product from somewhere else would have led me to a better experience.  </li>
            <li>Argan Oil is really refreshing for your skin, soaks in and leaves your skin feeling great and makeup goes on really well.</li>
            <li>Free trial is a trick to getting more from you without your authorization.</li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and seems to be working just fine.  </li>
            <li>It makes it smooth to&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish I would have read these reviews before getting my $5.99 free sample.  </li>
            <li>I ordered two \\&quot;free samples.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>They said I did not reply to their free sample within a 15 day period and therefore owe for the samples.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>After trying both products for a month, I can honestly say there were no results from the Idrotherapy as far as wrinkles.</li>
            <li>They are full of lies.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and it gets irritated very easily.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the manufactor would add a little bit more instructions on how and when to apply.</li>
            <li>I spoke to on the phone for 30 minutes, I was promised that if I returned the bottle in any time frame at my own expense I would be given my money back.</li>
            <li>So my bank was wonderful and credited me BACK the unauthorized transactions (minus the $3.99 which I DID authorize).</li>
            <li>Not even close to being worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Too early to say absolutely how effective it is.  </li>
            <li>There are ethical, fair trade companies who deliver a similar product.</li>
            <li>I actually liked how smooth the oil is, not sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li>Then about 2 weeks later, I had a charge of $83.00 and another week later, ANOTHER charge of $89 from Argon Oil of Great Britain.</li>
            <li>For anyone who is interested in this product BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did receive an email saying that even though I&#x27;d returned the bottle, it was more than 15 days after the period set by the company and I would receive nothing back.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying/using this brand</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s exactly why I do a search on EVERY product I purchase in store or online.</li>
            <li>Not seeing consistent results, I&#x27;ve looked into this product after seeing an ad on the web.</li>
            <li>I purchased from Mobilis after reading customer reviews on amazon site - 5 stars from 5 customers from this vendor, sounded better to me than 4.5 stars from 200 customers, from another vendor for seemingly similar item, which is cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I will also see if the ACCC is interested in this case.</li>
            <li>I do see some complexion improvement, hopefully more later.</li>
            <li>I did not experience this company or product through Amazon, perhaps it would&#x27;ve been better if I had, but I had to comment on the company and product and warn others before they made the same mistakes I did and got involved with this company, Essence of Argon.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to purchase this via a special offer advertised on The Real Talk Show.</li>
            <li>Hopefully if you can get past any &amp;#34;scam&amp;#34; offers as I did, you will see that this product is amazing!</li>
            <li>ordered Essence of Argan online with a free trial for $5 and before I could test the product,&lt;br /&gt;I was being charged $89 on my visa for a second amount (before my 15 days).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really works I notice the line and drawn face that has come over me during the day seem to disappear when I use this at night, I just have to remember to use it every night.</li>
            <li>this argon oil thanks</li>
            <li>However, the real danger is that this is not just $3.99 as it said, but will cost you over $99.00 plus shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>Those people are absolutely SKETCHY -</li>
            <li>and I have received absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I received my supposedly free sample only to learn that I will be billed $83.80 for this supposedly miracle oil.  </li>
            <li>Works very well on my arms -</li>
            <li>I tend to break out with nervous bumps - this stuff works very well</li>
            <li>I saw this product on a facebook link with comments- comments I assumed were real and from real people-</li>
            <li>I am 3 weeks in and see a HUGE difference with the Essence of Argon, the cracks on my feet are going away and they are not rough or dry anymore, my hands also seem better (I work in construction) just from applying it daily...</li>
            <li>I might like this product in the long run, but the free trial will cost me $83.80 plus shipping every month if I don&#x27;t return it within 15 days of ordering.  </li>
            <li>I received both Essence of Argan 30 ml., &amp; Idrotherapy, full size jar just for the price of S&amp;H only of $4.10 each.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as it said and noticed not one bit of difference around or near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I bought it due to dryness around my eyes, and in a few days my eyelids are so much better</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the cost is fair</li>
            <li>When I finally got through, I was told to return the product and that they would send me a FRESH bottle upon receipt of my return.</li>
            <li>But in the meantime, I had to cancel my debit card and now have to wait a week until I get a new one.</li>
            <li>If you want to try it for $99.00 go for it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that all positive reviews on this site is fake that&#x27;s been generated by the scammers.</li>
            <li>However, I never did agree to the \\&quot;terms.\\&quot; This is a scam, pure and simple.</li>
            <li>One of them purchased it for her 70 year old mom who&#x27;s a cancer fighter.</li>
            <li>I also smooth it on my eyelashes and hair line so as not to waste any.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the person you get on the phone doesn&#x27;t speak English very well at all.  </li>
            <li>As far as the company is concerned: You may have some safeguards in purchasing this product through Amazon, however, given the number of people being scammed by this company, I would not buy from them on principle.</li>
            <li>After countless creams and lotions, I had simply given up and thought that I just had to live with itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, and here is the serious part, I came across an offer for a free trial bottle for 3.99$ to cover S/H.</li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY dry, aging skin and this oil when applied to my slightly damp face, is absorbed without a sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I moisturized with 100% cold pressed virgin coconut oil), and my skin looks amazing after one week of use.</li>

            <li> or they were busy with other disgruntled customers.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, it may be too oily for some people&#x27;s facial skin and clog the pores, which ironically, can cause dry skin and pimples.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, I have been plagued with repeated visits to the dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> They had to reissue my bank card twice though which was very inconvenient since I had set up auto debits and had to contact those other vendors to give them my new card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I only lost about $10 to these scammers, I never even got to try the product</li>
            <li> I think I will use up a lot the next couple of days and return an empty bottle!</li>
            <li> My issues are the same as other people&#x27;s issues that have already commented (unauthorized charges, etc.)so I wont go into all those details again, but, I also wanted to add that I would also be wary of the positive reviews you might see because I know that many of those are fake.</li>
            <li> I no longer have dry itchy cracking  skin.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil is also known to treat diaper rash, psoriasis, eczema, dry scalp, wrinkles, sun damage, sun burn, dry hair, nails, stretch marks, acne...</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing, and I signed up for their auto delivery on their site: [...].  </li>
            <li> When you call the company, their computer system is conviently down and you have to call back.  </li>
            <li> I brought it for half price on groupon a couple of weeks back.</li>
            <li> Three days after using the oil, applying it once in morning and once at night before bed time, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is significantly soft, my face has a glow, not a shine, the dry skin at my T-zone area was gone and the acne dried out - odd</li>
            <li> After they investigated, they found the same other fraudulent claims from other people and when they tried to call the phone number on the card transaction, nobody ever answered the phone.</li>
            <li> After calling and arguing again with the robotic representatives at their call center for almost an hour I was offered gifts and credits instead of my refund.</li>
            <li> I have few wrinkles (prior to this oil</li>
            <li> He said no, not really.</li>
            <li> She had tried some other product but it must have been diluted or a scam because she didn&#x27;t see any results...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but after using it for a week, my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten irritated ever since.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about younger looking skin, but will use it.</li>
            <li> I got the product but find it extremely oily.</li>
            <li> so sorry to hear of the unfortunate mishaps of so many</li>
            <li> No more itching and the dry looking skin healed in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having dry cracking skin problems lately (age 60).  </li>
            <li> All the Essence of Argan did was make my face a little bit smoother.</li>
            <li> My wife got me using the Essence of Argon Oil on my feet at night because she was tired of them being dry, cracked, and rough looking...</li>
            <li> Essence Of Argan is real, organic, cold pressed, Moroccan, Argan Oil, loaded with Omegas and vitamin E...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been having dry cracking skin problems lately (age 60).  My nephew told me about Argan oil and how he thought it would help.  I put it on after my daily shower and felt a difference immediately.  No more itching and the dry looking skin healed in just a few days.  I no longer have dry itchy cracking  skin.  I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> For anyone who is interested in this product BEWARE.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered Essence of Argan online with a free trial for $5 and before I could test the product,&lt;br /&gt;I was being charged $89 on my visa for a second amount (before my 15 days). The company is known online for cheating people and not refunding your money. I called in to ask for a refund and after arguing with the rep I spoke to on the phone for 30 minutes, I was promised that if I returned the bottle in any time frame at my own expense I would be given my money back. This however was a lie as I shipped my bottle back and received no refund. I did receive an email saying that even though I&#x27;d returned the bottle, it was more than 15 days after the period set by the company and I would receive nothing back. After calling and arguing again with the robotic representatives at their call center for almost an hour I was offered gifts and credits instead of my refund. The product may be good but I was given no chance to try it, only headache and the loss of my time and money.</li>
            <li> I only buy 100% argan oil. This oil is great. I brought it for half price on groupon a couple of weeks back. I have to say that it&#x27;s always expensive (at least $50-$60 at min). This was my first time buying/using this brand and I was very pleased. I think those who were scammed clicked a scam website...nothing to do with the actual provider at all. Mines came as promised and no extras on my acct. so sorry to hear of the unfortunate mishaps of so many but that&#x27;s exactly why I do a search on EVERY product I purchase in store or online. And I write reviews...honest ones. This oil is great for so many things. For us native argan oil users...just about any 100% argan oil is a jewel...this being one I&#x27;ve added to my list of must haves.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin and acne - something that didn&#x27;t leave me with my teenage years. I&#x27;ve tried expensive treatment creams for acne and moisturizers that my dermatologist prescribed/recommended. Not seeing consistent results, I&#x27;ve looked into this product after seeing an ad on the web. There are lots of gimmicks out there for this type of item. This seller is legitimate. I purchased from Mobilis after reading customer reviews on amazon site - 5 stars from 5 customers from this vendor, sounded better to me than 4.5 stars from 200 customers, from another vendor for seemingly similar item, which is cheaper.  Three days after using the oil, applying it once in morning and once at night before bed time, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is significantly soft, my face has a glow, not a shine, the dry skin at my T-zone area was gone and the acne dried out - odd isn&#x27;t it that oil dries out acne?!.   The 15 ml bottle lasted me about 1 months. When the time came for me to replenish the oil, I decided to try the cheaper brand - less than a week after using it, my skin became greasy, the acne returned worse and I returned it. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.  To sum up, I&#x27;m so impressed with the results of this oil that I not only bought another container that&#x27;s 60 ml, but I also told my friends about it. One of them purchased it for her 70 year old mom who&#x27;s a cancer fighter. She says she&#x27;s extremely happy with it, as it leaves her skin feeling soft like rose petals.</li>
            <li> My wife got me using the Essence of Argon Oil on my feet at night because she was tired of them being dry, cracked, and rough looking...She had been using the product for the past month and there was a noticable difference in her skin and her feet...She had tried some other product but it must have been diluted or a scam because she didn&#x27;t see any results...I am 3 weeks in and see a HUGE difference with the Essence of Argon, the cracks on my feet are going away and they are not rough or dry anymore, my hands also seem better (I work in construction) just from applying it daily...I also just gave some to a friend who has terrible arthritis and he seems to notice a difference in his joints when he applies the Essence of Argon to his elbows, wrists and hands...This is a great product and I would recommend anyone to try it...Essence of Argon is good for what ails ya!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and it gets irritated very easily.  For as long as I can remember, I have been plagued with repeated visits to the dermatologist.  After countless creams and lotions, I had simply given up and thought that I just had to live with itchy skin.  One of my buddies let me try their Argan oil from Essence of Argan.  I was skeptical at first, but after using it for a week, my skin hasn&#x27;t gotten irritated ever since.  This stuff is truly amazing, and I signed up for their auto delivery on their site: [...].  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product is good for keeping your skin moisturized.  It makes it smooth to&lt;br /&gt;the touch and your makeup goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil from Morocco for about 3 months now.  I am thrilled with the results... My skin has a radiant glow, is wholly moisturized - but not oily. I have reduced wrinkles, and also apply to my hands, feet and hair.  Argan Oil is also known to treat diaper rash, psoriasis, eczema, dry scalp, wrinkles, sun damage, sun burn, dry hair, nails, stretch marks, acne... the list goes on.  NOTE - Argan oil is extremely expensive to extract (and is done so by Berber women in Morocco) so many producers dilute their oil... Essence Of Argan is real, organic, cold pressed, Moroccan, Argan Oil, loaded with Omegas and vitamin E... Just what the body needs!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! It hydrates the skin without leaving it oily. I am using it daily on my face and nails and I am very happy with the results. I will definitely keep using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to purchase this via a special offer advertised on The Real Talk Show. I paid $28 plus s&amp; h ($34.95). This 100% pure organic morroccan oil is awesome. I have EXTREMELY dry, aging skin and this oil when applied to my slightly damp face, is absorbed without a sticky residue. I have few wrinkles (prior to this oil I moisturized with 100% cold pressed virgin coconut oil), and my skin looks amazing after one week of use. I also smooth it on my eyelashes and hair line so as not to waste any. Hopefully if you can get past any &amp;#34;scam&amp;#34; offers as I did, you will see that this product is amazing!</li>
            <li> It really works I notice the line and drawn face that has come over me during the day seem to disappear when I use this at night, I just have to remember to use it every night. This is an excellent product to keep your skin smooth and more youthful looking</li>
            <li> argon oil is very healing.this is the perfect size for travel fast shipping very pleased with this argon oil thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to oily for my face. It is a great oil for my hands. I&#x27;m not sure about younger looking skin, but will use it.</li>
            <li> So I found this on one of the browser&#x27;s AD, and I tried it.  The product is not much more then a olive oil in effectiveness.  However, the real danger is that this is not just $3.99 as it said, but will cost you over $99.00 plus shipping and handling. When you try to contact the number given, it does not connect.  If you want to try it for $99.00 go for it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that all positive reviews on this site is fake that&#x27;s been generated by the scammers.</li>
            <li> This product combined with or without the wrinkle reducer is nothing but a scam. Your credit card is used BEFORE the allotted time and it is used in back of Bourke Europe. I rang the two numbers several times at all different times of the day and night, only to ALWAYS get an engaged signal. I think the numbers were also a scam or they were busy with other disgruntled customers. This is how you go over the number of days allotted to you. My next try was to use e mail, after two days this worked, I refused them permission to use my credit card details in writing and demanded an RMA number required to return the product. My credit card provider has refused to pay them and my card has been cancelled to stop any further unauthorised charges, this is the only way to stop this fraudulent behaviour. I will not be giving them any star rating. I will also see if the ACCC is interested in this case.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I bought it due to dryness around my eyes, and in a few days my eyelids are so much better</li>
            <li> I gave this review ONE star because the product itself isn&#x27;t bad! I actually liked how smooth the oil is, not sticky or heavy. HOWEVER, and here is the serious part, I came across an offer for a free trial bottle for 3.99$ to cover S/H. I ordered it online, gave them my debit card number and I received the product and was charged $3.99 on my bank statement. So far so good. Then about 2 weeks later, I had a charge of $83.00 and another week later, ANOTHER charge of $89 from Argon Oil of Great Britain. I called my bank and talked to the fraud unit. After they investigated, they found the same other fraudulent claims from other people and when they tried to call the phone number on the card transaction, nobody ever answered the phone. So my bank was wonderful and credited me BACK the unauthorized transactions (minus the $3.99 which I DID authorize). But in the meantime, I had to cancel my debit card and now have to wait a week until I get a new one. Those people are absolutely SKETCHY - so if you DO decide to order from them, send them a money order! Do NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD #!</li>
            <li> I received both Essence of Argan 30 ml., &amp; Idrotherapy, full size jar just for the price of S&amp;H only of $4.10 each. I was looking forward to results. After trying both products for a month, I can honestly say there were no results from the Idrotherapy as far as wrinkles. All the Essence of Argan did was make my face a little bit smoother. I was looking for results, even asked my husband if he could see anything different, decrease of wrinkles, pores tighter, anything. He said no, not really. Considering the price they would charge each of us monthly, $83.86 for Essence of Argan &amp; $99.99 for Idrotherapy, if purchased through their website, it&#x27;s a rip off. Beware ladies.</li>
            <li> After using Argon oil for a couple months I could see a difference in the skin on my face .  Reduced wrinkles and a smoother more even tone.  I also put it on my neck and upper chest.  When a co-worker asked what I was using on my face &amp; neck I was hooked.  She noticed an improvement in my skin both face and neck. I&#x27;m starting to use it on my arms &amp; legs also.  A little goes a long way and the cost is fair</li>
            <li> It feels good on your face but  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference,  I still look just as oldas I did before.</li>
            <li> BEWARE!!! Unfortunately, I too was scammed by this horrible company! After clicking on a free trial link on my facebook page, I received a sample, however, it was EXPIRED! I received it in February and the tiny printed expiration date on the bottle was 08/12. When I tried to email them, the email was returned stating that I must call them. When I called it took several tries to get through as the number was busy. When I finally got through, I was told to return the product and that they would send me a FRESH bottle upon receipt of my return. They issued me a Return authorization number. Well, it has been over a month now and I have received absolutely nothing. So I decided to call them today and guess what? They never received my return!! They asked me for a delivery confirmation, however, I did not ship it with a return receipt because they didn&#x27;t tell me I had to!! They are full of lies. I already paid $4.99 for the \\&quot;shipping and handling\\&quot; for the expired product that they initially sent and now I am out another few dollars for this crap that I sent back which they didn&#x27;t receive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, within 15 days they charged my bank account $83.80 which thankfully my bank stopped from going through because they thought it was fraud (which it was!). They had to reissue my bank card twice though which was very inconvenient since I had set up auto debits and had to contact those other vendors to give them my new card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I only lost about $10 to these scammers, I never even got to try the product so I can&#x27;t really say if it works or not, just beware of the company essenceofargan.com because they are horrible.  Perhaps purchasing this product from somewhere else would have led me to a better experience.  This experience has left a negative impression on me and does not make me want to try this product EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I found this to do nothing that it claimed. It was a waste of my money and I do not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is really refreshing for your skin, soaks in and leaves your skin feeling great and makeup goes on really well.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and seems to be working just fine.  It would be nice if the manufactor would add a little bit more instructions on how and when to apply.</li>
            <li> I received my supposedly free sample only to learn that I will be billed $83.80 for this supposedly miracle oil.  When you call the company, their computer system is conviently down and you have to call back.  Not to mention the person you get on the phone doesn&#x27;t speak English very well at all.  I&#x27;m sending mine back and having my card number changed so they can&#x27;t charge anymore of this crap to my card.  How can these people sleep at night. SMB</li>
            <li> I might like this product in the long run, but the free trial will cost me $83.80 plus shipping every month if I don&#x27;t return it within 15 days of ordering.  I should know better!  I wish I would have read these reviews before getting my $5.99 free sample.  I think I will use up a lot the next couple of days and return an empty bottle!</li>
            <li> I ordered two \\&quot;free samples.\\&quot; I was charged on my credit card the $3.99 for each \\&quot;fee\\&quot; sample. I got the product but find it extremely oily. 15 days later I was charged with $83 on my credit card. I called the company. They said I did not reply to their free sample within a 15 day period and therefore owe for the samples. I did not know I was to call the company within 15 days. In revisiting their website, I do see that the \\&quot;terms\\&quot; are listed under a separate page than the \\&quot;free\\&quot; sample. However, I never did agree to the \\&quot;terms.\\&quot; This is a scam, pure and simple. Once they get your credit card number, I fear they will just keep charging.</li>
            <li> This is used around the eyes along with another eye gel for lines.  This does not work either. I used it exactly as it said and noticed not one bit of difference around or near my eyes.  Once again this product is expensive to get people to feel that it must be working when in reality, it&#x27;s just another oil.  I wasted my money on this item.</li>
            <li> Not even close to being worth the money.  Don&#x27;t think that you are getting something for nothing.  Free trial is a trick to getting more from you without your authorization.</li>
            <li> Too early to say absolutely how effective it is.  Feels nice on skin.  I do see some complexion improvement, hopefully more later.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my arms - I tend to break out with nervous bumps - this stuff works very well</li>
            <li> I did not experience this company or product through Amazon, perhaps it would&#x27;ve been better if I had, but I had to comment on the company and product and warn others before they made the same mistakes I did and got involved with this company, Essence of Argon. My issues are the same as other people&#x27;s issues that have already commented (unauthorized charges, etc.)so I wont go into all those details again, but, I also wanted to add that I would also be wary of the positive reviews you might see because I know that many of those are fake. I saw this product on a facebook link with comments- comments I assumed were real and from real people- and then a day or two later there was a different product link with the SAME comments by the same &#x27;people&#x27;. Nothing about this company is &#x27;as advertised&#x27; so beware!</li>
            <li> By all means, sign up and buy the product from this company - EssenceofArgan! However, if you, like me, prefer to give your money to worthwhile causes and not to fraudulent thieves, then look around for another company that sells argan oil! As for the product itself, not to mention dozens of others on the market, promises abound. I&#x27;ve used Argan oil and found it to be great for shine and protection for the ends of your hair. The smell and feel of argan oil is beautiful too. However, it may be too oily for some people&#x27;s facial skin and clog the pores, which ironically, can cause dry skin and pimples. It&#x27;s a personal choice. As far as the company is concerned: You may have some safeguards in purchasing this product through Amazon, however, given the number of people being scammed by this company, I would not buy from them on principle. There are ethical, fair trade companies who deliver a similar product.</li>
