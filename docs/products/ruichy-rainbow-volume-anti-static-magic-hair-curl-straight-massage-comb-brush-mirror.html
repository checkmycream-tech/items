            <li>I love it.</li>

            <li>This products is great to use when ironing especially doing others hair.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this.</li>
            <li>It is a lil cheap....</li>
            <li>I would still recommend it because I have seen several videos of women who used it very easily but it just wasn&#x27;t the best tool for me personally.</li>

            <li>I was super excited when i ordered this comb</li>

            <li>Works great as a blow drying tool not so much for flat ironing.</li>
            <li>I got this as an add on item, its easy to use but does snag on my hair no matter how straight it is, but works well for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>and it broke the first time using it!</li>
            <li>yeah, if you have any questions, feel free to reply to this message and if you really want to know about this product&#x27;s results, reply after christmas.</li>
            <li>and i grab it right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the thought that counts, right?</li>
            <li>it is a very durable product very sturdy &amp; easy to handle with i</li>
            <li>The package arrived a few days later and I tried my best to hide it from my sister.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>Product received exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I never straighten my hair without it, the texture of my hair is much more smoother and my african american hair looks just like I got a Brazilian hair treatment, so I love it.</li>
            <li>it took a couple of days but it came pretty fast for me !</li>
            <li>Detangle your hair first</li>
            <li>The teeth of the comb are a bit to far apart for my liking but still it is very useful.</li>
            <li>Just got this item, so I&#x27;m not completely sure about the durability, but it seems to be good quality.  </li>
            <li>Able to section off areas of hair (i.e. bangs) and dry straight.  </li>
            <li>It took a little longer to get delivered, than I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way my hair looks and feels after using this.  </li>
            <li>very inexpensive</li>
            <li>It makes it soooo much easier for me to straighten my hair myself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real inexpensive tool, but does the job just as well as any $30 comb.  </li>
            <li>i would suggest this product so much</li>
            <li>\\&quot;hmmm, is this really that good?\\</li>
            <li>It arrived timely and works really well.  </li>
            <li>I know that practice makes perfect but after several attempts for over a 3 month period, I went back to my usual comb chase method.</li>
            <li>Overall its cool</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this comb and now i have to buy a new one..</li>
            <li>Also the shipping only took about 3 days which is pretty fast for me.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my hair and my daughters thick long (very long) curly hair.</li>
            <li>n&#x27;t it used correctly i don&#x27;t like it and the material is not hard</li>
            <li>It was flimsy and cheap compared to other ones that I have used.</li>
            <li>a little more costly it will be worth it in the long run!</li>
            <li>I was excited to find this comb for such a low price with shipping!  </li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I then later asked my sister, \\&quot;do you want straight hair?\\</li>
            <li>It is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>and it really does help to make flat iron smoother and faster.</li>
            <li>i always find it because of the hot pink.</li>
            <li>This comb definitely made flat ironing much easier for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are using it on your natural hair or on your extensions, it will definitely get the job done.</li>
            <li>I have rather thin hair, I cant imagine someone with even semi think hair being able to use it.</li>
            <li>but it makes my hair so straight i was looking at all the other ones of these v combs</li>

            <li> but it makes my hair so straight i was looking at all the other ones of these v combs</li>
            <li> IT DEFINITELY GETS MY HAIR STRAIGHTER THEN USING A FLAT IRON ALONE.</li>
            <li> my flat iron</li>
            <li> It straightens my hair with just one pass with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help when I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> It grips the hair as the comb slides through each section straightening my hair as it&#x27;s being flat ironed.</li>
            <li> but they were much more exspensive if you have thick hair &amp; its hard to straighten when your flat ironing your hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb after seeing online videos of other women using similar combs to help straighten their hair.  </li>
            <li> If this one breaks, I will replace it immediately because there&#x27;s no way I can go back to doing my hair any other way!</li>
            <li> This is as I expected.</li>
            <li> It requires a little practice to get used to flat ironing your hair with two arms...</li>
            <li> I use this everyday, for the last year and half</li>
            <li> Took 1 star off due to the fact that the teeth were not as close as I had hoped ( just as other reviewers noted)</li>
            <li> It cuts the time in half.</li>
            <li> Curious, I opened the package and tried the comb on a small portion of my hair.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to</li>
            <li> I thought the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; would be a little bit closer together, but it&#x27;s not a deal braker.</li>
            <li> I wish the teeth in the comb were a little closer together as well.</li>
            <li> I have a tough time holding a regular comb while doing it, so I thought this would help.</li>
            <li> &amp; this works amazing when i have bad hair days !!!</li>
            <li> and I will recommend this product to anyone who has hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> (duh)</li>
            <li> I find it a little awkward to work this comb and straighten my hair</li>
            <li> somehow, I can&#x27;t help but feel sad.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> my hair is already straighten for touch up so it won&#x27;t snag my thick curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> After receiving it, I tried to use it but found it to be awkward for me.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love doing my hair with this</li>
            <li> This comb does a great job keeping tension, untangling, and of course keeping your fingers burn free. I find it a little awkward to work this comb and straighten my hair but I believe that&#x27;s mostly just because I&#x27;m not used to it and using it on myself. compared to doing my hair without the comb I can see a difference in how well and quickly it straightens using one. It would defiantly be helpful to an actual stylist using it on someone else. I have done my sisters hair using this comb + my flat iron and she is now ordering one for herself.</li>
            <li> This product really works! It straightens my hair with just one pass with a flat iron. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are using it on your natural hair or on your extensions, it will definitely get the job done. Also the shipping only took about 3 days which is pretty fast for me. I love it and I will recommend this product to anyone who has hard to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with lots of doubt that this would worked based upon some of the reviews.  So far I have no complaints. It took a little getting used to but I now use it with more ease.  I really like the way my hair looks and feels after using this.  It is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Looks just as pictured and works splendidly. I use this everyday, for the last year and half and it&#x27;s still awesome. Perfect for those who flat iron their hair and want to avoid the heat and burns.</li>
            <li> This comb definitely made flat ironing much easier for me.  It&#x27;s very easy to hold and slides easily through the hair.  I thought the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; would be a little bit closer together, but it&#x27;s not a deal braker. Great product.</li>
            <li> i always find it because of the hot pink. it stands out in my drawer and i grab it right away. very inexpensive but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Great for blow drying hair straight.  Able to section off areas of hair (i.e. bangs) and dry straight.  Good deal as well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this. It was flimsy and cheap compared to other ones that I have used.</li>
            <li> Received product several weeks prior to scheduled delivery date! Packaged neat &amp; secure. Product received exactly as pictured. Took 1 star off due to the fact that the teeth were not as close as I had hoped ( just as other reviewers noted) Works great as a blow drying tool not so much for flat ironing. Great tool in pretty girly color nonetheless. Great buy for price! No problems with transaction or seller. Will recommend to others. :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb after seeing online videos of other women using similar combs to help straighten their hair.  I was excited to find this comb for such a low price with shipping!  After receiving it, I tried to use it but found it to be awkward for me. I know that practice makes perfect but after several attempts for over a 3 month period, I went back to my usual comb chase method. I would still recommend it because I have seen several videos of women who used it very easily but it just wasn&#x27;t the best tool for me personally.</li>
            <li> This is a tool that you need in your aresonal of hair products. Achieve the brazillian blowout results with this comb. I like the way the comb catches short pieces on the edge of the hair. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done. The teeth of the comb are a bit to far apart for my liking but still it is very useful.</li>
            <li> EWWWK ESTA COSA ESTABA USADA ! !&lt;br /&gt;NUNCA MAS VOLVERE A COMPRAR ALGO DE ESTA COMPANIA ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> Just got this item, so I&#x27;m not completely sure about the durability, but it seems to be good quality.  As far as the concept of this comb, it is amazing!  It makes it soooo much easier for me to straighten my hair myself.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it!  If this one breaks, I will replace it immediately because there&#x27;s no way I can go back to doing my hair any other way!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product, I just got it in the mail and can&#x27;t wait to use one my clients</li>
            <li> I love this comb I never straighten my hair without it, the texture of my hair is much more smoother and my african american hair looks just like I got a Brazilian hair treatment, so I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help when I flat iron my hair. I have a tough time holding a regular comb while doing it, so I thought this would help. It grips the hair as the comb slides through each section straightening my hair as it&#x27;s being flat ironed. It arrived on time, but the comb was all scraped up like it had been dragged in the street. I wish the teeth in the comb were a little closer together as well. Overall its cool and I have told friends about it.</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to get delivered, than I would have liked.  But it did ship from China, so what can you expect.  It&#x27;s a real inexpensive tool, but does the job just as well as any $30 comb.  My hair dresser has one and I had to find one that I could use at home.  I currently have an A-line cut and my hair is naturally , and this works perfectly to get all the curls out.  I love it.</li>
            <li> i just got my product in the mail today ! it took a couple of days but it came pretty fast for me !(: it is a very durable product very sturdy &amp; easy to handle with i never even heard of one of these until i came on amazon ! but it makes my hair so straight i was looking at all the other ones of these v combs but they were much more exspensive if you have thick hair &amp; its hard to straighten when your flat ironing your hair. i would suggest this product so much im only 14. &amp; this works amazing when i have bad hair days !!! its a great buy!!</li>
            <li> OMG OMG OMG!! So I was looking for cheap item on amazon (-__-\\&quot;) and so I came across this product. I was browsing the review and thought...\\&quot;hmmm, is this really that good?\\&quot; I then later asked my sister, \\&quot;do you want straight hair?\\&quot; (Her hair has a frizzy texture) She replied with a yes and so I bought it for her as a Christmas present. It&#x27;s the thought that counts, right? Cause for a girl like me, 3 bucks are a lot, like I&#x27;m not even kidding. The package arrived a few days later and I tried my best to hide it from my sister. Like a week later, I looked through the reviews again. Curious, I opened the package and tried the comb on a small portion of my hair. Even though I stroked it twice, I immediately could tell that my hair looked softer and straighter. I put the comb back in the package and so I&#x27;m writing this review after. IT&#x27;S AMAZING, and all the reviews were correct!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But somehow, I can&#x27;t help but feel sad. Before I was contemplating whether I should have bought one for me and my sister, but I ended up only buying one for my sister. I&#x27;m all thinking now, \\&quot;should I have gotten one?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe....maybe...someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^^ so yeah, if you have any questions, feel free to reply to this message and if you really want to know about this product&#x27;s results, reply after christmas. My sister should have used it by then and I&#x27;ll ask for her review of the WONDER COMB. &gt;(O^-^O)&amp;lt;</li>
            <li> Nice product, works good</li>
            <li> This is as I expected. Really good!!</li>
            <li> This products is great to use when ironing especially doing others hair. This way the heat from it doesn&#x27;t bother your hands.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this. Its a handy little tool and its great because it does the task of holding on to your hair while its hot and it saves you the extra toasty fingers you tend to get while straightening your hair. Also it combs though your hair before you hit it with the straightener and gets all the tangles out.</li>
            <li> this is a must have if u style ur hair by urself.. it make ironing super easy and fast.. and the best part is u wont have to accidentally burn ur firgers.. and it ships fast..</li>
            <li> Sorry but  it not working i can&#x27;t it used correctly i don&#x27;t like it and the material is not hard</li>
            <li> I had one somewhat like this before and then it broke.  I could not find anything in my area to replace it.  Then I found this.  It arrived timely and works really well.  I am gald I bought 2</li>
            <li> IT DEFINITELY GETS MY HAIR STRAIGHTER THEN USING A FLAT IRON ALONE. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING TO HAVE THE STRAIGHTEST OF HAIR :)</li>
            <li> It is a lil cheap.... Plasticy!!!! but i got what i paid for!!! I would use this is my hair is already straighten for touch up so it won&#x27;t snag my thick curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> This was truly a God-send.  It requires a little practice to get used to flat ironing your hair with two arms... but it&#x27;s totally awesome and gets your hair really straight and neat.</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you straighten your hair. It cuts the time in half. Must have product. I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this as an add on item, its easy to use but does snag on my hair no matter how straight it is, but works well for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I was super excited when i ordered this comb but when i got it i used it once and it broke the first time using it! I have rather thin hair, I cant imagine someone with even semi think hair being able to use it. I know it was only 3 or 4 dollars but it should be priced at .99 cents because its so cheap! I was really looking forward to this comb and now i have to buy a new one..i suggest if you want a straightening comb you buy one a little more costly it will be worth it in the long run!</li>
            <li> works well.  Detangle your hair first (duh) and it really does help to make flat iron smoother and faster. Perfect for my hair and my daughters thick long (very long) curly hair.</li>
