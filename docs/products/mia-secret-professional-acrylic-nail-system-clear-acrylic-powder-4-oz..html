            <li>Best I&#x27;ve ever used , for the value price and the large.</li>
            <li>This acrylic is amazing.</li>
            <li>Arrived securely and feels great.</li>
            <li>and I can control it as I do my own nails.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use self-leveling powder</li>
            <li>I will buy more soon.</li>
            <li>Much better than the stuff you can buy at Sallys.  </li>
            <li>love the product.</li>
            <li>The smell of this powder is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s filled til the top.</li>
            <li>Product alone, with other liquids doesnt work the best (depending on the quality of the acrylic liquid).</li>
            <li>The consistency is somewhat runny, but that makes it easy to control.</li>
            <li>it sets quickly, great beads , I will definitely be getting more for school.</li>
            <li>Wasnt full to the top but almost.</li>
            <li>Silky n smooth when doing nails.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product it doesn&#x27;t run</li>
            <li>but I really do appreciate that it was full almost to the top!</li>
            <li>Absolutely AMAZING Will buy again, i am an inspiring nail tech (soon to be) and i will only use this product from now on!</li>
            <li>so I will not need more for quite a while, but I will definitely be reordering more when I need it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, it smooths itself so you don&#x27;t do as much filing.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product too and delivery was fast Thank You.</li>
            <li>Pairing it with the Mia Secret Pro Liquid is your best bet!</li>
            <li>Nice large size, definitely last awhile!</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large container</li>
            <li>Works well..nails are good and hard with polymer product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, but the consistency is a bit running.</li>
            <li>Goes on very well.</li>
            <li>Just came in the mail, this is a very pretty big jar</li>
            <li>I love it, its big, its sealed and last long.</li>
            <li>Professional quality.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry too quick and it gives you enough time to mold it.</li>
            <li>However, it makes it easier to manage it and mold it into the nail shape you want because it doesn&#x27;t dry so fast.</li>
            <li>Used with Mis&#x27;s secret liquid monomer and got a really nice bead for the fist time out of all the other products I tried, mainly KISS line.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly with Mia Secret acrylic liquid!</li>
            <li>Just received the product, wow big container .. Will buy again!!</li>
