            <li>This is just an okay product.</li>
            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>I wish it worked better,</li>
            <li>My issue with this is that it will take literally a whole day to straighten my hair and still then, it won&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be  wonderful for long hair.</li>
            <li>Worth $60 for sure!</li>
            <li>Which is totally fine.</li>
            <li>Great product would definitely buy this as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li>The big plus is that my hair looks very shiney and beautiful  too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never been able to handle a regular hair dryer with a round brush, so this is perfect for me!  </li>
            <li>I can make my hair full and wavy, full of body, or straight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it won&#x27;t make your hair just flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li>It just blows out hot air and tangles your hair..</li>
            <li>AT FIRST I WAS DOUBTING TO BUY IT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real timesaver product!</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and leaves your hair looking as if you just left the salon.  </li>
            <li>It does dry your locks and it will curl the ends under and give you more body.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>WAS VERY SURPRISE</li>
            <li>HOW STRAIGHT MY HAIR END UP</li>
            <li>I have wavy frizzy hair, this Conair Infiniti Pro Spin really tames my hair</li>
            <li>Although she still uses her flat iron to straighten her hair, she uses the infiniti Pro Spin for a quick fix right before work.  </li>
            <li>Super big &amp; bulky.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>At First it was kind of hard to get the techniques down but after watching videos on how to use it, my mom got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Not only did my hair fall out but it made it very tangly and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I am a busy mom of a preschooler and a toddler, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do a professional blow-out, or</li>
            <li>really anything that requires more than flipping my head over and blowdrying...not to mention I&#x27;m not really coordinated when it comes to managing a round brush and blow dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li>However, it takes a long time to really get your hair dry.</li>
            <li>You almost need to use a normal hair drier to get the bulk of the wet out, then use this gadget to style it.</li>

            <li> You almost need to use a normal hair drier to get the bulk of the wet out, then use this gadget to style it.</li>
            <li> She was looking for an alternative to flat ironing.</li>
            <li> so I dry my hair about 75% of the way with a traditional blow dryer then finish up with the pro styler.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> My long, medium-thick hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the bristles.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have very long hair.  </li>
            <li> and she sais that you cannot dry your hair with it.</li>
            <li> So my suggestion to anyone who has my hair type, Stay Away From This product because it doesn&#x27;t dry or straighten your hair well.</li>
            <li> Loud &amp; took forever to do my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Not a high quality item.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect to sit in front of the mirror with dropping wet hair and dry it with this!</li>
            <li> The plastic combs on the head of the styler are a bit rough in texture.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have thick hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Some have complained about how big the rotating brush is</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and this product does not meet my qualifications.</li>
            <li> I have purchased every hair product out there and usually they don&#x27;t work as advertised -  </li>
            <li> In one year i have bought at least four.</li>
            <li> The ceramic heat and negative ions is also a plus.</li>
            <li> This is such bad quality, the manufacture should just recall this item.</li>
            <li> Sad to say i don&#x27;t think I can use the 2 inch barrel.</li>
            <li> I promise it&#x27;s almost impossible to get it tangled in your hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much. It just blows out hot air and tangles your hair.. Mine didn&#x27;t spin well, it would spin a couple of spins and then just stops!</li>
            <li> Love it... Makes hair smother,shine, and a lot more control. I will replace it if I ever have a problem.</li>
            <li> This is just an okay product. I use it once in a while. Not a high quality item. The plastic combs on the head of the styler are a bit rough in texture. Product works fair. Price matches the quality of this item. Heats up quickly so that is good! Would not buy again if I needed another.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have thick hair that tangles easily. This works great. Put it at the root and let it heat up. Then turn on the spin feature and go through the hair. Love love love it</li>
            <li> This is such bad quality, the manufacture should just recall this item. Not only did my hair fall out but it made it very tangly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Super big &amp; bulky. Loud &amp; took forever to do my thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good option to do hair at home but this product life is short. In one year i have bought at least four.</li>
            <li> I have purchased every hair product out there and usually they don&#x27;t work as advertised -  well - this one does!  It is a great tool and easy to use.  I have long hair so I dry my hair about 75% of the way with a traditional blow dryer then finish up with the pro styler.  It is easy to use and leaves your hair looking as if you just left the salon.  I highly recommend this product.  Worth $60 for sure!</li>
            <li> Hated it. I forgot i tried it before and i immediately returned it!!!!!! I wish it worked better, the concept it great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BRUSH! IT DRYS, AND CURL AND ADDS VOLUMW TO MY HAIR!!! Without Frizz!!! I&#x27;M ORDING A BACK UP!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, but she has a lot of hair and she sais that you cannot dry your hair with it. You need to wait some time after take a shower to have the expect effect.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair and this product does not meet my qualifications. Some have complained about how big the rotating brush is but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it.

            <li> This product I bought for my mom. She was looking for an alternative to flat ironing. Got this product and boy was it big! But my mom likes it. At First it was kind of hard to get the techniques down but after watching videos on how to use it, my mom got the hang of it. What my mom  likes about this product was that it gave her hair shine and volume. The ceramic heat and negative ions is also a plus. Although she still uses her flat iron to straighten her hair, she uses the infiniti Pro Spin for a quick fix right before work.  Great product would definitely buy this as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> This gadget is good. It does dry your locks and it will curl the ends under and give you more body. It&#x27;s nice because it won&#x27;t make your hair just flat and lifeless. However, it takes a long time to really get your hair dry. You almost need to use a normal hair drier to get the bulk of the wet out, then use this gadget to style it. Which is totally fine. Just don&#x27;t expect to sit in front of the mirror with dropping wet hair and dry it with this! It works though!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something similar for some time. Sad to say i don&#x27;t think I can use the 2 inch barrel. i haven&#x27;t sent it back because I keep thinking maybe I can use it. I think it would be  wonderful for long hair.I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to tell a friend because it is a good product.&lt;br /&gt; Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Get this product, you will not regret it. I promise it&#x27;s almost impossible to get it tangled in your hair.</li>
            <li> It would get tangled in my hair and I don&#x27;t even have very long hair.  I sent it back. Disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST I WAS DOUBTING TO BUY IT BECAUSE I THOUGH IT WAS ONLY FOR CURLING THE HAIR BUT I TOOK THE CHANCE.&lt;br /&gt;WHEN IT ARRIVED I USED IT IMMEDIATELY&lt;br /&gt;OMG...!!!&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT WORK EXTREMENTLY WELLL&lt;br /&gt;I WAS VERY SURPRISE HOW STRAIGHT MY HAIR END UP&lt;br /&gt;LOOKED LIKE A HAIR SALON DID IT&lt;br /&gt;I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I have wavy frizzy hair, this Conair Infiniti Pro Spin really tames my hair&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Love this product</li>
            <li> I am a busy mom of a preschooler and a toddler, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to do a professional blow-out, or really anything that requires more than flipping my head over and blowdrying...not to mention I&#x27;m not really coordinated when it comes to managing a round brush and blow dryer at the same time. This takes the work out of it, and the results are comparable to a blow-out. My long, medium-thick hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the bristles. It&#x27;s a real timesaver product!</li>
