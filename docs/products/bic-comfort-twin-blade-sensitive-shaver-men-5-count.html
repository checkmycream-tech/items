    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These are the best damn blades I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Great deal from a wonderful person.</li>
            <li>Great blade.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good close shave.</li>
            <li>Razors are good, but hair struck between two blades.</li>
            <li>Nice feel.</li>
            <li>Great razors, not fancy but give a close and clean shave.</li>
            <li>Good product, very good on sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I love it because it has an Aloe strip</li>
            <li>cheap but work pretty good</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>this one is lower on the scale in my book just because it does not seam as smooth.</li>
            <li>basic razors good price</li>
            <li>While most 3 or 5 blade razors are straight from the handle to the head; the Bic Comfort Twin razor has an angled handle and an upright twin blade.</li>
            <li>The unique design of the razor provides me with a more traditional and closer shave.</li>
            <li>A customer service rep from Amazon, sent an email saying that was fine, a new order was sent.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>Better than Schick 2 disposables that require much tinkering for the proper blade</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Packaged very well also.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these and this seller!</li>
            <li>so I get a real close shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I took a picture of them and threw them out because I have young children in the house.  </li>
            <li>I find paying 3-5 dollars for a single Gillette too expensive and have tried many disposables, but the comfort twin far and away the best...shaves are neat, clean and painless.</li>

            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like the other disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.</li>
            <li> Each one generally lasts me 2-3 weeks and commonly surpass performance of the very expensive Gillette products.  </li>

            <li> Good product, very good on sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Better than Schick 2 disposables that require much tinkering for the proper blade angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this razor as a replacement for the discontinued bic metals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big strip and wide blade head.  Glides across the face with minimal effort.  Cuts close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price per shaver is not the cheapest compared to others.</li>
            <li> as described therefore fully meeting expectations&lt;br /&gt;arrived well packaged and on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my thanks</li>
            <li> basic razors good price</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered these, they all arrived broken at the handle, completely unusable.  I took a picture of them and threw them out because I have young children in the house.  A customer service rep from Amazon, sent an email saying that was fine, a new order was sent.  Now they keep harassing me about returning the broken razors and I keep trying to tell them that someone already told me I didn&#x27;t have to and I threw them out! NOT WORTH THE HASSLE. DO NOT BUY THESE!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good close shave. Nice feel.</li>
            <li> These are the best damn blades I have ever used.  Each one generally lasts me 2-3 weeks and commonly surpass performance of the very expensive Gillette products.  I find paying 3-5 dollars for a single Gillette too expensive and have tried many disposables, but the comfort twin far and away the best...shaves are neat, clean and painless.</li>
            <li> Great blade. Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Plastic 2 blade razor, they get the job done</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly, as described and well packaged.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Razors are good, but hair struck between two blades. So while shaving facing difficulties. Even I wash my blades hair not removed from the blades. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Great deal from a wonderful person. Packaged very well also. I highly recommend these and this seller!</li>
            <li> I like bic products this one is lower on the scale in my book just because it does not seam as smooth.</li>
            <li> Not perfect. Occassional nicks which I dont get with my more expensive blades.</li>
            <li> cheap but work pretty good</li>
            <li> What a bargain for my husband and I, we always use these!</li>
            <li> Cut my husband&#x27;s face up like crazy!  He tried a couple of the razors and the experience was the same.  He&#x27;ll have to look further for something that will not be so problematic.</li>
            <li> Great razors, not fancy but give a close and clean shave. I will be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this model razor for over a year. I love it because it has an Aloe strip so I don&#x27;t need shaving cream.  It is really sharp so I get a real close shave and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like the other disposable razors.  I would give this razor a 7 out of 5 rating if I could.</li>
            <li> I fully endorse the Bic Comfort Twin. The unique design of the razor provides me with a more traditional and closer shave. Above the twin blades is a &amp;#34;lubricating strip with Aloe &amp; vitamin E&amp;#34; that helps soothe my skin after the razor makes contact. While most 3 or 5 blade razors are straight from the handle to the head; the Bic Comfort Twin razor has an angled handle and an upright twin blade. I gently slide the Bic Comfort Twin razor down my face, resulting in a closer shave with less irritation. I&#x27;m ready for the day.</li>
