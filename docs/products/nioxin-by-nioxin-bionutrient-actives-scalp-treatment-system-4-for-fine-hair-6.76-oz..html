    <ol>
            <li>Their #4 series (triple whammy) is the best on the market.</li>
            <li>A great rrot lifter and styling product with wonderful nutrients for the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have now used them for about 4 to 5 months and don&#x27;t seem to find any great solution to my thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>Kind of cruchy,like a gel or hairspray, but it brushes out!</li>
            <li>I am getting good results</li>
            <li>Good product for improving thinning hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the greatest for styling, but I&#x27;m still able to style it with a blow dryer ok.  </li>
            <li>Receive  timely and very pleased with the size.</li>
            <li>I still love it just for the sunblock!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product that really works if you use the rest of the Nioxin system.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much thicker, especially on top.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, found it easy to use</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Hair feels fuller, looks better all the way around.  </li>
            <li>Because I use and love the Nioxin products - the system 4 shampoo, the conditioners, the hair booster, I thought I would surely love the scalp therapy product.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair behaves and feels.</li>
            <li>So while my scalp is not in the best shape its pretty much under control.</li>
            <li>We are happy that hair loss has slowed way down.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd stage and is sort of a foam that is quite amazing  </li>
            <li>I have noticed considerable hair growth at the hairline (where I wanted it most).</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you are willing to be patient to see the results.  </li>
            <li>While I have not seen any greater hair loss (as was reported on earlier reviews)</li>
            <li>Perhaps I was expectiong too much, but its reviews were positive.</li>
            <li>I felt very self-conscious wherever I went, whether to work, shopping or to Church, hoping no one could smell my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is much healthier and seems thicker.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice as much hair falling out.</li>
            <li>I use the whole system (4 Products).  </li>
            <li>This seems to really work well for me.</li>
            <li>I must have been touching my hair now and then and the bitter flavor would transfer across.</li>
            <li>The shampoo &amp; conditioner are okay, a little medicinal-smelling, but</li>
            <li>A bit too early on for me to say how much help they&#x27;ll be, although I do think they are making a difference.</li>
            <li>some new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for a product to prevent sunburn on my scalp as I&#x27;ve had skin cancer on my scalp and my part seems to be very sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>Overall its a very high priced product without any particular benefit for me.</li>
            <li>The only thing positive about this Scalp treatment was that it replaced the mousse I used for my hair styling.</li>
            <li>Both my adult son &amp; I use this.</li>
            <li>Im talking shampoo, conditioner and the hair and scalp treatment complete systems.</li>
            <li>I had to use the old standbys with pyrithione zinc and salicylic acid in order to get it back under control.</li>
            <li>Not a single hair of regrowth.</li>
            <li>I used this whole system religiously for 3 months and it made absolutely no difference for me.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to treat my scalp when its dry with one of these products like Head and Shoulders and let it sit directly on my scalp for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>

            <li> Can not use it every day as my hair will get dry and sticky.</li>
            <li> I blow it dry</li>
            <li> I am a male age 43 with a small thinning area on the back of my head where the typical male bald spot starts to develop.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so tacky that I couldn&#x27;t get a wide mouth comb or even a pick through my hair.</li>
            <li> His is growing back, not sure about mine.</li>
            <li> Along with the other Nioxin.</li>
            <li> When I tried to use this system without continuing the dandruff treatments, I noticed the dandruff coming back as usual over a 1 month period.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like using the worst hairspray possible, although your hair looks nice.</li>
            <li> Have been seeing improvement and bald spots are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but this sent me over the edge because it is misleading in both the product description and the picture, not to mention the waste of time and money on my part.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty impossible to find a hair care product that has SPF in it that does not make your hair greasy, believe me I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> In the products defense though, I do have very bad dandruff that I keep under control with strong anti-dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but I ultimately threw it away, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews -</li>
            <li> I was hoping to at least slow down the loss of hair but NOT!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 2 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably need hair transplants or at least a wig soon....</li>
            <li> It is still not as thick as I would have hoped it to be but will continue to use to see if the thickness improves.  </li>
            <li> get me wrong:  </li>
            <li> h ave not seen any increase in hair growth also and the product is quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> If your Mom is sick, or you have to leave for vacation, you are stuck.</li>
            <li> I hate to shop and trusted Nioxin.</li>
            <li> So, I was very disappointed when I received this product</li>
            <li> And the smell is absolutely horrible, like a mix between asphalt and an ash tray.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this as part of the 3-part set: shampoo, conditioner &amp; this. The shampoo &amp; conditioner are okay, a little medicinal-smelling, but okay. A bit too early on for me to say how much help they&#x27;ll be, although I do think they are making a difference. However, THIS product, the scalp treatment foam -- I agree with the reviewers who have commented about how it makes your hair feel sticky. It&#x27;s like using the worst hairspray possible, although your hair looks nice. But, it feels like you&#x27;re wearing a helmet. And the smell is absolutely horrible, like a mix between asphalt and an ash tray. YUK! I tried it 3 times, hoping that maybe my body/hair would get used to the product and the smell would somehow decrease, but that didn&#x27;t happen. I felt very self-conscious wherever I went, whether to work, shopping or to Church, hoping no one could smell my hair. It&#x27;s expensive, but I ultimately threw it away, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that really works if you use the rest of the Nioxin system.  Along with the hair booster, this stimulates hair growth.</li>
            <li> Receive  timely and very pleased with the size.</li>
            <li> Both my adult son &amp; I use this. We are happy that hair loss has slowed way down. His is growing back, not sure about mine.</li>
            <li> My hair is much healthier and seems thicker.</li>
            <li> It leaves a greasy film on my hair that I don&#x27;t care for. I like the shampoo and rinse out conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nioxin System 4 Scalp Treatment for 4 months.  I have noticed considerable hair growth at the hairline (where I wanted it most). It is still not as thick as I would have hoped it to be but will continue to use to see if the thickness improves.  I recommend this product if you are willing to be patient to see the results.  I also use the System 4 Shampoo, Conditioner, and vitamin supplements.  (System 4 is for color treated hair so it does not strip the color out)</li>
            <li> This one is higly recommended, but did not help my hair problem.  Perhaps I was expectiong too much, but its reviews were positive.</li>
            <li> This product allowed me to finally not have to wear a hat whenever I go outside.  Previously my scalp would sunburn easily, because my hair is so thin, and then it would flake as the sunburn sloughed off.  It&#x27;s not the greatest for styling, but I&#x27;m still able to style it with a blow dryer ok.  My stylist thought my hair seemed a touch thicker since starting the Nioxin System 4 plan, but I&#x27;m not convinced yet.  I still love it just for the sunblock!</li>
            <li> Noticible change in my hair.  I don&#x27;t notice as much hair falling out. Hair feels fuller, looks better all the way around.  I use the whole system (4 Products).  Love it!</li>
            <li> This mousse gives me body with no sticky buildup. Along with the other Nioxin. 4 products I use I am getting good results</li>
            <li> I specifically purchased this product because of the &amp;#34;SPF 15&amp;#34;, both the description and the image indicate that the product has SPF 15. I am looking for a product to prevent sunburn on my scalp as I&#x27;ve had skin cancer on my scalp and my part seems to be very sensitive to the sun. (A female cannot wear a hat all the time.) It seems pretty impossible to find a hair care product that has SPF in it that does not make your hair greasy, believe me I&#x27;ve tried. So, I was very disappointed when I received this product and there&#x27;s only a &amp;#34;UV&amp;#34; filter. UV filter and SPF are two totally different things. I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews - but this sent me over the edge because it is misleading in both the product description and the picture, not to mention the waste of time and money on my part.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product twice and have used for 9 months now with no results. I was hoping to at least slow down the loss of hair but NOT!</li>
            <li> I ordered three different types of these Nioxin system products. The number 2 system and the number 4 system. Im talking shampoo, conditioner and the hair and scalp treatment complete systems. I am a male age 43 with a small thinning area on the back of my head where the typical male bald spot starts to develop. I used this whole system religiously for 3 months and it made absolutely no difference for me. Not a single hair of regrowth. In the products defense though, I do have very bad dandruff that I keep under control with strong anti-dandruff shampoos. Sometimes I have to treat my scalp when its dry with one of these products like Head and Shoulders and let it sit directly on my scalp for 5 to 10 minutes. This seems to really work well for me. I do that 2-3 times a month and viola, no dandruff. So while my scalp is not in the best shape its pretty much under control. When I tried to use this system without continuing the dandruff treatments, I noticed the dandruff coming back as usual over a 1 month period. I had to use the old standbys with pyrithione zinc and salicylic acid in order to get it back under control. The only thing positive about this Scalp treatment was that it replaced the mousse I used for my hair styling. It worked well for volume and control all day long but left a bitter taste on my fingers if they happened to touch my mouth during the day when I was eating. I must have been touching my hair now and then and the bitter flavor would transfer across. Overall its a very high priced product without any particular benefit for me. Perhaps its just my individual scalp but I noticed no hair regrowth and no benefit at all.</li>
            <li> been on Nioxin 4 series of products (cleanser, conditioner, &amp; scalp treatment) for 3 months now; within 5 days or so, I noticed a fuller look to my hair -- simply looked fuller &amp; felt thicker to the touch.  I think part of the process is &#x27;volumizing&#x27; existing hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a haircut 2 months in, stylist told me she could see some shorter hairs growing in...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong:  at this point, there is still thinning goin&#x27; on, but in the big picture:  fuller hair.  some new hair growth.  I&#x27;ll stick with it... and buying large-size bottles on Amazon beats in-store pricing big time...!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look and feel thicker! Kind of cruchy,like a gel or hairspray, but it brushes out! Hope it&#x27;s also helping it grow as well!</li>
            <li> On the suggestion of my dermatologist, I bought a &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; with the three Nioxin products.  I have now used them for about 4 to 5 months and don&#x27;t seem to find any great solution to my thinning hair.  In addition, the last part of the system (the therapy that I am reviewing here) seems to leave my hair feeling like straw.  While I have not seen any greater hair loss (as was reported on earlier reviews) I h ave not seen any increase in hair growth also and the product is quite expensive.  I figure I will continue until I finish the product and then try something else or resign myself to this condition.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it works, given time</li>
            <li> I bought this product in a much smaller size last fall.  I liked it, found it easy to use and it&#x27;s living up to its description and promise.</li>
            <li> Because I use and love the Nioxin products - the system 4 shampoo, the conditioners, the hair booster, I thought I would surely love the scalp therapy product. I hate to shop and trusted Nioxin. I bought 4 of them. I followed the directions. It made my hair so tacky that I couldn&#x27;t get a wide mouth comb or even a pick through my hair. I actually lost hair trying to style it so I could eat dinner with my family.  I took it to my hairdresser and she used a smaller amount and had the same problem. I have three unopened boxes of the stuff. You have exactly one month to return the product if you are not satisfied. If your Mom is sick, or you have to leave for vacation, you are stuck. I have to throw it away. I wouldn&#x27;t want anyone else to have the experience that I have had. Unless you don&#x27;t comb your hair or have very very short hair, do not buy it!!</li>
            <li> Thinning hair? Their #4 series (triple whammy) is the best on the market. This is the 3rd stage and is sort of a foam that is quite amazing  how it pumps up the hair... it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much thicker, especially on top.  I have been using it for at least 2 months. Can not use it every day as my hair will get dry and sticky. I blow it dry</li>
            <li> A great rrot lifter and styling product with wonderful nutrients for the scalp.  I love the way my hair behaves and feels.</li>
            <li> Good product for improving thinning hair but it takes a while for results. Have been seeing improvement and bald spots are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, (menopausal overweight woman on thyroid regimen), maybe it will work for you.  I remember feeling my scalp tingling with it, but nothing happened and I used it for several years along with the Nioxin shampoo and conditioner for thinning hair.  Darn.  I&#x27;ll probably need hair transplants or at least a wig soon....</li>
