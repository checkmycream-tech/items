            <li>It feels fuller, looks better.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>AND I KNEW I HAD TO PURCHASE MORE.</li>
            <li>SO THIS WAS A BARGAIN FOR SURE THROUGH AMAZON.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say about the product, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad</li>
            <li>But as stated, good if it&#x27;s a copy and the price is really right.</li>
            <li>Shampoo is fine- like that it gives my hair more volume.  </li>
            <li>Does give alot of volume for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I go for nice pictures to convince me the shampoo will make my life better.</li>
            <li>A huge amount of shampoo comes out when you tip it over.</li>
            <li>and all I had read in the ads this was to be a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous idea.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is kind of drying and it does not add much volume at all.</li>
            <li>It was okay but not near as good as was touted</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel squeaky clean</li>
            <li>But the hole in the top of the bottle is too large.  </li>
            <li>This is the RIGHT shampoo!  </li>
            <li>Not as much volume on the top of my head</li>
            <li>Not always sure you get the real thing or repackaged copy product.</li>
            <li>AND FEELS FULL.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery love product,</li>
            <li>I also have a scalp that quickly becomes greasy/hard to manage half-way through the day if I put any product in my hair at all, so hairspray and volumizing cream/gel are out of the question.</li>
            <li>Not only a good selection but very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>But I do love how it is so good for my usually greasy hair.</li>
            <li>This also is a great shampoo if you need a little body and lift in your hair</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a little stronger but very nice smell.</li>
            <li>Right on.</li>
            <li>Her hair is noticeably softer and shiny-er after the first use....</li>
            <li>Have reordered several times :)</li>
            <li>Price is great and quantity will last a long time saving me money and time.</li>
            <li>Item arrived and was exactly what I was wanting.....</li>
            <li>I am so glad to be able to access this shampoo here because it is so hard to find.</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected a lot more.</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing it for years, I like the price and fast shipment of the product.</li>
            <li>WHO BOTH SUFFER FROM DANDRUFF, GENTLE ON THEIR HAIR.</li>
            <li>I really recommend dis product to every one..</li>
            <li>Product seems very &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>arrived very timely and packaged well.</li>
            <li>a little hours a long way, and makes my hair smell great, and adds about 5-10% volume when I use it with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It rivals even the local beauty stores AND is delivered right to my door!  </li>
            <li>This is the only volumizing shampoo that has every actually made my hair visibly more voluminous.</li>
            <li>I followed my normal routine this morning and was pretty pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>AS AN OLDER WOMAN</li>
            <li>Not hard on hair.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for years - and yes, the right shampoo makes a different in how your hair looks, and its manageability.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works really well for me and the price on Amazon is very competitive compared to what I&#x27;ve found in big box stores in my area.  </li>
            <li>I could use a far cheaper product and get better results - or a slightly more expensive product and actually get some volume and no negative side effects.</li>
            <li>I worry these may have sat in a hot southern warehouse for a while and have changed consistency.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this is safe...</li>
            <li>I have very straight, half-Asian hair that tends to fall flat and</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair that is naturally straight as a pin and does not hold curl.</li>
            <li>One would think that a shampoo for fine hair would not make your hair feel limp and oily.  </li>
            <li>It controlled my falling hair and volumized my fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo so far.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to be classy without breaking the bank, this seems like it.</li>
            <li>very gud difference with in a short tym</li>
            <li>Works very well for me, I will definitely be buying this one again!</li>
            <li>I still use cleansing shampoo every couple of days to fully strip my hair of Biolage shampoo residue to prevent build-up, but then go right back to using this shampoo on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but I still prefer my usual Aveda Clove shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not so sure this is the same formula as I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>have fine, thin hair and this makes my hair look and feel much fuller</li>
            <li>The bottle is a large long lasting size.</li>
            <li>Even my mom, who is very critical of shampoo&#x27;s was surprised to see the change.</li>
            <li>Even extra conditioner barely helps.</li>

            <li> Even extra conditioner barely helps.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, my hair is thin due to the medication I take after having breast cancer.</li>
            <li> Certainly volumizes the hair but at the expense of excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> (if you dig that) and when it&#x27;s dry, I actually feel like there&#x27;s enough texture and volume to it that I don&#x27;t need to add any product!</li>
            <li> ordered this 6 months ago, still using the bottle daily, as I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> That must mean the shampoo must be decent.</li>
            <li> I will try using less of it and applying only at the scalp then rinsing, to see if that minimizes the dryness it causes.</li>
            <li> The larger bottle is a cost saver but a bit heavy</li>
            <li> I used to have very thin and extremely flat straight hair.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s supposed to be a &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; shampoo, I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this product and other Matrix shampoos.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not seem to add any volume to my hair, but it has made my scalp a bit itchy and flaky - two problems I have not experienced prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that weighs itself down, and I have tried numerous volumnizing products with really no tangible difference in volume.  </li>
            <li> Average product.</li>
            <li> I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair that lacks body</li>
            <li> I have med/long wavy/curly hair and have no problem with tangling or heavy residue.</li>
            <li> you, I&#x27;m ugly as hell and you&#x27;ll still like me for me&amp;#34;, Right on Matrix Biolage.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pricey compared to my usual</li>
            <li> She usually buys at a salon</li>
            <li> This shampoo provides body to my thin hair strands, as well as adding a slight lift at my roots.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult for me to find a shampoo that gives me volume that doesn&#x27;t dry out and damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes a bit hard to find and rather pricey (at hair salons)</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I mean, look at the bottle.</li>
            <li> (Or even worse-- was it on purpose?)</li>
            <li> AND BECAUSE I NEVER  BUY EXPENSIVE SHAMPOOS</li>
            <li> SADLY</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS VERY THIN</li>
            <li> Like not the trashy 3 buck crap at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s boring as hell.</li>

            <li> Not as much volume on the top of my head and I do feel like I have to use a lot however the day I curl my hair and use the shampoo, my curls will remain bouncy for three days! Would recommend to use on occasions.</li>
            <li> Not always sure you get the real thing or repackaged copy product. But as stated, good if it&#x27;s a copy and the price is really right.</li>
            <li> It has very mild scent, which is great.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for color treated hair.  Very good service.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo</li>
            <li> I am so glad to be able to access this shampoo here because it is so hard to find. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> love it! my favorite shampoo. it&#x27;s pricey compared to my usual but my hair actually looks shiny for 2-3 days after washing so, i&#x27;ll do it!</li>
            <li> For the price and all I had read in the ads this was to be a fabulous product. It was okay but not near as good as was touted</li>
            <li> Not so sure this is the same formula as I have used in the past.  One would think that a shampoo for fine hair would not make your hair feel limp and oily.  I will try another Biolage shampoo product because I do like them.  They have not lost me yet.  Maybe the Company has sold or something and there for is made differently.</li>
            <li> It smells good. The wife said she likes it. Her hair is noticeably softer and shiny-er after the first use.... which is what I would expect for a bottle of shampoo that costs $20.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and great size bottle for more than one person using it. Works great with the pump inserts as well</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo so far. Seems to provide good volume to my fine hair. I also purchased the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this shampoo, but was disappointed. Not only does it not seem to add any volume to my hair, but it has made my scalp a bit itchy and flaky - two problems I have not experienced prior to using this product. For the price, I expected a lot more. I could use a far cheaper product and get better results - or a slightly more expensive product and actually get some volume and no negative side effects. Will be switching out this shampoo for something better.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s supposed to be a &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; shampoo, I don&#x27;t notice any difference between this product and other Matrix shampoos.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is fine- like that it gives my hair more volume.  But the hole in the top of the bottle is too large.  A huge amount of shampoo comes out when you tip it over. Felt like I was wasting a lot every time I used it. I solved the problem by pouring contents into an old empty bottle, but ticked off that I had to bother fixing their design flaw. (Or even worse-- was it on purpose?)</li>
            <li> I have used Matrix Biolage shampoo for over 20 years now.  Sometimes a bit hard to find and rather pricey (at hair salons), I decided to look on Amazon.  Not only a good selection but very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. It controlled my falling hair and volumized my fine, limp hair. I recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years - and yes, the right shampoo makes a different in how your hair looks, and its manageability. This is the RIGHT shampoo!  I buy this on Amazon because it cheaper than my local hair salon.</li>
            <li> Matrix Biolage is an excellent shampoo for anybody looking get some volume. I used to have very thin and extremely flat straight hair. Couple of years ago my hairstylist recommended me to try the volumatherapie and I am so glad that I did. Now my hair has so much volume and looks beautiful. Even my mom, who is very critical of shampoo&#x27;s was surprised to see the change. I have recommended Matrix to all my friends and family who have similar issues.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this one again. It sounds like it&#x27;s good. Like not the trashy 3 buck crap at Rite Aid. If you&#x27;re trying to be classy without breaking the bank, this seems like it. I mean, look at the bottle. It&#x27;s boring as hell. A leaf icon. Real original. That must mean the shampoo must be decent. Normally I go for nice pictures to convince me the shampoo will make my life better. But this one...this one says &amp;#34;forget you, I&#x27;m ugly as hell and you&#x27;ll still like me for me&amp;#34;, Right on Matrix Biolage. Right on.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo out there</li>
            <li> My wife used most of this bottle of shampoo and liked it.  However, when she went into her hair stylist she was told that her shampoo had taken a lot of the color out of her hair.  I guess one should not use this product if you have color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R. Snavely</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this shampoo.  I have been purchasing it for years, I like the price and fast shipment of the product.</li>
            <li> I love Biolage products and the price on this large bottle is an incredible value.  It rivals even the local beauty stores AND is delivered right to my door!  Love it!</li>
            <li> This also is a great shampoo if you need a little body and lift in your hair</li>
            <li> This is the only volumizing shampoo that has every actually made my hair visibly more voluminous. I have very fine, thin hair that is naturally straight as a pin and does not hold curl. I also have a scalp that quickly becomes greasy/hard to manage half-way through the day if I put any product in my hair at all, so hairspray and volumizing cream/gel are out of the question. This shampoo provides body to my thin hair strands, as well as adding a slight lift at my roots. It does not make my scalp greasy/hard to manage after one day. I still use cleansing shampoo every couple of days to fully strip my hair of Biolage shampoo residue to prevent build-up, but then go right back to using this shampoo on a daily basis. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Have reordered several times :)</li>
            <li> This shampoo works really well for me and the price on Amazon is very competitive compared to what I&#x27;ve found in big box stores in my area.  I have thin blonde hair that lacks body and it is difficult for me to find a shampoo that gives me volume that doesn&#x27;t dry out and damage my hair.  I like the volume and feel of my hair when using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this product yet, but I got a sample at a women&#x27;s expo and used it this morning.  I cannot believe how huch volume it added to my hair!  I have thick curly hair that weighs itself down, and I have tried numerous volumnizing products with really no tangible difference in volume.  I followed my normal routine this morning and was pretty pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, my hair is thin due to the medication I take after having breast cancer. It feels fuller, looks better. Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It makes my hair look and feel very healthy. The larger bottle is a cost saver but a bit heavy so I just purchased a shampoo dispenser and refill that.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo that leaves hair feeling clean. I have med/long wavy/curly hair and have no problem with tangling or heavy residue.</li>
            <li> A friend suggested I buy all my products on line.  Fabulous idea.  Price is great and quantity will last a long time saving me money and time.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS SHAMPOO AS A GIFT FOR MY BIRTHDAY AND BECAUSE I NEVER  BUY EXPENSIVE SHAMPOOS I WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT. I RATIONED IT AND IT LASTED FOR MONTHS. SADLY IT RAN OUT AND I KNEW I HAD TO PURCHASE MORE. GREAT SMELL AND VOLUMIZING IT IS! AS AN OLDER WOMAN MY HAIR IS VERY THIN SO WHEN I WASH WITH THIS MY HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS FULL.  GREAT PRODUCT! I COULD NOT FIND LOCALLY EXCEPT IN HAIR SALONS SO THIS WAS A BARGAIN FOR SURE THROUGH AMAZON. ALSO USED BY MY HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER WHO BOTH SUFFER FROM DANDRUFF, GENTLE ON THEIR HAIR. JUST A GREAT FAMILY SHAMPOO!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  This is the best shampoo I have ever used for my baby fine hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is kind of drying and it does not add much volume at all. Yet I will still use it because its the best option for someone like me who has very oily itchy hair. My last shampoo was salerm citric and it was very good but it had parabens and my hair would get greasy after one or two days despite washing twice. With biolage volume shampoo I only wash once and it stays non greasy for 3 days! I will try using less of it and applying only at the scalp then rinsing, to see if that minimizes the dryness it causes. But I do love how it is so good for my usually greasy hair. I&#x27;m no longer greasy or itchy.</li>
            <li> The best volumizing shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  I have very straight, half-Asian hair that tends to fall flat and have made it my life&#x27;s work to find the best volumizing products.  Makes my hair feel squeaky clean (if you dig that) and when it&#x27;s dry, I actually feel like there&#x27;s enough texture and volume to it that I don&#x27;t need to add any product!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> Its really an awesome product...I could c a lot of difference in my hair ....it makes look like bouncing hair..very gud difference with in a short tym...I really recommend dis product to every one..</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a little stronger but very nice smell. I get compliments on it a lot.  It gives my hair nice volume. The bottle is a large long lasting size.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say about the product, it&#x27;s great. The shipping and handling was A++.</li>
            <li> ordered this 6 months ago, still using the bottle daily, as I have long hair. a little hours a long way, and makes my hair smell great, and adds about 5-10% volume when I use it with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo to change to something different. It works fine, but I still prefer my usual Aveda Clove shampoo.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this shampoo.  She usually buys at a salon but we saved by getting it on here.</li>
            <li> Item arrived and was exactly what I was wanting.....Very pleased.....</li>
            <li> Certainly volumizes the hair but at the expense of excessive dryness. Even extra conditioner barely helps.</li>
            <li> The smell and consistency on this shampoo where quite a bit off, from when I purchase at a salon.  I worry these may have sat in a hot southern warehouse for a while and have changed consistency.  Not sure if this is safe...this didn&#x27;t come from warehouse but third party, hence my safety concern.</li>
            <li> Average product. Provides volume but don&#x27;t recommend for greasy/oily hair. The aroma is good.</li>
            <li> this shampoo was recommended to me my a friend and I am so glad she did.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, thin hair and this makes my hair look and feel much fuller</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years.  Good product. Not hard on hair. Product seems very &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived very timely and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery love product,</li>
            <li> Been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me, I will definitely be buying this one again!</li>
