            <li>I bought this tool along with some others to do my own gel manicures</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure that it will take me some time to get perfectly polished nails, and I have a learning curve with it, since it&#x27;s new to me.  </li>

            <li>This cuticle pusher is great, it is made very sturdy</li>

            <li>Such a great value!</li>
            <li>I am currently in the process of growing out my nails, and I have been wanting to find a good cuticle pusher that would help me keep my nails looking great, and improve the appearance of manicures.</li>
            <li>love that this is made from stainless steel, it gives me great results.</li>
            <li>Thus I&#x27;d have to keep buying more.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the cleaner part is cupped.  </li>

            <li>It gets my cuticles so clean that I don&#x27;t need to use a cuticle trimmer anymore, which tends to cause hang nails and cuts.</li>
            <li>for the price I was really surprised at the quality feels nice in your hand.</li>
            <li>Love this cuticle pusher so much that I bought another one for my mother who also raves about it.</li>
            <li>Works great; I like how it&#x27;s so much easier to clean than the wooden ones.</li>

            <li>It was shipped quickly too.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Really like the ends, but the shaft is too skinny to hold comfortably.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only $6.99 on Amazon, which truly is within most everyone&#x27;s reach.  </li>
            <li>(I did this after using a cuticle oil first and rubbing it in).  </li>
            <li>really enjoyed this product and will definitely keep it in my nail tool kit.  </li>

            <li>This tool is very useful and professional.</li>
            <li>She was super pleased with it...said it cleans well and isn&#x27;t too sharp so doesn&#x27;t cause pain!</li>
            <li>I also found it extremely easy to push my nails back</li>
            <li>Very high quality tool.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Bombay.</li>
            <li>Cleans under the nails very well.</li>

            <li>Use the opposite end to clean under and around your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very professional tool!</li>
            <li>Nothing cheap about it.&lt;br /&gt;Works as expected.</li>
            <li>The curved end works great at getting under my nails and no parts of this cuticle pusher ever scratched me or felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Majestic Bombay - Professional Stainless Steel Cuticle Pusher and Nail cleaner tool.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what the screwdriver like end is for but the other end cleans and scrapes great.</li>
            <li>The problem I had with wooden cuticle pushers was that they would last for maybe 4 uses before they were pretty much ready to be thrown away.</li>
            <li>So, we received this item a day early.</li>
            <li>Looks professional.</li>
            <li>The stainless steel construction of this cuticle pusher/ nail tool means that it&#x27;s a tool that should last for years to come, without the worry of rusting.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for offering such a quality product.</li>
            <li>This is much better than a lot of similar tools I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Having used this tool for a couple of months now, it is obvious that it is of a high quality.</li>
            <li>my tools are always to blunt or not small enough!</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is similar to professional surgical instruments I work with.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s extremely affordable!  </li>
            <li>Now, since this is my first time trying a product like this, I can&#x27;t compare it to other similar tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job, and is worth the small amount of money.</li>

            <li> I have used plastic and wood cuticle pushers in the past, but I never really got the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> (she uses a real sharp one)</li>
            <li> Look no more...</li>
            <li> I have used several products by Majestic Bombay, and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> , if any of you have kiddos, you know that it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep your set of nails looking glam between all the diaper changing &amp; sippy cup washing -_- your nails, regardless of the polish, finish etc, they are going to chip, crack,</li>
            <li> I also am really bad at making a schedule</li>
            <li> I decided to do my research and get everything she uses as I hate feeling like the tools may not be cleaned properly...after searching for a nail cleaner like hers</li>

I also found it extremely easy to push my nails back (I did this after using a cuticle oil first and rubbing it in).  It easily cut away excess skin that had built up over time.  The stainless steel construction of this cuticle pusher/ nail tool means that it&#x27;s a tool that should last for years to come, without the worry of rusting.  Saving you money in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure that it will take me some time to get perfectly polished nails, and I have a learning curve with it, since it&#x27;s new to me.  I also am really bad at making a schedule and so I could forget to do it for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this product and will definitely keep it in my nail tool kit.  If you are going to use a product like this, I would definitely suggest using this with a cuticle oil, or Virgin Argan Oil to help to prepare your skin prior to using the cuticle pusher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was highly impressed with this product and definitely recommend it, if you are currently searching for a good nail tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  I received this product for testing and review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions stated here, are my own!</li>
            <li> Quality made, perfect for taking care of my nails.</li>
            <li> This tool is fab! I ordered it to use for when I do my manicure and pedicures at the salon. The lady who does this for me is a nightmare to please...my tools are always to blunt or not small enough! I decided to do my research and get everything she uses as I hate feeling like the tools may not be cleaned properly...after searching for a nail cleaner like hers (she uses a real sharp one) I took a risk and got this! She was super pleased with it...said it cleans well and isn&#x27;t too sharp so doesn&#x27;t cause pain! Bargain I&#x27;d say!</li>
            <li> Sturdy and strong, this cuticle pusher is perfect for getting those pesky cuticles out of the way!</li>
            <li> Look no more...This is the best tool period...Thank you so much for offering such a quality product.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it should do. The flatter edge is great for pushing back my cuticles and does it very easily. It is way easier than using a wooden pusher. The curved end works great at getting under my nails and no parts of this cuticle pusher ever scratched me or felt uncomfortable. It cleans very easily also. This is much better than a lot of similar tools I have used in the past. While I received a discounted/complimentary product for testing purposes all opinions are completely my own, honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> A simple, straightforward transaction.  Loved it!</li>
            <li> Improve your mani-pedi with this indispensable tool.</li>
            <li> I had to grind the squared end because of burrs.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, and is worth the small amount of money.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as deacribed and was promptly delivered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be 100% honest! I HATE doing my own nails! If you know me in non-internet life you know that pre-lil&#x27;princess, I was the nail snob! Never, ever touched my own nails. I left my fingers looking glam to a professional!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if any of you have kiddos, you know that it&#x27;s almost impossible to keep your set of nails looking glam between all the diaper changing &amp; sippy cup washing -_- your nails, regardless of the polish, finish etc, they are going to chip, crack, basically a bunch of horribleness is going to happen, regardless of how careful you are! That&#x27;s when tools like this handy thing come in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still a nail snob lol....I just can&#x27;t live without my pretty nails...but unless I wanna live at my nail techs chair, I&#x27;ve learned that having good touch-up tools has come in handy! Now if something chips, crack, needs to be touched up, I can do it myself between nail salon visits! I can have fabulous nails &amp; keep my salon visits to two times a month, regardless of what happens to my nails from mommyhood! Recommend this tool to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> Very professional tool!</li>
            <li> I bought this tool along with some others to do my own gel manicures and I have to say this tool is great quality! I would purchase again for sure!</li>
            <li> The edges are smooth and effectively get the gunk out from under my nails. Have to get another one. as my granddaughter borrowed the first one.</li>
            <li> I love my product! Such a great value! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Received quickly &amp; works perfectly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Awesome tool for cuticles!</li>
            <li> I am currently in the process of growing out my nails, and I have been wanting to find a good cuticle pusher that would help me keep my nails looking great, and improve the appearance of manicures. I have used plastic and wood cuticle pushers in the past, but I never really got the results I wanted. This cuticle pusher by Majestic Bombay was the very first stainless steel one that I have ever used, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is simple. Use the pusher side to push back your cuticles. Use the opposite end to clean under and around your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is made from stainless steel, it gives me great results. The problem I had with wooden cuticle pushers was that they would last for maybe 4 uses before they were pretty much ready to be thrown away. Thus I&#x27;d have to keep buying more. With this one being made from stainless steel, I save money because I can keep reusing it over and over. It doesn&#x27;t lose its form, or fall apart. Overall I am just happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Majestic Bombay - Professional Stainless Steel Cuticle Pusher and Nail cleaner tool.  I love the fact that the cleaner part is cupped.  It does a good job of cleaning under my finger nails.</li>
            <li> The flat edge was chipped on one side.  Still works I just have to be extra careful with it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and delivery</li>
            <li> Product as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this cuticle pusher so much that I bought another one for my mother who also raves about it. It gets my cuticles so clean that I don&#x27;t need to use a cuticle trimmer anymore, which tends to cause hang nails and cuts. It was shipped quickly too. Highly recommended!! Don&#x27;t pay double for the brand name one!</li>
            <li> Great service, great product!</li>
