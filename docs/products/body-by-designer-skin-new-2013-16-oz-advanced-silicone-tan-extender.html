            <li>This lotion is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Love this Body Lotion ♥</li>
            <li>I love this line of skin care, and this lotion smells so good and feels great!</li>
            <li>It smells so good and makes my skin look flawless :)</li>
            <li>Makes your tan look really good.</li>
            <li>The product itself is good, but the smell itself made me give it two stars.</li>
            <li>This smells so good.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice feel after, but the scent is a bit citrus...but still a great extender it does</li>
            <li>After using the Body By Design Enamore Lotion (which I loved) they stopped making that lotion.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as the Enamore lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, it has a perfume-like smell that is not overpowering and is kind of a unisex scent.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very smooth!  </li>
            <li>Your skin will have a great glow and looks fabulous in pictures!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing tan extender.</li>
            <li>Genuine product at a great price</li>
            <li>This is a good tan extender, it smells ok.</li>
            <li>I love love this product!</li>
            <li>Enamor is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s a shame they discontinued it.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most amazing lotion i have ever had it works GREAT!</li>
            <li>It would have been great if it where the right product.</li>
            <li>matches the designer by designer I bought at my work, glad that I was able to get it on here</li>
            <li>and i thought i would try this one since I do love Designer Skin products.</li>
            <li>So I was able to compare the two.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find a lotion like it since.</li>
            <li>but I still think the Enamore was better.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin healthy</li>
            <li>the more you use it i have a glow .</li>
            <li>Basically, before noticing this I thought the lotion was perfect but this definitely changed that.</li>
            <li>Just an ok lotion in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I will not be ordering any more of this lotion without a doubt.</li>
            <li>I think Enamor smelled better in my opinion - this product has an Amber/citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li>so it covers up any imperfections, it has caffeine to revitalize your skin, SO MANY skin care ingredients in there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad or overwhelming by any means, everyone just has their own olfactory preferences.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it seemed to extend my tan to some extent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor</li>
            <li>makes skin feel fairly smooth, goes on easy (not greasy feeling).</li>
            <li>I wanted to throw it out there that this product is in fact bronzer free.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.....very good mosturizer and actually does preserve your tan.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this and has a good feel to it that lasts a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li>I love it a whole lot!</li>
            <li>but I was too excited to use the lotion to return it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing smells wonderful and extend your tan as well as a slight Perfector for your legs</li>
            <li>Love the smell and how it makes skin soft</li>
            <li>Lotion is good but doesnt stand up to their previous lotion that was discontinued.</li>
            <li>put it on last night and is an ok lotion</li>
            <li>I will most likely not purchase this one again</li>
            <li>The only issue I had is that it was not packaged well and the lotion top was off when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lotion- white and siliconey that glides on easily and makes my skin feel very moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to tan several years ago, and I remember using Enamor by Designer skin - it contained a silicone emulsion that left the skin feeling AMAZING</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thin and silky, and has a great scent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Do not like Designer as much as Body by Designer.</li>
            <li>This one not so much...</li>
            <li>It shipped so fast.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a very generous size.</li>
            <li>I really like this tan extender I use it all the time</li>
            <li>(not bad smell just a little strong in the begining)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this because of the good reviews and it is hard to find a decent silicone based tan extender/moisturizer</li>
            <li>it was very unusual and pretty gross...</li>
            <li>Still a highly recommended buy.</li>
            <li>Enamor soaks right in with minimal rubbing and leaves skin feeling super soft with zero (ZERO)</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and not too floral, definitely not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to try something new.  </li>
            <li>but it does not mean that I&#x27;m not interested in having soft, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Not greasy but keeps skin soft all day!</li>
            <li>Really like this after tanning moisturizer; I use it daily after showering.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Never heavy.</li>
            <li>I wish so much that they would come back out with the Enamore lotion.</li>
            <li>if your someone who wants a bronzer-free lotion, this one does not contain a bronzer and it is white in color.</li>
            <li>product also contains a silicone emulsion that leaves the skin silky soft in ways that store brands just can&#x27;t even compete with.</li>
            <li>I know that this lotion is a little pricey, but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The lotion does not make your skin as soft feeling like the Enamore did, and me personally I think the smell is kinda of a manly smell instead of a girly smell.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel really soft and lasts for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying.</li>

            <li> This lotion is also on the watery side I didn&#x27;t give it a chance long enough to see how it worked on my tan</li>
            <li> There are both positive and negative things about this lotion...</li>
            <li> It lasts reasonably long on the skin, and does NOT contain a bronzer.</li>
            <li> Trying to find a lotion like this that doesn&#x27;t contain a bronzer is definitely an adventure in itself, since the description does not say it quite in black and white</li>
            <li> and i will never go back to any other lotion..</li>
            <li> I still had a little bit left when I got this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Luckily only a little had spilled.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I was very let down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got that cheap cologne smell (not girly or fruit, as you would expect from a moisturizer) and the smell stays on your skin to the point that I had to wash it off because it was making me sick.</li>
            <li> The smell to this lotion is bland and gross, it&#x27;s not a good smell to rock.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find that Enamor had been discontinued, but after a little searching I was able to come across this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems a bit less thick than I remember this product being and almost watery.....</li>
            <li> It is a little thin and has a perfume type smell.</li>
            <li> At least by 2-3 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It contains a caffeine complex to stimulate the skin and help cellulite, and has a matte &amp;#34;airbrush&amp;#34; finish.</li>
            <li> My tan has lasted longer with this lotion, i would recommend it if you have a hard time keeping your tan!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting it to be as thin as it was.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken when I received it</li>
            <li> Never have I gotten a bad product from this company  </li>
            <li> but this product smells AWFUL.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this lotion.....very good mosturizer and actually does preserve your tan. Smells great too! I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I got this today and it&#x27;s expired.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit less thick than I remember this product being and almost watery.....</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and has a good feel to it that lasts a long time on the skin. Makes your tan look really good. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this line of skin care, and this lotion smells so good and feels great! I would order again, and recommend to others!</li>
            <li> It would have been great if it where the right product. I searched spray tan extender and this popped up. Its not for spray tans.</li>
            <li> Best lotion! I use it as a tan extender and as an every day moisturizer. It&#x27;s thin and silky, and has a great scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try something new.  It is a little thin and has a perfume type smell. (not bad smell just a little strong in the begining)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on last night and is an ok lotion makes skin feel fairly smooth, goes on easy (not greasy feeling). I was not expecting it to be as thin as it was. I did not see the matte finish I was expecting either.&lt;br /&gt; I will most likely not purchase this one again is a personal preference everyone likes something different and this is just not the product for me.</li>
            <li> Scent- it smells just like the tanning lotion version if this. Cologne mixed with coppertone sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion- white and siliconey that glides on easily and makes my skin feel very moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color extender: my tan defintley lasts alto longer with this lotion. At least by 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all 5/5</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the good reviews and it is hard to find a decent silicone based tan extender/moisturizer but this product smells AWFUL. It&#x27;s got that cheap cologne smell (not girly or fruit, as you would expect from a moisturizer) and the smell stays on your skin to the point that I had to wash it off because it was making me sick. The product itself is good, but the smell itself made me give it two stars.</li>
            <li> Really like this after tanning moisturizer; I use it daily after showering.  It makes my skin soft and not greasy.  The fragrance is fresh and not too floral, definitely not overpowering.  I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It smells great. I would but it again. I highly recommend it! My skin feels great since I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> Never have I gotten a bad product from this company  All of their lotions ROCK!  Smell great with a great feel.  Never heavy.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing smells wonderful and extend your tan as well as a slight Perfector for your legs</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the correct product--- was sent &amp;#34;Designer&amp;#34; by Designer instead.  Do not like Designer as much as Body by Designer.</li>
            <li> matches the designer by designer I bought at my work, glad that I was able to get it on here</li>
            <li> I Just Received My Bottle Today 5/1/2015 Which Expired A Year Ago. I&#x27;m Almost Scared To Use It.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a replacement for Designer Skin&#x27;s discontinued Enamor line, this is not it. Enamor is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used, and it&#x27;s a shame they discontinued it. This lotion, &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; is too perfumed for my liking, and doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin like Enamor does. Enamor soaks right in with minimal rubbing and leaves skin feeling super soft with zero (ZERO) oily-feeling. This one not so much...</li>
            <li> This smells so good.  It makes your tan last and makes your skin super-smooth.  I love it a whole lot!</li>
            <li> i have always used an extender after tanning and i thought i would try this one since I do love Designer Skin products. This has a nice feel after, but the scent is a bit citrus...but still a great extender it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing tan extender. It shipped so fast. The pump was broken when I received it but I was too excited to use the lotion to return it. It smells so good and makes my skin look flawless :)</li>
            <li> After using the Body By Design Enamore Lotion (which I loved) they stopped making that lotion. I  got this lotion thinking it would be like the Enamore lotion but unfortunately I was very let down. It is not as good as the Enamore lotion. I still had a little bit left when I got this lotion.  So I was able to compare the two.  The lotion does not make your skin as soft feeling like the Enamore did, and me personally I think the smell is kinda of a manly smell instead of a girly smell. I ended up just giving the lotion to my brother. I wish so much that they would come back out with the Enamore lotion. I have not been able to find a lotion like it since. I&#x27;ve tried the Kardashian after skin lotion in the blue bottle and that is what I use now. The Kardashian is the closest lotion that I have found that is like the Enamore but I still think the Enamore was better.</li>
            <li> Lotion is good but doesnt stand up to their previous lotion that was discontinued.</li>
            <li> the BEST body lotion I have EVER used. I order over and over again. They sell this at the tanning salon for $38. Even when I&#x27;m not tanning I use this. My skin drinks it. It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how it makes skin soft</li>
            <li> Love this Body Lotion ♥</li>
            <li> This is by far the most amazing lotion i have ever had it works GREAT! not oily at all it makes your skin healthy the more you use it i have a glow . i have been using this for about 2 weeks and i will never go back to any other lotion.. oh and it does make your tan last longer but i would use this even if i was tanning all the time. a MUST buy!</li>
            <li> There are both positive and negative things about this lotion...&lt;br /&gt;positive: It has a silky consistency because of the silicone in it which coats your skin to lock in moisture. The scent is pleasant, it has a perfume-like smell that is not overpowering and is kind of a unisex scent. The bottle is a very generous size. if your someone who wants a bronzer-free lotion, this one does not contain a bronzer and it is white in color. it makes your skin very soft and moisturized. Most importantly it seemed to extend my tan to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;negative: although the lotion goes on smooth and silky, I noticed if I rubbed the area of skin after the lotion dried, the lotion would ball up into dried up clumps on my skin and basically come off.... it was very unusual and pretty gross... Basically, before noticing this I thought the lotion was perfect but this definitely changed that.</li>
            <li> This is a good tan extender, it smells ok. I do like the way it moisterizes my skin, and feels silky to touch after use.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for after spray tanning or being out in the sun.  Makes your skin feel really soft and lasts for a long time so you don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> I really like this tan extender I use it all the time</li>
            <li> This lotion is very smooth!  Like the way it feels.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and I like that!</li>
            <li> Just an ok lotion in my opinion. I will not be ordering any more of this lotion without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I used to tan several years ago, and I remember using Enamor by Designer skin - it contained a silicone emulsion that left the skin feeling AMAZING, I&#x27;ve never had a lotion like it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer tan these days - but it does not mean that I&#x27;m not interested in having soft, smooth skin. I was very disappointed to find that Enamor had been discontinued, but after a little searching I was able to come across this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also contains a silicone emulsion that leaves the skin silky soft in ways that store brands just can&#x27;t even compete with. It contains a caffeine complex to stimulate the skin and help cellulite, and has a matte &amp;#34;airbrush&amp;#34; finish. It lasts reasonably long on the skin, and does NOT contain a bronzer. Trying to find a lotion like this that doesn&#x27;t contain a bronzer is definitely an adventure in itself, since the description does not say it quite in black and white I wanted to throw it out there that this product is in fact bronzer free. I double checked with Designer Skin (the manufacturer) prior to ordering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with it! I think Enamor smelled better in my opinion - this product has an Amber/citrus fragrance. It&#x27;s not bad or overwhelming by any means, everyone just has their own olfactory preferences. Still a highly recommended buy. Genuine product at a great price (because goodness knows I paid $40 for Enamor at the tanning salon way back when). Great deal all in all!</li>
            <li> The smell to this lotion is bland and gross, it&#x27;s not a good smell to rock.This lotion is also on the watery side I didn&#x27;t give it a chance long enough to see how it worked on my tan that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 3stars, shipping was get and on time so no problems with the sellers just not the best lotion at all, I don&#x27;t recommend to buy and i will not be Re buying this product in the future</li>
            <li> I know that this lotion is a little pricey, but it is worth every penny. It smells wonderful and leaves ur skin feeling like silk.</li>
            <li> This tan extender is WONDERFUL. It has a matte finish so it covers up any imperfections, it has caffeine to revitalize your skin, SO MANY skin care ingredients in there. It&#x27;s smell is almost like a lemongrass smell. It comes out almost as a serum. Not greasy but keeps skin soft all day! It is a MUST HAVE</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!  The only issue I had is that it was not packaged well and the lotion top was off when I opened the package. Luckily only a little had spilled.</li>
            <li> I love love this product! I seen awesome results in just one use. Your skin will have a great glow and looks fabulous in pictures!</li>
            <li> My tan has lasted longer with this lotion, i would recommend it if you have a hard time keeping your tan!</li>
