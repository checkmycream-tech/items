            <li>It is the best self tanner I have found at any price!  </li>
            <li>The best thing for me is the fact that I am allergic to alot of sunscreens.</li>

            <li>Great product, great service, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>and I did a happy dance when I put the lotion on</li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t know why, but say I look rested &amp; happy with this color.  </li>
            <li>This sun tanner from Palmers is great...</li>

            <li>Gives you nice color!</li>
            <li>Scent is pleasant without lingering or being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>Nice color, great spf protection.</li>
            <li>Will never find another product as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Good for everything from face, around eyes, to legs.</li>
            <li>Gives a good Colour.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>I was using face tanner that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference - with one application of this you will be able to tell the difference!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It smells like brown sugar, which I love!  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s kind of a given because this is a coco butter product.</li>
            <li>This really the best product on the market.</li>
            <li>I really liked the results of this tanner.</li>
            <li>and I woke up with a nice color.</li>
            <li>Wear latex gloves to apply - the kind a doctor wears, not dishwashing gloves.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells like cocoa butter and if it continues to work as it did just now, I will order many more times!</li>
            <li>Really love this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing, no funky smell, in fact it smells a bit like chocolate.</li>
            <li>This sunless tanner and bronzer works very quickly to give you a nice tanned appearance.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>so  I&#x27;d give this product more than 5 stars if I could</li>
            <li>I also love that it contains an spf of 15.</li>
            <li>This stuff is okay.</li>
            <li>$115.00 dollars???????I Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I am MADLY IN LOVE with this product.  </li>
            <li>Cheap!  </li>
            <li>Nice light moisurizer.  </li>
            <li>This is quite possibly the best self tanner regardless of price.</li>
            <li>I would pay much more for this product.</li>
            <li>The fact that you are protected from the sun and provides a healthy glow is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>the more you use it.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to have more odor that competing products.  </li>
            <li>This is the only sunless tanner lotion I have used, but it is great!</li>
            <li>I love that it has sunscreen in it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Overall excellent</li>
            <li>I love this self tanner.</li>
            <li>I was able to put on my pjs within five minutes</li>
            <li>It is very rich and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Thank you Palmers for a superior product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>it actually smells good!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The bronze makes it easy to see where it goes</li>
            <li>When on easy, no streaks.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t looked streaky.</li>
            <li>the cocoa butter formula Palmers is famous for, which gives it its more pleasant scent, instant bronzer which gives my olive toned skin more of a lovely glow than bronzing action - as well as SPF 15.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a light chocolate smell.</li>
            <li>Great product, I wish my local drug stores sold it, but thank-goodness for Amazon!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t streak too much and the smell was kind of chocolatey.</li>
            <li>As a strawberry blonde, tanning is not an intelligent option.  </li>
            <li>Great if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty light milk chocolate color</li>
            <li>Your skin is incredibly soft, to the extent that people have commented on how smooth my arms are!!</li>
            <li>The formula is very smooth and goes on very well.</li>
            <li>Amazing natural color  </li>
            <li>Of course the standard rules do still apply re: washing hands immediately and using caution when applying to feet/knees/elbows, the tint helps a lot in minimizing this though and I can safely use this twice a week without getting that dreaded orange hue most tanners give off.  </li>
            <li>Works great but does have a slight odor.</li>
            <li>To prevent wrinkles and skin cancer, I wear sunscreen regularly, and the easier a regimen, the better for me!  </li>
            <li>When I first discovered color on my white top, I was pleased to see it came out in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, when I asked salespeople for it, they were all interested!</li>
            <li>, it is definitely worth its price</li>
            <li>but it still absorbed into my cuticles on my nails</li>
            <li>I even forgot to exfoliate on the second use and the application was still nice.</li>
            <li>Color is brownish golden rather than orange.</li>
            <li>I am in my forties and fair-skinned, but I like the look of a golden tan.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful to find tanner, instant bronzer and SPF protection all in one product, however the effects of the tanner were very minimal.</li>
            <li>Sunless tanner is good, but after two weeks of using every other day i have yet to achieve the color i want.</li>
            <li>It would be five stars for me if it lasted a bit longer--but still I really like it for those times that you want to have your legs bare and you need to have them looking nice and tan in a hurry.</li>
            <li>It looks good for a day or two--then it seems to break down a bit.</li>
            <li>Love that I have an instant golden glow.  </li>
            <li>The first day I applied it it looked almost orange</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty olive to begin with.</li>
            <li>Below is my most recent review of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love how it feels on my skin especially on clean-shaven legs.  </li>
            <li>(This is a first for me.  </li>
            <li>What you are left with is a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I just received it and have used it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty affordable at any drugstore pharmacy department, if not on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels good once it is absorbed (and it has SPF, big bonus) and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner is cruelty free, so it&#x27;s not tested on animals, which is a major selling point for me.  </li>
            <li>In just the first application it darkened so much...</li>
            <li>Also, this was very liquidy and not creamy like the first time I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I was super happy, I felt like my tan looked natural, but dark enough for me and my fianc&amp;eacute; to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to see where you have applied it so that you don&#x27;t end up with streaks or white patches.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner should have a huge following.    </li>
            <li>Gently exfoliate before application.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice bronze look after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Turned my skin a yellowish hue, smells funky and rubs off more than other brands.</li>
            <li>I am going to be in the sun for a prolonged period of time, I simply apply a higher SPF regular sunscreen on top of the Palmer&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stays on top of your skin, is not absorbed readily making it look shiney and feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>Then when it dried the self tanner smell was very strong.</li>
            <li>Palmers 1 part moisturizer lotion (that makes the self tanner less potent)</li>
            <li>This one gives me incredibly soft skin and a healthy looking tan without streaks in minimal time.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I took a leap of faith based off the high reviews this product got.</li>
            <li>Normally, scented products bother me, but while this product does have an odor, it&#x27;s not offensive.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, it will get on your clothes if you try to put clothes on right after applying.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but you have to be careful not to get streaks by applying carefully.</li>
            <li>The bronzer included is more of a chocolate color than the orange often associated with a fake tan, but it&#x27;s also kind of shimmery and doesn&#x27;t quite seem to dry as it should.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair, so I can&#x27;t use something too dark as I just don&#x27;t get really dark.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I have used many sunless tanners in the past, but Palmer&#x27;s gives a natural color that isn&#x27;t at all orange or unnatural!  </li>
            <li>It does have that tanner smell once it is on and dried... but that tanner smell isn&#x27;t really strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a self-tanner that is natural looking, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li>Fast subtle color that is easy to build on.  </li>
            <li>I will contact them directly.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews before buying and they were pretty positive, maybe I have different skin type, but that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li>It rubs off quickly and makes a mess of your clothes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap that you have very little to lose....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more greasy than other brands, but I didn&#x27;t think there was an abnormally long drying time.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results of this product but was disappointed the the container was no sealed or packaged in a sealed container.    </li>
            <li>I have used this several times and can barely see ANY difference after applying it.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty pale skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Allowing the Palmer&#x27;s to dry completely before getting dressed does NOT prevent it from leaving some color on clothes.  </li>

            <li> It feels good once it is absorbed (and it has SPF, big bonus) and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner is cruelty free, so it&#x27;s not tested on animals, which is a major selling point for me.  </li>
            <li> In just the first application it darkened so much...</li>
            <li> Also, this was very liquidy and not creamy like the first time I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I was super happy, I felt like my tan looked natural, but dark enough for me and my fianc&amp;eacute; to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to see where you have applied it so that you don&#x27;t end up with streaks or white patches.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner should have a huge following.    </li>
            <li> Gently exfoliate before application.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice bronze look after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Turned my skin a yellowish hue, smells funky and rubs off more than other brands.</li>
            <li> I am going to be in the sun for a prolonged period of time, I simply apply a higher SPF regular sunscreen on top of the Palmer&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stays on top of your skin, is not absorbed readily making it look shiney and feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> Then when it dried the self tanner smell was very strong.</li>
            <li> Palmers 1 part moisturizer lotion (that makes the self tanner less potent)</li>
            <li> This one gives me incredibly soft skin and a healthy looking tan without streaks in minimal time.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I took a leap of faith based off the high reviews this product got.</li>
            <li> Normally, scented products bother me, but while this product does have an odor, it&#x27;s not offensive.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, it will get on your clothes if you try to put clothes on right after applying.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but you have to be careful not to get streaks by applying carefully.</li>
            <li> The bronzer included is more of a chocolate color than the orange often associated with a fake tan, but it&#x27;s also kind of shimmery and doesn&#x27;t quite seem to dry as it should.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair, so I can&#x27;t use something too dark as I just don&#x27;t get really dark.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I have used many sunless tanners in the past, but Palmer&#x27;s gives a natural color that isn&#x27;t at all orange or unnatural!  </li>
            <li> It does have that tanner smell once it is on and dried... but that tanner smell isn&#x27;t really strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a self-tanner that is natural looking, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Fast subtle color that is easy to build on.  </li>
            <li> I will contact them directly.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews before buying and they were pretty positive, maybe I have different skin type, but that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li> It rubs off quickly and makes a mess of your clothes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap that you have very little to lose....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more greasy than other brands, but I didn&#x27;t think there was an abnormally long drying time.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results of this product but was disappointed the the container was no sealed or packaged in a sealed container.    </li>
            <li> I have used this several times and can barely see ANY difference after applying it.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty pale skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Allowing the Palmer&#x27;s to dry completely before getting dressed does NOT prevent it from leaving some color on clothes.  </li>
            <li> The tan I get is very natural and medium dark.</li>
            <li> It actually smells pretty good and does not have that horrible self-tanner smell (hallelujah).</li>
            <li> Only things I didn&#x27;t like was the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t last for long.  </li>
            <li> Just enought to look like you&#x27;ve been in the sun for a few hours highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Apply regular moisturizer to \\&quot;tricky\\&quot; spots before application (neck, elbows, knees, ankles), and allow to dry thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> The bronzer all washes off, as expected, but then I am white underneath.  </li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner gives a natural tan without being greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s rubbed in well, there is no streaking.</li>
            <li> As with any other tanner, you need to rub in evenly and wash palms with soap following aplication.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long but does give a little color.</li>
            <li> The only negative comment is that it takes a while to dry and it will stain your clothes if not completely dry when you get dressed.</li>
            <li> As a pale white girl (I&#x27;m usually the 2nd or 3rd lightest shade when it comes to makeup foundations), I don&#x27;t like to look transparent when it&#x27;s summer time.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bothers me is that it can look a little orange at times.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my daily lotion when I used it so it doesn&#x27;t go on too heavily.</li>
            <li> As will all self tanners, I am careful to blend around knees &amp; elbows.  </li>
            <li> I will be crushed if this is ever discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It is a subtle scent that you can&#x27;t even smell unless you put your nose directly to your skin.</li>
            <li> This tanner gave me a noticeable, but natural and subtle, tan.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I agree with one of the other posters who wrote that she hopes they never stop manufacturing this!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no smell!!  </li>
            <li> It is SO subtle that it simply helps avoid streaks when blending.    </li>
            <li> I am extremely pale and it has not turned me orange or ridiculously dark.</li>
            <li> There is a mild scent of coco butter which isn’t bad compared to the others I tried.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, just one or two applications every few days works for me.</li>
            <li> I put this on, wear my bikini and work in the garden for a few hours.</li>
            <li> When it dried it looked blotchy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if some ingredient was missing.  </li>
            <li> works beautifully - no streaking, use it several times a week on my face</li>
            <li> I admit this sat in my cabinet for several weeks after I received because I was afraid to use it, but I now I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long.</li>
            <li> Bad decision for an old guy.</li>
            <li> The tan lasts about 5-7 days, applying it once a week usually keeps me looking tan!</li>
            <li> I originally gave a glowing review, but the product is now horrible.  </li>
            <li> and it is just a subtle color to start and gradually gets darker</li>
            <li> but the next day it darkened and it doesn&#x27;t look too bad.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to slather on multiple products.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed as I&#x27;d hoped I would get all the benefits of Palmers plus a little color.</li>
            <li> however even then the Palmers is so thick that it&#x27;s almost impossible for it not to streak.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have that horrible self-tanning smell that all other tanning creams seem to have.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> At this price, it would be silly to not try this product!</li>
            <li> it does smell a bit but not as bad as some products I&#x27;ve used, that&#x27;s why I rated this product 4 stars instead of 5, because of the smell.</li>
            <li> In the name of fairness, I contacted the manufacturer, Palmer, this morning about how bad this product is now.  </li>
            <li> Everything else I have tried goes bad on my skin.)  </li>
            <li> VERY Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and this is now a terrible product.  </li>
            <li> and they all smelled horrible!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product makes my legs and arms look tan. It is easy to apply and smells good. The only negative comment is that it takes a while to dry and it will stain your clothes if not completely dry when you get dressed. Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Nice product, but you have to be careful not to get streaks by applying carefully.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did&#x27;n&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it smells like cocoa when I apply it.  I will say the smell goes away and it doesn&#x27;t emit a smell later like some tanners do.  I&#x27;m fair, so I can&#x27;t use something too dark as I just don&#x27;t get really dark.  Therefore, just one or two applications every few days works for me.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried many. This one gives me incredibly soft skin and a healthy looking tan without streaks in minimal time. The added bonuses being the cocoa butter formula Palmers is famous for, which gives it its more pleasant scent, instant bronzer which gives my olive toned skin more of a lovely glow than bronzing action - as well as SPF 15.  Of course the standard rules do still apply re: washing hands immediately and using caution when applying to feet/knees/elbows, the tint helps a lot in minimizing this though and I can safely use this twice a week without getting that dreaded orange hue most tanners give off.  At the end of the day - well week - I am often complimented on my skin tone/tan and I have this stuff to thank for that so  I&#x27;d give this product more than 5 stars if I could, it is definitely worth its price and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have probably tried a dozen tanners over the years and this is the best yet. Best feature is the lack of odor. I also love that it contains an spf of 15. I put this on, wear my bikini and work in the garden for a few hours. The tan I get is very natural and medium dark. As with any other tanner, you need to rub in evenly and wash palms with soap following aplication. Thank you Palmers for a superior product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> So...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used tanning lotion before, I have only tanned in a bed and used spray tan. I took a leap of faith based off the high reviews this product got. I also use this brand as my daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a light chocolate smell. That&#x27;s kind of a given because this is a coco butter product. It does have that tanner smell once it is on and dried... but that tanner smell isn&#x27;t really strong. I have pretty pale skin and I did a happy dance when I put the lotion on, about 4-5 hours later I was looking like I lived in California again. I was super happy, I felt like my tan looked natural, but dark enough for me and my fianc&amp;eacute; to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product. I will used it all during my winter here in Seattle.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results of this product but was disappointed the the container was no sealed or packaged in a sealed container.    If not for the packaging, I would have given this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing, no funky smell, in fact it smells a bit like chocolate. Will buy again.  Great product, I wish my local drug stores sold it, but thank-goodness for Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The reviews written for this product were rave: \\&quot;best color\\&quot;, \\&quot;no streaks\\&quot;, \\&quot;no smell\\&quot;...  The color is alright. The first day I applied it it looked almost orange but the next day it darkened and it doesn&#x27;t look too bad.  I&#x27;m probably not going to wear it again.  In just the first application it darkened so much... I&#x27;m worried I&#x27;ll look like a burnt orange when the bottle is gone.  It does streak.  I mixed it 1 part Palmers 1 part moisturizer lotion (that makes the self tanner less potent) however even then the Palmers is so thick that it&#x27;s almost impossible for it not to streak.  When it dried it looked blotchy.  Also I washed my hands thoroughly but it still absorbed into my cuticles on my nails so my fingernails look orange.  It does smell like self tanner... and chocolate.  It smelled like I was rubbing chocolate syrup on me.  Then when it dried the self tanner smell was very strong.</li>
            <li> Gives you nice color!</li>
            <li> I was using face tanner that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference - with one application of this you will be able to tell the difference! It doesn&#x27;t look orange-y at all. To be used on the face or the body, but I use it on my face because I always put sunscreen on my face, making my face multiple shades lighter than my body.  it does smell a bit but not as bad as some products I&#x27;ve used, that&#x27;s why I rated this product 4 stars instead of 5, because of the smell. The tan lasts about 5-7 days, applying it once a week usually keeps me looking tan!</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Nice color, great spf protection.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty olive to begin with. No color change on my skin though.</li>
            <li> My mistake.  This product not only makes your skin darker, it makes your age spots darker than that.  Bad decision for an old guy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is okay. I mix it with my daily lotion when I used it so it doesn&#x27;t go on too heavily. It didn&#x27;t streak too much and the smell was kind of chocolatey. It was okay, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because it wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> The best sunless tanner I have ever used. Very natural looking. I only use on my face and get compliments all the time! People constantly ask if I have been on vacation recently and when I say &amp;#34;No&amp;#34;, they immediately want to know what product I am using. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner out there! And the smell is amazing! Tinted makes it easier to apply and not have streaks! I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> This sunless tanner and bronzer works very quickly to give you a nice tanned appearance. It is easy to see where you have applied it so that you don&#x27;t end up with streaks or white patches. It looks good for a day or two--then it seems to break down a bit. It would be five stars for me if it lasted a bit longer--but still I really like it for those times that you want to have your legs bare and you need to have them looking nice and tan in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to use gloves to apply or it will stain. Doesn&#x27;t last long but does give a little color.</li>
            <li> Below is my most recent review of this product.  In the name of fairness, I contacted the manufacturer, Palmer, this morning about how bad this product is now.  The Product Specialist at Palmer told me the item has been DISCONTINUED.  Whatever is left of it is now being sold on Amazon.  BUYER BEWARE.  I purchased here in July 2016 and this is now a terrible product.  DO NOT BUY IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I last purchased this in July 2016 and it&#x27;s NOT the product I received before. I originally gave a glowing review, but the product is now horrible.  I have used this several times and can barely see ANY difference after applying it.  The bronzer all washes off, as expected, but then I am white underneath.  What a disappointment.  I will contact them directly.  I&#x27;m wondering if some ingredient was missing.  Also, this was very liquidy and not creamy like the first time I purchased it.  VERY Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner gives a natural tan without being greasy or heavy.  I love how it feels on my skin especially on clean-shaven legs.  I use it on my legs and arms in the summer.  The color is perfect.  I have used many sunless tanners in the past, but Palmer&#x27;s gives a natural color that isn&#x27;t at all orange or unnatural!  Normally, scented products bother me, but while this product does have an odor, it&#x27;s not offensive.  I agree with one of the other posters who wrote that she hopes they never stop manufacturing this!  And another benefit: Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner is cruelty free, so it&#x27;s not tested on animals, which is a major selling point for me.  I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> $115.00 dollars???????I Love this product.  Tried to re-order and EEEEEEK!!!!!  Will never find another product as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and I never thought I would say that about a self-tanner. I admit this sat in my cabinet for several weeks after I received because I was afraid to use it, but I now I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long. It actually smells pretty good and does not have that horrible self-tanner smell (hallelujah). It feels good once it is absorbed (and it has SPF, big bonus) and it doesn&#x27;t take long at all. Obviously, it will get on your clothes if you try to put clothes on right after applying. It is a very pretty light milk chocolate color but it doesn&#x27;t go on obvious at all. You have to keep applying to build the coverage so even if you do make some goofs they won&#x27;t be that noticeable. I am extremely pale and it has not turned me orange or ridiculously dark. I just look like I have some actual color, but I don&#x27;t use it every day. I&#x27;m thrilled to have found a self-tanner that is natural looking, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Excellent product--gives a nice even tan and moisturizing without being too tacky or sticky! Easy to use. I even forgot to exfoliate on the second use and the application was still nice. Scent is pleasant without lingering or being overpowering. I&#x27;d recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is tinted so you get an instant tan and you don&#x27;t get streaks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  The bronzer included is more of a chocolate color than the orange often associated with a fake tan, but it&#x27;s also kind of shimmery and doesn&#x27;t quite seem to dry as it should.  I&#x27;m also not a fan of the cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner should have a huge following.    I am MADLY IN LOVE with this product.  It is the best self tanner I have found at any price!  No kidding.  Here is why...  1. Amazing natural color  2. Absolutely no smell!!  (This is a first for me.  Everything else I have tried goes bad on my skin.)  3. No streaking. As will all self tanners, I am careful to blend around knees &amp; elbows.  4. Fast subtle color that is easy to build on.  5. Color lasts!  People don&#x27;t know why, but say I look rested &amp; happy with this color.  6. Cheap!  A little goes a long way.  7. Good for everything from face, around eyes, to legs. I use it on my face over my daily moisturizer &amp; still get color.   8. Has SPF!  9. Nice light moisurizer.  10. Don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;Instant bronzer\\&quot; feature scare you. It is SO subtle that it simply helps avoid streaks when blending.    I will be crushed if this is ever discontinued.  I have used self tanners since the beginning of time.  As a strawberry blonde, tanning is not an intelligent option.  TRY IT!  It&#x27;s so cheap that you have very little to lose....</li>
            <li> This is quite possibly the best self tanner regardless of price. I would pay much more for this product. The color is a bronze shade without being too orange or yellow. What you are left with is a healthy glow. Your skin is incredibly soft, to the extent that people have commented on how smooth my arms are!! Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have that horrible self-tanning smell that all other tanning creams seem to have.  The best thing for me is the fact that I am allergic to alot of sunscreens. This product comes with an SPF 15 but doesn&#x27;t cause any allergic reactions. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about applying a sunscreen that will sting my skin! The fact that you are protected from the sun and provides a healthy glow is a huge plus! At this price, it would be silly to not try this product!</li>
            <li> Great product, great service, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have tried several products...several Avon, Jergens..sprays and lotions...and they all smelled horrible!! I would try to put it on at night so that I would not stink all day. This sun tanner from Palmers is great...it actually smells good! It is a subtle scent that you can&#x27;t even smell unless you put your nose directly to your skin. The bronze makes it easy to see where it goes and it is just a subtle color to start and gradually gets darker the more you use it. This really the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> works beautifully - no streaking, use it several times a week on my face</li>
            <li> Love that I have an instant golden glow.  Smells like cookies 🍪.</li>
            <li> Stays on top of your skin, is not absorbed readily making it look shiney and feel greasy.  It rubs off quickly and makes a mess of your clothes.  Also, it seems to have more odor that competing products.  I read other reviews before buying and they were pretty positive, maybe I have different skin type, but that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li> Works great but does have a slight odor. Otherwise great product!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunless tanner lotion I have used, but it is great! I love that it has sunscreen in it so I don&#x27;t have to use that as well. As long as it&#x27;s rubbed in well, there is no streaking. The only thing that bothers me is that it can look a little orange at times. Smells great which is another plus!!</li>
            <li> I just received it and have used it for the first time.  It smells like cocoa butter and if it continues to work as it did just now, I will order many more times!</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs every time I go in the sun for the color as well as the SPF.  I will purchase this all summer !!!</li>
            <li> Love it. When on easy, no streaks. Gives a good Colour. Only things I didn&#x27;t like was the smell, but that doesn&#x27;t last for long.  Overall excellent</li>
            <li> Mmmm smells like chocolate buttercream frosting!</li>
            <li> The biggest problems with these sunless tanners are the smell. That can repel people. There is a mild scent of coco butter which isn’t bad compared to the others I tried.  Leaves a nice bronze look after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner. It is very rich and moisturizing. Great if you have dry skin. Color is brownish golden rather than orange.</li>
            <li> I really liked the results of this tanner. As a pale white girl (I&#x27;m usually the 2nd or 3rd lightest shade when it comes to makeup foundations), I don&#x27;t like to look transparent when it&#x27;s summer time. This tanner gave me a noticeable, but natural and subtle, tan. The formula is very smooth and goes on very well. I didn&#x27;t have any streaks. It&#x27;s a little more greasy than other brands, but I didn&#x27;t think there was an abnormally long drying time. I was able to put on my pjs within five minutes and I woke up with a nice color. The bronzer rinsed off in the shower, leaving just the tan. My friends said \\&quot;Angela, you look tan!\\&quot; But they had no idea it was fake until I told them &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Turned my skin a yellowish hue, smells funky and rubs off more than other brands. I was really disappointed as I&#x27;d hoped I would get all the benefits of Palmers plus a little color.</li>
            <li> Looks great, feels&amp; smells great! Just enought to look like you&#x27;ve been in the sun for a few hours highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to find tanner, instant bronzer and SPF protection all in one product, however the effects of the tanner were very minimal.</li>
            <li> Sunless tanner is good, but after two weeks of using every other day i have yet to achieve the color i want.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Sunless Tanner &amp; Instant Bronzer, SPF 15 is the only self tanner I use.  It smells like brown sugar, which I love!  It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t looked streaky.</li>
            <li> I am in my forties and fair-skinned, but I like the look of a golden tan.  I like the color this one gives as well as the fragrance. To prevent wrinkles and skin cancer, I wear sunscreen regularly, and the easier a regimen, the better for me!  I hate having to slather on multiple products.  Palmer&#x27;s Moisturizer, Bronzer, Self-Tanner, Sunscreen all-in-one product is genius!  To avoid the streaks that ALL bronzers can leave, I do three things:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Gently exfoliate before application.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Apply regular moisturizer to \\&quot;tricky\\&quot; spots before application (neck, elbows, knees, ankles), and allow to dry thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Wear latex gloves to apply - the kind a doctor wears, not dishwashing gloves.  These are pretty affordable at any drugstore pharmacy department, if not on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allowing the Palmer&#x27;s to dry completely before getting dressed does NOT prevent it from leaving some color on clothes.  With this in mind, I just wear darker clothes after initial application.  When I first discovered color on my white top, I was pleased to see it came out in the wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am going to be in the sun for a prolonged period of time, I simply apply a higher SPF regular sunscreen on top of the Palmer&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great value.  Through Amazon, I bought multiple tubes to have on hand, as it cannot be found at any bricks and mortar store in my local area.  But, when I asked salespeople for it, they were all interested!</li>
