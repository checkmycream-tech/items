            <li>THIS 4 PACK WAS A GREAT BARGAIN AT THE PRICE</li>
            <li>Great smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is also very nice.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is no exception, and is a very effective anti-perspirant.  </li>
            <li>Great Deal, the best part is that I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store and interact with people to buy it :-)</li>
            <li>It smells good but not overpowering, controls any odor, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li>This 4 pack is a good deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied and don&#x27;t mind using a women&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li>Love Dove!</li>
            <li>Would for sure recommend this to family and friends!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming but it is noticeable and pleasant - I&#x27;ve been asked what fragrance I was wearing, and I don&#x27;t wear perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the best thing about it is it really moisturizes, does NOT irritate at all, and I even think it helps with hair growth (I know that Dove has another line for this).</li>
            <li>Smells nice though.</li>
            <li>Great price and a nice light fragrance</li>
            <li>I am loving this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I finally just decided to try this deodorant and it surprisingly has worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>First of all, this deodorant smells so good!</li>
            <li>Great on my skin and makes me armpit smell fresh! :)</li>
            <li>Nice and refreshing..</li>
            <li>This deoderant smells very nice, but for me it doesn&#x27;t deliver the kind of protection I need for hot, humid summer days in the Northeast.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply on and the smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li>(most people would love it).</li>
            <li>The smell is really appealing also.</li>
            <li>Dove deodorant is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>I love this \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of dove deoderant -</li>

            <li>But I don&#x27;t love the consistency of it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still an ok product.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love smelling Dove products.</li>
            <li>and I am certainly glad that I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the times I buy as many as I can when I find it on sale at the grocery</li>
            <li>Like most people, I do sweat tho.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite deodorant</li>
            <li>I really like this deodorant, it smells great.</li>
            <li>Wonderful deal on the only deodorant I will use!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I switched to Dove anti-perspirant years ago and love it still.  </li>
            <li>This is cool and refreshing, with a mild, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the price is pretty dang good for a reliable product.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery &amp; good price.</li>
            <li>And the smell is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>goes on easily and works just fine.</li>
            <li>I tried the rose scented Dove and was not as happy with it as I am with the Fresh and Cool Essential.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I got it again here at amazon.</li>
            <li>I really love how smooth and irritation free it leaves my skin, even RIGHT after shaving.</li>
            <li>Very clean and fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I was originally using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it smells so clean and fresh!  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost all brands of deodorant and this Dove Ultimate is by far the best I have used.</li>
            <li>This scent is really nice, it&#x27;s my favorite and the only one that I use since discovering it.</li>
            <li>also love the solid, although I have to be honest</li>
            <li>Always loved Dove deodorant but when Ultimate came out I was excited to try it since it was suppose to stop irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li>this product keeps me cool and feeling clean no matter what the day&#x27;s activity are,</li>
            <li>just love the fresh, crisp smell of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Maybe its just because I put so much on, but I&#x27;d rather have the stain than be smelly :)</li>
            <li>The scent is so nice and fresh - very clean and spring-y, but this disappears almost instantly.</li>
            <li>By the end of my day, I still felt and smelled fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>VERY gentle and smooth.</li>
            <li>this stick can normally last me 2-3 weeks... which is pretty dang good</li>
            <li>After all, nothing is more embarrassing than having to scratch your armpits in public :) haha.</li>
            <li>smells nice when i put it on, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>It works BETTER than any other product I&#x27;ve used before and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t get allergic easily but I am not going well with this product.</li>
            <li>Even in the high humidity and heat of east Texas combined with a day full of chasing dogs and horses around</li>
            <li>B001FB5HJC Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Power Gel, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 2.25 oz</li>
            <li>Makes my underarms soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I first got this deodorant because it came in a four pack at Costco.</li>
            <li>Love this product a lot and will definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I purchased, and received the item in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast !</li>
            <li>The body soap, body wash, facial cleanser, toner, and deodorants - I&#x27;ve always been pleased.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for like 6 years now, it never failed me.</li>
            <li>online for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The cool essentials line is new to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll just melt right off when you sweat too much.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the good reviews from other users and because I love the smell of the other Dove products in the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>last date it was supposed to ship, I was made aware) to a scent that, while it smells good, is not what I wanted or even my second choice in scents that Dove carries.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and love how it keeps me fresh and dry all day long!</li>
            <li>I found it much more effective than Secret.</li>
            <li>This is the only deodorant that is good for my body, and it smells very fresh and natural, and lasts long as promised.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast, its exactly what I asked for, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li>They all smell simple: fresh and clean, and don&#x27;t compete with my perfume.</li>
            <li>Leaves little stain but thu, I will continue to use smoth, protects, and nice smell.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really protects me....</li>
            <li>considering how much I put on.</li>
            <li>It really does have a sort of \\&quot;cooling\\&quot;, soothing effect.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed, this is the only deodorant I use and will search for it.</li>
            <li>Like the original Dove deodorant, this goes on smooth and dry, and in a nice thin coat.</li>
            <li>I had used the normal Dove Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant, Invisible Solid, Original Clean for years before I finally made the switch to this product..</li>
            <li>This is my favorite deodorant, I have been using it for years now and it never let me down.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Dove products have a well-deserved reputation for being of high quality.  </li>
            <li>I figured it would smell nice and work like any other deodorant or anti-perspirant on the market, no big deal.</li>
            <li>A FRESH CUT CUCUMBER &amp; IT DOES ITS JOB OF KEEPING ME DRY UNDER HIGH STRESS SITUATIONS.</li>
            <li>It keeps me fresh and dry even when I am sweating in 112 degree temps in the south this summer.</li>
            <li>It is also very soft on the skin, and does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant Stick, Apricot, 2.25-Ounce Stick (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li>As such, it may have lasted 2 whole hours if I just sat still in an air conditioned environment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a person who really needs a deodorant, i.e., on occasions when I rush out having forgotten to put it on, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I have rather sensitive skin and some deodorants</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for about a year with a layer of the sensitive skin deodorant underneath.  </li>
            <li>I like the soft underarms I have</li>
            <li>I mean how many people go 2 days without showering/bathing?</li>
            <li>Every once in a while, I get a white mark on a black shirt, but it&#x27;s nothing that I haven&#x27;t experienced with every single other product out there.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, subtle and fress.  </li>
            <li>It is the only deodorant that I will use now as it makes me feel fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>I am a male with VERY sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Every time I used it, before long I began to feel really itchy and had to wash it off, then I felt alright again.</li>
            <li>Price was comparative but mostly just tired of not finding the dove sensitive skin in store so ordered both here.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive armpits (especially after shaving, which I do every 2-3 days) and this product always helps with my irritation.</li>
            <li>I used this deodorant for years and didn&#x27;t think much about it until I switched to a new type a few weeks ago --</li>
            <li>I only use this brand and no other, I found something I like</li>
            <li>The Dove does cost more than other brands which at first glance is a negative, but then again in the long run I&#x27;m using less of it</li>

            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s not for hardcore sport or heavy summer sweating.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> It keeps me dry all day long as other brands would konk out half way during the day.</li>
            <li> I do now what I did then, which is not push the cap on all the way down.</li>

            <li> if you are even a little active, the scent is non-existent and you will sweat.</li>
            <li> I had this experience and it was not pleasant having white stuff dripping down your armpit.</li>
            <li> so having to choose between smelling like fake flowers or baby powder every time I chose a new one...</li>
            <li> I bought this scent because I heard that green tea and cucumber helps with odor.  </li>

            <li> This one leave a lot behind</li>

            <li> I am a male with VERY sensitive skin! I was originally using [[ASIN:B001FB5OAO Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Deodorant Stick, Apricot, 2.25-Ounce Stick (Pack of 6)]] but it was irritating my skin and wasn&#x27;t really helping control the body odor smell. I also tried [[ASIN:B001FB5HJC Mitchum Anti-Perspirant &amp; Deodorant, Power Gel, Sensitive Skin, Fragrance Free, 2.25 oz (Pack of 6)]] but the odor protection just wasn&#x27;t that great and it left my armpits feeling dry. I finally just decided to try this deodorant and it surprisingly has worked wonderfully. It smells good but not overpowering, controls any odor, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or leave marks on my clothes. I&#x27;m very satisfied and don&#x27;t mind using a women&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
            <li> Makes my underarms soft and smooth. The scent is also very nice. I only use this brand and no other, I found something I like and I won&#x27;t use anything else. I have stocked-up</li>
            <li> I first got this deodorant because it came in a four pack at Costco. I couldn&#x27;t smell it then. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the cucumber scents, but this is alright (most people would love it). But the best thing about it is it really moisturizes, does NOT irritate at all, and I even think it helps with hair growth (I know that Dove has another line for this). I liked it so much that I got it again here at amazon. I really love how smooth and irritation free it leaves my skin, even RIGHT after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all brands of deodorant and this Dove Ultimate is by far the best I have used. It keeps me dry all day long as other brands would konk out half way during the day. The smell is really appealing also. I put some on today at 8 am and it is now 6:50 and it seems like I just applied it! Great price too especially if you have amazon prime.</li>
            <li> I bought this scent because I heard that green tea and cucumber helps with odor.  When I tried this deodorant, I was smelling something fishy.  The scent is overpowering and when it wears of, it smells so terrible.  Didn&#x27;t help with keeping sweat at bay either.  So sweat+odor&#x3D;very embarrassing moments in public and by myself!  Threw this deodorant away and will never try Dove again.  Also, they test on animals, how terrible!!!</li>
            <li> This deoderant smells very nice, but for me it doesn&#x27;t deliver the kind of protection I need for hot, humid summer days in the Northeast. But for cooler weather, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Dove deodorant is my favorite brand. I&#x27;m an athlete, so I need sweat control. Dove is the best of any deodorant I&#x27;ve tried, and it also smells great! I have really sensitive skin and allergies, so I hate heavy scents. This is cool and refreshing, with a mild, pleasant scent. I found it much more effective than Secret. It&#x27;s not sticky at all, and lasts all day. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Ended up getting this because didn&#x27;t get to check out the prices before it shipped. The price had been raised since before</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews from other users and because I love the smell of the other Dove products in the cucumber scent. I figured it would smell nice and work like any other deodorant or anti-perspirant on the market, no big deal. It works BETTER than any other product I&#x27;ve used before and it smells fantastic! No greasy feeling when you apply it, no marks at all on your clothes after you apply it, it goes on dry and stays that way. Even in the high humidity and heat of east Texas combined with a day full of chasing dogs and horses around I did not find I had to reapply three or fours into my day. By the end of my day, I still felt and smelled fresh and clean. The Dove does cost more than other brands which at first glance is a negative, but then again in the long run I&#x27;m using less of it so it&#x27;s a wash. (pun intended.)</li>
            <li> VERY gentle and smooth. Easy to apply on and the smell is just amazing. Very clean and fresh scent. The only downside is that it&#x27;s not for hardcore sport or heavy summer sweating. It&#x27;ll just melt right off when you sweat too much. You have to reapply a lot every few hour sometimes even 30 minutes. I had this experience and it was not pleasant having white stuff dripping down your armpit.</li>
            <li> I love this \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; of dove deoderant - it smells so clean and fresh!  The subscribe &amp; save is a great option!  Fast delivery &amp; good price.</li>
            <li> Great on my skin and makes me armpit smell fresh! :)</li>
            <li> This lasted about an hour. I work for a living as a paramedic. As such, it may have lasted 2 whole hours if I just sat still in an air conditioned environment. But as a deodorant/antiperspirant, utter failure. Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> Nice and refreshing..</li>
            <li> I tried a few times. Every time I used it, before long I began to feel really itchy and had to wash it off, then I felt alright again. Normally I don&#x27;t get allergic easily but I am not going well with this product. Definitely in my blacklist. And the smell is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> Always loved Dove deodorant but when Ultimate came out I was excited to try it since it was suppose to stop irritation after shaving. I was not disappointed, this is the only deodorant I use and will search for it. Love this product a lot and will definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.... It really protects me....in my active and busy life style. I ran out of it one day and used another brand I had on hand and what a difference....I did not have the protection I needed that day... When I got home I trashed it... And have not used another brand since..&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy that this cucumber scent does  not clash with my perfume fragrance....this product keeps me cool and feeling clean no matter what the day&#x27;s activity are, I&#x27;m assured that I am protected!!!</li>
            <li> I love Dove Deodorant. This scent is really nice, it&#x27;s my favorite and the only one that I use since discovering it. This 4 pack is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I like it&amp;#34; bit I don&#x27;t love it. I like the scent because the use the soap as well. But I don&#x27;t love the consistency of it. With with original it goes on and does leave too much of a white powder behind.  This one leave a lot behind but it&#x27;s still an ok product.</li>
            <li> Bought this Deodorant in bulk because Im going out of the country on a long trip. It was delivered fast, its exactly what I asked for, so no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Great price and a nice light fragrance</li>
            <li> This deodorant is for women who sit at home or the office all day and never have to lift a finger. if you are even a little active, the scent is non-existent and you will sweat.</li>
            <li> but, wish it came in all the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34;, had to settle for this one and not the scent I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great Deal, the best part is that I didn&#x27;t have to go to the store and interact with people to buy it :-)</li>
            <li> I love, love, love smelling Dove products. They all smell simple: fresh and clean, and don&#x27;t compete with my perfume. I had used the normal Dove Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant, Invisible Solid, Original Clean for years before I finally made the switch to this product.. and I am certainly glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love the fresh, crisp smell of this deodorant. I have sensitive armpits (especially after shaving, which I do every 2-3 days) and this product always helps with my irritation. After all, nothing is more embarrassing than having to scratch your armpits in public :) haha. And being that I do not \\&quot;apply sparingly\\&quot; (I have a ritual of putting it on each armpit for 10 seconds, and then repeating) this stick can normally last me 2-3 weeks... which is pretty dang good considering how much I put on. Not to mention the price is pretty dang good for a reliable product. Most of the times I buy as many as I can when I find it on sale at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the solid, although I have to be honest it still shows up on clothing. I apply my deodorant with my shirt on, normally just pulling down my collar and reaching in, so of course I never get it on the sides of my clothing... but it still shows up in the armpit of the shirt when I take it off. Maybe its just because I put so much on, but I&#x27;d rather have the stain than be smelly :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that is good for my body, and it smells very fresh and natural, and lasts long as promised. That&#x27;s why I keep buying it in quantities.</li>
            <li> great price great delivery excellent smell i never tried the dove deodorant but i see it get great stars so we will see</li>
            <li> I cannot find this for the price I just paid for it. I have been using Dove for over 12 years now and it was recommended to me by my doctor.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I purchased, and received the item in a timely fashion.  I would purchase this item again</li>
            <li> Love Dove! Love the scent and love how it keeps me fresh and dry all day long! Would for sure recommend this to family and friends!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast !&lt;br /&gt;lasts long !&lt;br /&gt;definetly recommend 😊</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove products forever. The body soap, body wash, facial cleanser, toner, and deodorants - I&#x27;ve always been pleased. The cool essentials line is new to me. When I saw the Cucumber &amp; Green Tea scent (and on sale) I had to try it. I LOVE this! Like the original Dove deodorant, this goes on smooth and dry, and in a nice thin coat. The scent is so nice and fresh - very clean and spring-y, but this disappears almost instantly. I&#x27;m not a person who really needs a deodorant, i.e., on occasions when I rush out having forgotten to put it on, it&#x27;s not a big deal. Like most people, I do sweat tho. This takes care of that, without a heavy artificial scent. I feel like I have nothing on at all. It says, &#x27;48 h&#x27; on it which is weird to me. I mean how many people go 2 days without showering/bathing? ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative - it does annoy me that the cap is SO tight on the stick that I have to really struggle to take it off. I remember the same thing with another Dove deodorant. I do now what I did then, which is not push the cap on all the way down. That&#x27;s annoying. If this is a pattern I will edit this review. Got a pack of 5 on sale at Costco for $3 off $13.99.</li>
            <li> Dove products have a well-deserved reputation for being of high quality.  This deodorant is no exception, and is a very effective anti-perspirant.  The cucumber scent is a little stronger than I&#x27;d like, but that&#x27;s the only drawback.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  been using it for years.  smells nice when i put it on, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last so i&#x27;m not smelling of cucumber all day.  goes on easily and works just fine.</li>
            <li> I am a foo foo type of gal and usually go for the floral in deodorant or perfume. I tried the rose scented Dove and was not as happy with it as I am with the Fresh and Cool Essential. It is the only deodorant that I will use now as it makes me feel fresh all day long. The scent does not interfere with my perfume as you might think it would as it is not strong in odor. It keeps me fresh and dry even when I am sweating in 112 degree temps in the south this summer. I apply it after a shower at night and again in the morning. I even have it in the travel size to put in my purse when I am traveling overseas and not able to shower as often as when I am home.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant and I would have absolutely no complaints if I had known when I ordered this product that the scent I had wanted was on back order. Not knowing that, I ended up having to change my order at the last minute(the last date it was supposed to ship, I was made aware) to a scent that, while it smells good, is not what I wanted or even my second choice in scents that Dove carries.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, subtle and fress.  It is also very soft on the skin, and does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The best of Dove products in the collection of stick deodorants. I have been using it for like 6 years now, it never failed me. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> Contiuous user for this type of deodorant. Leaves little stain but thu, I will continue to use smoth, protects, and nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite deodorant, I have been using it for years now and it never let me down. The price here on Amazon is just unbeatable. I recommend you to buy it!</li>
            <li> First of all, this deodorant smells so good! I was so tired so having to choose between smelling like fake flowers or baby powder every time I chose a new one...this is just perfect. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming but it is noticeable and pleasant - I&#x27;ve been asked what fragrance I was wearing, and I don&#x27;t wear perfume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff also feels great. I have rather sensitive skin and some deodorants make my underarms burn if I put them on after shaving. Not this one! It really does have a sort of \\&quot;cooling\\&quot;, soothing effect. Every once in a while, I get a white mark on a black shirt, but it&#x27;s nothing that I haven&#x27;t experienced with every single other product out there. I&#x27;ve got several of these stocked up in case they stop making them - I don&#x27;t plan on ever using a different deodorant! Definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> i am a male and only use this deo. Its the best!</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, it smells great. Was going to buy from here but the price jumped from $12 to $20 in a day! Now it&#x27;s cheaper in store!</li>
            <li> As expected.  I have used this deodorant for about a year with a layer of the sensitive skin deodorant underneath.  No problems.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered online for the first time.  Price was comparative but mostly just tired of not finding the dove sensitive skin in store so ordered both here.</li>
            <li> AND THE CUCUMBER SCENT IS NO EXCEPTION. IT&#x27;S SMELLS JUST LIKE A FRESH CUT CUCUMBER &amp; IT DOES ITS JOB OF KEEPING ME DRY UNDER HIGH STRESS SITUATIONS. THIS 4 PACK WAS A GREAT BARGAIN AT THE PRICE I CAUGHT IT AT.  ..QUICKLY DELIVERED + IN PRISTINE CONDITION.</li>
            <li> Great smell. I am loving this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Wonderful deal on the only deodorant I will use!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it feels on my skin.  Hate the way it gets tacky and builds up in the armpits of my clothes.  I used this deodorant for years and didn&#x27;t think much about it until I switched to a new type a few weeks ago -- now I will probably never go back to Dove.</li>
            <li> I switched to Dove anti-perspirant years ago and love it still.  I like the soft underarms I have and there is no residue on my clothes.</li>
