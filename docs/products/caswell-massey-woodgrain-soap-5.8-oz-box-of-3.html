            <li>and he&#x27;s always more than pleased.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it, by my father</li>
            <li>sure does.</li>
            <li>The smell is fragrant w/o overpowering- our skin is smooth an the product lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>So glad he uses it.</li>
            <li>Nice Mild soap smell.</li>
            <li>Really nice soap - smells great &amp; lasts darned near forever - it&#x27;s also pretty in the soap dish</li>
            <li>He was happy to see &amp;#34;an old friend.&amp;#34;  These soaps make great gifts for men and teenage boys.  </li>
            <li>I make my own soap which is much better than most commercial soaps, but this soap is even better than my handmade soaps.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Bee &amp; Flower Sandalwood soap bars as they have more of a sandalwood fragrance, and no artificial coloring agent.</li>
            <li>Smells GREAT and lasts a LONG time.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is intense and may put you off at first, but it is so nice</li>
            <li>Great product, not much else to say.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is good but lasts a very short time both during a shower and afterwards.</li>
            <li>Delivery was within the scheduled time; packing was appropriate; and the general form, fit, and function of the product was as described.</li>
            <li>A huge bar of sandlewood goodness with a very generous suds profile.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>Nice soap, different than your regular sandalwood scent, but nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Great scent, great lather, long lasting product compared to other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Well I actually purchased this for Christmas, but I can say without a doubt, my husband will love it.  </li>
            <li>real sandal wood, smooth, remembers Indian smells, remembers my young age, when my mother used sandal wood smell for everything</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s makes a good lather and will be long lasting.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous scent, long lasting, and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>The soap is harder than many cheaper kinds of soap.</li>
            <li>I really like these Caswell-Massey products.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin and the whole bathroom smell of sandalwood</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be put off by the cost - this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Unique soap fragrances and quality above all else sets these products apart.</li>
            <li>Subtle, softening, rich and lovely.</li>
            <li>Also good to know that they are a small American business with a long and prominent history.</li>
            <li>alternate with the newport depending on my mood and follow with the shampoo, shave soap, shave oil, body lotion, and cologne for an all over, masculine, yet subdued fragrance that I enjoy without imposing on others.  </li>
            <li>One quick search later</li>
            <li>The luxury of highly milled soaps is not overlooked by my wife.</li>
            <li>Many compliments and they last a really long time.</li>
            <li>Caswell-Massey is my new source for bathroom products from shower and shave to lotion and cologne.  </li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is one of our favorite scents; masculine but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I never liked sandalwood scented products until I bought this soap, but I LOVE this one.</li>
            <li>So, again, it&#x27;s a good soap, in that respect, but it unfortunately is to drying to me.</li>
            <li>These large bars last me close to 4 weeks with daily showering and do not melt away like drug store soap bars do.  </li>

            <li> and it lasts a fairly long time as soap goes.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> last close to forever due to its hardness - no chance of turning into a puddle of gummy goo anytime soon.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can think of about this soap (the woodgrain bar) is that it will permanently stain light-colored or white washcloths.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and have to be very careful about anything I put on my body.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this soap is so hard milled it will last for months.</li>
            <li> The pants cross member is flimsy and difficult to adjust.  </li>
            <li> Also they seem to use an artificial red coloring in the soap which darkens the wash cloth and the water...</li>
            <li> but it slowly dissappears.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood fragrance is weak.  </li>
            <li> I discovered it in a soap shop in San Francisco and was unable to find it online after I moved to LA.</li>
            <li> Just wrong.  </li>
            <li> So I know unhappy, damaged skin.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day. He loves the smell of sandalwood. This soap is wonderful. It lathers well et has stood up to a lot of showers already.</li>
            <li> Great Service.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and I love using this soap. It smells great. It smells warm and spicy, not flowery. The soap is harder than many cheaper kinds of soap. I make my own soap which is much better than most commercial soaps, but this soap is even better than my handmade soaps. The only negative thing I can think of about this soap (the woodgrain bar) is that it will permanently stain light-colored or white washcloths. I never liked sandalwood scented products until I bought this soap, but I LOVE this one. The rest of the C-M sandalwood line is also wonderful, especially the lotion and the talc.</li>
            <li> This soap lasts much longer than the common bars of soap found on the shelves. My wife has given me many compliments on my pleasant aroma after a shower.</li>
            <li> Bought this before.  It&#x27;s okay.  Sandalwood fragrance is weak.  Also they seem to use an artificial red coloring in the soap which darkens the wash cloth and the water...but does&#x27;t leave a permanent stain.  I prefer the Bee &amp; Flower Sandalwood soap bars as they have more of a sandalwood fragrance, and no artificial coloring agent.</li>
            <li> Great scent, great lather, long lasting product compared to other soaps I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Caswell-Massey is my new source for bathroom products from shower and shave to lotion and cologne.  The sandalwood soap smells wonderful without being overpowering or girly.  These large bars last me close to 4 weeks with daily showering and do not melt away like drug store soap bars do.  I find it a better and cheaper alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate with the newport depending on my mood and follow with the shampoo, shave soap, shave oil, body lotion, and cologne for an all over, masculine, yet subdued fragrance that I enjoy without imposing on others.  It leaves my bathroom smelling manly after a shower &amp; shave without \\&quot;perfuming\\&quot; the bathroom permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get complements from my kids when they hug me or snuggle up that I, \\&quot;smell good.\\&quot;  I remember how my dad smelled when I was a kid and take pride in passing on those staple childhood memories to my children.</li>
            <li> I really like these Caswell-Massey products. Unique soap fragrances and quality above all else sets these products apart. Also good to know that they are a small American business with a long and prominent history.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Great scent and it lasts a fairly long time as soap goes. It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT and lasts a LONG time.  Can&#x27;t wait to give some as a gift to my Son.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever - my wife calls me princess now yet she loves the smell</li>
            <li> This is a very good sandalwood soap but to me it is more drying than anticipated. The fragrance is good but lasts a very short time both during a shower and afterwards. So, again, it&#x27;s a good soap, in that respect, but it unfortunately is to drying to me.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous scent, long lasting, and gentle on the skin. Recommended.</li>
            <li> These soaps are wonderful.  I have purchase this product twice and will again.  The soaps are long-lasting, with an amazing, understated yet noticeable scent which lasts throughout the day.  A great gift for the man in your life.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend as a gift, as he said it is his favorite soap.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> I am a cancer/radiation/chemo survivor. So I know unhappy, damaged skin. I LOVE this stuff. It is soothing and it moisturizers nicely. My husband uses it and I have introduced a number of friends to this product.</li>
            <li> The best soap. Lasts for months. Didnt use sparingly. Gave 2 away. Friends loved it. One of them kept his on the counter in the plastic. He says its the best bathroom air freshener he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin and the whole bathroom smell of sandalwood</li>
            <li> I used this soap years ago and loved it. I discovered it in a soap shop in San Francisco and was unable to find it online after I moved to LA. Then it dawned on me - the soap looks like wood! One quick search later and I found this amazing soap again. Seriously, this soap is so hard milled it will last for months. The aroma is intense and may put you off at first, but it is so nice I think you&#x27;ll adjust just like I did. Don&#x27;t be put off by the cost - this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My husband smells yummy!</li>
            <li> Really nice soap - smells great &amp; lasts darned near forever - it&#x27;s also pretty in the soap dish</li>
            <li> Nice Mild soap smell.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  Smells wonderful.  Lathers nicely.  Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> real sandal wood, smooth, remembers Indian smells, remembers my young age, when my mother used sandal wood smell for everything</li>
            <li> No.  Just wrong.  Maybe for the beach but not for the office or board room.  Seek farther...</li>
            <li> The pants cross member is flimsy and difficult to adjust.  I will not order these the next time.  This is not a substantial hanger</li>
            <li> A huge bar of sandlewood goodness with a very generous suds profile. Acts&#x27; like a liquid in that regard!&lt;br /&gt;Should last close to forever due to its hardness - no chance of turning into a puddle of gummy goo anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband.  He loves big cakes of soap with a spicy scent.  This soap is perfect</li>
            <li> Caswell-Massey makes an excellent soap.  Their exotic scents are wonderful and bring back memories and visions of travel and adventure.</li>
            <li> We used to buy these soaps for my husband when we lived in West Palm Beach.  Since moving to Georgia 6 years ago, we haven&#x27;t seen them to purchase.  I was so glad when I saw them on Amazon.  I purchased a box and gave them to my husband for Christmas.  He was happy to see &amp;#34;an old friend.&amp;#34;  These soaps make great gifts for men and teenage boys.  They come in a box of three.  They are individually wrapped so if you want to give them as gifts to three different people that works.  We love the scent of sandalwood.  The soap is very attractive with its glossy finish that looks like polished wood.</li>
            <li> Well I actually purchased this for Christmas, but I can say without a doubt, my husband will love it.  I have been purchasing Caswell-Massey soaps for him for years and he&#x27;s always more than pleased.  Sandalwood is one of our favorite scents; masculine but not overwhelming.  I love the smell of this soap!</li>
            <li> Gosh! Perfect scent for a man or woman! I bought this for my brother. Now I want one for myself! I will never use a different bar of soap! Utterly perfect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, by my father sure does. Nice to be able to purchase online.</li>
            <li> Given to us as a gift. The smell is fragrant w/o overpowering- our skin is smooth an the product lathers nicely.  I find My shower more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> The luxury of highly milled soaps is not overlooked by my wife. She was extremely happy to receive this as a gift and the milled quality of the soap will continue to delight her for many, many months to come.</li>
            <li> This soap does well.  It&#x27;s makes a good lather and will be long lasting. It&#x27;s attractive in the soap dish. The scent, however, is not as strong or as delicious at Roger &amp; Gallet.</li>
            <li> Subtle, softening, rich and lovely. Many compliments and they last a really long time. Scent is perfect for close quarters and both sexes.</li>
            <li> Very good soap! The best I have found yet! Worth the price</li>
            <li> Nice soap, different than your regular sandalwood scent, but nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li> My husband received these soaps for Christmas and he loves them. The smell is a little&lt;br /&gt;strong in the bath but it slowly dissappears. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> This soap set was for my husband. But I just love it!  It smells wonderful.  So glad he uses it.</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive skin...but I&#x27;ve heard good things about this soap. I have psoriasis and have to be very careful about anything I put on my body. Does anyone have a chemical sensitivity and or psoriasis that has used this soap?</li>
            <li> A great bar of soap and fast service!</li>
            <li> Delivery was within the scheduled time; packing was appropriate; and the general form, fit, and function of the product was as described.</li>
            <li> Many compliments on the fragrance from the ladies!</li>
            <li> Great product, not much else to say.</li>
            <li> If you want a &#x27;squeaky-clean&#x27; wash and to smell good all day, then use this soap!  Long-lasting manly fragrance.  As always, Caswell-Massey puts out a superior product.</li>
