    <ol>
            <li>This is an awesome product.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Dermalogica is an amazing skin care line...</li>
            <li>and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I will probably try another bottle of it just to see, but if I don&#x27;t see any improvement, then I will for sure discontinue since it&#x27;s so pricey.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>it works better for others.</li>
            <li>But otherwise it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>And Did reduce fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Have a fair skin that is not dramatically sensitive but ended up with both eyes swollen just about shut for 3 days.</li>
            <li>I can pass for 35 right now, but I&#x27;ve noticed more bagging under the eyes and bought this product.</li>
            <li>While I very much like most of Dermalogica&#x27;s product&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most of the way through my first container of this stuff</li>
            <li>I havent noticed significant changes or results just yet</li>
            <li>I use it with the Super Rich Repair creme.</li>
            <li>Using this, in conjunction with a good retinol solution, SkinMedica vitamin C and E complex and a nice lotion (I use Dermalogica Skin Smoothing), my skin is drastically improved.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li>It completely eradicates the fine lines and crepe texture under my eyes, reduces smile lines and brightens each area where it is applied.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it did nothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that fine lines are less noticeable and skin is softer and more</li>
            <li>and I have good skin with few wrinkles because my skin has always been oily and - well -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good product like the rest of the Demelogica product, still under monitoring.</li>
            <li>pure night lightening cream&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks, once again, Dermalogica.</li>
            <li>I did not fine the results of using this product as effective or pleasing.  </li>
            <li>am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a long while and that is why I am getting fresh stock to replenish my beauty cabinet.</li>
            <li>You only need a little mixed with your moisturizer and it lasts six months or more!</li>
            <li>I realize that different products work differently for each person, but for me, this product takes years off of my face from the very first application.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>But the main thing is the powder is such a pain to apply.</li>
            <li>It put elasticity back in my 44 year old Florida tanned skin.  </li>
            <li>Very costly for minimal benefit.&lt;br</li>

            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t give dramatic or specific, distinct results in my daily skincare. I will probably not purchase again. The texture (a powder) is messy. Don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLDER REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them. After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone. All these issues have been satisfactorily addressed. Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Wash with DM essential cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;DM oil control lotion&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum&lt;br /&gt;Either DM dynamic skin recovery moisteurizer or DM active moist (the former if i feel a bit dry)&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;Makeup as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;DM wash&lt;br /&gt;DM daily microfoliant&lt;br /&gt;Murad and c12 serums&lt;br /&gt;DM pure night lightening cream&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week I use a DM sebum clearing mask&lt;br /&gt;Every two weeks or as needed I use a chemical peel, followed by DM power recovery masque to restore moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Map15 generator dust mixed with moisteurizer as needed but rarely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are massive. Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li> I DO NOT LIKE THIS. Firstly, it did nothing to my skin. No better, no worse. But the main thing is the powder is such a pain to apply. Whenever I put it on my forehead, no matter how carefully, it would inevitably get in my eyes slightly, and they would be irritated for hours. I did mix it in my hand with my face lotion, but again, my skin was no different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product a few times, I mix it with the &amp;#34;Rich Repair&amp;#34; moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve only used it before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It looks as though you&#x27;d go through this in a month but in reality it lasts on and on. I&#x27;m using the same tube now for 10 months now and it&#x27;s still going.  I mix it with Dermalogica night serum.</li>
            <li> Brand new in box - exactly the same product I have used for years but way less expensive than purchasing in a salon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most of the way through my first container of this stuff and I&#x27;m not sure what to think of it. I mix it with the Dermalogica Multi-Vitamin Power Serum because the MAP-15 is a powder. The directions on the box say to simply apply it to your face, but it&#x27;s powder - it just falls off, so I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m missing something or not. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement to my bags or wrinkles under my eyes. I&#x27;m 49 yrs. old and I have good skin with few wrinkles because my skin has always been oily and - well - I haven&#x27;t had kids so less sleepless nights or stretched skin. I can pass for 35 right now, but I&#x27;ve noticed more bagging under the eyes and bought this product. I use a lot of Dermalogica products but this - I&#x27;m just not sure about. I will probably try another bottle of it just to see, but if I don&#x27;t see any improvement, then I will for sure discontinue since it&#x27;s so pricey.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed in conjunction with the multi. Power eye cream. Have a fair skin that is not dramatically sensitive but ended up with both eyes swollen just about shut for 3 days. Not happy. Used it as directed, sparingly, never had anything like that happen before, won&#x27;t be using it again that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Started using it last year after a facial in Jamaica while on vacation!  You only need a little mixed with your moisturizer and it lasts six months or more!</li>
            <li> Dermalogica is an amazing skin care line... You will see results if you use it faithfully!  It put elasticity back in my 44 year old Florida tanned skin.  And Did reduce fine lines.  Been using line about a month and a half... I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a good product like the rest of the Demelogica product, still under monitoring.</li>
            <li> I like but but not love it. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any real signs of those awful lines around my mouth disappearing though sometimes they look at little less obvious.</li>
            <li> The woman who does my facials has suggested this product for the past 2 years since my skin is aging. I was skeptical and it was pricey and it was to be used in addition to my moisturizer. But I finally gave in and purchased it since Amazon had it for less than the salon and it is amazing. I have noticed that fine lines are less noticeable and skin is softer and more supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I did not fine the results of using this product as effective or pleasing.  Very costly for minimal benefit.&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not recommend this product to anyone else.  While I very much like most of Dermalogica&#x27;s product&lt;br /&gt;line, this one is thumbs down for me.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works better for others.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  It took little effort to figure out how to apply the powder to the problem areas of the face until I realized that when you reach middle age, your entire face could use the help, so I mix the powder with a small amount of serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an extra boost, I will pat some of the powder on the under eye -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t make a 50 year-old look 20 again, but I have been asked by many women about what products I use on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t be shocked at the small size of the vial.  It does last longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product at a spa and HAD to have it. I realize that different products work differently for each person, but for me, this product takes years off of my face from the very first application. It completely eradicates the fine lines and crepe texture under my eyes, reduces smile lines and brightens each area where it is applied. Using this, in conjunction with a good retinol solution, SkinMedica vitamin C and E complex and a nice lotion (I use Dermalogica Skin Smoothing), my skin is drastically improved. Thanks, once again, Dermalogica.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powder. I don&#x27;t like that. But otherwise it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in the a.m. and mixing with my Derm. Active Moist.  I havent noticed significant changes or results just yet but maybe it is too soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now and truly see a difference.  I use it with the Super Rich Repair creme.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a long while and that is why I am getting fresh stock to replenish my beauty cabinet.</li>
