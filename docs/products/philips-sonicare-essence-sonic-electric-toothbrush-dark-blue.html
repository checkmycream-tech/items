            <li>I try to make sure</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>Most people know the the Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes are great....used them for years.</li>
            <li>Ive had a sonic care since they where on the market simply the best electric toothbrush out there</li>
            <li>Sonicare really does a great job keeping your teeth clean!</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a definite win for me.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Just clean it and no problems.</li>
            <li>Gives me that dentist clean feel every time I brush.</li>
            <li>Great, works just as expected</li>
            <li>Showed up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Best value of main component for your hard earned dollar.</li>
            <li>This type of elect brush is hard to get use to</li>
            <li>Love the various colors so everyone in the family can identify their toothbrush.</li>
            <li>nice color, long battery, nice small carrying case</li>
            <li>after my old toothbrush&#x27;s battery started to wane (not even lasting enough time to do a single brush), I replaced it with this, which is a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li>but i really like the timer.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>teeth feel not only clean, but polished.</li>
            <li>All other models simply have more and different features but cost more as well.</li>
            <li>Not the same as a truth brush, but contained with generally satisfied function and quality in such a price.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say except I strongly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a decently priced electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is so HIGH POWERED compared to my crest spin brush.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have gum problems.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this very Sonicare tooth brush for nearly 16 years.  </li>
            <li>I definitely think its well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this because I was paying 10 plus dollars every 6 weeks for a new toothbrush</li>
            <li>My teeth actually FEEL cleaner and my gums look much healthier since using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this brand in the past and found that they last a good long time.</li>
            <li>BUT as time has gone on since the first product came out decades ago, this has actually rested on its laurels, and instead of improving over time, the product now is okay but not great.</li>
            <li>Terrific product that I cannot live without.</li>
            <li>I bought this bare bones model through Amazon for about $35.  </li>
            <li>My teeth immediately felt cleaner and with the sensation lasting nearly the entire day.</li>

            <li> It works great.  Showed up quickly.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush but it takes getting used to. It is so HIGH POWERED compared to my crest spin brush. This was recommended by my dentist, but I Will have to ease into this. Its like its powered by a jet engine. I read the top rated review for this that talks about water getting into the mechanical part, and I did notice this. I try to make sure i dry it out each time I use it. I would recommend this because I was paying 10 plus dollars every 6 weeks for a new toothbrush and I if this lasts me 6 months at this price I will for sure be happy. I definitely think its well worth the money. Would recommend but it definitely takes getting used to.</li>
            <li> Best brush I have ever used....</li>
            <li> Yep, that&#x27;s the stuff.  About our 10th Sonicare in about 20 person-years...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this very Sonicare tooth brush for nearly 16 years.  Just love it.</li>
            <li> Best value of main component for your hard earned dollar. All other models simply have more and different features but cost more as well.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Works great, came in quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been telling everyone I know about this purchase. My teeth actually FEEL cleaner and my gums look much healthier since using this product. I&#x27;ll never go back! So worth the cost!!!</li>
            <li> I have it charged and used it few times now.  This type of elect brush is hard to get use to but i really like the timer.  I have been told very good things from friends and dentist about the success of using the sonicare.  Great price!!  Came on time and packaged well!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. It works excellent, teeth feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed not to have the sound sequence break every 30 seconds as had the earlier unit</li>
            <li> Good brush, clean teeth every day. Just clean it and no problems. Teeth are WHITER</li>
            <li> Great, works just as expected</li>
            <li> Most people know the the Phillips Sonicare toothbrushes are great....used them for years.</li>

            <li> This is a very good product for its price. The batteries work fine and the cleaning is excellent. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Gives me that dentist clean feel every time I brush.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy and noisy. Not the same as a truth brush, but contained with generally satisfied function and quality in such a price.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Sonicare really does a great job keeping your teeth clean! I have had the more expensive models in the past, but I feel like this one works just as well. It doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles, but I never really used those extra features.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes! This is the 4th one we&#x27;ve bought. Dentist wasn&#x27;t happy with our gums and wanted x-soft brushes used. They are very hard to find so we tried this. Dentist is happy, we&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> works well - miss the built-in timer earlier models have and this model doesn&#x27;t have</li>
            <li> Sonicare was recommended by my dentist so I thought I would give it a whirl. After using this brush, I am not exaggerating when I say, &amp;#34; I feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s office.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel not only clean, but polished. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has always been a good product --- and this is a Sonicare --- BUT as time has gone on since the first product came out decades ago, this has actually rested on its laurels, and instead of improving over time, the product now is okay but not great.</li>
            <li> Simple. Works amazingly. Not much else to say except I strongly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a decently priced electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Lasts for a long time before needing to be recharged. Comfortable grip design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always thought this toothbrush was too expensive, because I&#x27;d often seen them advertised to $80 or more.  I bought this bare bones model through Amazon for about $35.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with its performance.  I can feel it is helping relieve my gingivitis after only one month of use.  For me, it will pay itself off in reduced dental cleanings bills almost immediately.  I highly recommend this product if you have gum problems.  I&#x27;ve been flossing once day for years prior, but nothing to date has helped my inflamed/bleeding and receding gums like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Was stolen from my mail box. Amazon refunded my money and I went to target and bought another one. Best brush ever! Cuts my dentist visits in half</li>
            <li> I really like it.  My teeth immediately felt cleaner and with the sensation lasting nearly the entire day.</li>
            <li> nice color, long battery, nice small carrying case</li>
            <li> A very good buy for a good solid product that just does the job without all the bells and whistles.  I&#x27;ve owned this brand in the past and found that they last a good long time.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended getting the Sonicare after noticing some potential gum issues. Within a week of getting Sonicare I was back at her office for a different issue and she said she could already see improvement in my teeth! It&#x27;s a definite win for me.</li>
            <li> A gift that was well received by the recipient.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  I am just getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Nice price.</li>
            <li> Best Brush for the price</li>
            <li> I like this product. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my son.  Loves these toothbrushes.  This is his third one.  Was a great price.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Terrific product that I cannot live without. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity in years and I think it&#x27;s due in part to this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned</li>
            <li> after my old toothbrush&#x27;s battery started to wane (not even lasting enough time to do a single brush), I replaced it with this, which is a perfect replacement. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Fuel injected , pop up pistons, dual exhaust thats what this toothbrush has under the hood! I got this for my son , whom is a dentist as his broke after years of service Ive had a sonic care since they where on the market simply the best electric toothbrush out there</li>
            <li> Sucks. Not worth it. Waste of money. No noticable improvement.</li>
            <li> I started using sonicare after I started having gum problems.  I have not had a cavity in 25 years and no gum problems.  It is a wonderful way to brush your teeth.  I highly recommend it.</li>
