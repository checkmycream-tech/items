            <li>it smells really good and has good hold with great shine.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t so pleasant either - almost like beeswax.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good pomade if you&#x27;re looking for a medium hold.</li>
            <li>The hair pomade was surprising good.</li>
            <li>one of the best pomades in the market if you like these creamy light products.</li>
            <li>good price point, considering handmade and the natal ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Washes out</li>
            <li>I need a good amount for it to even hold well.</li>
            <li>This product has good hold and can re-styled throughout the day</li>
            <li>a good thing cause</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten the best hair days with this baby right here.</li>
            <li>I must say I love the smell - its a very nice peppermint fragrance that&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Works great, strong hold.</li>
            <li>has a nice minty smell to is which is a plus.</li>
            <li>A nice creamy feel to it.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, light, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a creamy substance that&#x27;s very easy to scoop out and apply on your hair.</li>
            <li>It also washes out very easily with just water which is another plus for me.</li>
            <li>good stuff, light hold</li>
            <li>But, that is kind of the case with most water based pomades</li>
            <li>So far i am impressed with this product</li>
            <li>I love this waterbased pomade.  </li>
            <li>It provides great control because it&#x27;s very waxy.</li>
            <li>what I love, is the person that shipped it</li>
            <li>Besides that, I fully recommend this pomade; its the best WB pomade I&#x27;ve currently tried.</li>
            <li>I switched to this and its incredibly better.  </li>
            <li>What more could you want .</li>
            <li>It has a great consistency, kind of like soft butter, but it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>All in all, I love this product.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product, while not terrible, is not for me.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this pomade is the smell, to me it smells like a barber shop which i love.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this pomade more.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice scent, but if you have thicker or wavier hair, there are much more useful pomades.</li>
            <li>good hold, similar to American Crew Fiber, and reworkable with water if you want to change in the day.&lt;br /&gt;Really great shine, just the right amount to look healthy and great.</li>
            <li>Better, I can get it close to the original quality of styling if I use a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hold is very mild but that&#x27;s the way I like it.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it is easy to work with as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps every hair in place and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Washes out easily.</li>
            <li>It gives great shine and fantastic hold that lasts the whole (and very hot) day - it never dries.</li>
            <li>Hands down best pomade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This pomade might be fine for a fluffier look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell is a a musky medicinal smell which is manly and fine.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it&#x27;s pretty easy to apply and kept my hair in place all day, even in 90Â°F with high humidity.</li>
            <li>Overall, the standout points for this product are is the great herbal smell, and creamy smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Great product and its American made.  </li>
            <li>Plus it gives a medium to light hold.</li>
            <li>but i haven&#x27;t used it enough just yet to give a very acute review on how it holds up to all day use.</li>
            <li>Travel size is great, love the large opening despite the smaller size.</li>
            <li>I love the way the product feels when you first put it in your hair, the way it tingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With Teddy Boy Original, the downsides to a water based product are substantially diminished though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Boy Original opened my eyes to what is out there.</li>
            <li>The thing is, in order for me to get the most out of this pomade, I first need to blowdry my hair (I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;have&amp;#34; to blowdry my hair when styling) in order to create volume and then apply this generously and evenly all throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is unique, like a cinnamon smell.</li>
            <li>Applies very easy, easy to work with and style, I love that it doesn&#x27;t ever dry, so restyling is easy.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s special &amp;#34;going out&amp;#34; pomade.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, and great overall product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve re-purchased this several times as it&#x27;s so good at what it does.  </li>
            <li>Everyone tells me how much they love my hair, but they&#x27;re not stuck with it on their head.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is by far the best water based pomade it doesn&#x27;t dry throughout the day</li>
            <li>It smells great in the container, but as it&#x27;s applied it starts to smell like shoe polish, not exactly the smell that I want on my head, but everybody is different.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>I do like the new updated look, it improves the aesthetics a lot more.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply and to wash out, and the smell is good enough but it&#x27;s barely present during the day.</li>
            <li>If you need a stronger hold you can just put some more in so unless you have super thick curly hair, you should be good with this.</li>
            <li>It caused far more frustration than the cheaper brands for my hair type and style.</li>
            <li>definitely worth it</li>
            <li>The smell is minty but not too strong and is pleasant, at least to me.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish in regard to this product, would be that they would offer a strong hold version of this as well as the original.</li>
            <li>it was soft, pliable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>which this does completely and easily.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t even wear cologne on the days I wear this product because of the really refreshing smell.</li>
            <li>Even the instructions say that you should first blowdry your hair.</li>
            <li>Most days it&#x27;s simply unmanagable.</li>
            <li>Overall excellent product, I will definitely buy it again in the larger jar.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this pomade, go right ahead and get the 4 oz jar and as long as you&#x27;re using it for what its meant, you&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
            <li>This product is a very unique water based pomade that actually seems like it never drys, but it does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice water-based pomade that deoesn&#x27;t harden unless you put too much in (even then it&#x27;s not like other WB pomades).</li>
            <li>it still washes out really easily, and I will definitely be rebuying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a water based product, which largely means that it is easy to wash out on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The Teddy Boy tends to make my hair look frizzy, even when using a large amount, which feels disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t harden like other water based products I&#x27;ve used which makes combing and restyling super easy.</li>
            <li>I have been using Suavacito regular and the hold works great, but it smells a little like dirt to me.</li>
            <li>My son really like it so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It does not work very well for me</li>
            <li>I really have never paid attention to any of that.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Not too much to say besides</li>
            <li>The smell is very manly, a mix of mint and bay rum.  </li>
            <li>The amount of shine depends on how much you put in your hair.</li>
            <li>I really prefer water based over petroleum based, because I like it to wash out of my hair,</li>
            <li>The hold was very good and you only need a very small amount to get the job done, which is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m often likely to look for the lowest price vs being brand loyal, but this pomade won me over.</li>
            <li>Your significant other will want to run their hands through your hair with this one in it ;)</li>
            <li>am glad that I bought the small size, (even though it cost as much as 4 oz of most other products).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Typically, my hair would be styled for the first 2 or 3 hours, but since I constantly fiddle with my hair, it would be trashed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>not last THE WHOLE day, depending on how much you have in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and it does a good job keeping my hair as I want it even though by the end of the day I have some curls coming back to me.</li>
            <li>I tend to go for a slick pompadour instead of a more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li>maybe improving the hold a small bit in order to create more volume and height on your hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I can definitely restyle if I so desire, and it leaves your hair feeling soft enough and great; not sticky or hard at all.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural shine to it but very natural.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait till they drop a &#x27;Firm or Super&#x27; hold!</li>
            <li>I have used plenty of hair products, and as far as the hold goes, it&#x27;s nearly non-existent.</li>
            <li>The jar is tiny and you don&#x27;t really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It is enough for me to make my hair do almost exactly what I want, but soft enough to still allow some of my hair&#x27;s natural wavy character come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not have a high shine, and had I known that I would have tried it earlier.  </li>
            <li>The smell and ingredients are great (if you&#x27;re into herbal stuff), but overall I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li>Not thick enough, shapes well</li>
            <li>Good hold but not worth the $$$ for such a small amount</li>
            <li>One of the only &#x27;Natural &amp; Water Based&#x27; pomade products out there.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is I personally have you use a relative large amount to acheive the same effect as some other products, but again, i have really unruly, voluminous hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard and stiff.</li>
            <li>I usually go for Suavecito ($2.57/oz) or Layrite ($3.44/oz), they work much better for my slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s other products out there to get more bang for your hard earned bucks.</li>
            <li>It  is still gross to the touch, it looks at least a little more natural and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Putting a larger amount of product in can help really set a style and does not give a typical greasy look.</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this pomade, go right ahead and get the 4 oz jar and as long as you&#x27;re using it for what its meant, you&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
            <li> This product is a very unique water based pomade that actually seems like it never drys, but it does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice water-based pomade that deoesn&#x27;t harden unless you put too much in (even then it&#x27;s not like other WB pomades).</li>
            <li> it still washes out really easily, and I will definitely be rebuying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a water based product, which largely means that it is easy to wash out on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The Teddy Boy tends to make my hair look frizzy, even when using a large amount, which feels disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t harden like other water based products I&#x27;ve used which makes combing and restyling super easy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Suavacito regular and the hold works great, but it smells a little like dirt to me.</li>
            <li> My son really like it so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It does not work very well for me</li>
            <li> I really have never paid attention to any of that.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Not too much to say besides</li>
            <li> The smell is very manly, a mix of mint and bay rum.  </li>
            <li> The amount of shine depends on how much you put in your hair.</li>
            <li> I really prefer water based over petroleum based, because I like it to wash out of my hair,</li>
            <li> The hold was very good and you only need a very small amount to get the job done, which is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often likely to look for the lowest price vs being brand loyal, but this pomade won me over.</li>
            <li> Your significant other will want to run their hands through your hair with this one in it ;)</li>
            <li> am glad that I bought the small size, (even though it cost as much as 4 oz of most other products).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically, my hair would be styled for the first 2 or 3 hours, but since I constantly fiddle with my hair, it would be trashed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> not last THE WHOLE day, depending on how much you have in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and it does a good job keeping my hair as I want it even though by the end of the day I have some curls coming back to me.</li>
            <li> I tend to go for a slick pompadour instead of a more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> maybe improving the hold a small bit in order to create more volume and height on your hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I can definitely restyle if I so desire, and it leaves your hair feeling soft enough and great; not sticky or hard at all.</li>
            <li> It gives a natural shine to it but very natural.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait till they drop a &#x27;Firm or Super&#x27; hold!</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of hair products, and as far as the hold goes, it&#x27;s nearly non-existent.</li>
            <li> The jar is tiny and you don&#x27;t really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It is enough for me to make my hair do almost exactly what I want, but soft enough to still allow some of my hair&#x27;s natural wavy character come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not have a high shine, and had I known that I would have tried it earlier.  </li>
            <li> The smell and ingredients are great (if you&#x27;re into herbal stuff), but overall I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not thick enough, shapes well</li>
            <li> Good hold but not worth the $$$ for such a small amount</li>
            <li> One of the only &#x27;Natural &amp; Water Based&#x27; pomade products out there.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is I personally have you use a relative large amount to acheive the same effect as some other products, but again, i have really unruly, voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard and stiff.</li>
            <li> I usually go for Suavecito ($2.57/oz) or Layrite ($3.44/oz), they work much better for my slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s other products out there to get more bang for your hard earned bucks.</li>
            <li> It  is still gross to the touch, it looks at least a little more natural and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Putting a larger amount of product in can help really set a style and does not give a typical greasy look.</li>
            <li> The container was a bit smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> holds well and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> not so much if it you have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this stuff, but I&#x27;ve gone back to other products instead.</li>
            <li> The hold/shine are respectable, it won&#x27;t give you that Mad Men look</li>
            <li> wrote a little handwritten note on the back.</li>
            <li> I wish the bigger size was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I will probably try a few other products out there, but for now, this will definitely be my go-to product.</li>
            <li> The only small complaint I have is the peppermint smell can be a little overpowering for the first few hours.</li>
            <li> my hair, compared to other pomades, this doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> very unknown</li>
            <li> When it drys it&#x27;s very oily much like a oil base and could be re-combed once or twice before the water wears off the pomade.</li>
            <li> Anything that will hold it down feels like Rubber Cement, and anything i can run my fingers through either leaves my hands sticky or doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place.</li>
            <li> It will last the entire day, keeps random hairs down too.  </li>
            <li> Typically this also comes with substantial down sides - hardened shiny hair and no ability to restyle throughout the day, to name a few.</li>
            <li> easily&lt;br /&gt;Comes with two product stickers and a comb; so you too can be a little hipster and advertise this</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that for thick hair much like mine</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> I went through a few tubs of the teddy boy matte.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d say that this works if you have short maybe thin hair</li>
            <li> grew tired of drug store products and them not lasting all day, and having a long list of ingredients that just sounded unhealthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too thick for me, and it tends to weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> , I have curly, hard to hold hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t get hard at all.</li>
            <li> The hold sucks.</li>
            <li> The formula sucks.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: Not for me, over priced, smells bad, does not hold, does not last all day.</li>
            <li> May work for people with thin hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and its a bit tough to get my desired style.</li>
            <li> Definitely a game changer in the water based pomades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $4.80/oz; Uppercut is also expensive at $5.14/oz, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Reviews must be fake.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed at all by this product.</li>
            <li> It wasnt cutting once summer started.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> Even just as a base, I&#x27;m sold.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> One of the only &#x27;Natural &amp; Water Based&#x27; pomade products out there.  I use this everyday.  Even just as a base, I&#x27;m sold.  Can&#x27;t wait till they drop a &#x27;Firm or Super&#x27; hold!</li>
            <li> The hold sucks. The formula sucks. The smell is alright.</li>
            <li> good stuff, light hold</li>
            <li> My son really like it so much.He. doesn&#x27;t like to share it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good pomade if you&#x27;re looking for a medium hold. Applies very easy, easy to work with and style, I love that it doesn&#x27;t ever dry, so restyling is easy. Scent it&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> It has a really nice scent, but if you have thicker or wavier hair, there are much more useful pomades. This pomade is probably one of the lightest holding pomades I&#x27;ve ever used (I like trying pomades and have 7 in my cabinet at the moment). It caused far more frustration than the cheaper brands for my hair type and style. I tend to go for a slick pompadour instead of a more &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; one. This pomade might be fine for a fluffier look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my hair, compared to other pomades, this doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s $4.80/oz; Uppercut is also expensive at $5.14/oz, but it works well. I usually go for Suavecito ($2.57/oz) or Layrite ($3.44/oz), they work much better for my slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I loved it.. it smells really good and has good hold with great shine. It allows me to restyle and comb my hair through out the day and I almost forget it&#x27;s water based until I hop in the shower ): definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this stuff, but I&#x27;ve gone back to other products instead. It&#x27;s a bit too thick for me, and it tends to weigh down my hair. The smell isn&#x27;t so pleasant either - almost like beeswax.</li>
            <li> Works great, strong hold. Will buy again</li>
            <li> The hair pomade was surprising good. it was soft, pliable and easy to use. has a nice minty smell to is which is a plus. Id definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this waterbased pomade.  The scent is light and pleasant.  I&#x27;ve re-purchased this several times as it&#x27;s so good at what it does.  I&#x27;m often likely to look for the lowest price vs being brand loyal, but this pomade won me over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product. It provides great control because it&#x27;s very waxy. The hold is very mild but that&#x27;s the way I like it. So no hardness or stiffness at all. It gives a natural shine to it but very natural. It is very easy to apply and to wash out, and the smell is good enough but it&#x27;s barely present during the day. I really like this product one of the best pomades in the market if you like these creamy light products.</li>
            <li> Great product and its American made.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Reviews must be fake.  Not impressed at all by this product. I have used plenty of hair products, and as far as the hold goes, it&#x27;s nearly non-existent. The smell and ingredients are great (if you&#x27;re into herbal stuff), but overall I was pretty disappointed. The jar is tiny and you don&#x27;t really get what you pay for. May work for people with thin hair, but it didn&#x27;t work for my thick hair. Overall, the standout points for this product are is the great herbal smell, and creamy smooth consistency. There&#x27;s other products out there to get more bang for your hard earned bucks.</li>
            <li> I found this product through James (The Pomp on Youtube) After giving it a try, I have to say that I loveeeee this product!! Great hold, just the right amount of shine, and awesome awesome scent. I actually don&#x27;t even wear cologne on the days I wear this product because of the really refreshing smell. I love the way the product feels when you first put it in your hair, the way it tingles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew tired of drug store products and them not lasting all day, and having a long list of ingredients that just sounded unhealthy. Thatâs why I like this product and what this company stands for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Really good hold, similar to American Crew Fiber, and reworkable with water if you want to change in the day.&lt;br /&gt;Really great shine, just the right amount to look healthy and great. Your significant other will want to run their hands through your hair with this one in it ;)&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, awesome pepperminty scent, and lasts a while too. It just feels so fresh!!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good price point, considering handmade and the natal ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Washes out easily&lt;br /&gt;Comes with two product stickers and a comb; so you too can be a little hipster and advertise this very unknown product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;May not last THE WHOLE day, depending on how much you have in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also what I love, is the person that shipped it wrote a little handwritten note on the back. That to me, just speaks to the customer service and the care they give to orders! Very fast shipping, and great overall product!</li>
            <li> This product is a very unique water based pomade that actually seems like it never drys, but it does. When it drys it&#x27;s very oily much like a oil base and could be re-combed once or twice before the water wears off the pomade. The only bad thing is that for thick hair much like mine I need a good amount for it to even hold well.</li>
            <li> Hands down best pomade I&#x27;ve used. Will buy again. Downside is price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. I wanted to like it. But...&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell. It smells great in the container, but as it&#x27;s applied it starts to smell like shoe polish, not exactly the smell that I want on my head, but everybody is different.&lt;br /&gt;Next, the hold, or lack of it. It does not work very well for me, I have curly, hard to hold hair. I have been using Suavacito regular and the hold works great, but it smells a little like dirt to me. The Teddy Boy tends to make my hair look frizzy, even when using a large amount, which feels disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I bought the small size, (even though it cost as much as 4 oz of most other products).&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Not for me, over priced, smells bad, does not hold, does not last all day.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff!! It&#x27;s a nice water-based pomade that deoesn&#x27;t harden unless you put too much in (even then it&#x27;s not like other WB pomades). If you need a stronger hold you can just put some more in so unless you have super thick curly hair, you should be good with this. I have thick curly hair and it does a good job keeping my hair as I want it even though by the end of the day I have some curls coming back to me. Buy this.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s special &amp;#34;going out&amp;#34; pomade.  It looks great and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Finally, a water based Pomade that doesn&#x27;t harden like a gel. This product has good hold and can re-styled throughout the day</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is by far the best water based pomade it doesn&#x27;t dry throughout the day</li>
            <li> I have always just bought the product that my barber has recommended. Often, she will talk about water versus oil based or different holds. I really have never paid attention to any of that. This product makes me care all of the sudden though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a water based product, which largely means that it is easy to wash out on a daily basis. Typically this also comes with substantial down sides - hardened shiny hair and no ability to restyle throughout the day, to name a few. With Teddy Boy Original, the downsides to a water based product are substantially diminished though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrive at work and do my hair in the bathroom because I bike to work. Typically, my hair would be styled for the first 2 or 3 hours, but since I constantly fiddle with my hair, it would be trashed pretty quickly. With this product, I can passably reset my hair with my hands. Better, I can get it close to the original quality of styling if I use a comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is solidly in the &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34; camp. It is enough for me to make my hair do almost exactly what I want, but soft enough to still allow some of my hair&#x27;s natural wavy character come through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting a larger amount of product in can help really set a style and does not give a typical greasy look. I think this must be the wax in this product. It  is still gross to the touch, it looks at least a little more natural and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teddy Boy Original opened my eyes to what is out there. I will probably try a few other products out there, but for now, this will definitely be my go-to product.</li>
            <li> I love it! It works really well and I have to say it is easy to work with as well.</li>
            <li> Definitely a game changer in the water based pomades. I&#x27;ve gotten the best hair days with this baby right here. The container (I bought the 2.5 oz jar) is well made: all plastic except the aluminum lid. I do like the new updated look, it improves the aesthetics a lot more. It&#x27;s a creamy substance that&#x27;s very easy to scoop out and apply on your hair. It gives great shine and fantastic hold that lasts the whole (and very hot) day - it never dries. I can definitely restyle if I so desire, and it leaves your hair feeling soft enough and great; not sticky or hard at all. I must say I love the smell - its a very nice peppermint fragrance that&#x27;s not overpowering.The thing is, in order for me to get the most out of this pomade, I first need to blowdry my hair (I don&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;have&amp;#34; to blowdry my hair when styling) in order to create volume and then apply this generously and evenly all throughout my hair. Even the instructions say that you should first blowdry your hair. I didn&#x27;t give it the 5 stars because I believe there is room for improvement: maybe improving the hold a small bit in order to create more volume and height on your hairstyle. Besides that, I fully recommend this pomade; its the best WB pomade I&#x27;ve currently tried. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this pomade, go right ahead and get the 4 oz jar and as long as you&#x27;re using it for what its meant, you&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
            <li> I went through a few tubs of the teddy boy matte.  It wasnt cutting once summer started.  I switched to this and its incredibly better.  It will last the entire day, keeps random hairs down too.  Not too much to say besides it still washes out really easily, and I will definitely be rebuying.  Smell is a a musky medicinal smell which is manly and fine.  Scent lasts longer than teddy boy matte.  It does not have a high shine, and had I known that I would have tried it earlier.  People keep asking me if I just got a haircut since it works that well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps every hair in place and washes out easily.  What more could you want .</li>
            <li> Not thick enough, shapes well but you need a lot to make it work</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair.  It&#x27;s a blessing and a curse. Everyone tells me how much they love my hair, but they&#x27;re not stuck with it on their head. Most days it&#x27;s simply unmanagable. Anything that will hold it down feels like Rubber Cement, and anything i can run my fingers through either leaves my hands sticky or doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place. This product is simply great. The smell is very manly, a mix of mint and bay rum.  The hold/shine are respectable, it won&#x27;t give you that Mad Men look but it&#x27;s enough to prevent my afro from creeping back before noon.  You can run your hands through it without them feeling gross. Washes out easily. And best of all it&#x27;s a great value! Only downside is I personally have you use a relative large amount to acheive the same effect as some other products, but again, i have really unruly, voluminous hair. Travel size is great, love the large opening despite the smaller size.</li>
            <li> Good hold but not worth the $$$ for such a small amount</li>
            <li> The hold just isn&#x27;t there. The smell is great, light, and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard and stiff. This stuff doesn&#x27;t get hard at all. Plus it gives a medium to light hold. The amount of shine depends on how much you put in your hair. You&#x27;ll have to experiment to see what works best for you. It has a great consistency, kind of like soft butter, but it&#x27;s not greasy at all. A nice creamy feel to it. The smell is minty but not too strong and is pleasant, at least to me. I really prefer water based over petroleum based, because I like it to wash out of my hair, which this does completely and easily. The only thing I wish in regard to this product, would be that they would offer a strong hold version of this as well as the original. I did notice that the 2.5 oz. is 12 dollars and the 4.5 oz. is 20 dollars. I wish the bigger size was a little cheaper. I have bought this product once, and got the 2.5 oz. All in all, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s pretty easy to apply and kept my hair in place all day, even in 90Â°F with high humidity. Doesn&#x27;t harden like other water based products I&#x27;ve used which makes combing and restyling super easy. The only small complaint I have is the peppermint smell can be a little overpowering for the first few hours. Overall excellent product, I will definitely buy it again in the larger jar.</li>
            <li> The container was a bit smaller than expected.  The smell of the product, while not terrible, is not for me.  It also doesn&#x27;t hold as well as the product description states it does.  But, that is kind of the case with most water based pomades</li>
            <li> My favorite part of this pomade is the smell, to me it smells like a barber shop which i love. Ive only used it once because i am trying to grow my hair out for that 20s gangster look like brad pitt in fury. The hold was very good and you only need a very small amount to get the job done, which is a good thing cause this is a very tiny bottle. So far i am impressed with this product but i haven&#x27;t used it enough just yet to give a very acute review on how it holds up to all day use. It also washes out very easily with just water which is another plus for me. I am glade i gave this a try. ill update when my hair grows some more and i start using this more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: my hair has been getting longer and I&#x27;ve had a chance to use this pomade more. I find that now it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair as well now that my hair has grown out. By the end of the night my hair is all over the place. So I&#x27;d say that this works if you have short maybe thin hair not so much if it you have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> holds well and lasts a long time.  a bit sticky though.</li>
            <li> This product is ok. I have wavy hair and its a bit tough to get my desired style. The smell is unique, like a cinnamon smell. I don&#x27;t use it regularly, but when I do, its somewhat of a challenge</li>
    </ol>
