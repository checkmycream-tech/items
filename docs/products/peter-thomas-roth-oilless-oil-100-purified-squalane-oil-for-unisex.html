            <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This product carries the Good Housekeeping &#x27;seal of approval&#x27; which peaked my interest too.  </li>
            <li>It feels so good on your skin.</li>
            <li>But now I notice the redness on my cheeks are much better compared with a month ago!</li>
            <li>The reason I bought this was because I read from a blog that commented this product as the savior for redness issues, and I am glad it did its job!</li>
            <li>Love this oil not oil product!</li>
            <li>Good Housekeeping has an impeccable reputation for endorsing only the best products.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I use the VIZ-1000 also but needed something to act like an oil to hydrate and help prevent an over secretion of my own sebum.  </li>
            <li>skin, with no make up has a nice dewiness, not oily look.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I do wear make up, I find that it looks better on and stays good for about 4-5 hours.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice on your skin and after couple weeks you do see results.</li>
            <li>one drop does entire face-works great as a primer under foundation-even helps plump fine lines!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any others of its kind yet to compare it to, i do have straight shark liver oil, which is great stuff, but quite odorous.</li>
            <li>I broke out and got more blackheads.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin appear to look better and feel refreshed/moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this product.....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this squalane oil.</li>
            <li>One star off because I&#x27;d prefer it to be squalane extracted from shark fin for better absorbance.</li>
            <li>But Amazon has the best price!!!--Add that start back :)</li>
            <li>I love this product as a lightweight moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I like olive squalane better.</li>
            <li>Of the veg products this is from sugar cane rather olive as most are.</li>
            <li>Love love love this</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have used many serums to try to keep moisture in my skin but haven&#x27;t found one like this.  </li>
            <li>I just use sunscreen moisturizer on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly oily skin that is also sensitive and acne</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and hopefully like me you will love the results.</li>
            <li>Price was much more affordable then in department stores.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for normal skin to stay hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my bare face and neck.</li>
            <li>Even though it is an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;, it is a light oil.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a moisturizer that fit all of my skin&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li>and I am seeing a difference.&lt;br /&gt;After application my skin is comfortable</li>
            <li>Very light weight without a greasy  feel but provides a very light barrier to protect your skin and keep it soft.</li>
            <li>Love this product I would not want to be without it ever.... very fast shipping</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of sensitive skin and easy to get acne</li>
            <li>I was initially interested in Squalane after seeing several great reviews.</li>
            <li>This has a much thicker consistency and is a lot greasier, but on the days I feel that I need more moisture</li>
            <li>Came to Amazon and purchased the full size bottle from DrSkinSpa.</li>
            <li>I however, use almost a full dropper full rather than the one drop they recommend.</li>
            <li>It goes on and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Good for both summer &amp; winter months for dry &amp; oily skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Squalane to anyone searching for the Fountain of Youth!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel firmer and really does decrease the look of fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to combat the oiliness with oil free and oil absorbing lotions (and in combinations of oil control primers,setting  powders and foundations for oily skin )</li>
            <li>do make my skin feel more soft and moist after shower.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Really nice product to compliment your current skin care regime.</li>
            <li>This oil is not greasy and is easily absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>To put something on that I would anticipate to make my skin oily, and then have it magically absorb into my skin and make it so soft and leave NO residue - blows my mind.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>This is not a product that will show your the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I personally use it on top of Wexler, which is probably a bit much for most people, but alone it is very soothing, heals chapping and redness.</li>
            <li>You just feel soft clean fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It goes on oily (because it is oil) but quickly absorbs and leaves my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using an oil instead of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>fully intend to be back for more.</li>
            <li>I first heard about Squalane oil through a blog I came across in passing, and decided to dig deeper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Makeup looks great over it and doesn&#x27;t get that oily mixed look I have had with other oils.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a small bottle, .34oz, from QVC and loved it.</li>
            <li>I was kind of hesitant since I have very sensitive skin and tried a variety of oils for my extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I certainly do like this product.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Also, only one drop is enough for each time use, I really love it!</li>
            <li>Easier to spread over whole face.</li>
            <li>I immediately went on Amazon to get feedback from real people who tried it.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so I need something that&#x27;s very moisturizing but won&#x27;t leave me oily.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how much everyone else uses, but I use one dab/drop on each side of my face.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Nice lightweight skin product, it is not greasy or heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It acts like an oil on my face but absorbs much better than other oils.  </li>
            <li>Better than other oils I have tried in the padt</li>
            <li>This full size should last a year if used correctly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan and will continue to use this product when I need a super moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and gives such a silky hydrated feeling.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any and all.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it has done wonders for my skin and its texture.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a couple of weeks and really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away &amp; use it under my regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it disapeares leaveing your face very soft.</li>
            <li>Applied at night, i wake up with glowing and clear skin!</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the way the dropper is made, because Roth clearly took the effort to think about the mechanism for which to apply the product!</li>
            <li>This oilless oil has completely re-placed the $60 jar of moisturizer I normally use.</li>
            <li>Now the crows feet look much less visible and my skin feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin to at least give it a try and hope they will be as satisfied as I am with this product.</li>
            <li>but water clear instead of opaque.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have tried every anti wrinkle cream on the market.</li>
            <li>You only need VERY little(Like a drop on each corner of face) to do the job.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I find it gives my skin a soft texture.  </li>
            <li>feel soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>Same thing really-</li>
            <li>Absorbs completely in seconds....</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I had two dry patches on my skin the first time I tried it, and</li>
            <li>Use this oil on clean skin, but try spraying a little water on skin before applying.  </li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly and is not greasy as the ones I have previously</li>
            <li>It really helps reduce dry skin and the visibility of wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Forego the expensive creams ladies, and start using oils and hyalronic acid to keep wrinkles at bay and keep your skin healthy!</li>
            <li>two days later - completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it for a couple of weeks and went back to my normal moisturizer - big mistake!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if you have dry to skin to give this product a try</li>
            <li>Works great in cold and dry weather that we are having.</li>
            <li>I use this product in first step for everyday after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li>My skin used to look quite dry but now feels baby soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>still not entirely sure what this magic is or why so few people know about it -</li>
            <li>Now this is a real problem solver for me, as I have extremely reactive skin, and it is dry also.</li>

            <li> it disapeares leaveing your face very soft.</li>
            <li> Applied at night, i wake up with glowing and clear skin!</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the way the dropper is made, because Roth clearly took the effort to think about the mechanism for which to apply the product!</li>
            <li> This oilless oil has completely re-placed the $60 jar of moisturizer I normally use.</li>
            <li> Now the crows feet look much less visible and my skin feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin to at least give it a try and hope they will be as satisfied as I am with this product.</li>
            <li> but water clear instead of opaque.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have tried every anti wrinkle cream on the market.</li>
            <li> You only need VERY little(Like a drop on each corner of face) to do the job.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I find it gives my skin a soft texture.  </li>
            <li> feel soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> Same thing really-</li>

            <li> Makes my face feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I had two dry patches on my skin the first time I tried it, and</li>
            <li> Use this oil on clean skin, but try spraying a little water on skin before applying.  </li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly and is not greasy as the ones I have previously</li>
            <li> It really helps reduce dry skin and the visibility of wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Forego the expensive creams ladies, and start using oils and hyalronic acid to keep wrinkles at bay and keep your skin healthy!</li>
            <li> two days later - completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it for a couple of weeks and went back to my normal moisturizer - big mistake!  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend if you have dry to skin to give this product a try</li>
            <li> Works great in cold and dry weather that we are having.</li>

            <li> still not entirely sure what this magic is or why so few people know about it -</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t yet speak to long term use as I have only used it several days at this point.  </li>
            <li> This is more expensive than some other squalane  only products.</li>
            <li> I have to be extremely careful with just about anything that comes in contact with my facial skin especially.  </li>
            <li> and I use retinol which does tend to dry my skin out, so</li>
            <li> I use it for targeted dry patches and corners of my eyes to help combat crows feet.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands on products, both store bought as well as dermatologist created.  </li>
            <li> After trying it a couple of times I almost sent it back due to a little redness on my face but decided to continue and see how my skin would react after about a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to be used for travel.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product! I&#x27;m a fan of Peter Thomas Roth and this product do make my skin feel more soft and moist after shower. Also, only one drop is enough for each time use, I really love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t soak in. I broke out and got more blackheads. Didn&#x27;t even change lines. Using up the rest as body oil.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as an alternative to Timeless squalene! This has a much thicker consistency and is a lot greasier, but on the days I feel that I need more moisture this does the trick! Applied at night, i wake up with glowing and clear skin! I also appreciate the way the dropper is made, because Roth clearly took the effort to think about the mechanism for which to apply the product! I&#x27;m a big fan and will continue to use this product when I need a super moisturizer. Definitely worth the money. Forego the expensive creams ladies, and start using oils and hyalronic acid to keep wrinkles at bay and keep your skin healthy!</li>
            <li> This made me break out really badly and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin. It does make my skin appear to look better and feel refreshed/moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant since I have very sensitive skin and tried a variety of oils for my extremely dry skin.  After trying it a couple of times I almost sent it back due to a little redness on my face but decided to continue and see how my skin would react after about a couple of weeks.  I have now been on it for almost 2 months and it is the best oil that I have come across.  My skin is softer and not as dry as it has been in the past especially with these frigid winter months. It also absorbs quickly and is not greasy as the ones I have previously tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin to at least give it a try and hope they will be as satisfied as I am with this product.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;, but not oil at all.  It is the VERY BEST hydration product I have ever used!  I would HIGHLY recommend this product to any and all.  Thank you, Carol F. Raines</li>
            <li> I love this product.....it is truly a oilless oil, I have oily skin and I use retinol which does tend to dry my skin out, so this is absolutely perfect and it is squalene, I would recommend this product to anyone regardless of your skin type</li>
            <li> Love this product I would not want to be without it ever.... very fast shipping</li>
            <li> I was initially interested in Squalane after seeing several great reviews. This product carries the Good Housekeeping &#x27;seal of approval&#x27; which peaked my interest too.  Good Housekeeping has an impeccable reputation for endorsing only the best products. Well, I have only been using Squalane for 2 days and already see an improvement.  It is not greasy at all and absorbs into my skin like a sponge. My skin used to look quite dry but now feels baby soft. I recently acquired a bad case of dermatitis - red,scaly patches around my nose. These annoying, sore spots have nearly vanished! I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have tried every anti wrinkle cream on the market. My dermatologist even gave me a retinol prescription to fight off the aging process. Nothing worked. Now the crows feet look much less visible and my skin feels silky smooth. I would highly recommend Squalane to anyone searching for the Fountain of Youth!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an oil instead of a moisturizer.I have been using this for a couple of weeks and really like it so far. It seems to keep my skin moisturized without causing break outs.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It feels so good on your skin. Its the strangest thing, it looks and feels like oil but you put it on and &amp;#34;poof&amp;#34;, its gone. You just feel soft clean fresh and moisturized. No oily feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Great for cuticles. No greasy feel</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. You only need VERY little(Like a drop on each corner of face) to do the job. Especially in the summer. I use it for targeted dry patches and corners of my eyes to help combat crows feet. This full size should last a year if used correctly.</li>
            <li> Really nice product to compliment your current skin care regime. Good for both summer &amp; winter months for dry &amp; oily skin. Very light weight without a greasy  feel but provides a very light barrier to protect your skin and keep it soft. I noticed a difference right away &amp; use it under my regular moisturizer. I would purchase this product again &amp; recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Good,But the packing is not sealed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what to expect from this.  I was looking for a daytime facial oil.  I have a hard time with some other oils that just sit on my face and don&#x27;t absorb.  I use the VIZ-1000 also but needed something to act like an oil to hydrate and help prevent an over secretion of my own sebum.  I was really surprised with this product.  It only takes 2 drops so it will last forever.  It acts like an oil on my face but absorbs much better than other oils.  Makeup looks great over it and doesn&#x27;t get that oily mixed look I have had with other oils.  Overall, I really like this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this squalane oil.All u need is 2 drops for face and neck,within seconds it disapeares leaveing your face very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for normal skin to stay hydrated.  If you have very dry skin it probably won&#x27;t be enough.  But it soaks into the skin and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Nice lightweight skin product, it is not greasy or heavy feeling.  There is no odor or color.  It goes on and absorbs quickly.  I find it gives my skin a soft texture.  It comes in a small bottle with an eye dropper.  It is small enough to be used for travel.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years now.  I received it in a subscription box.  Ran out of regular night time moisturizer so I broke out the sample.  I used it for a couple of weeks and went back to my normal moisturizer - big mistake!  I noticed a difference right away.  When I woke up in the morning I noticed a big difference in how my face feels - it just feels smoother and healthier.  Now I won&#x27;t be without my Peter Thomas Roth Squalane Oil</li>
            <li> skin never felt so moist-one drop does entire face-works great as a primer under foundation-even helps plump fine lines!!! I&#x27;ll buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for winter skin.  My enlarged pores are smaller too.  Probably because my skin is getting enough moisture now that I have added this oil.  Better than other oils I have tried in the padt, that never seemed to absorb into the skin.  Use this oil on clean skin, but try spraying a little water on skin before applying.  Easier to spread over whole face.</li>
            <li> This is not a product that will show your the difference right away. I started noticing the difference after I finished 1/3 of the bottle. It&#x27;s not oily feeling and it does leave your skin feel soft in the morning. I have sensitive and dry skin so when I started using this product, I was somewhat frustrated that I didn&#x27;t see immediate difference. But now I notice the redness on my cheeks are much better compared with a month ago! The reason I bought this was because I read from a blog that commented this product as the savior for redness issues, and I am glad it did its job! One star off because I&#x27;d prefer it to be squalane extracted from shark fin for better absorbance. But Amazon has the best price!!!--Add that start back :)</li>
            <li> I love this product as a lightweight moisturizer.  It goes on oily (because it is oil) but quickly absorbs and leaves my skin super soft.  I have a lot of skin allergies and I find this does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I like olive squalane better. This itched my face a bit</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this product, need to do so asap!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing without the greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I fully intend to be back for more.</li>
            <li> I saw Peter Thomas Roth on QVC selling this product.  I immediately went on Amazon to get feedback from real people who tried it.  I have been using it for a couple weeks.  My skin looks great!  Even though it is an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34;, it is a light oil.  Penetrates well.</li>
            <li> This is more expensive than some other squalane  only products. I don&#x27;t have any others of its kind yet to compare it to, i do have straight shark liver oil, which is great stuff, but quite odorous. Shark products are squalene not squa-LANE. Same thing really- lk it up. Of the veg products this is from sugar cane rather olive as most are. It has a great feel - it&#x27;s a wax ester like jojoba, so it&#x27;s like that but water clear instead of opaque. Like jojoba it not only moisterizes it clears up skin problems. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I have spent thousands on products, both store bought as well as dermatologist created.  I finally tried squalane oil after it was recommended to me by a friend who also has problematic skin.  I have a tendency to hyper pigment when my skin is scarred either by acne or sun damage.  I have to be extremely careful with just about anything that comes in contact with my facial skin especially.  I highly recommend this product, it has done wonders for my skin and its texture.  It absorbs quickly and gives such a silky hydrated feeling.  Love love love this</li>
            <li> This oil is not greasy and is easily absorbed into your skin. It really helps reduce dry skin and the visibility of wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> No need for makeup. My skin glows.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I first heard about Squalane oil through a blog I came across in passing, and decided to dig deeper on Amazon. I used a Peter Thomas Roth moisturizer a few years ago - and decided I&#x27;d give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not entirely sure what this magic is or why so few people know about it - but it&#x27;s AWESOME. I&#x27;ve never used a moisturizer that fit all of my skin&#x27;s needs. I have combination skin, so I need something that&#x27;s very moisturizing but won&#x27;t leave me oily. Ladies and gentleman, this is it. To put something on that I would anticipate to make my skin oily, and then have it magically absorb into my skin and make it so soft and leave NO residue - blows my mind. I had two dry patches on my skin the first time I tried it, and two days later - completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how much everyone else uses, but I use one dab/drop on each side of my face. Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! I purchased a small bottle, .34oz, from QVC and loved it. Came to Amazon and purchased the full size bottle from DrSkinSpa. This oilless oil has completely re-placed the $60 jar of moisturizer I normally use. Feels great on my bare face and neck. Absorbs completely in seconds....I however, use almost a full dropper full rather than the one drop they recommend. Makes my face feel firmer and really does decrease the look of fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. I&#x27;m 45 and have some sun damage.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps skin soft without an oily feeling. Works great in cold and dry weather that we are having.</li>
            <li> I have used many serums to try to keep moisture in my skin but haven&#x27;t found one like this.  Makes my face feel soft and moisturized.  I just use sunscreen moisturizer on top of it.  Can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin looks and feels great!  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I certainly do like this product.  Can&#x27;t yet speak to long term use as I have only used it several days at this point.  Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great price on this beauty product. Feels great on my skin. No residual oily feel. A little goes a long way. I think my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s entirely different compared to the ones bought in stores. It smells like rubber tires instead of an airy sugar cane smell.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly oily skin that is also sensitive and acne prone (I won the genetic lottery, I know).  I&#x27;ve tried to combat the oiliness with oil free and oil absorbing lotions (and in combinations of oil control primers,setting  powders and foundations for oily skin ) (smahsbox, urban decay, mac,  hourglass).  Still, at the 3 hours mark, everything breaks down.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the PTR as my moisturizer after my toner for 4 weeks and I am seeing a difference.&lt;br /&gt;After application my skin is comfortable, I haven&#x27;t experienced any break outs.&lt;br /&gt;My skin, with no make up has a nice dewiness, not oily look.&lt;br /&gt;When I do wear make up, I find that it looks better on and stays good for about 4-5 hours.  I&#x27;ll call this progress.  Not the silver bullet I hoped for, but definitely progress, will continue and would recommend.</li>
            <li> OMG! I love this product. Just 1 week I face looks awesome. I use this product in first step for everyday after cleansing my face. I&#x27;m kind of sensitive skin and easy to get acne but this thing works very very good. I can&#x27;t say enough. Try it !!!!</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this oil! It makes my skin look and feel beautiful... I would highly recommend if you have dry to skin to give this product a try and hopefully like me you will love the results.</li>
            <li> Now this is a real problem solver for me, as I have extremely reactive skin, and it is dry also. I personally use it on top of Wexler, which is probably a bit much for most people, but alone it is very soothing, heals chapping and redness.</li>
            <li> Love this oil not oil product! It&#x27;s really nice on your skin and after couple weeks you do see results. Price was much more affordable then in department stores.</li>
