    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The dax pomade is the best hair oil in the world.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ingredients may not be the best.</li>
            <li>I like and chose this product because it is very good for the hair.  </li>
            <li>Good sealant as well!</li>
            <li>great product i would buy this again,</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>I have used Dax for the longest time and now even my daughter and my grand daughter also use and love it!!!</li>
            <li>I used to use this &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34; and loved it then.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on your hair cause it has such great ingredients like: mineral oil, lanolin, castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil which is excellent for you hair.</li>
            <li>It still smells good and leaves a nice finish.</li>
            <li>Great effect on my hair, Helping keep it nice and defined so my styles look better.</li>
            <li>I have mixed feelings on this pomade, because it feels great in my hair smells great</li>
            <li>Still love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it again.</li>
            <li>I am sure for a more conservative hairstyle this might do the trick but for a Greaser style avoid this</li>
            <li>It gives me healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t you know that the answer to my problem had been sitting in my closet for years while I ran around spending money like a fool looking for a magic bullet.</li>
            <li>It is light, makes hair manageable and shines shines shines!  </li>
            <li>Nothing too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Light pomade that moisturizers the scalp and keeps hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>that is if i ever run out the jar is huge.</li>
            <li>leave hair greasy yet still keeps it under control as if it was.&lt;br /&gt;its easy to clean off your hands and</li>
            <li>It does have a light fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product shipping was wonderful arrived 6 days after the initial order and for an APO address that is extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I hope that the company that makes&lt;br /&gt;DAX pomade, continues to make DAX pomade in the original formula.</li>
            <li>So it doesn&#x27;t build up as quickly.</li>
            <li>Old time favorite.</li>
            <li>Very good for black hair!!!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;m using a product like this.</li>
            <li>when i first used it something about the smell reminded me of Easter when i was little&lt;br /&gt;any way</li>
            <li>Just got a larger jar at a better price.</li>
            <li>So I added this along with those other products to soften the hold a bit and to add a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Old school is true school.</li>
            <li>I even changed to a more plant based diet, but still nothing keeps the dry skin/dandruff built up build up at bay in between washes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>and my hair feels and looks nice a few days after i use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used most major brands and types of pomade, but this is my daily driver.</li>
            <li>Great pomade for the hard to style short cuts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to people that want to condition their hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>The Ultra Sheen conditioner and hair dress for extra dry hair tries to come close to the good results of the DAX pomade.  </li>
            <li>Super moisturizing for my dry , frizz prone hair.</li>
            <li>I use the flat iron or hot comb to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>My Dad used this oil when he was young and so did my mom in her hair.</li>
            <li>but my scalp situation was at least 80-90% improved - way more than I can say for everything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>but so far this doesn&#x27;t seem to have harmed me or caused hair loss.</li>
            <li>so on a whim, I chose to purchase it, now that i have been fully natural for 2yrs and 3mths.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually think it&#x27;s better now as it&#x27;s not as heavy with grease as it was back then.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t dry out your scalp like most, but you may need to use a little more to get that maximum helmet hold if you have very thick hair.</li>
            <li>My mom used this oil in my hair as far back as i can remember, and now i use it regularly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read contradictory reports as to whether mineral oil was good or bad for you</li>

            <li> : I ended up finding a use for this, sometimes the Murray&#x27;s or legit Dax pomades are just a bit too rough, and not enough of a sheen.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting that little 3 oz can of Murray&#x27;s or whatever; this will last quite a while.</li>

            <li> I have seen numerous dermatologist who prescribed expensive and prescription shampoos.</li>
            <li> Just about 3-4 weeks ago, for some inexplicable reason I decided to go old school and use this on my scalp after I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> This is another product that&#x27;s hard to find which I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> As one who rocks the Pompadour I found this product to weak to hold the glorious shape of a Pomp.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Old time favorite. Still love it. My mom used to use it on my hair growing up and I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve found it again. I use it seal my ends in place of gel on my edges.</li>
            <li> Everytime I let someone talk me out of using DAX pomade, because of the&lt;br /&gt;petroleum that it contains, I get problems of dryness and hair breakage. I use the flat iron or hot comb to straighten my hair.  I wash my hair once a month.&lt;br /&gt;  The Ultra Sheen conditioner and hair dress for extra dry hair tries to come close to the good results of the DAX pomade.  I hope that the company that makes&lt;br /&gt;DAX pomade, continues to make DAX pomade in the original formula.</li>
            <li> As one who rocks the Pompadour I found this product to weak to hold the glorious shape of a Pomp. I am sure for a more conservative hairstyle this might do the trick but for a Greaser style avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is that of hair gel as opposed to the waxy goodness that is Murray&#x27;s Pomade or even some of the other Dax products (Wave and Groom looks a lot better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if your looking for the Greaser look and need the strength to hold a Pomp, pass on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I ended up finding a use for this, sometimes the Murray&#x27;s or legit Dax pomades are just a bit too rough, and not enough of a sheen. So I added this along with those other products to soften the hold a bit and to add a nice sheen. So I actually like this stuff as an add-on to another product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m using a product like this. It gives me healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> The dax pomade is the best hair oil in the world. My mom used this oil in my hair as far back as i can remember, and now i use it regularly. My Dad used this oil when he was young and so did my mom in her hair. This hair grease moisterizes your hair and prevents Dandruff or dry scalp. It can last for days and it also aids in the growth of your hair. I totaly recommend this oil, and i plan to use it forever (even with my kids).</li>
            <li> As long as I can remember I have had a problem with dry flaky scalp. As an AA, with my hair type, I just can&#x27;t wash my hair every day. I have tried all types of shampoos over the counter (neem shampoo, sulfate frees, tea tree based, you name it). I have seen numerous dermatologist who prescribed expensive and prescription shampoos. I&#x27;ve tried various oils ranging from tea tree, castor and EVOO. I&#x27;ve tried the ayurvedic approach. I pre-poo before every wash with homemade garlic and EVOO solution. I even changed to a more plant based diet, but still nothing keeps the dry skin/dandruff built up build up at bay in between washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this jar sitting in my closet for an embarrassing amount of years. I don&#x27;t even now how or why I had it. Just about 3-4 weeks ago, for some inexplicable reason I decided to go old school and use this on my scalp after I washed my hair. Wouldn&#x27;t you know that the answer to my problem had been sitting in my closet for years while I ran around spending money like a fool looking for a magic bullet. Not saying that I had no build up but my scalp situation was at least 80-90% improved - way more than I can say for everything else I have tried. On day 6-7 after my wash, I could actually show parts of my scalp and not be embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients may not be the best. I&#x27;ve read contradictory reports as to whether mineral oil was good or bad for you but so far this doesn&#x27;t seem to have harmed me or caused hair loss.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted, never used pomade befor but this is just what i expected.&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy yet still keeps it under control as if it was.&lt;br /&gt;its easy to clean off your hands and the smell i dont know how to describe it&lt;br /&gt;but when i first used it something about the smell reminded me of Easter when i was little&lt;br /&gt;any way great product i would buy this again, that is if i ever run out the jar is huge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for another place to purchase the Dax Pomade.  I use to purchase it at Walmart, but it has been hard to find recently.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am from Jamaica. My mother used this on my scalp growing up....so on a whim, I chose to purchase it, now that i have been fully natural for 2yrs and 3mths.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is: type 4. Coarse. Dense. Thick and very long....waist length.&lt;br /&gt;What dax does? Keeps my hair pliable when styling. Keeps the scalp sebum flowing...ok..its greasy. But greasy works for my hair! Good sealant as well!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing for my dry , frizz prone hair. Really helpin gme to tame my hair and add shine. Great effect on my hair, Helping keep it nice and defined so my styles look better.</li>
            <li> I have used Dax for the longest time and now even my daughter and my grand daughter also use and love it!!! Very good for black hair!!!</li>
            <li> I like and chose this product because it is very good for the hair.  I highly recommend it to people that want to condition their hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> Great pomade for the hard to style short cuts. Delivered promptly. Great price.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Just as described. Fast delivery and i would recommend it for anybody</li>
            <li> Dax Pomade works so well on my hair!  It is light, makes hair manageable and shines shines shines!  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is another product that&#x27;s hard to find which I found on Amazon. It&#x27;s great on your hair cause it has such great ingredients like: mineral oil, lanolin, castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil which is excellent for you hair.</li>
            <li> Old school is true school.</li>
            <li> I used to use this &amp;#34;back in the day&amp;#34; and loved it then. I actually think it&#x27;s better now as it&#x27;s not as heavy with grease as it was back then. So it doesn&#x27;t build up as quickly. The package says it&#x27;s made with vegetable oils now which seems to make it lighter - which I like. It still smells good and leaves a nice finish. This jar is bigger than I thought it would be so it will last me months.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings on this pomade, because it feels great in my hair smells great and my hair feels and looks nice a few days after i use it but it does not sleek my hair back the way other pomades</li>
            <li> I already use it. Just got a larger jar at a better price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most major brands and types of pomade, but this is my daily driver. If you&#x27;re used to pomade (including others by Dax), this is almost like a hybrid between pomade and hair oil. It won&#x27;t dry out your scalp like most, but you may need to use a little more to get that maximum helmet hold if you have very thick hair. Also stinks like hair oil, but the smell dissipates pretty quickly once it&#x27;s in. Just brush it in, slap on a wave cap and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;FYI - 14 ounces is a lot. Don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re getting that little 3 oz can of Murray&#x27;s or whatever; this will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This product is just as I remembered it during my child hood days. Light pomade that moisturizers the scalp and keeps hair looking healthy and shiny. It does have a light fragrance to it. Nothing too overwhelming. Overall a great product shipping was wonderful arrived 6 days after the initial order and for an APO address that is extremely fast. Packaging was done properly and with car. Container arrived in tact along with the box.</li>
            <li> Well, i got d stuff but it arrived beyond my expected date n its not functioning d way i wanted to be.</li>
