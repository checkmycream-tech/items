            <li>I have a Mia and they fit perfectly, why pay more for the same product.</li>
            <li>Great for more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just bought these since they had the best reviews despite having hormonal break outs and dry skin .</li>
            <li>These fit perfect and work basically the same.</li>
            <li>These facial brush heads fit my daughters&#x27; Mia 2 Clairsonic systems perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fit my Mia Clairsonic just fine!</li>
            <li>It feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was so pleasantly surprised how great these brushes are.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly and works as expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty good fit and operation on my Clairsonic Mia.  </li>
            <li>However, customer service was excellent and sent me some replacement delicate brush heads, and they seem much more suitable for my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, this brush was flinging around more soap (splattering in my bathroom) than the original.  </li>
            <li>Everythign was as advertised and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>ordered the sensitive &amp; considering how much the clarisonic-brand replacement brushes cost, i made an excellent purchase.  </li>
            <li>This brush leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh!!</li>
            <li>These work just fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more willing to replace the heads more often.</li>
            <li>Works with my Mia just fine.</li>
            <li>Work just fine with my Mia.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to pay the brand name price for a replacement brush that seems every bit as good.</li>
            <li>Fit my Mia 2 just fine.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads fit my Clarisonic fine and the cleaning action was good.</li>
            <li>Brush heads fit Mia with no problems, and work just like the overpriced brand name heads</li>
            <li>Also, no problem with the way they fit the Mia.</li>
            <li>They fit snugly on head &amp; get the job done.</li>
            <li>They fit just like the name brand.</li>
            <li>My face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>The cap doesn&#x27;t come off the brush heads as nicely as the real clarisonic ones do.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great replacement head for the frugal</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a REALLY NICE silky texture and is so much cheaper than buying a replacement from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>They fit just like the name brand.</li>
            <li>These brushes fit my clarisonic mia and I have not had any problems.</li>

            <li>I recently purchased this product and it works great on my  Mia 2.</li>
            <li>Great price and is the same quality as Clarisonic replacement.</li>
            <li>Was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>I am so impressed to have paid such a reasonable price for this well made item that&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as good as the original sensitive skin brush-heads that they were replacing!  </li>
            <li>They fit my Mia clarisonic perfectly and cost a heck of a lot less!</li>
            <li>Great product, great price and performs like the more expensive original.</li>
            <li>These are awesome and I highly recommend them as they are very similar to Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot tell the difference with the original brushes.</li>
            <li>These are a close match though the brush seems a bit softer than the original Clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li>I deleted my original review accidentally so am reposting/updating.  </li>
            <li>its just like the original one</li>
            <li>Thanks! :)</li>
            <li>Worth buying!</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Feel and work just like the original.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads work as well as the original head that came with my Mia 2.  </li>
            <li>Works just like the Clarisonic but wwith a significant price difference.</li>
            <li>Feels like the original brush that came with the device.</li>
            <li>honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much in terms of quality from these heads, but figured they were worth a try.  </li>
            <li>These certainly look identical in many respects as the brush that came with my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>just what I needed and right on time!</li>
            <li>Why pay a whole lot more for the brand name?</li>
            <li>I also did not want to pay full price for the name brand heads either.  </li>
            <li>this brush leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I received really quick.</li>
            <li>Received it quickly.</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic and it was time to replace the older heads.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with them, especially knowing that I&#x27;m saving money at the same time.</li>
            <li>Same quality, great price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and the item was as adverstised.</li>
            <li>Order came quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other compatible brushes but these are the best so far</li>
            <li>They fit and work exactly as the originals.</li>
            <li>If this was the only option it would be ok, but I was happy to switch back to the name brand product,</li>
            <li>Actually I felt they were even softer than the original ones, which makes them great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly like Sonicare at a lower price!</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes were exactly like the original one.  </li>
            <li>The only difference I see from the clarisonic brand name ones are that these are softer and feel better and they&#x27;re WAY cheaper!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best imitation brush heads I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to not buy the real Clarisonic brushes for my Mia2 thinking they probably wouldn&#x27;t fit or hold up etc.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied and will continue to buy from Sonimart as long as they continue to make this product at this quality</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>but they are totally worth the price and quality to me.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly onto the Clarisonic Mia, and feel just the same for much less!</li>
            <li>Now that I can get new brushes so easily and inexpensively</li>
            <li>Perfect replacement for my Mia... couldn&#x27;t be happier to get double the product for half the price.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft and gentle on my skin as I love the way my face feels after using this brush.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell the difference between my original and these new ones!</li>
            <li>May not be the most suitable for sensitive skin, as the bristles felt somewhat rough and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d already spent more replacing heads than I did on the original Clarisonic unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fit seamlessly with my clarisonic pro.</li>
            <li>(this is my first replacement brush).</li>
            <li>Works exactly like a Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li>I love these and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be replacing mine more regularly.</li>
            <li>The cost is much better compared to getting the actual clarisonic ones</li>
            <li>Exactly what it said it would be.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more when needed.</li>
            <li>The price for the Clarisonic brush heads is pretty steep, at $27-30 each.</li>
            <li>I did see some fall out of the bristles when I washed the head for the first time, but nothing that would stop me from purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>This brush is nice and soft and my face feels fantastic after I use it unlike the other replacement brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was concerned that these brushes would aggravate my skin, but they have done an amazing job, and if anything these bristles are actually softer then the name brand version.</li>
            <li>So, I gave these a try and was pleasantly surprised (and I love to be pleasantly surprised!).  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft but gets her face really clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I will certainly order them again.</li>
            <li>The facial brushes were just fine.</li>
            <li>Does the job at a much nicer price.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering.</li>
            <li>and I couln&#x27;t be happier (unless they were free obviously)!</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>Works very well with my Mia</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell the difference from the real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to any Clarisonic user!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order these again.</li>
            <li>Comparable to the real deal brush head</li>
            <li>but at a much sweeter price.</li>
            <li>This brush is softer and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>because really, who does)?</li>
            <li>I would say that it feels like the brushes aren&#x27;t spinning as much as with my Sonicare ones</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a month now and they are still working very well.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I can&#x27;t really do an apples-to-apples comparison.  </li>
            <li>Compatible at a much lower price</li>
            <li>Same design and fit as the Clarisonic replacements for the Mia 2</li>
            <li>They fit my  Clarisonic, but they did not actually spin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>They fit and the sensitive skin brushes are truly soft.</li>
            <li>left my skin super clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well, I really don&#x27;t see much difference from this brand and the original brand replacement facial cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li>May be a little more abrasive than the name-brand ones, but work just fine if you get the bristles wet with very warm water and a little face wash directly onto the bristles.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re overall pretty similar, and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell a difference just from looking at them.</li>
            <li>I feel like this product was not cleaning as deeply as the original clairsonic brush head.  </li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin and have to be careful with physical exfoliation but this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve waited so long to replace my Clarisonic brush heads when these very affordable alternatives were available.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy the name brand heads anytime soon as long as this item is available</li>
            <li>First non-name brand brush heads (for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>I feel like a new girl!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who owns a Clarisonic and doesn&#x27;t want to pay full price for 99.9% the same refill brush product (</li>
            <li>This is the same quality as the brand name brush heads that cost more than double this amount.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a much better quality than the last generic ones I purchased.  </li>
            <li>This is the same quality as the brand name brush heads that cost more than double this amount.</li>
            <li>Quality product at a fraction of he cost of the main brand.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are as highly rated as they are for a reason.</li>
            <li>Just like clairsonic, but not the high price.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.</li>
            <li>DO FOLLOW PACKAGE DIRECTIONS and replace the head while the clear plastic shield is still on the head - it makes replacement a snap !!</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly as they are much cheaper and possibly of even higher quality than the Clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li>They are so soft &amp; gentle.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I am always skeptical of compatible parts but these are great.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have my old ones to really compare.</li>
            <li>They are equally as soft and gentle and hold up as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this one a few weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li>and each brush comes with a new plastic cover too</li>
            <li>Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these replacement heads for those of us who are cost conscious.</li>
            <li>Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li>These brush heads feel exactly the same as the original, more expensive brush heads.</li>
            <li>The only difference in that there were a couple of stray bristles that came out the first time I used the head.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li>They seem to move/rotate exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, not hard and scratchy.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that it does not dry out as well or quickly as the branded brush heads.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same quality and texture as the Clarisonic sensitive for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!</li>
            <li>I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!</li>
            <li>definitely recommend these and would certainly buy them again.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order again at this price as they fit without issue into my Clarisonic PRO device and work as expected.</li>
            <li>Fits the Clarisonic Mia perfectlyand the bristles are even softer than the Clarisonic Sensitive</li>
            <li>The brush bristles feel as soft as the name-brand brush ones I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my Clarisonic for nearly a year and</li>
            <li>I have been very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Works just like the name brand as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Mia seems to run a bit louder, but maybe my unit is just getting old.  </li>
            <li>Mine is 3+ years old.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles.</li>
            <li>So far I do like these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I find that I really need to wash the brush with soap and water after every use versus just rinsing and occasional washing with the name brand version.  </li>
            <li>I think these are softer than the sensitive version from the Clarisonic brand</li>
            <li>Works as good as the expensive ones in the store</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I ordered the Sonimart brushes  due to the fact that they do exactly the same as the Mia 2 brush heads for much less.</li>
            <li>I closely observed how the original clarisonic brush head moved and fit and this one looks and moves exactly the same, or at least close enough to look the same and feel the same on my face.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and found the Clarisonic heads I purchased locally to still be somewhat rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li>work exactly as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them as they&#x27;ll save you a ton of money, and they actually work!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular replacement name brand heads</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular replacement clarisonic heads</li>
            <li>If you are doubting to purchase these because you are not sure if they will fit your Mia (1) then stop and purchase.</li>
            <li>Perfect and less expensive than name-brand replacements!</li>
            <li>This is a quality product for much less and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using these for a couple of weeks, but so far, I see no difference between these and the brand version!  </li>
            <li>My Clarisonic came with the cashmere brush and no other brushes.</li>
            <li>Work exactly as well as other brushes.</li>
            <li>I honestly think that even if they last half of the time of the original you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li>These are the gentle brushes, and I previously used the normal brushes that came with my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>For the price difference and the amazing quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>I got the sensitive and also the deep pore cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I bought both the regular and the sensitive brushes</li>
            <li>These look like Clarisonics brush heads right down to the packaging!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing these again when I need new ones and highly recommend them to other buyers.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing, I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the actual clairsonic ones except these don&#x27;t seem to get that weird odor that the clairsonic ones get.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between these and the far more expensive name-brand brush heads.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads are firm yet gentle on my sensitive skin and I will never go back to name brand.</li>
            <li>Sonimart&#x27;s customer service contacted me to offer me a full refund and apologize for the negative experience.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought replacement heads for my Mia 2 off of a Groupon/Living Social deal before, but when I got them, they did not actually work.  </li>
            <li>Replacement heads just as good as Clarisonic...but less expensive.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Clarisonic brand heads but not super expensive.</li>
            <li>/feel the same as the original and for less than half the price.  </li>

            <li> They work better, in my opinion, then the clarisonic brush head replacements...</li>

            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the cleaning heads.</li>

            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I have a Mia and they fit perfectly, why pay more for the same product.</li>
            <li> Great for more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just bought these since they had the best reviews despite having hormonal break outs and dry skin .</li>
            <li> These fit perfect and work basically the same.</li>
            <li> These facial brush heads fit my daughters&#x27; Mia 2 Clairsonic systems perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fit my Mia Clairsonic just fine!</li>
            <li> It feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was so pleasantly surprised how great these brushes are.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty good fit and operation on my Clairsonic Mia.  </li>
            <li> However, customer service was excellent and sent me some replacement delicate brush heads, and they seem much more suitable for my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, this brush was flinging around more soap (splattering in my bathroom) than the original.  </li>
            <li> Everythign was as advertised and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> ordered the sensitive &amp; considering how much the clarisonic-brand replacement brushes cost, i made an excellent purchase.  </li>
            <li> This brush leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh!!</li>
            <li> These work just fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more willing to replace the heads more often.</li>
            <li> Works with my Mia just fine.</li>

            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to pay the brand name price for a replacement brush that seems every bit as good.</li>
            <li> Fit my Mia 2 just fine.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads fit my Clarisonic fine and the cleaning action was good.</li>
            <li> Brush heads fit Mia with no problems, and work just like the overpriced brand name heads</li>
            <li> Also, no problem with the way they fit the Mia.</li>
            <li> They fit snugly on head &amp; get the job done.</li>
            <li> They fit just like the name brand.</li>
            <li> My face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t come off the brush heads as nicely as the real clarisonic ones do.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great replacement head for the frugal</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a REALLY NICE silky texture and is so much cheaper than buying a replacement from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> They fit just like the name brand.</li>
            <li> These brushes fit my clarisonic mia and I have not had any problems.</li>

            <li> They fit, and the work for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and it works great on my  Mia 2.</li>
            <li> Great price and is the same quality as Clarisonic replacement.</li>
            <li> Was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> I am so impressed to have paid such a reasonable price for this well made item that&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just as good as the original sensitive skin brush-heads that they were replacing!  </li>
            <li> They fit my Mia clarisonic perfectly and cost a heck of a lot less!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and performs like the more expensive original.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and I highly recommend them as they are very similar to Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot tell the difference with the original brushes.</li>
            <li> These are a close match though the brush seems a bit softer than the original Clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li> I deleted my original review accidentally so am reposting/updating.  </li>
            <li> its just like the original one</li>
            <li> Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> Worth buying!</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Feel and work just like the original.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work as well as the original head that came with my Mia 2.  </li>
            <li> Works just like the Clarisonic but wwith a significant price difference.</li>
            <li> Feels like the original brush that came with the device.</li>
            <li> honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much in terms of quality from these heads, but figured they were worth a try.  </li>
            <li> These certainly look identical in many respects as the brush that came with my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> just what I needed and right on time!</li>
            <li> Why pay a whole lot more for the brand name?</li>
            <li> I also did not want to pay full price for the name brand heads either.  </li>
            <li> this brush leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I received really quick.</li>
            <li> Received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and it was time to replace the older heads.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with them, especially knowing that I&#x27;m saving money at the same time.</li>
            <li> Same quality, great price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and the item was as adverstised.</li>
            <li> Order came quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other compatible brushes but these are the best so far</li>
            <li> They fit and work exactly as the originals.</li>
            <li> If this was the only option it would be ok, but I was happy to switch back to the name brand product,</li>
            <li> Actually I felt they were even softer than the original ones, which makes them great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly like Sonicare at a lower price!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes were exactly like the original one.  </li>
            <li> The only difference I see from the clarisonic brand name ones are that these are softer and feel better and they&#x27;re WAY cheaper!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best imitation brush heads I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to not buy the real Clarisonic brushes for my Mia2 thinking they probably wouldn&#x27;t fit or hold up etc.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will continue to buy from Sonimart as long as they continue to make this product at this quality</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> but they are totally worth the price and quality to me.</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly onto the Clarisonic Mia, and feel just the same for much less!</li>
            <li> Now that I can get new brushes so easily and inexpensively</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my Mia... couldn&#x27;t be happier to get double the product for half the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and gentle on my skin as I love the way my face feels after using this brush.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between my original and these new ones!</li>
            <li> May not be the most suitable for sensitive skin, as the bristles felt somewhat rough and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d already spent more replacing heads than I did on the original Clarisonic unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fit seamlessly with my clarisonic pro.</li>
            <li> (this is my first replacement brush).</li>
            <li> Works exactly like a Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> I love these and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will be replacing mine more regularly.</li>
            <li> The cost is much better compared to getting the actual clarisonic ones</li>
            <li> Exactly what it said it would be.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more when needed.</li>
            <li> The price for the Clarisonic brush heads is pretty steep, at $27-30 each.</li>
            <li> I did see some fall out of the bristles when I washed the head for the first time, but nothing that would stop me from purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and soft and my face feels fantastic after I use it unlike the other replacement brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was concerned that these brushes would aggravate my skin, but they have done an amazing job, and if anything these bristles are actually softer then the name brand version.</li>
            <li> So, I gave these a try and was pleasantly surprised (and I love to be pleasantly surprised!).  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft but gets her face really clean.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I will certainly order them again.</li>
            <li> The facial brushes were just fine.</li>
            <li> Does the job at a much nicer price.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for offering.</li>
            <li> and I couln&#x27;t be happier (unless they were free obviously)!</li>
            <li> I really like these.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my Mia</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference from the real.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them to any Clarisonic user!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely order these again.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the real deal brush head</li>
            <li> but at a much sweeter price.</li>
            <li> This brush is softer and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> because really, who does)?</li>
            <li> I would say that it feels like the brushes aren&#x27;t spinning as much as with my Sonicare ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a month now and they are still working very well.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I can&#x27;t really do an apples-to-apples comparison.  </li>
            <li> Compatible at a much lower price</li>
            <li> Same design and fit as the Clarisonic replacements for the Mia 2</li>
            <li> They fit my  Clarisonic, but they did not actually spin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> They fit and the sensitive skin brushes are truly soft.</li>
            <li> left my skin super clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well, I really don&#x27;t see much difference from this brand and the original brand replacement facial cleaning brush.  </li>
            <li> May be a little more abrasive than the name-brand ones, but work just fine if you get the bristles wet with very warm water and a little face wash directly onto the bristles.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re overall pretty similar, and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell a difference just from looking at them.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product was not cleaning as deeply as the original clairsonic brush head.  </li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and have to be careful with physical exfoliation but this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve waited so long to replace my Clarisonic brush heads when these very affordable alternatives were available.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy the name brand heads anytime soon as long as this item is available</li>
            <li> First non-name brand brush heads (for sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I feel like a new girl!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who owns a Clarisonic and doesn&#x27;t want to pay full price for 99.9% the same refill brush product (</li>
            <li> This is the same quality as the brand name brush heads that cost more than double this amount.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a much better quality than the last generic ones I purchased.  </li>
            <li> This is the same quality as the brand name brush heads that cost more than double this amount.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a fraction of he cost of the main brand.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are as highly rated as they are for a reason.</li>
            <li> Just like clairsonic, but not the high price.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> DO FOLLOW PACKAGE DIRECTIONS and replace the head while the clear plastic shield is still on the head - it makes replacement a snap !!</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly as they are much cheaper and possibly of even higher quality than the Clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li> They are so soft &amp; gentle.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of compatible parts but these are great.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have my old ones to really compare.</li>
            <li> They are equally as soft and gentle and hold up as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one a few weeks now and love it.</li>
            <li> and each brush comes with a new plastic cover too</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these replacement heads for those of us who are cost conscious.</li>
            <li> Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li> These brush heads feel exactly the same as the original, more expensive brush heads.</li>
            <li> The only difference in that there were a couple of stray bristles that came out the first time I used the head.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li> They seem to move/rotate exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, not hard and scratchy.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that it does not dry out as well or quickly as the branded brush heads.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same quality and texture as the Clarisonic sensitive for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!</li>
            <li> I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!</li>
            <li> definitely recommend these and would certainly buy them again.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again at this price as they fit without issue into my Clarisonic PRO device and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Fits the Clarisonic Mia perfectlyand the bristles are even softer than the Clarisonic Sensitive</li>
            <li> The brush bristles feel as soft as the name-brand brush ones I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Clarisonic for nearly a year and</li>
            <li> I have been very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Works just like the name brand as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Mia seems to run a bit louder, but maybe my unit is just getting old.  </li>
            <li> Mine is 3+ years old.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> So far I do like these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I find that I really need to wash the brush with soap and water after every use versus just rinsing and occasional washing with the name brand version.  </li>
            <li> I think these are softer than the sensitive version from the Clarisonic brand</li>
            <li> Works as good as the expensive ones in the store</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I ordered the Sonimart brushes  due to the fact that they do exactly the same as the Mia 2 brush heads for much less.</li>
            <li> I closely observed how the original clarisonic brush head moved and fit and this one looks and moves exactly the same, or at least close enough to look the same and feel the same on my face.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and found the Clarisonic heads I purchased locally to still be somewhat rough on my skin.  </li>
            <li> work exactly as the more expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them as they&#x27;ll save you a ton of money, and they actually work!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular replacement name brand heads</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular replacement clarisonic heads</li>
            <li> If you are doubting to purchase these because you are not sure if they will fit your Mia (1) then stop and purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect and less expensive than name-brand replacements!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product for much less and is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these for a couple of weeks, but so far, I see no difference between these and the brand version!  </li>
            <li> My Clarisonic came with the cashmere brush and no other brushes.</li>
            <li> Work exactly as well as other brushes.</li>
            <li> I honestly think that even if they last half of the time of the original you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> These are the gentle brushes, and I previously used the normal brushes that came with my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> For the price difference and the amazing quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I got the sensitive and also the deep pore cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I bought both the regular and the sensitive brushes</li>
            <li> These look like Clarisonics brush heads right down to the packaging!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing these again when I need new ones and highly recommend them to other buyers.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the actual clairsonic ones except these don&#x27;t seem to get that weird odor that the clairsonic ones get.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between these and the far more expensive name-brand brush heads.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads are firm yet gentle on my sensitive skin and I will never go back to name brand.</li>
            <li> Sonimart&#x27;s customer service contacted me to offer me a full refund and apologize for the negative experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought replacement heads for my Mia 2 off of a Groupon/Living Social deal before, but when I got them, they did not actually work.  </li>
            <li> Replacement heads just as good as Clarisonic...but less expensive.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand heads but not super expensive.</li>
            <li> /feel the same as the original and for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased and can say with confidence that you will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it stays damp for so long</li>
            <li> Lasts a long long time.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I do not have to buy an expensive replacement brush head for my Clairsonic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brush heads from 3rd party companies and this one meets, if not exceeds, the quality of an OEM brush head replacement.</li>
            <li> Those brushheads are not a tiny bit worse than those original ( and expensive) Clarisonic ones, but are much easier on your wallet.</li>
            <li> Have not had a single breakout and because they are so inexpensive</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical whether it would fit and work the same way as the sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier to get double the product for half the price.</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement for my daughters pink mia 1.</li>
            <li> the price of constantly replacing the heads at a local store was absolutely ridiculous -</li>
            <li> Just as expected!  </li>
            <li> I can see no difference between the Sonimart replacement brushes and the other ones.</li>
            <li> I cannot find any difference other than the price.</li>
            <li> I truly see no difference, other than the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is the same if not better than the Clarisonic brush!  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these work equally well as the expensive Clarisonic replacement heads that I have been buying for the past 5 years for my Clarisonic Mia.  </li>
            <li> the bristles seem slightly longer or softer than the name brand version.  </li>
            <li> They work just like the originals for so much less $</li>
            <li> Been using it now for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> They are a little softer but work as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> So, I was a little hesitant to buy these replacement heads off of Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Cant tell the difference between these and clarisonic, other than the price!!</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t feel quite as firm as the Clarisonic brand, but after a few days of using them, I don&#x27;t even notice the difference anymore.  </li>
            <li> I just got tired of paying $27.00 for a single Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> Though I had a negative experience with the Sonimart brushes - I broke into a rash/pimples after using one for a few weeks-</li>
            <li> This product is identical (if not better) than the ones that came with the clarisonic</li>
            <li> I was shocked on the difference the new brush made.  </li>
            <li> I honestly do not see a difference between these and the Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> Not one negative thing to say.</li>
            <li> After searching for replacement brush heads for my Clarsonic Mia and seeing that they were $25 each, I was skeptical to find I could purchase a two pack for less than $10; however, I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Much less expensive than Clairsonic brush</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> but so much less expensive!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I purchased these, BUT I have not been disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Purchased these brushes as an alternative to the expensive Clarisonic brand.  </li>
            <li> I will not be buying the expensive version again.</li>
            <li> No more paying an outrageous amount for the Clarisonic brush replacements.</li>
            <li> So... it turns out that I have a fake MIA2!</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> now she wasn&#x27;t disappointed</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Brush heads fit Mia with no problems, and work just like the overpriced brand name heads</li>
            <li> First non-name brand brush heads (for sensitive skin) I&#x27;m trying.  Been using it now for a little over a month.  Great substitute. Does the job at a much nicer price.  Will buy this again and again and again.</li>
            <li> Great product and will buy again! Thanks for offering. Please always offer set and save!!!</li>
            <li> As good as name brand &amp; a way better value!</li>
            <li> Fit seamlessly with my clarisonic pro. These replacement heads are firm yet gentle on my sensitive skin and I will never go back to name brand.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I actually had an easier time getting these replacement heads on my Clarisonic Mia than the Clarisonic replacement heads themselves.  Look/work/feel the same as the original and for less than half the price.  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> These are great! I would purchase these again. These are perfect for my Mia and I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great ... work exactly as the more expensive ones.  Also, no problem with the way they fit the Mia.</li>
            <li> Love these replacement heads. They are so soft &amp; gentle. I like them more than the clarisonic brand. For the price difference and the amazing quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I find the quality of brushes comparable to the clarisonic at a much better price.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these great brushes for such an awesome price! Excellent service and follow up. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Liked them even more than the Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Great product at an even better price. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the cleaning heads. I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great! They fit snugly on head &amp; get the job done. Glad I ordered  :)</li>
            <li> Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li> Fits my Mia 2 perfectly and works well. Will purchase again in future.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use it with my Mia 2 and I cannot tell the difference with the original brushes.</li>
            <li> Works just like the Clairsonic heads</li>
            <li> Product an service is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using these for a couple of weeks, but so far, I see no difference between these and the brand version!  Great savings, and the product came in a timely manner.  No reason not to try it!</li>
            <li> Love them!! Very impressed so glad I don&#x27;t have to pay the high prices for clarisonic brushes</li>
            <li> These are a close match though the brush seems a bit softer than the original Clarisonic brand.  Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Just like the mia brush that came with my set</li>
            <li> If you are doubting to purchase these because you are not sure if they will fit your Mia (1) then stop and purchase. I closely observed how the original clarisonic brush head moved and fit and this one looks and moves exactly the same, or at least close enough to look the same and feel the same on my face. I honestly think that even if they last half of the time of the original you cannot go wrong. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These certainly look identical in many respects as the brush that came with my Clarisonic.  They function the same as well so I wonder if both these and Clarisonic are made by the same people</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly into my clarisonic Mia2 and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this brush head and the one it came with (this is my first replacement brush). I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> I believe this are just as good or better than the Name brand. I just don&#x27;t have the name brand in my possession to compare it to. My Clarisonic came with the cashmere brush and no other brushes. It feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Product was just as described. Fit my Mia 2 just fine.  Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> same quality. much better price.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order these brushes because the price was so low. I just got tired of paying $27.00 for a single Clarisonic brush. I was so pleasantly surprised how great these brushes are. Works exactly like a Clarisonic brush. Fits perfectly. I received really quick. Don&#x27;t hesitate to order. You won&#x27;t regret your purchase. They are great.</li>
            <li> Very happy I found this product!!!  They fit perfectly and are well made. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work great. They feel really nice on my face and get the job done.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the original!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Received it quickly. Popped right onto my Clarisonic and works perfectly. Great buy! Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great - excellent price</li>
            <li> Love them! Great price.</li>
            <li> They fit just like the name brand. I am enjoying the soothing cleansing motion of these heads.</li>
            <li> Fits my Clarisonic Mia!  They work as advertised and the savings are phenomenal!</li>
            <li> The brush replacement heads fit perfectly in my Mia. The only thing is that it does not dry out as well or quickly as the branded brush heads. I don&#x27;t like that it stays damp for so long</li>
            <li> fits perfectly onto the clarasonic mia and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and it was time to replace the older heads.</li>
            <li> I was not replacing the heads like I should because I felt soooo ripped off buying them. These are the same quality as my dermatologist sells. Maybe better. I am so very happy I found these. Love Amazon</li>
            <li> May not be the most suitable for sensitive skin, as the bristles felt somewhat rough and irritated my skin. However, customer service was excellent and sent me some replacement delicate brush heads, and they seem much more suitable for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the same quality as the brand name brush heads that cost more than double this amount. I am very happy with this and will no longer be purchasing the OEM.</li>
            <li> Great product.can see no difference from the original with a price tag of $25.00 for one  Thank You</li>
            <li> Perfect dupe. These brush heads feel exactly the same as the original, more expensive brush heads. Great for more sensitive skin. I love these and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> These work great in my Clarsonic Aria</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on my Mia 2 as they snapped right in.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly with my Mia.  the bristles seem slightly longer or softer than the name brand version.  So although they are not an exact replica; they are great &amp; a much better value.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly with my Clarisonic Mia. Shipped fast and incredibly soft. Won&#x27;t be buying the name-brand replacement heads again!</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly and work with no problems</li>
            <li> I love these replacement brush heads! Five stars!</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find it softer than the Clarisoinc version of these brushes.  I am very pleased with how this turned out.</li>
            <li> A great great buy for $5.00 each.  Considering the alternative of $20 each.&lt;br /&gt;My wife said they fit and worked great.</li>
            <li> After searching for replacement brush heads for my Clarsonic Mia and seeing that they were $25 each, I was skeptical to find I could purchase a two pack for less than $10; however, I thought I would give it a try.  I must say I am thrilled with my purchase.  The brush heads appear identical to those sold by Clarsonic and after using them for a couple of weeks, I cannot tell a difference in quality.  My skin feels just as great after using these.  I will definitely be purchasing these again when I need new ones and highly recommend them to other buyers.  Save your money without compromising quality!</li>
            <li> this brush leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I do not have to buy an expensive replacement brush head for my Clairsonic!</li>
            <li> As advertised, the brushes are softer than the name brand.  I recommend this highly as they are much cheaper and possibly of even higher quality than the Clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li> These are great and the price is really good!  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy the name brand heads anytime soon as long as this item is available</li>
            <li> Fits the Clarisonic Mia perfectlyand the bristles are even softer than the Clarisonic Sensitive</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase of Sonimart replacement brush heads for my Mia 2.  The quality and the cost are great. I will purchase more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic Mia2 and I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Clarisonic brand cleansing heads.  These seem to work just as well as the name brand, in my opinion.  The bristles are soft, not hard and scratchy.  The head seems to oscillate as well as the name brand. Overall I am very happy with the purchase and would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly and does an amazing job of cleaning my face. My face feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> These were a great purchase, they work great and fit my Mia clarisinic perfectly. Why pay a whole lot more for the brand name? These sonismart brush heads are affordable and work just as well! So glad I found these!</li>
            <li> Brushes work just as well as Clarisonic brushes, but cheaper.</li>
            <li> As advertised, I love them</li>
            <li> I bought these to use on my Clarisonic Aria and though they&#x27;re good, they&#x27;re not as great as the Clarisonic head that came with my Aria.  All things considered, I&#x27;d probably buy them again as the price was fair and the quality was also good</li>
            <li> Just as expected!  Fit perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best imitation brush heads I&#x27;ve used! They are a little softer but work as well as the name brand. Delivery was quick. No complaints here!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads fit my Clarisonic Mia 2 perfectly and at a fraction of the price Clarisonic charges.  They feel  and look the same, so &amp;#34;good bye&amp;#34; Clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the expensive ones in the store</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other compatible brushes but these are the best so far and I couln&#x27;t be happier (unless they were free obviously)!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are the best replacement for Clarisonic brushes that I&#x27;ve found. They even rotate! I highly recommend them as they&#x27;ll save you a ton of money, and they actually work! Get them...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These work just fine.  Been using it about 1 month and very happy with feel and quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference with actual Clarisonic brushes. I recommend..</li>
            <li> Good product. I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love these. I have a Sonicare Pro made in 2011. These fit perfect and work basically the same. I will only buy this from now on.</li>
            <li> customer service goes above and beyond to ensure customers are satisfied by helping in finding what product best suits their needs and expectations. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve waited so long to replace my Clarisonic brush heads when these very affordable alternatives were available.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> These fit my clarisonic perfectly. The brush bristles feel as soft as the name-brand brush ones I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Great price, great brush head! I am happy that I tried this product. I will be buying them again!</li>
            <li> I really like these. I honestly do not see a difference between these and the Clarisonic brushes. I just bought these since they had the best reviews despite having hormonal break outs and dry skin . They work just the same to me!</li>
            <li> Perfect and less expensive than name-brand replacements!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been purchasing the Clarisonic brand brushes from the department store for my Mia 2, but it can get pricey replacing them regularly. I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon. They&#x27;re so much more affordable and work perfectly with the Mia 2. Would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> Love these replacement brushes! They work better, in my opinion, then the clarisonic brush head replacements...and they are a fraction of the cost. I was nervous to try them, but figured for the price I needed to try them to see. So glad I did!!! No more paying an outrageous amount for the Clarisonic brush replacements. Note: I have very sensitive skin and was concerned that these brushes would aggravate my skin, but they have done an amazing job, and if anything these bristles are actually softer then the name brand version. Have not had a single breakout and because they are so inexpensive I&#x27;m more willing to replace the heads more often. That alone will help keep breakouts at a minimum. They are incredible. Not one negative thing to say.</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t come off the brush heads as nicely as the real clarisonic ones do. still good for the price.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these sonicare brush replacement heads. They&#x27;re a terrific value and work as well as the name brand brush heads. I definitely plan to buy them again.</li>
            <li> Great products for the money!!!  They are good quality items.  I am very happy with them, especially knowing that I&#x27;m saving money at the same time.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads feel and look the same as the Clarisonic heads. The only difference in that there were a couple of stray bristles that came out the first time I used the head.  Overall, a great replacement head for the frugal</li>
            <li> Fits my Mia 2. Works perfectly!! Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular replacement name brand heads</li>
            <li> These work perfectly with my Clarisonic and are just as good as the original heads, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the Clarisonic scrubbing pads. I&#x27;ve been using this one a few weeks now and love it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than Clairsonic brush and I could not tell the difference.  I will purchase Soinimart from now on!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with these replacement heads. They fit my Mia clarisonic perfectly and cost a heck of a lot less!</li>
            <li> Fit my Mia Clairsonic just fine! May be a little more abrasive than the name-brand ones, but work just fine if you get the bristles wet with very warm water and a little face wash directly onto the bristles. Good price! They work!</li>
            <li> Everythign was as advertised and arrived very quickly.  The brush heads fit my Clarisonic fine and the cleaning action was good.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with our face cleaners, just like they said it would. We&#x27;re going to buy these every time that we replace the heads. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Ordered these for my wife to replace the facial head for her Clarisonic at a fraction of the cost. Same quality, great price, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I deleted my original review accidentally so am reposting/updating.  Though I had a negative experience with the Sonimart brushes - I broke into a rash/pimples after using one for a few weeks- Sonimart&#x27;s customer service contacted me to offer me a full refund and apologize for the negative experience.  They also acknowledged that the brush heads are a work in progress and still need some refining before they are up to Clarisonic standards.  So,  one star for the product,  five stars for customer service!</li>
            <li> This product is identical (if not better) than the ones that came with the clarisonic</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly on my Mia 2. They give a great scrub. I swear my face has never felt softer or smoother. I will continue to order this product. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> These are just as good as the brand name.  No complaints!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t have to pay the brand name price for a replacement brush that seems every bit as good. I can see no difference between the Sonimart replacement brushes and the other ones. I will certainly order them again.</li>
            <li> I purchased these replacement heads to use with my Clarisonic.  I&#x27;ve owned my Clarisonic for nearly a year and the price of constantly replacing the heads at a local store was absolutely ridiculous - I&#x27;d already spent more replacing heads than I did on the original Clarisonic unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much in terms of quality from these heads, but figured they were worth a try.  I have been very pleasantly surprised.  I have super sensitive skin and found the Clarisonic heads I purchased locally to still be somewhat rough on my skin.  These are softer but still as effective.  I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend these and would certainly buy them again.</li>
            <li> Great company..great price&amp;fast shipping..will order again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell they are &amp;#34;off brand&amp;#34;. They work just like the regular Clarisonic brush heads. I will replace them more often (recommended every 3 months) since they are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Exactly like Sonicare at a lower price! Very satisfied! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really good value, can&#x27;t tell the difference between the name brand.</li>
            <li> This brush is nice and soft and my face feels fantastic after I use it unlike the other replacement brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> They fit my clarisonic perfectly and I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes were exactly like the original one.  They snapped on effortlessly.  They were a fraction of the cost of the name brand replacement brushes.  Now that I can get new brushes so easily and inexpensively I will be replacing mine more regularly.</li>
            <li> The sensitive brushes are not as firm as the Clarisonic sensitive brushes.</li>
            <li> Works just like the name brand as far as I am concerned. I cannot tell any difference and the price is fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and knew it was time to replace the cleaning heads. I ordered these as an less expensive replacement and they are great!</li>
            <li> Similar quality to the Clarisonic brand brushes. Can&#x27;t even tell the difference!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to not buy the real Clarisonic brushes for my Mia2 thinking they probably wouldn&#x27;t fit or hold up etc.  I was wrong.  This brush is the same if not better than the Clarisonic brush!  I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Mia2 and works great!</li>
            <li> These work just as well as my clarisonic brush heads, however these were purchased at a way better price</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t replaced your brush in a while, it&#x27;s time. I was shocked on the difference the new brush made.  I feel like a new girl!</li>
            <li> A good alternative to the Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my Mia</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference from the real. Love it.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and gentle on my skin. Highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> The cost is much better compared to getting the actual clarisonic ones</li>
            <li> These replacement heads feel and look the same as the Clarisonic heads.</li>
            <li> Delivery on time. Replacement heads just as good as Clarisonic...but less expensive.</li>
            <li> Fit great on my Mia, would buy it again</li>
            <li> Bought these replacement heads for my son&#x27;s Mia. They work great &amp; I&#x27;m thankful to not have to pay the Ulta prices!</li>
            <li> So happy I found these. They fit my Sonicare Mia perfectly. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not good. it doesn&#x27;t come sealed and looks chep</li>
            <li> Works with Clarisonic Mia</li>
            <li> its just like the original one</li>
            <li> Perfect match to my clarisonic! I am so impressed to have paid such a reasonable price for this well made item that&lt;br /&gt;works so great!</li>
            <li> These facial brush heads fit my daughters&#x27; Mia 2 Clairsonic systems perfectly. Very satisfied with the price.</li>
            <li> So... it turns out that I have a fake MIA2! I only found out when I went to register it. Anyway, this fits perfectly. It&#x27;s a REALLY NICE silky texture and is so much cheaper than buying a replacement from Clarisonic. I have dry sensitive skin and have to be careful with physical exfoliation but this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Great price- prompt shipping!  Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy that I found these. They fit my Mia2 perfectly  :)</li>
            <li> I have gotten the Clarisonic brushes for years.  These work just as well.  Save your money and get these.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between my original and these new ones! I recommend this, and there are two in the package, so thats another plus for me.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a gift for our daughter and she was very specific in what she wanted - only this product would do!  After having used it for a couple of weeks now she wasn&#x27;t disappointed - it was everything she hoped it would be!!</li>
            <li> I like these more than the name brand. Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> Lasts a long long time.  Is wonderful.  I like to leave it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my Mia!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier to get double the product for half the price.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  I highly recommend them to any Clarisonic user!</li>
            <li> I am using these with my Clarisonic and I love it.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the pricey name-brand brush heads. I&#x27;ll replace them more often because they don&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. Worth buying!</li>
            <li> Purchased these and they seem every bit as good as name brands at a much better price.</li>
            <li> Cant tell the difference between these and clarisonic, other than the price!!</li>
            <li> Good quality replacement brush from an aftermarket company. I&#x27;ve used other brush heads from 3rd party companies and this one meets, if not exceeds, the quality of an OEM brush head replacement. Very satisfied and will continue to buy from Sonimart as long as they continue to make this product at this quality</li>
            <li> Perfect fit and feel compared to Clarisonic but so much less expensive!</li>
            <li> Great! Just as good as the original sensitive skin brush-heads that they were replacing!  (What a mark-up Clarisonic has, as these are every bit Clarisonic&#x27;s equal and about 1/5th the price!)</li>
            <li> These brushes are a very good way to save money and still get performance which is comparable to the original brushes.  These brushes are a much better quality than the last generic ones I purchased.  I would absolutely order these again.</li>
            <li> These are great !!! Do not hesitate to buy!!! I had received a Clarisonic as a gift and then was horrified when they wanted $25-$35 for a replacement head !!! YIKES !! I was apprehensive about buying these but decided to give them a try !! They are identical to the original and perform wonderfully at a fraction of the price !! DO FOLLOW PACKAGE DIRECTIONS and replace the head while the clear plastic shield is still on the head - it makes replacement a snap !! Will buy again.. Hope this helps.....</li>
            <li> No reason to get the name brand.</li>
            <li> They fit just like the name brand. I am enjoying the deeper cleansing motion of these heads.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Mia 2 Clarisonic.  They fit perfectly!  The bristles don&#x27;t feel quite as firm as the Clarisonic brand, but after a few days of using them, I don&#x27;t even notice the difference anymore.  Good value.</li>
            <li> fits my sonicare mia 2 perfectly! and each brush comes with a new plastic cover too</li>
            <li> Perfectly compatible and a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> These brush heads feel softer than the name brands, this is a quality product and I&#x27;m happy to give it a good rating.</li>
            <li> ordered the sensitive &amp; considering how much the clarisonic-brand replacement brushes cost, i made an excellent purchase.  the brushes fit my clarisonic mia perfectly &amp; feel great on my skin.  am so glad to found these brushes.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my clarisonic 1 at at $5 each (twin pack for $10) I love it. Will order from them again. Hope they never go out of business. Perfect and cheaper than the $27 price in the store for one. Great packaging and exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Perfection!  Will buy again!  I got the sensitive and also the deep pore cleansing.  At this price I thought why not?  Both are great!  YOu will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it. I own a Mia 2 and the brush heads fit perfectly. Comparable to the real deal brush head but at a much sweeter price. My face is happy and thankful. Definitely would recommend and will buy again when my supply runs out.</li>
            <li> Cheaper alternative for Clarisonic brushes. They work perfectly with my pro.</li>
            <li> An excellent substitute -- can tell zero difference between these and Clarisonic!  Will order again and again!</li>
            <li> It did what it had to do!</li>
            <li> Work exactly as well as other brushes. Nothing to worry abt.</li>
            <li> I am always skeptical of compatible parts but these are great. Quality, speed, price &amp; service all A+</li>
            <li> I was buying the replacement brushes on QVC for years.  I was spending (wasting) $40 for this same pack of brushes!  They fit the Clarisonic perfectly!  Thank you, Amazon!!!!  Once again you rock!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it said it would be.  Fits on my Clarsonic.  Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This is the same quality as the brand name brush heads that cost more than double this amount. I am very happy with this and will no longer be purchasing the OEM.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find this on Amazon. I was a little skeptical whether it would fit and work the same way as the sonicare brushes. It worked perfect. They look and feel like the sonicare brushes but are a lot cheaper than replacement brush heads for the sonicare. I will definitely be buying more when needed. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are a great investment and cheaper than the Clarosonic brand. I have a Mia 2 and it works great. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a Mia 2. This brush is softer and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am so glad to have these! They&#x27;re great on my Aria!</li>
            <li> These brush heads are as highly rated as they are for a reason. They fit perfectly onto the Clarisonic Mia, and feel just the same for much less! I would highly recommend this to anyone who owns a Clarisonic and doesn&#x27;t want to pay full price for 99.9% the same refill brush product (because really, who does)? Great job, Sonimart!</li>
            <li> This is a quality product and I&#x27;m glad that I bought it. It was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Fits my Mia 2. Works perfectly!! Highly recommend and a fraction of the cost of the regular replacement clarisonic heads</li>
            <li> The brushes are of great quality.</li>
            <li> Works with my Mia just fine. I would say that it feels like the brushes aren&#x27;t spinning as much as with my Sonicare ones but I don&#x27;t have my old ones to really compare. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I purchased these, BUT I have not been disappointed at all. They work wonderfully &amp; are great with my Clarisonic Mia 2. I&#x27;ll be buying these from now on.</li>
            <li> Purchased these brushes as an alternative to the expensive Clarisonic brand.  Very pleased and can say with confidence that you will not be disappointed.  They fit and work exactly as the originals. This will be the ONLY way I purchase replacement brushes.  Savings is substantial....</li>
            <li> just what I needed and right on time!</li>
            <li> These are good replacement brushes for the Mia 2.  They fit and the sensitive skin brushes are truly soft. Mia seems to run a bit louder, but maybe my unit is just getting old.  Mine is 3+ years old.</li>
            <li> Best price and super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great replacement brush heads. Worked perfectly with my Aria. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great price! These brushes fit my clarisonic mia and I have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> just as described work great</li>
            <li> Work just fine with my Mia.  No complaints and will order again rather than pay the OEM Clairsonic  price</li>
            <li> Just like clairsonic, but not the high price.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion. Works just as well as the name brand.</li>
            <li> Brushes just a good as the more costly Clarisonic  brand, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very soft bristles. Works perfectly. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Just what I had hoped for!</li>
            <li> This works with the Clarisonic Mia.  Soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly and works as expected.</li>
            <li> Will definitely come back for more in the future.</li>
            <li> So far so good! They work just like the originals for so much less $</li>
            <li> These are a very good dupe for the Clarisonic brush heads. The price for the Clarisonic brush heads is pretty steep, at $27-30 each. I thought I would try these on a whim, trying to avoid breaking the bank to stock up on the Clarisonic brush heads They&#x27;re overall pretty similar, and you wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell a difference just from looking at them. I do think the Clarisonic brush heads are a tiny bit gentler, and stay softer for longer. However, the Sonimart brush heads are great for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product for much less and is worth every penny.  I am so glad that I ordered the Sonimart brushes  due to the fact that they do exactly the same as the Mia 2 brush heads for much less.</li>
            <li> Great low cost alternative that works great on my Mia 1. Highly recommend these replacement heads for those of us who are cost conscious.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again at this price as they fit without issue into my Clarisonic PRO device and work as expected.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Will buy again</li>
            <li> These brushes rock. The only difference I see from the clarisonic brand name ones are that these are softer and feel better and they&#x27;re WAY cheaper! I love the clarisonic but this makes it actually affordable. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well, I really don&#x27;t see much difference from this brand and the original brand replacement facial cleaning brush.  Very happy with my purchase - love the price.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference between these and the far more expensive name-brand brush heads.  They arrived withing two days, also!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the price and quality of these brush heads, they fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly!</li>
            <li> excellent service from this vendor.  good product</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the claresonic brushes.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my Clarisonic Mia 2.  They fit perfectly, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference at all from the brand name brush heads.  They seem to move/rotate exactly the same.  It&#x27;s been over a month now and they are still working very well.  In fact...I can even say I like them better than Clarisonic brand brush heads.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and will definitely be buying these again.  So happy to have found an inexpensive replacement brush head for my Mia!</li>
            <li> Feel and work just like the original. I have a Mia and they fit perfectly, why pay more for the same product.</li>
            <li> This is 2nd time i bought this product...it fits well on my mia2.  Great replacement brushes at a fantastic price!  Very happy w/this product!</li>
            <li> Wow, perfect dupes for Clarisonic. I will not be buying the expensive version again. I cannot find any difference other than the price.</li>
            <li> So nice to not have to spend $30 on a clarisonice brand brush. I cannot tell a difference between these and the actual name brand. Definitely a great deal.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the Sonicare brush head.  Brush head seems to look and stay dirtier than the Sonicare brand one.</li>
            <li> Works great with my Mia3!ðŸ˜„</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work as well as the original head that came with my Mia 2.  They each have a cover for travel.  Great value for a great price.</li>
            <li> These work just as well as the clarisonic heads for a fraction of the price. great product.</li>
            <li> Works just like the Clarisonic but wwith a significant price difference. Glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> great quality and the price is very nice as well..</li>
            <li> These are the gentle brushes, and I previously used the normal brushes that came with my Clarisonic.  Therefore, I can&#x27;t really do an apples-to-apples comparison.  But these brushes fit my Mia 2 perfectly and seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than the brush that comes with the Clairisonic Mia.  It is a great value!</li>
            <li> These are awesome and I highly recommend them as they are very similar to Clarisonic.  I did see some fall out of the bristles when I washed the head for the first time, but nothing that would stop me from purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> fit and worked perfectly</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and the item was as adverstised.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my Mia... couldn&#x27;t be happier to get double the product for half the price.</li>
            <li> good compatible replacement</li>
            <li> This brush leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful!  I notice no difference than with the clarisonic brushes that came with the unit.</li>
            <li> soft, clicks in to my Mia 2 perfectly. left my skin super clean and soft. will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft and gentle on my skin as I love the way my face feels after using this brush.</li>
            <li> So far I do like these brushes.  That said I wonder if they have the same antimicrobial properties as the clarisonic version?  I find that I really need to wash the brush with soap and water after every use versus just rinsing and occasional washing with the name brand version.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I think these are softer than the sensitive version from the Clarisonic brand but they are totally worth the price and quality to me. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a fraction of he cost of the main brand.  Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> These are better than the Clarisonic brushes.</li>
            <li> This replacement brush works great with my clarisonic plus. The price is so affordable. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> much better price than originals</li>
            <li> They fit my Clarisonic perfectly and they work great. Great price!</li>
            <li> I might just be too picky for off brand refills.  I feel like this product was not cleaning as deeply as the original clairsonic brush head.  Also, this brush was flinging around more soap (splattering in my bathroom) than the original.  If this was the only option it would be ok, but I was happy to switch back to the name brand product,</li>
            <li> Compatible at a much lower price</li>
            <li> For the price, they are great!! Same design and fit as the Clarisonic replacements for the Mia 2 but without the hefty price tag. I bought both the regular and the sensitive brushes and I did not feel a difference in the softness of the bristles. When I used the sensitive brush heads my skin was not irritated afterwards, so I call it win!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and as described!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the name brand clarisonic brush heads</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Clarisonic brand heads but not super expensive.</li>
            <li> These look like Clarisonics brush heads right down to the packaging! They fit my Mia perfectly and I am extremely pleased with their performance and durability</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought replacement heads for my Mia 2 off of a Groupon/Living Social deal before, but when I got them, they did not actually work.  They fit my  Clarisonic, but they did not actually spin.  So, I was a little hesitant to buy these replacement heads off of Amazon.  I also did not want to pay full price for the name brand heads either.  So, I gave these a try and was pleasantly surprised (and I love to be pleasantly surprised!).  They fit, and the work for a fraction of the cost.  Win-win!  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and it works great on my  Mia 2. If you want to save money,try it !</li>
            <li> Works like supposed to</li>
            <li> Great price and is the same quality as Clarisonic replacement. Order came quickly.</li>
            <li> Fits and waaaay cheaper than the actual brand.</li>
            <li> Those brushheads are not a tiny bit worse than those original ( and expensive) Clarisonic ones, but are much easier on your wallet. Actually I felt they were even softer than the original ones, which makes them great for sensitive skin. Definitely love this product ! Will go back again after using up current ones.</li>
            <li> This product is a fraction of the cost of name brand heads, fits perfectly onto the clarasonic mia and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference between these replacement heads and the Clarisonic brand. Save alot of $$$$.</li>
            <li> perfect! I like this item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect match for the Clarisonic Mia2</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement for my daughters pink mia 1. She said it works great. The brush is soft but gets her face really clean. So glad I tried them. Great value!</li>
            <li> The facial brushes were just fine.</li>
            <li> Good purchase -compatible with Clarasonic Mia 2 as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my Clarisonic Mia 1. Exactly the same quality and texture as the Clarisonic sensitive for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Feels like the original brush that came with the device. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a Clarisonic Mia 2 and am very pleased with the quality of the brushes and the price. I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the Clarisonic brand and I will definitely buy these again. Great product, great price and performs like the more expensive original.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, I can&#x27;t tell a difference between these and the actual clairsonic ones except these don&#x27;t seem to get that weird odor that the clairsonic ones get. I recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and GREAT for the price!</li>
            <li> Works great and saves a lot of monay.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes are great. Work as well as the name brand. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these work equally well as the expensive Clarisonic replacement heads that I have been buying for the past 5 years for my Clarisonic Mia.  They are equally as soft and gentle and hold up as well.  I truly see no difference, other than the price.</li>
            <li> Was concerned they wouldn&#x27;t fit.  Pretty good fit and operation on my Clairsonic Mia.  Good value for the money.  Good quality bristles.</li>
