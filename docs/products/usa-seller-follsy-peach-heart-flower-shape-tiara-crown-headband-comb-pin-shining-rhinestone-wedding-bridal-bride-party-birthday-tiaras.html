            <li>Perfect for my Little Miss.</li>
            <li>She was Cinderella and it was just the right piece to top off her Costume which I bought here on Amazon :</li>
            <li>More fit for a large head than a child!</li>

            <li>Too large for my granddaughter</li>
            <li>My little granddaughter love it.</li>
            <li>but I was able to keep it on long enough for it to serve its purpose.  </li>

            <li>It was a little big but worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and heavy duty.</li>
            <li>This looked much cheaper in person(some of the pattern wasn&#x27;t even lining up) and wasn&#x27;t as quality made as other items of similar looks.</li>
            <li>Was rather large even for my head (adult small)</li>

            <li> No problem at all. It looks perfect on her.</li>
            <li> I wanted a TR for decoration in my baby girls nursery. This was a reasonable price and it looks beautiful up on the shelf. Now I have it I have room fit for a princess!!</li>
            <li> Too large for my granddaughter</li>
            <li> It was great for the money!  It was used as a crown for the prom queen and it did the trick.  I would recommend buying it as long as your expectations are set for this price range.</li>

            <li> Really pretty.  Could be used for prom or wedding but the cost was low enough to get for a child&#x27;s dress up play or costume.  Size is large enough for an adult but not too large for a child.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, especially for the price. It kind of sits on the head like a headband, rather than a tiara.</li>
