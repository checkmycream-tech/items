            <li>Never purchased this one before but it smells great</li>
            <li>This one lathers great.  </li>
            <li>It does remind me of the scent of honeysuckle flowers (I walk by some with my dog each morning), so they&#x27;ve done a great job of capturing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is my favorite!!</li>
            <li>The scent of the shower gel is very nice.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very very happy to get it on here. :)</li>
            <li>Love this body wash, the honeysuckle smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li>and my wife loved it.</li>
            <li>I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the scent of Honeysuckles.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and it leaves a very light sent on your skin.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to find it online because it has been discontinued in Bath and Body Works stores.</li>
            <li>Will be getting more!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is one of the better shower gels I have tried!  </li>
            <li>Love Honeysuckle scent!</li>
            <li>It even gets rid of the mineral (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) sunscreen that kind of coats my arms.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice scent but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s been a long time since I used the original honeysuckle-scented product from B&amp;BW, so I can&#x27;t offer a great comparison, I will say that this smells very good.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i love honeysuckle but this one is a bit too perfumey</li>
            <li>Bath and Body Works has many scents that I love</li>
            <li>I love this scent from Bath and Body Works.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who wants to smell nice should try it!  </li>
            <li>This has the light honeysuckle fragrance that I so love.  </li>
            <li>The main feature I look for is a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Light flowery scent, not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I used to be a big fan of this scent of shower gel (I&#x27;m talking years and years ago), but then Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued a lot of the shower gel scents I&#x27;d come to love, and I kind of drifted away from using their products.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon without having smelled the scent first and all I can say is I won&#x27;t ever do that again!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll probably never use it when there are so many other B&amp;BW products that smell much better.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like the Honeysuckle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Was exactly the scent I remember from the store.</li>
            <li>Great scent that actually lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Smells great and last long</li>
            <li>The shower gel really moisturizes my skin and the scent lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This lathers up nicely and washes off easily, not leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li>Super clean fragrance---you cannot go wrong with most BBworks products.  </li>
            <li>Most of them are typical for products of this type in this price range.  </li>
            <li>The main surfactant (lathering ingredient) is sodium lauryl sulfate.  </li>
            <li>I can live with it</li>
            <li>Bath &amp; Body works is always cooking up something new for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of where I used to live, we lived near a lot of honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>I HOPE THEY BRING BACK THE ENTIRE WILD HONEYSUCKLE LINE!!!!!</li>
            <li>I remember growing when I was young.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the center of a honeysuckle flower and it brings me back to when I would pick honeysuckle flowers as a kid.</li>
            <li>It was just as appreciated by the recipient as the other products.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  </li>

            <li> Love this body wash, the honeysuckle smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I bought a lotion, 2 body mists, and a triple moisture body cream of this scent online but they were sold out of the shower gel so I got in on Amazon. Unfortunately they have discontinued this scent and I will be using my remaining supply as slowly as possible. It smells exactly like the center of a honeysuckle flower and it brings me back to when I would pick honeysuckle flowers as a kid.</li>
            <li> Will be getting more!</li>
            <li> For my Wife. Smells exactly like the Honeysuckle I remember growing when I was young. I Loooove it.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I bought some honeysuckle cologne from Avon. After I ran out of it, it&#x27;s been very difficult to find anymore. I was so glad to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s exactly as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Love it! Was exactly the scent I remember from the store. Used it and the smell wasn&#x27;t overpowering as with perfumes.</li>
            <li> This shower gel was part of a gift combining a few other items with this fragrance. It was just as appreciated by the recipient as the other products.</li>
            <li> Never purchased this one before but it smells great and my wife loved it. You can go wrong with this product</li>
            <li> This is one of the better shower gels I have tried!  The main feature I look for is a good lather.  This one lathers great.  It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  I&#x27;m not going to review the scent because that is such a matter of personal taste.  I like the quality of this shower gel and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought that I might like this shower gel but after smelling it I didn&#x27;t like it. I LOVED it. It reminds me of where I used to live, we lived near a lot of honeysuckle. This has a smell that will stay with you.</li>
            <li> I used to be a big fan of this scent of shower gel (I&#x27;m talking years and years ago), but then Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued a lot of the shower gel scents I&#x27;d come to love, and I kind of drifted away from using their products.  I was recently on their website, though (haven&#x27;t been to a store in years), and saw they had this in stock.  I knew I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s been a long time since I used the original honeysuckle-scented product from B&amp;BW, so I can&#x27;t offer a great comparison, I will say that this smells very good.  It does remind me of the scent of honeysuckle flowers (I walk by some with my dog each morning), so they&#x27;ve done a great job of capturing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shower gel was not tested on animals.  It contains no parabens although it does have two artificial dyes (yellow 5 and yellow 6).  The main surfactant (lathering ingredient) is sodium lauryl sulfate.  (The list of ingredients is rather long and hard to read on the back of the bottle.  Most of them are typical for products of this type in this price range.  This contains a lot of ingredients that are components of essential oils, although this product does not appear to contain any actual plant extracts.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lathers up nicely and washes off easily, not leaving any residue.  It even gets rid of the mineral (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) sunscreen that kind of coats my arms.  The scent doesn&#x27;t really last after use, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve used half the bottle already!</li>
            <li> I heard from Bath and body works that they discontinued this product.... Every Christmas I bought this for my two daughters for there stocking</li>
            <li> It does have a nice scent but not my favorite. I will not order again. The scent does not last on me after I rinse off in the shower.</li>
            <li> i love honeysuckle but this one is a bit too perfumey</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and in good condition. I was very pleased to find it online because it has been discontinued in Bath and Body Works stores. I HOPE THEY BRING BACK THE ENTIRE WILD HONEYSUCKLE LINE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon without having smelled the scent first and all I can say is I won&#x27;t ever do that again!  Bath and Body Works has many scents that I love but this is definitely not one of them.  I can live with it but I&#x27;ll probably never use it when there are so many other B&amp;BW products that smell much better.</li>
            <li> Great scent that actually lasts for a long time. Compliments the moisturizer cream by the same maker. Hope they continue it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and it leaves a very light sent on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this scent from Bath and Body Works.  Anyone who wants to smell nice should try it!  Stink no more!</li>
            <li> Bath and Body Works don&#x27;t sell this anymore, or at least around me.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite!! So I&#x27;m very very happy to get it on here. :)</li>
            <li> Light flowery scent, not overbearing.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and last long</li>
            <li> The only body wash that actually smells like Honeysuckle</li>
            <li> Bath &amp; Body works is always cooking up something new for Christmas. However, this has been on my wife&#x27;s list since it came out. Every Christmas I get this for her, and other products from Bath and Body which she loves. The scent of the shower gel is very nice. Although it has been discontinued at Bath &amp; Body Works stores I can still order it on here.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the scent of Honeysuckles.  I have several in my backyard and they are so fragrant.  BBW captures their scent perfectly.  The shower gel really moisturizes my skin and the scent lasts for hours.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Super clean fragrance---you cannot go wrong with most BBworks products.  This has the light honeysuckle fragrance that I so love.  Thank you for a great deal!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love Honeysuckle scent!</li>
