            <li>This micro crystal system has worked great for my skin.</li>
            <li>Then, he found it on Amazon for a great price &amp; pushed it.</li>
            <li>I order this product for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister, after I read the reviews and did my research,  I wasn&#x27;t happy</li>

            <li>I was so happy to find this kit of proactive.  </li>
            <li>My daughter uses this stuff every morning and evening, and while it works great, it gets a bit pricey.  </li>
            <li>Also, I especially enjoy the convenience of ordering whenever I need it.  </li>
            <li>The product is good, but the shelf life of the product is close, just about 3 months from the date of receipt.</li>
            <li>I hope it continues to do a good job.</li>
            <li>My set arrived quickly, and the luxury-sized products are the perfect way to use Proactiv on a budget.</li>

            <li>But love the product!</li>
            <li>Love Proactive!</li>
            <li>I have seen an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: they&#x27;re effective.</li>
            <li>she was thrilled when she recieved the proactiv</li>
            <li>After much internet and amazon searching, this is the best bargain for your buck.</li>
            <li>The best part is ordering on Amazon I can order when she needs it and not sign up for one of the auto ship things, they charge too much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping - Great size!  </li>
            <li>I liked what product did yet to me.</li>
            <li>It is really incredible how fast it works.</li>
            <li>Pro-Activ has been the most effective product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m granting this order 5 stars for the great pricing, great product, and for the seller following up on the order.</li>
            <li>Awesome product line - purchased for my fianc√© and worked great and fast to clear up his acne ----</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great as when I first started using this</li>
            <li>Love the product, and the size is as promised.</li>
            <li>So, fresh legit product in a monster size at a good price.</li>
            <li>Will keep ordering when we need more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad he did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already better than it was 2 months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>like I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li>FOR THE MOST PART.</li>
            <li>but my face is dramatically better.  </li>
            <li>but im sure</li>
            <li>and it worked like magic.  </li>
            <li>After just 2 weeks, her skin already looks soo much better.</li>
            <li>I bought more sets for my teenagers.</li>
            <li>You get more for ur buck and u dont need to be a proactive member where they charge  you monthly.</li>
            <li>(But according to the rules I need 18 words so here are some of those words, OK?</li>
            <li>OK.)</li>
            <li>I am acne free!</li>
            <li>i wasnt sure afterbthe firsttwo weeks</li>
            <li>I love Proactive solution.</li>
            <li>I chose to purchase the set from Amazon as opposed to Proactiv because unbeknownst to most consumers, once you order from Proactiv&#x27;s website, you become a &amp;#34;subscribing member&amp;#34; and have to pay semi-annual dues of ~$50...</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s better to just buy from a seller on Amazon, so you don&#x27;t have those periodic &amp;#34;dues.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So glad I can still get the original formula!</li>
            <li>Great product - got this for my 16 yr old son whose face was breaking out and this cleared up his face within 4 days.</li>
            <li>skin is more smooth and even textured.&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>We have tried everything and even prescription wash, we are the most comfortable with Proactiv and it seemed to work quite well.</li>
            <li>This set works GREAT at healing adult acne.</li>
            <li>I think the original Proactiv is SO MUCH better than Proactiv+</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It is easy to use</li>
            <li>And I drink strong coffee once a day if this is helpful to someone&#x27;s caffeine concern.</li>
            <li>mask works amazingly at killing pimples when they first start.</li>
            <li>I no longer have fine bumps on my chest as I use it on my chest maybe once a week</li>
            <li>Could be more fresh(((((((</li>
            <li>Proactive Advanced 4 pc kit has been a goddess send for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so far so good  </li>
            <li>but I pretty sure it racist.  </li>
            <li>Received product within a couple days of ordering and it was exactly as described in the listing with all the original packaging and everything!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with acne issues, either mild or severe</li>
            <li>would highly recommend Proactive to any woman going through the lovely tops survey world of menopause....</li>
            <li>I had not ever in my life experienced break outs much less acne up until full on menopause started...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m dreading purchasing this set again, but dread having the pimples back even more!</li>
            <li>am 65 years old and glad to have discovered it</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>They can be drying for some folks in which case I&#x27;d recommend alternating with more gentle skincare or using a moisturizer as part of your basic regimen after allowing the repair lotion to be fully absorbed.</li>
            <li>Anytime I consistently use this skincare system, I receive compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Misleading at best and unfortunately deceptive.</li>
            <li>When she runs out we will definitely purchase more</li>
            <li>For the first time since I was 12 years old I am pimple free on my face!&lt;br</li>
            <li>cheaper than being stuck with a subscription and automatic ordering besides a larger size is  much more practical</li>
            <li>BUT FOR A PERSON FIRST TRYING OUT PROACTIVE, OH</li>
            <li>I can assure you my entire face was a railway disaster before this and now it looks way better, even presentable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In about two weeks of consistent use</li>
            <li>First time i tried proactiv</li>
            <li>On top of whatever Proactiv kit you actually order!</li>
            <li>When I first started using Proactiv at 15, it did wonders.  </li>
            <li>You would think after being around for so long that proactive would have made this treatment smell better.  </li>
            <li>Im worried that it will dry out my skin, but so far its been ok!</li>
            <li>It was packaged in such a way that things could easily fall out or get taken out.</li>
            <li>120 supply.item came very quickly.and the defining mask was awsome add on</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and it has helped her so much.  </li>
            <li>I went ahead and ordered the whole set again to save some money.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I REALLY DONT KNOW</li>
            <li>because I sleep on it too much and need to stop doing that.  </li>
            <li>this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too</li>
            <li>and I see so much difference in my face.</li>
            <li>It really works</li>
            <li>Much cheaper then taking him to a Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>My right side is completely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The active ingredient stains my clothes, so be sure to wash your hands after applying the product to your face.  </li>
            <li>I have had a clear face for the first time in 51 years.</li>
            <li>my skin clears up significantly and I only get the occasional blemish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wear makeup daily and my face is clean clear and balanced with no dry patches, don&#x27;t even have to rely on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It does not last the full 120 days in my personal</li>
            <li>I used to use proactive to clear my face up</li>
            <li>My son needed this to clear his face.</li>
            <li>and now my face is clear</li>
            <li>I am 36 years old and still was getting adult pimples and cystic pimples everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different systems, some with temporary success, some made it worse.</li>
            <li>I have had adult acne ever since I can remember.</li>
            <li>It got to the point where I stopped using any products because my face was so sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne.  </li>
            <li>your skin does change and you will find old products stop working.</li>
            <li>My face looks clearer and more even toned and my pimples are slowly going away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think proactiv does much for me except dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and Proactiv is the only thing that works on my adult acne.</li>
            <li>Apparently I&#x27;m allergic.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this for my 13-year old niece who is now going through puberty and has some acne.  </li>
            <li>this is the only product that has worked for my adult rosacea&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I never had acne until I was an adult, being in my middle 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The toner, since I will go through that most quickly, wasn&#x27;t that bad at about $16.</li>

            <li> 120 supply.item came very quickly.and the defining mask was awsome add on</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it has helped her so much.  </li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered the whole set again to save some money.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I REALLY DONT KNOW</li>
            <li> because I sleep on it too much and need to stop doing that.  </li>
            <li> this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too</li>
            <li> and I see so much difference in my face.</li>
            <li> It really works</li>
            <li> Much cheaper then taking him to a Dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> My right side is completely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The active ingredient stains my clothes, so be sure to wash your hands after applying the product to your face.  </li>
            <li> I have had a clear face for the first time in 51 years.</li>
            <li> my skin clears up significantly and I only get the occasional blemish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear makeup daily and my face is clean clear and balanced with no dry patches, don&#x27;t even have to rely on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It does not last the full 120 days in my personal</li>
            <li> I used to use proactive to clear my face up</li>
            <li> My son needed this to clear his face.</li>
            <li> and now my face is clear</li>
            <li> I am 36 years old and still was getting adult pimples and cystic pimples everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different systems, some with temporary success, some made it worse.</li>
            <li> I have had adult acne ever since I can remember.</li>
            <li> It got to the point where I stopped using any products because my face was so sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne.  </li>
            <li> your skin does change and you will find old products stop working.</li>
            <li> My face looks clearer and more even toned and my pimples are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think proactiv does much for me except dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and Proactiv is the only thing that works on my adult acne.</li>
            <li> Apparently I&#x27;m allergic.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this for my 13-year old niece who is now going through puberty and has some acne.  </li>
            <li> this is the only product that has worked for my adult rosacea&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I never had acne until I was an adult, being in my middle 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The toner, since I will go through that most quickly, wasn&#x27;t that bad at about $16.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv Solution in the past with positive results; and have seen the same results this time.  </li>
            <li> My face lotion is still about 1\2 full, the mask has quite a few uses left since a little goes a really long way</li>
            <li> what a waste of money, this product must be really old!!</li>
            <li> Super frustrating when you paid extra for rush shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the lotion when my skin starts to get dry around mymouth/chin area, so it doesn&#x27;t get used as regularly as the others.</li>
            <li> use only loose powder to even out my complexion from years of pimples &amp; skin discoloration from them.</li>
            <li> So, I will continue to buy from Amazon as long as they continue to have the lowest price.</li>
            <li> I expected to get it a week after I actually did, but maybe it took 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> since I started the treatment with this product, my problems with heavy acne have disappear completely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about half way through my 2nd bottle of wash and have started on my 3rd bottle of astringent.</li>
            <li> I have tryed several other products and had no luck.</li>
            <li> The products are not heavy or harsh!</li>
            <li> I finally received the missing refining mask under separate cover.</li>
            <li> On QVC the same kit comes with the Cleansing Bar and Green Tea Moisturizer for $65.00.</li>
            <li> he has continued to use everyday ay in his daily regimen !!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  very disappointing that this kit can be used for 120 days and even more (according to my previous experience) but it expires in May, and I&#x27;ve received it in 3rd decade of March.</li>
            <li> only takes a small amount of product to achieve maximum results</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> But after years of trying other unsuccessful products I start using this again.  </li>
            <li> I do not use ALL THREE products every single time, I break out in a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having bad flare ups, primarily on my cheeks, and this seems to have done the trick in calming down my skin.</li>
            <li> the new formula casued my skin to regress back to my teenage years :(  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical and would have sent it back if the expiration dates were short, but they were Jan 2013.</li>
            <li> using less makeup since I don&#x27;t have any pimples to hide.&lt;br /&gt;*I</li>
            <li> I do use it a lot though &amp; being half the size of the wash &amp; astringent</li>
            <li> and I end up with a stock pile, not cool.</li>
            <li> It goes away a little after putting on the lotion and given a little time though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used just one step it was OK, but when i used all the steps correctly it dried my face out so bad it hurt!</li>
            <li> If used properly ,proactiv is tough villain against pimple man.</li>
            <li> I told him that if he wanted to waste money in another product then I would try it.</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks</li>
            <li> I decrease my usage to once a day, within a few days I am breaking out</li>
            <li> but when it arrived it was missing the refining mask.</li>
            <li> My black heads are almost non-existent!</li>
            <li> wish that the individual items were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will get this again.</li>
            <li> I was at a loss , I have tried all kinds of over the counter facial cleaners , including expensive brands.</li>
            <li> during this harsh cold Washington Winter Weather no dry flaking skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for those with oily skin and bad acne.</li>
            <li> I did get a refund when i complained.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin anyways and while this may take care of that aspect, it&#x27;s like it sucks all the moisture out too.</li>
            <li> Despite saying that it would take at least 2 weeks to notice a change, I noticed it after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> The price was unbeatable for the amount that you get, at least from all my research.</li>
            <li> In addition the shipping was late.</li>
            <li> But after a while I think it loses it&#x27;s potency in treating and preventing acne.  </li>
            <li> My face had never looked so bad, at 6 months pregnant, I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> The left side is still bad</li>
            <li> My daughter has had the worst trouble with acne and nothing worked including what the doctors where prescribing and then we found practiv and she has had clear skin sence about three weeks after using.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t get any worse.</li>
            <li> AND ITS GETTING WORSE.</li>
            <li> cause my acne got worse</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that I did not receive my complete order.</li>
            <li> I hate spending money on myself, $40/month for clear skin isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> Works,  however smells really bad on the face.  </li>
            <li> and she hated it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is awful when the two combine on your face!</li>
            <li> Worst part is I bought for 3 months...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply horrific smelling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product - got this for my 16 yr old son whose face was breaking out and this cleared up his face within 4 days.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product and was shock to see that it expires in 6 monthss.....what a waste of money, this product must be really old!! will not be using it.</li>
            <li> Love the product, and the size is as promised. However the refining mask was not included. I did get a refund when i complained.</li>
            <li> Received product within a couple days of ordering and it was exactly as described in the listing with all the original packaging and everything! No complaints here!</li>
            <li> I fully advocate Proactiv products. They can be drying for some folks in which case I&#x27;d recommend alternating with more gentle skincare or using a moisturizer as part of your basic regimen after allowing the repair lotion to be fully absorbed. Bottom line: they&#x27;re effective. Anytime I consistently use this skincare system, I receive compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered the 5 pc set. A 4 pc kit including refining mask and a separate treatment. The cleanser, toner and repair lotion arrived wrapped in plastic along with the independently boxed treatment. I finally received the missing refining mask under separate cover. I&#x27;m granting this order 5 stars for the great pricing, great product, and for the seller following up on the order.</li>
            <li> great price for the product recieved.purchased for my daughter. she was thrilled when she recieved the proactiv 120 supply.item came very quickly.and the defining mask was awsome add on</li>
            <li> This is great product but I pretty sure it racist.  Just the refining mask.  I don&#x27;t like how it make my face all white for 10 minutes until I rinse it off.</li>
            <li> My set arrived quickly, and the luxury-sized products are the perfect way to use Proactiv on a budget. Skipping the monthly autoships helps me save money!</li>
            <li> After much internet and amazon searching, this is the best bargain for your buck. I was skeptical and would have sent it back if the expiration dates were short, but they were Jan 2013. So, fresh legit product in a monster size at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great Product, but it can be purchased at a lower cost at QVC.com. On QVC the same kit comes with the Cleansing Bar and Green Tea Moisturizer for $65.00.</li>
            <li> Awesome product line - purchased for my fianc√© and worked great and fast to clear up his acne ---- he has continued to use everyday ay in his daily regimen !!!! Will keep ordering when we need more</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the shelf life of the product is close, just about 3 months from the date of receipt.</li>
            <li> Picture shows all 4 items, but they are only selling 3.  Mask not included!  Misleading at best and unfortunately deceptive.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it has helped her so much.  When she runs out we will definitely purchase more</li>
            <li> This micro crystal system has worked great for my skin. I am 36 years old and still was getting adult pimples and cystic pimples everywhere. I have tried many different systems, some with temporary success, some made it worse. Dermatologist prescriptions made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried proactive 20 some years ago, it didn&#x27;t work for me, so I never tried it again. My husband has been trying to get me to try it for years, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money for something that probably wouldn&#x27;t work. Then, he found it on Amazon for a great price &amp; pushed it. I&#x27;m so glad he did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;*It is easy to use&lt;br /&gt;*Smells ok&lt;br /&gt;*It only takes a small amount of product to achieve maximum results&lt;br /&gt;*It works! For the first time since I was 12 years old I am pimple free on my face!&lt;br /&gt;*My skin is more smooth and even textured.&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m using less makeup since I don&#x27;t have any pimples to hide.&lt;br /&gt;*I use only loose powder to even out my complexion from years of pimples &amp; skin discoloration from them. But, proactive it taking care of that too. It will just take time to fade them. It&#x27;s already better than it was 2 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;*The mask works amazingly at killing pimples when they first start. My black heads are almost non-existent! It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;*It does not last the full 120 days in my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;*After using the sulfur mask you are instructed to use the astringent after rinsing off the Mask. The smell is awful when the two combine on your face! Just like rotten eggs. It goes away a little after putting on the lotion and given a little time though.&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I ran out of my toner after 70 days and ran out of my face wash today @ 86 days. My face lotion is still about 1\2 full, the mask has quite a few uses left since a little goes a really long way and I only apply 3 times a week.  I&#x27;ll update when I run out of those. I don&#x27;t use the lotion when my skin starts to get dry around mymouth/chin area, so it doesn&#x27;t get used as regularly as the others. I do use it a lot though &amp; being half the size of the wash &amp; astringent I don&#x27;t understand how I haven&#x27;t gone through it just as fast.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that the individual items were not so expensive. Especially the wash. The toner, since I will go through that most quickly, wasn&#x27;t that bad at about $16. I ordered that a week before I ran out, however,  when it came time to order the face wash the cost almost made me choke at $36! I went ahead and ordered the whole set again to save some money. I hate spending money on myself, $40/month for clear skin isn&#x27;t that bad I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I love this system! Will recommend to everyone I know &amp; when my kids hit puberty, and are possibly plagued with pimples like I was, this with be my go to prescription for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update*** December 5, 2013&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of my lotion after 116 days of use and the mask lasted me 120 days. I&#x27;m about half way through my 2nd bottle of wash and have started on my 3rd bottle of astringent. I&#x27;m dreading purchasing this set again, but dread having the pimples back even more! So, I will continue to buy from Amazon as long as they continue to have the lowest price.</li>
            <li> I have had adult acne ever since I can remember. I have tried everything, and I&#x27;m not kidding. It got to the point where I stopped using any products because my face was so sensitive to everything. My face didn&#x27;t get any worse. My husband asked me if I had ever tried this. I told him that if he wanted to waste money in another product then I would try it. I have had a clear face for the first time in 51 years. I would be a spokesman for this product if I could. I have never been happier with my skin...ever. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> works&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than being stuck with a subscription and automatic ordering besides a larger size is  much more practical</li>
            <li> If used properly ,proactiv is tough villain against pimple man. Very good stuff. Often imitated and never duplicated. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 12 years. Nothing compares to it in my opinion. DHC salicylic acne wash three step system comes close.</li>
            <li> I order this product for my boyfriend&#x27;s sister, after I read the reviews and did my research,  I wasn&#x27;t happy and I told my boyfriend that we shouldn&#x27;t buy it but we did and she hated it.  Now I ordered her Mary Kay like I have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and Proactiv is the only thing that works on my adult acne. The products are not heavy or harsh! Always pleased!</li>
            <li> My daughter has had the worst trouble with acne and nothing worked including what the doctors where prescribing and then we found practiv and she has had clear skin sence about three weeks after using. The best part is ordering on Amazon I can order when she needs it and not sign up for one of the auto ship things, they charge too much and I end up with a stock pile, not cool. But love the product!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this from this seller and both times it was just as described. You won&#x27;t find Proactiv any cheaper even from the company itself and you don&#x27;t have to be locked into one of there contracts which takes an Act of Congress to get out of.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations, bought the product for  my son and did not help with his acne!!! Worst part is I bought for 3 months... I just made a doctors appointment!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  very disappointing that this kit can be used for 120 days and even more (according to my previous experience) but it expires in May, and I&#x27;ve received it in 3rd decade of March. Could be more fresh(((((((</li>
            <li> Works,  however smells really bad on the face.  You would think after being around for so long that proactive would have made this treatment smell better.  It&#x27;s simply horrific smelling.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product was it, the one to work for me! Apparently I&#x27;m allergic. My face is covered in itchy red bumps now.</li>
            <li> I STILL USE PROACTIVE TO THIS DAY. I THINK MY SKIN IS GETTING IMMUNE TO IT, BECAUSE IM STARTING TO BREAK OUT AGAIN AND ITS GETTING WORSE. I REALLY DONT KNOW THOUGH IF ITS PROACTIVE OR MY SKIN. BUT FOR A PERSON FIRST TRYING OUT PROACTIVE, OH IT WORKS.. BUT IVE BEEN USING IT IT FOR YEAAARRSS...AND ITS HELD UP FOR ME FOR THE MOST PART.</li>
            <li> My face had never looked so bad, at 6 months pregnant, I was desperate.  I used to use proactive to clear my face up, I thought I should try it again.  Took a few weeks but my face is dramatically better.  The left side is still bad but im sure its because I sleep on it too much and need to stop doing that.  My right side is completely.  cear and so is my forehead.  I can assure you my entire face was a railway disaster before this and now it looks way better, even presentable.  The shipping was great too.  I expected to get it a week after I actually did, but maybe it took 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> I had not ever in my life experienced break outs much less acne up until full on menopause started... Proactive Advanced 4 pc kit has been a goddess send for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed by my 4th use my skin was clearing up, looking brighter and best of all was NOT drying out.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Proactive to any woman going through the lovely tops survey world of menopause....</li>
            <li> since I started the treatment with this product, my problems with heavy acne have disappear completely.  It is really incredible how fast it works.</li>
            <li> I received all except the refining mask.  Very disappointed that I did not receive my complete order. Not sure if I will get this again.</li>
            <li> been using proactiv for 11 years and i know what the products smell like. this is the real deal. no bs.</li>
            <li> My son needed this to clear his face. We have tried everything and even prescription wash, we are the most comfortable with Proactiv and it seemed to work quite well.</li>
            <li> My husband used Proactiv years ago when he was younger and it worked like magic.  I recently bought this for my 13-year old niece who is now going through puberty and has some acne.  After just 2 weeks, her skin already looks soo much better. I swear by this stuff! It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny</li>
            <li> Pimples are going away only 1 stubborn 1 but is working.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think proactiv does much for me except dry my skin out. I have oily skin anyways and while this may take care of that aspect, it&#x27;s like it sucks all the moisture out too.</li>
            <li> Product is working wonderfully! Highly recommend it for those with oily skin and bad acne.</li>
            <li> I received my Proactiv Kit in the mail today. I&#x27;m very Satisfied. Thank You R&amp;M Shop! * * * * * 5 STARS * * * * *</li>
            <li> Excellent arrived as planned</li>
            <li> I have adult acne.  I have tried every skin care line possible ranging in all sorts of prices.  This product works.  Despite saying that it would take at least 2 weeks to notice a change, I noticed it after a couple of days.  I bought more sets for my teenagers.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that has worked for my adult rosacea&lt;br /&gt;I am 65 years old and glad to have discovered it</li>
            <li> Great! product!!! Very nice no issues!</li>
            <li> I have used acne fighting products for 13 years and even been on prescriptions.  Pro-Activ has been the most effective product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In about two weeks of consistent use my skin clears up significantly and I only get the occasional blemish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask does an excellent job of refining pores and evening skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I decrease my usage to once a day, within a few days I am breaking out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I do not use ALL THREE products every single time, I break out in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active ingredient stains my clothes, so be sure to wash your hands after applying the product to your face.  It may also stain sheets and pillow cases.</li>
            <li> Came on time, exp date was not untill 2014. Saved me money and made my wife happy. Win for me</li>
            <li> Worth the price. You get more for ur buck and u dont need to be a proactive member where they charge  you monthly.</li>
            <li> I never had acne until I was an adult, being in my middle 30&#x27;s I was at a loss , I have tried all kinds of over the counter facial cleaners , including expensive brands. So I decided one last try and I would try Proactiv,  NOT wanting a membership or repeat orders, I went with this , the price was great, and now that I have been using it for 30 days . I have seen an amazing difference. I would recommend this to anyone with acne issues, either mild or severe</li>
            <li> lo recomiendo mucho bhghghg&lt;br /&gt;hkbhbhbkjkhjhjkhkjhkhjk hjhuh huhh huk hk huk hk gyg yg yy ii giy ygbgbyby fut ubkhk i</li>
            <li> Came as described, but was almost expired. I bought it for my boyfriend, and he couldn&#x27;t use it all before the dates printed on the bottles.</li>
            <li> good, recommend this!</li>
            <li> &#x27;nuff said! (But according to the rules I need 18 words so here are some of those words, OK? OK.)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this stuff! Fast delivery too</li>
            <li> Fast shipping - Great size!  I think the original Proactiv is SO MUCH better than Proactiv+... the new formula casued my skin to regress back to my teenage years :(  So glad I can still get the original formula!</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star be cause I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I see so much difference in my face. My face looks clearer and more even toned and my pimples are slowly going away. I will purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this kit of proactive.  My daughter uses this stuff every morning and evening, and while it works great, it gets a bit pricey.  The price was unbeatable for the amount that you get, at least from all my research.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv Solution in the past with positive results; and have seen the same results this time.  I like the larger bottles. Also, I especially enjoy the convenience of ordering whenever I need it.  Ordering from Amazon means I don&#x27;t have to join a club to receive the products.  I got my order in a timely manner and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am acne free! I bought this set in June and I am still using it. Have not ran out and I use it every day. I wear makeup daily and my face is clean clear and balanced with no dry patches, don&#x27;t even have to rely on makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Even during this harsh cold Washington Winter Weather no dry flaking skin. This was the best change for my face in my mid-30&#x27;s, bc your skin does change and you will find old products stop working. My sister in her 40&#x27;s was using it and so I bought the set after seeing her skin glow. Between lots of water and juicing in the morning my skin radiates! I no longer have fine bumps on my chest as I use it on my chest maybe once a week and now I don&#x27;t even use it as often. And I drink strong coffee once a day if this is helpful to someone&#x27;s caffeine concern. Love Proactive!</li>
            <li> I like the proactive but when it arrived it was missing the refining mask. It was packaged in such a way that things could easily fall out or get taken out. Other than that I liked what product did yet to me.</li>
            <li> I have tryed several other products and had no luck. First time i tried proactiv i wasnt sure afterbthe firsttwo weeks cause my acne got worse but i kept useing it and now my face is clear n im not embarrassed by my acne.</li>
            <li> I love Proactive solution. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years and it has been the only system that works for my skin. The 1 star is not for the product but for the seller! I purchased this 120 day supply at the end of April 2014. When I received it I noticed the expiration date read July 2014. You don&#x27;t have to be a math wizard to figure that one out. In addition the shipping was late. Amazon guaranteed it for Monday, the package arrived Tuesday. Super frustrating when you paid extra for rush shipping.</li>
            <li> This set works GREAT at healing adult acne. I was having bad flare ups, primarily on my cheeks, and this seems to have done the trick in calming down my skin. I chose to purchase the set from Amazon as opposed to Proactiv because unbeknownst to most consumers, once you order from Proactiv&#x27;s website, you become a &amp;#34;subscribing member&amp;#34; and have to pay semi-annual dues of ~$50... On top of whatever Proactiv kit you actually order! So it&#x27;s better to just buy from a seller on Amazon, so you don&#x27;t have those periodic &amp;#34;dues.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am very impressed. using it for 2 weeks now. and its cleared up my skin! I hope it continues to do a good job. Im worried that it will dry out my skin, but so far its been ok!</li>
            <li> so far so good  it works</li>
            <li> When I used just one step it was OK, but when i used all the steps correctly it dried my face out so bad it hurt!</li>
            <li> When I first started using Proactiv at 15, it did wonders.  But after a while I think it loses it&#x27;s potency in treating and preventing acne.  But after years of trying other unsuccessful products I start using this again.  It&#x27;s not as great as when I first started using this but it&#x27;s still the best product I&#x27;ve found for acne.</li>
            <li> My son feels like he has his acne under control. He still get the occassional pimple, but it is not like it was before. Would definitely recommend this for your teen who is stuggling with acne.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son who is 14.  It really works well he only needs to use it ounce daily.  Much cheaper then taking him to a Dermatologist.  If anyone reads this review I suggest trying this product 1st before a doctors appointment.</li>
