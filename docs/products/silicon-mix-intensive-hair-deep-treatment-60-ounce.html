            <li>thanks for the shipping, product is very good</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and gets tangles very easily, leading to hair breakage/damage.</li>

            <li>The best one that I have ever used so far.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but for me, it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the bambu formula.</li>
            <li>If it can transform my hair for the better, it will do it for you.</li>

            <li>My hair did not care for it as much but good smelling and silky.</li>
            <li>I could find a way to bring the aroma down a notch or two, it would be the most perfect hair product this side of Heaven!  </li>
            <li>To be honest they should&#x27;ve put in a box with more bubble wrap, not in a large envelope with some bubble wrap around it.</li>
            <li>While it did make my hair a little softer, it didn&#x27;t hold up to the many reviews of it being the best product ever.</li>
            <li>I can easily comb my hair out with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>VERY worthy product.</li>

            <li>Some say the smell is too strong</li>
            <li>I strongly recommended for you as well..</li>
            <li>Strong Chemical smell.</li>
            <li>While I was gone, my husband walked into the kitchen, saw this large container of silicon, mistook it for something he had ordered for waxing the car, and out he went to use it on the car!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in a year and this stuff let me run a fine tooth comb through my hair no problem.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this hair product leaves my hair super soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great choice since it was a large amount for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>so smooth</li>
            <li>Love LOve Love this product on my natural hair as well as extensions...</li>
            <li>Keeping it light and shining His Light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the results and the smell is fresh</li>
            <li>It is something that is cheap</li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S how much success I have enjoyed with Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li>I have to order via the states as it isn&#x27;t available in Canada</li>
            <li>I only use this as a leave in conditioner, and it has been great.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after seeing a lot of reviews, and so far its working good</li>
            <li>To make your weave soft and smell good</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I simply love this product, i&#x27;ve purchased every oz available, it&#x27;s truly worth the money, and in my opinion very affordable if you are on a healthy hair journey.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is strong but not unpleasant</li>
            <li>--it works great on Caucasian hair, too--especially long hair or extension hair.</li>
            <li>so I want to compare it to the original Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li>If anyone has any helpful hints for me I would be more then willing to try it</li>
            <li>When I tried using this with the conditioner first, the scent was much more manageable and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Your hair will be silky and will smell nice, clean and fresh for days even when it is super hot in Florida.</li>
            <li>I am currently using garnier conditioner and I let it sit for a couple of minutes then apply a nice scoop of Silicon mix on top of it.</li>
            <li>I had very high expectations for this product because I LOVE the bambu formula.</li>
            <li>I am 52 years old with the best looking long hair; the longest my hair has been in my life.</li>
            <li>But I love it so much I will probably order again.</li>
            <li>and it last forever, just like good marriage.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>my hair was nice and soft again.</li>
            <li>I love it , it really helps to mostorise your hair.and</li>
            <li>I finally found a seller that gives me a good price.</li>
            <li>Best treatment for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to go under the dryer for a deep condition, especially if you roller set your hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my ends from splitting and allows my hair to grow quickly without breaking.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair product for conditioning your hair, especially if you have naturally curly hair and trying to achieve a straight look.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks so smooth and straight!</li>
            <li>I am new to wearing wigs (lace) and I make sure that I condition both my hair and my unit with the mix</li>
            <li>i love to use on my new growth...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product works really good for dry damaged hair</li>
            <li>I had used this product for years and it is good, I recommend it for dry hair it is a intensive treatment for falling hair</li>
            <li>I probably should have gotten a smaller container in the first place, but I thought it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>Love it for my weave &amp; natural hair!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it)</li>
            <li>(smile)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, just wanted to share a laugh or two.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>but it is WORTH it.</li>
            <li>But trust me this stuff is worth</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, the product does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Once again today, I used Silicon Mix on my now VERY healthy, very long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m eager to try the bamboo simply because I&#x27;m in love with this original Intensive Hair Treatment</li>
            <li>The comb glides right through.</li>
            <li>I tried it again, but after shampooing I put on my normal conditioner and put the Silicon Mix on top of it, and didn&#x27;t use as much.  </li>
            <li>This is a very heavy mixture and it may be great for some, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this product I didn&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this because of all the high recommendations/ratings.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy and yet after wards makes my curls so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Before when I was using it on its own I would add oil to my hair and my hair would be just as dry and its because the silicon mix was blocking anything from getting into my hair.  </li>
            <li>Amazon customer was great enough to contact me regarding my subsequent purchases of this product, Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li>Amazon customer was great enough to contact me regarding my subsequent purchases of this product, Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft after using it and its soooo easy to detangle when I am rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>I expected better results on my hair!</li>
            <li>This mask for hydration and very good...really makes their effect on hair i like her very much!</li>
            <li>My hair is normally on the dry side, so perhaps that program will not be good for people with oilier hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, he didn&#x27;t use very much, and I was able to get it back for using it on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still super excited and shocked at how wonderful my hair feels!!!!</li>
            <li>It works really well on my weave!</li>
            <li>Since using this the first time, it gave my hair LIFE.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty fragrant.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do any more for my hair even after lengthy deep conditioning, than a drug store brand.    </li>
            <li>Plus, it is not expensive</li>
            <li>As for the smell, it is overpowering at first but after repeated use, either you get used to it and become immune to the smell or the hair has assimilated to the lotion</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its possible to make this product better but maybe.</li>
            <li>and i have never in my life felt my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It first appears to be surface oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that after I shampoo I need to put a moisturising conditioner on first.</li>
            <li>So by adding the moisturising conditioner first then this mix you are locking in the moisture instead of blocking it.</li>
            <li>it made my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Silicon Mix....absolutely repaired my hair in the first application.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m on top of my hair care product research for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li>NOTHING compares to this product (mixed with some Kanechom) keeping my full lace wig hair hydrated and smooth longer.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, usually I only use for my extensions, however,</li>
            <li>, shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silky soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I first found this product on a saloon.  </li>
            <li>Best deep conditioner I have ever used especially when mixed with kanechom</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff and use it religiously!  </li>
            <li>so I was able to scoop everything and put it back in the bag</li>
            <li>Love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I used a little bit as a leave in after I conditioned and this is the best my hair felt in a very, very long time.</li>
            <li>It really adds moisture and makes you hair managable, supple, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I never use conditioners provided with them or with elaxers, I just use this &amp; the big jug lasts for a good while so definitely worht every penny.</li>
            <li>This friend sings the praises of Silicon Mix, too; this from a 60 year old professional who has tried, used and endorsed some of the world&#x27;s top products.</li>
            <li>Its strong enough that the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li>it restores my units like new and smells fantastica!!</li>
            <li>My daughter has curly frizzy hair ( and we live in south Florida!!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good deep conditioner; especially for dry course hair.</li>
            <li>I aplied my silicon mix three times a week for about an hour, I actually used this only 5 times, but I swear my hair looks so much better and healthier now!</li>
            <li>When I use the silicon mix, then blow dry and flat iron it, it is gorgeous with lots of body.</li>
            <li>Will I buy this big freaky huge container again?  </li>
            <li>I have very curly ethnic hair &amp; it helps so much with untangling &amp; conditioning.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and use head tool very often.</li>
            <li>For those with allergies it might be too much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipper👍</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it too much as it will build up on your hair</li>
            <li>I used it on my real hair and also on my extensions</li>
            <li>I have naturally very curly hair</li>
            <li>I really dont understand why it didnt work for me</li>
            <li>It smells like a cheap perfume that you might find at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>Meaning it has so much mineral oil it will block moisture and oils from penetrating the hair.</li>
            <li>When you rinse your hair you really feel the difference.</li>
            <li>i really recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li>i encourage all to use i. thanks  SILICON MIX Intensive</li>
            <li>I scraped up what I could, because I really needed it for my clients.</li>
            <li>I use it on my weaves and my real hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my weave and my real hair so silky.</li>
            <li>Cant tell yet how much it will help my hair repair.</li>
            <li>this product really makes hair silky</li>
            <li>I have kinky hair and my hair smelled so good and felt so soft even after it air dried.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner, normally after wash and go, my hair would be dry as straw, after 2 hours; but this product left my hair soft for days.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner will make the hair silky straight on African American hair when u flat iron it</li>
            <li>this mixed with crece pelo and other oils work great to conditioncondition and moisturize my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>However the smell of the mix is very strong and will last till your next washing.</li>
            <li>This item is a life saver for a lazy person that made good hair look like trash one wash with this product and my Brazilian hair came right back to life</li>
            <li>This product may not be all that great on natural African American hair but works wonders on extensions especially deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my hair didn&#x27;t feel very silky and more or less hung there.</li>
            <li>With the first use I noticed my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I brought it was condition my extensions, but I used it on my natural hair first</li>
            <li>I contacted them to let them know they sent me a new no questions asked!</li>
            <li>Revives your hair and makes it brand new!</li>
            <li>Made my weave feel like brand new!</li>
            <li>and I live in a very humid climate.</li>
            <li>still have half of the pot and sure will buy another</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sure it will do wonders with persons with less dense hair.</li>
            <li>This is my main hair conditioner...</li>
            <li>I expected more natural ingredients tho.  </li>

            <li>Very good, but smells realy bad</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the smell is a strong and over powering as some other users have said but everyone has different sensitivity.</li>

            <li>I use it for my natural clients to straighten hair.</li>
            <li>As far as the SMELL.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about a 3c/4a natural mix, so my hair will resist, fight and protest if the product doesn&#x27;t agree with it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t run into any problems so far.</li>
            <li>My hair is so silk soft when I am finished.  </li>

            <li>It makes my natural hair so manageable and standard shipping arrived early!</li>

            <li>Gives you very professional results, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I use it with my deep conditioner, so I usually leave it on for up to an hour with heat and my hair or my weave comes out so soft, silky, and smooth.  </li>

            <li>Having tried and wasted $$$ low, high and very high priced salon and drugstore products (Joico, Redken, Nexxus, CHI etc)</li>
            <li>Maybe on hard to manage hair or already straight hair, but mine is wavy and it didn&#x27;t really make a lot of difference.</li>
            <li>I use several different conditioners and it wins hands down.</li>
            <li>I really LOVED the price for this, that you cannot beat, but it didn&#x27;t outweigh the fact that the smell was offensive to people near me :(</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t live in an urban center where this product is sold everywhere, then you need to order it online.  </li>
            <li>Either way, my once coarse dry brittle hair looks as if it was professionally managed.</li>

            <li>Ladies let me say my weave was a little fried on the ends as I used my curling iron a bit too much but</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not leave my hair sticky, dry, hard or anything like other conditioners tend to do to many peoples&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li>Too heavy for thin fine straight hair.</li>

            <li> Very happy with the product will buy again thanks</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if your hair is not finicky with products and you are able to use cones with no problem than this would probably be a good product.</li>
            <li> i got volume, no tangles and to be honest the sent</li>
            <li> This makes by own hair as well as my wigs so so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> It was still kind of frizzy after giving it two weeks to try out.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> thanks for the shipping, product is very good</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and gets tangles very easily, leading to hair breakage/damage.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my hair overnight and it makes my hair so soft and silky and smell so great!</li>
            <li> The best one that I have ever used so far.  </li>

            <li> The seller has excellent customer service, package came already open ..</li>
            <li> and I like this better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t replace a anti break therapy protein treatment but for deep conditioning I like this best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If it works Then it works and my hair love it.</li>
            <li> Mixed together these two treatments are awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizing treatments but none of them come close to the conditioning properties of Silicon Mix.  </li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all know how burnt hair smells!  :-).</li>

            <li> I saturate my hair and my daughters with this and leave in for an hour or more.</li>
            <li> The longer you leave it on, the better results you receive...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but for me, it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the bambu formula.</li>
            <li> If it can transform my hair for the better, it will do it for you.</li>
            <li> How can anything like this get better?</li>
            <li> My hair is so healthy and shiny that my bobby pins slipped out two hours.</li>

            <li> Try it and you will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> If you are natural and most importantly if you wear weaves this is the best conditioner to have  </li>
            <li> I added oil to mine to make sure my hair was getting all of the moisture and oils that it needed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>

            <li> My hair did not care for it as much but good smelling and silky.</li>
            <li> I could find a way to bring the aroma down a notch or two, it would be the most perfect hair product this side of Heaven!  </li>
            <li> To be honest they should&#x27;ve put in a box with more bubble wrap, not in a large envelope with some bubble wrap around it.</li>
            <li> While it did make my hair a little softer, it didn&#x27;t hold up to the many reviews of it being the best product ever.</li>
            <li> I can easily comb my hair out with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> VERY worthy product.</li>
            <li> VERY worthy product.</li>
            <li> My hair easily tangles.</li>
            <li> easily coats everything.</li>
            <li> Some say the smell is too strong</li>
            <li> I strongly recommended for you as well..</li>
            <li> Strong Chemical smell.</li>
            <li> While I was gone, my husband walked into the kitchen, saw this large container of silicon, mistook it for something he had ordered for waxing the car, and out he went to use it on the car!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in a year and this stuff let me run a fine tooth comb through my hair no problem.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair product leaves my hair super soft and smells so good.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great choice since it was a large amount for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> so smooth</li>
            <li> Love LOve Love this product on my natural hair as well as extensions...</li>
            <li> Keeping it light and shining His Light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the results and the smell is fresh</li>
            <li> It is something that is cheap</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S how much success I have enjoyed with Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li> I have to order via the states as it isn&#x27;t available in Canada</li>
            <li> I only use this as a leave in conditioner, and it has been great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing a lot of reviews, and so far its working good</li>
            <li> To make your weave soft and smell good</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product, i&#x27;ve purchased every oz available, it&#x27;s truly worth the money, and in my opinion very affordable if you are on a healthy hair journey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is strong but not unpleasant</li>
            <li> --it works great on Caucasian hair, too--especially long hair or extension hair.</li>
            <li> so I want to compare it to the original Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li> If anyone has any helpful hints for me I would be more then willing to try it</li>
            <li> When I tried using this with the conditioner first, the scent was much more manageable and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Your hair will be silky and will smell nice, clean and fresh for days even when it is super hot in Florida.</li>
            <li> I am currently using garnier conditioner and I let it sit for a couple of minutes then apply a nice scoop of Silicon mix on top of it.</li>
            <li> I had very high expectations for this product because I LOVE the bambu formula.</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old with the best looking long hair; the longest my hair has been in my life.</li>
            <li> But I love it so much I will probably order again.</li>
            <li> and it last forever, just like good marriage.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> my hair was nice and soft again.</li>
            <li> I love it , it really helps to mostorise your hair.and</li>
            <li> I finally found a seller that gives me a good price.</li>
            <li> Best treatment for thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to go under the dryer for a deep condition, especially if you roller set your hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my ends from splitting and allows my hair to grow quickly without breaking.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product for conditioning your hair, especially if you have naturally curly hair and trying to achieve a straight look.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks so smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> I am new to wearing wigs (lace) and I make sure that I condition both my hair and my unit with the mix</li>
            <li> i love to use on my new growth...</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product works really good for dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> I had used this product for years and it is good, I recommend it for dry hair it is a intensive treatment for falling hair</li>
            <li> I probably should have gotten a smaller container in the first place, but I thought it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love it for my weave &amp; natural hair!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth it)</li>
            <li> (smile)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, just wanted to share a laugh or two.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> but it is WORTH it.</li>
            <li> But trust me this stuff is worth</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, the product does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Once again today, I used Silicon Mix on my now VERY healthy, very long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m eager to try the bamboo simply because I&#x27;m in love with this original Intensive Hair Treatment</li>
            <li> The comb glides right through.</li>
            <li> I tried it again, but after shampooing I put on my normal conditioner and put the Silicon Mix on top of it, and didn&#x27;t use as much.  </li>
            <li> This is a very heavy mixture and it may be great for some, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this product I didn&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because of all the high recommendations/ratings.</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy and yet after wards makes my curls so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Before when I was using it on its own I would add oil to my hair and my hair would be just as dry and its because the silicon mix was blocking anything from getting into my hair.  </li>
            <li> Amazon customer was great enough to contact me regarding my subsequent purchases of this product, Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li> Amazon customer was great enough to contact me regarding my subsequent purchases of this product, Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft after using it and its soooo easy to detangle when I am rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> I expected better results on my hair!</li>
            <li> This mask for hydration and very good...really makes their effect on hair i like her very much!</li>
            <li> My hair is normally on the dry side, so perhaps that program will not be good for people with oilier hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, he didn&#x27;t use very much, and I was able to get it back for using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still super excited and shocked at how wonderful my hair feels!!!!</li>
            <li> It works really well on my weave!</li>
            <li> Since using this the first time, it gave my hair LIFE.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty fragrant.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do any more for my hair even after lengthy deep conditioning, than a drug store brand.    </li>
            <li> Plus, it is not expensive</li>
            <li> As for the smell, it is overpowering at first but after repeated use, either you get used to it and become immune to the smell or the hair has assimilated to the lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its possible to make this product better but maybe.</li>
            <li> and i have never in my life felt my hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It first appears to be surface oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that after I shampoo I need to put a moisturising conditioner on first.</li>
            <li> So by adding the moisturising conditioner first then this mix you are locking in the moisture instead of blocking it.</li>
            <li> it made my hair soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Silicon Mix....absolutely repaired my hair in the first application.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m on top of my hair care product research for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> NOTHING compares to this product (mixed with some Kanechom) keeping my full lace wig hair hydrated and smooth longer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, usually I only use for my extensions, however,</li>
            <li> , shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I first found this product on a saloon.  </li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner I have ever used especially when mixed with kanechom</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff and use it religiously!  </li>
            <li> so I was able to scoop everything and put it back in the bag</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used a little bit as a leave in after I conditioned and this is the best my hair felt in a very, very long time.</li>
            <li> It really adds moisture and makes you hair managable, supple, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I never use conditioners provided with them or with elaxers, I just use this &amp; the big jug lasts for a good while so definitely worht every penny.</li>
            <li> This friend sings the praises of Silicon Mix, too; this from a 60 year old professional who has tried, used and endorsed some of the world&#x27;s top products.</li>
            <li> Its strong enough that the smell lasts all day.</li>
            <li> it restores my units like new and smells fantastica!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly frizzy hair ( and we live in south Florida!!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good deep conditioner; especially for dry course hair.</li>
            <li> I aplied my silicon mix three times a week for about an hour, I actually used this only 5 times, but I swear my hair looks so much better and healthier now!</li>
            <li> When I use the silicon mix, then blow dry and flat iron it, it is gorgeous with lots of body.</li>
            <li> Will I buy this big freaky huge container again?  </li>
            <li> I have very curly ethnic hair &amp; it helps so much with untangling &amp; conditioning.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and use head tool very often.</li>
            <li> For those with allergies it might be too much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipper👍</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it too much as it will build up on your hair</li>
            <li> I used it on my real hair and also on my extensions</li>
            <li> I have naturally very curly hair</li>
            <li> I really dont understand why it didnt work for me</li>
            <li> It smells like a cheap perfume that you might find at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Meaning it has so much mineral oil it will block moisture and oils from penetrating the hair.</li>
            <li> When you rinse your hair you really feel the difference.</li>
            <li> i really recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> i encourage all to use i. thanks  SILICON MIX Intensive</li>
            <li> I scraped up what I could, because I really needed it for my clients.</li>
            <li> I use it on my weaves and my real hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my weave and my real hair so silky.</li>
            <li> Cant tell yet how much it will help my hair repair.</li>
            <li> this product really makes hair silky</li>
            <li> I have kinky hair and my hair smelled so good and felt so soft even after it air dried.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, normally after wash and go, my hair would be dry as straw, after 2 hours; but this product left my hair soft for days.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner will make the hair silky straight on African American hair when u flat iron it</li>
            <li> this mixed with crece pelo and other oils work great to conditioncondition and moisturize my naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> However the smell of the mix is very strong and will last till your next washing.</li>
            <li> This item is a life saver for a lazy person that made good hair look like trash one wash with this product and my Brazilian hair came right back to life</li>
            <li> This product may not be all that great on natural African American hair but works wonders on extensions especially deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my hair didn&#x27;t feel very silky and more or less hung there.</li>
            <li> With the first use I noticed my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I brought it was condition my extensions, but I used it on my natural hair first</li>
            <li> I contacted them to let them know they sent me a new no questions asked!</li>
            <li> Revives your hair and makes it brand new!</li>
            <li> Made my weave feel like brand new!</li>
            <li> and I live in a very humid climate.</li>
            <li> still have half of the pot and sure will buy another</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m sure it will do wonders with persons with less dense hair.</li>
            <li> This is my main hair conditioner...</li>
            <li> I expected more natural ingredients tho.  </li>
            <li> In Januracy, I bought a third container of Silicon Mix;; in May, I bought my most recent container of the product.</li>

            <li> I had high expectations reading the reviews and seeing videos on YouTube explaining how beneficial the silicon mix conditioner is</li>

            <li> It leaves hair feeling soft and smooth and hair reverts back to natural state with no problems.</li>
            <li> It allows you to easily comb through tangles while your hair is wet, and it leaves a nice shine once your hair is dry, especially if you deep condition under a dryer for 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has changed my hair life :)  If you&#x27;ve been battling dry, coarse, and unmanageable hair</li>
            <li> Breaking off and basically falling out left and right.</li>

            <li> The fragrance that they use reminds me of sweet little old ladies, and whatever it is they wear.? ;)</li>
            <li> (Yes the smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> you can actually notice the difference the first time you use it .</li>

            <li> I strongly recommend this product, specially for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very good, but smells realy bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the smell is a strong and over powering as some other users have said but everyone has different sensitivity.</li>

            <li> As far as the SMELL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about a 3c/4a natural mix, so my hair will resist, fight and protest if the product doesn&#x27;t agree with it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t run into any problems so far.</li>
            <li> My hair is so silk soft when I am finished.  </li>
            <li> but then  after you rinse your hair well, my hair is still soft.  </li>

            <li> I got it in a decent time but the only thing that I did not like is when I opened it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it especially in this size.</li>
            <li> It makes my natural hair so manageable and standard shipping arrived early!</li>
            <li> I wear full lace wig due to medical issues.</li>
            <li> I sprayed hot water on my hair to wet it up.</li>
            <li> Having spent so much for the product, I still hope that it will have some positive effect on my hair eventually, though I feel less certain now.</li>

            <li> I have natural hair and it leaves my hair so silky, soft, and moisturized when mixed with kanechom argan hair treatment cream.</li>
            <li> Gives you very professional results, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I use it with my deep conditioner, so I usually leave it on for up to an hour with heat and my hair or my weave comes out so soft, silky, and smooth.  </li>

            <li> If I keep getting results like this I will be purchasing more of this when I get down to half of my jar!</li>
            <li> Having tried and wasted $$$ low, high and very high priced salon and drugstore products (Joico, Redken, Nexxus, CHI etc)</li>
            <li> Maybe on hard to manage hair or already straight hair, but mine is wavy and it didn&#x27;t really make a lot of difference.</li>
            <li> I use several different conditioners and it wins hands down.</li>
            <li> I really LOVED the price for this, that you cannot beat, but it didn&#x27;t outweigh the fact that the smell was offensive to people near me :(</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t live in an urban center where this product is sold everywhere, then you need to order it online.  </li>
            <li> Either way, my once coarse dry brittle hair looks as if it was professionally managed.</li>
            <li> Either way, my once coarse dry brittle hair looks as if it was professionally managed.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have a friend who is a professional (retired) hairdresser who loyal to expensive professional hair care lines.</li>
            <li> Ladies let me say my weave was a little fried on the ends as I used my curling iron a bit too much but</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not leave my hair sticky, dry, hard or anything like other conditioners tend to do to many peoples&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for thin fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old (hmmm, actually, 53.5 years old) with very long (half-way down my back) colored hair.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old (hmmm, actually, 53.5 years old) with very long (half-way down my back) colored hair.</li>
            <li> i mixed it with the kanechom ultimate karate butter after washing my hair as a deep conditioning treatment… I sat under the dry for about 30 mins then washed it out</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any major difference between this product and any other of the same category...</li>
            <li> It works wonders and only has to be applied once a week which makes the product last a very long time.</li>
            <li> We have african natural no perm or chemical hair and less breakage because of this product.</li>
            <li> I read reviews stating that the silicone mix leaves your hair flat greasy and waxy.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with baby shampoo and then put a big handful of the silicone mix in my hair and leftist in for 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> that over powers the smell of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I tried this product just after shampooing and leaving on for as long as possible, letting the steam of the shower do the work.  </li>
            <li> The scent did go down later in the day, but if I sniffed my hair, it was very apparent.  </li>
            <li> detangles, smoothens, and moisturize all of your hair and last a very long time .</li>
            <li> I bought 2 big tubs of the product (60 oz each) in anticipation of its miraculous properties of softening and straightening my dry hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell - very perfum-ey.</li>
            <li> BTW, I want you to know that after I rinse Silicon Mix, I apply One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil before blowdrying or letting it air dry.</li>
            <li> BTW, I want you to know that after I rinse Silicon Mix, I apply One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil before blowdrying or letting it air dry.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t necessarily have to use it in the shower, your hair just has to be wet and washed you can use a regular conditioner before this</li>
            <li> I read somewhere that someone said it smells like a bunch of old ladies, that is so not true.</li>
            <li> When I flat iron it without the silicon treatment, it looks frizzy and not professionally done.</li>
            <li> I can wash and condition my hair, blow dry and flat iron, and not have to use additional products to keep it flat.</li>
            <li> ( I only use it only every other week)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and it has a little bit of protein.</li>
            <li> and I like the fact that the smells stays in ur hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> I know this is a long review</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry and not soft at all.</li>
            <li> Whether you choose to use it or not is as personal of a preference as any other product.</li>
            <li> I rinsed and let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> but this product will dry your hair out over time.</li>
            <li> I have biracial hair that tends to be on the DRY side.</li>
            <li> id DRY</li>
            <li> I rinse and let air dry.</li>
            <li> I can not live without it.</li>
            <li> I have 3C/4A curly thick high porosity hair.</li>
            <li> I only used the Silicon Mix b/c I wanted to see how it would do just by itself without using any other conditioner with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half African American &amp; half Puerto Rican and I must say Dominican products rule on my Hair.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest this to anyone looking for a leave in, on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I had always had a hard time keeping my hair soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Alot less time was spent with my ceramic flat iron, too.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and carefully packed.</li>
            <li> I have thick 4b hair and this transforms my coarse hair to soft, fluffy, and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Then put in your hair (wet).</li>
            <li> Almost like the pink capped Downy.  </li>
            <li> so I will be back to do an update once I&#x27;ve used half the jar!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years, and I realized right away that something was wrong with that bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Thankfully, a little of this product goes a long, long way; so that, in and of itself, will cut down on the strength of the aroma.</li>
            <li> I have natural curly long (and thin) hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so no need to slather it on.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ordered three 60oz bottles of the silicon hair treatment and one of the bottles had some other substance inside (not the hair treatment).</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of the other Silicon Mix products which have not yet arrived.</li>
            <li> I use it every two weeks due to my bleached damage hair.</li>
            <li> Also it left my hair very heavy with a coating of something like maybe oily.</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product but was shy about ordering.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to weight my hair down.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t just work on Black hair</li>
            <li> i wont order anything less than a 60 oz.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived half of the product spilled out into the plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> Silicon mix is a must for all Black and Hispanic hair types.</li>
            <li> This time my hair was still silky, had some shine, and less frizz.  </li>
            <li> This time 1/3 of content was spilled out and quite a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial,  and have really long,  thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick and dry, so if you have this hair type, I suggest the bambu formula.</li>
            <li> I took one of my little jars, (think Taliah Wajeed Curly Cream jar)</li>
            <li> did my little mix and off to the shower I went.</li>
            <li> ive had this for 6 months i use a little bit on days</li>
            <li> I got in the shower and let the water run on it a little and then proceeded to take my shower.</li>
            <li> Although I had to change containers because my container came broken open</li>
            <li> a waste of money&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> also co-washed a few bundles of 100% brazilian hair with this product and the results were wonderful!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I use it once a week , leave it on for a few minutes and the rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Around the crown area in front where my baby hair is looked a tad thinned out for some reason, and a few weeks of Silicon Mix has thickened it up and made it grow like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left a very heavy scent that was not pleasant to me or my husband.</li>
            <li> but it stinks to high heaven</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders, receives color every 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li> I will add some CHI silk infusion to keep up hydration and extend past 5-6 days.</li>
            <li> Sorry so long.</li>
            <li> Sorry so long.</li>
            <li> hard to find this size here in Miami.</li>
            <li> I tried so hard to like it.</li>
            <li> Its helps treat damaged or hard to manage hair.</li>
            <li> Its not a nice smell at all.</li>
            <li> came open, all poured into the box, I am very sad with you ...</li>
            <li> If your hair hates cones this is not a good product for you.</li>
            <li> MADE MY HAIR VERY HARD TO MANAGE</li>
            <li> The product came broken and spilled</li>
            <li> I recommended it to all my girlfriends and they all got addicted to it.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I&#x27;m not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> And when I got it in the mail , the cap was broken and about a handful spilled out onto the bubble wrap that was holding it in.</li>
            <li> Not happy.....</li>
            <li> The reason I stopped using this products is because it smells absolutely horrible to the point where my Husband&#x27;s nose was offended everytime he was near my hair.    </li>
            <li> When I moved to MD, I was unable to find it anywhere except Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I agree with T. Lawrence--I am addicted to Silicon Mix!    </li>
            <li> This is where I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> My hair takes a beating and looks like it, sadly.</li>
            <li> Like you, if a product or service fails me, I move away from that prduct or service.</li>
            <li> Your product outperforms anything on a store shelf, anything  in any expensive salon.taken worry and stress off my mind about how my hair looks.</li>

            <li> but it was very hard to get and very expensive.  </li>
            <li> so well I was afraid that it may have been a relaxer</li>
            <li> I used to use oil and water, but that just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore.</li>
            <li> omg it smells so bad..</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> came open, all poured into the box, I am very sad with you ...</li>
            <li> The best working for my hair.</li>
            <li> worked well for the person I gave it to. My hair did not care for it as much but good smelling and silky.</li>
            <li> It works really well on my weave!</li>
            <li> I am of both African American and Indian decent, and I have transitioned from a relaxer to natural hair. I co-wash my hair during the summer time and this product is perfect for that. It keeps my hair soft and helps it retain moisture. When I discovered the product, the girl in the video recommends that you mix it with some type of Kanechom Brazilian Hair  conditioner, but I have found that it work well with any type of conditioner. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you have natural hair (kinky, curly hair) I&#x27;m half African American &amp; half Puerto Rican and I must say Dominican products rule on my Hair.  I can easily comb my hair out with the conditioner. It makes it so easy and yet after wards makes my curls so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Need I say more? Run don&#x27;t walk to your nearest hair supply store and try this product- you won&#x27;t believe the transformation. Better yet order from AMAZON!</li>
            <li> our love is conditional it makes your hair feel so wonderful I ordered it from Amazon because the price was great I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> The product is as awesome as everyone says however when i got it the cap was still intact but the contents had spilled all over the inside of the box</li>
            <li> I saw this at a Dominican salon. It&#x27;s a great conditioner. It really adds moisture and makes you hair managable, supple, soft and smooth. It&#x27;s best to go under the dryer for a deep condition, especially if you roller set your hair. I have relaxed hair and do my wash and sets at home. It smells great. Gives you very professional results, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years now. I can not live without it. I have very curly ethnic hair &amp; it helps so much with untangling &amp; conditioning.</li>
            <li> I love this product I have bought it many times.This time 1/3 of content was spilled out and quite a mess. But I love it so much I will probably order again. My hair become silky, shiny no tangles and my curls are beautiful. Just rinse out well.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is strong but not unpleasant I even get compliments on it and I work in the fashion industry with fussy noses.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good price also!</li>
            <li> Product has very nice smell and my hairs feel smoother after I put this on. My daughter loves it too. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product works really good for dry damaged hair you can actually notice the difference the first time you use it .</li>
            <li> a constant in my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and use head tool very often. I use this twice a week and leaves my hair smelling great and shiny.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner in NY at a Dominican hair shop. When I moved to MD, I was unable to find it anywhere except Amazon.  This is a great product! It allows you to easily comb through tangles while your hair is wet, and it leaves a nice shine once your hair is dry, especially if you deep condition under a dryer for 5-10 minutes. This is my main hair conditioner...I have found NO others that suit up to it! I always recommend it to others, and now they order it online as well.  As an added bonus, it has a nice smell that lasts in your hair for days!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and carefully packed. It is the best detangler I have ever used! The smell is like perfume, but I don&#x27;t mind. For those with allergies it might be too much. Try it, you will like it too.</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling SO fragile. Breaking off and basically falling out left and right. Since using this the first time, it gave my hair LIFE. I now deep condition with it once every two weeks. My hair loves it. The smell is pretty fragrant. But I like it.</li>
            <li> makes my hair really soft and it smells great.  I alternate this conditioner as to not to use it all the time I was my hair.  but I must say that I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product plus very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Great product for your hair. Leaves your hair and scalp nice a smooth. If you have time leave the conditioner in for about an hour.</li>
            <li> The reason I stopped using this products is because it smells absolutely horrible to the point where my Husband&#x27;s nose was offended everytime he was near my hair.    This product didn&#x27;t do any more for my hair even after lengthy deep conditioning, than a drug store brand.    I prefer the deep conditioning from Mixed Chicks, Mixed Silk, or BioInfusion Olive Oil deep conditioning treatments.    I really LOVED the price for this, that you cannot beat, but it didn&#x27;t outweigh the fact that the smell was offensive to people near me :(</li>
            <li> I am new to wearing wigs (lace) and I make sure that I condition both my hair and my unit with the mix and it is wonderful...it restores my units like new and smells fantastica!! Will never purchase antother conditioner!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling GREAT! I always get compliments on how great my hair smells whenever I use it. It also leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product--leaves hair silky and smooth and with a nice scent.  Plus, it is not expensive &#x3D;)    But it doesn&#x27;t just work on Black hair--it works great on Caucasian hair, too--especially long hair or extension hair. No tangles!    I agree with T. Lawrence--I am addicted to Silicon Mix!    If you have hair, you *need* this!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I LOVE THE SIZE.... hard to find this size here in Miami. Fast shipper👍</li>
            <li> I love my silicon mix it&#x27;s make the client hair so smooth n shine love it. thanks u😍😍😍😍</li>
            <li> The product came broken and spilled</li>
            <li> Love LOve Love this product on my natural hair as well as extensions...It is a great moisturizer as well as conditioning shampoo/conditioner.  It truly brings the hair back to life and the price is good!!!</li>
            <li> Great product ... Super fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 big tubs of the product (60 oz each) in anticipation of its miraculous properties of softening and straightening my dry hair but till now I still don&#x27;t see any effect on my hair at all. As for the smell, it is overpowering at first but after repeated use, either you get used to it and become immune to the smell or the hair has assimilated to the lotion and it no longer bothers me any more. Having spent so much for the product, I still hope that it will have some positive effect on my hair eventually, though I feel less certain now.</li>
            <li> I ordered three 60oz bottles of the silicon hair treatment and one of the bottles had some other substance inside (not the hair treatment). I have been using this product for years, and I realized right away that something was wrong with that bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Always makes my haird feel so soft, even when I color my hair I never use conditioners provided with them or with elaxers, I just use this &amp; the big jug lasts for a good while so definitely worht every penny. Love this product</li>
            <li> With the first use I noticed my hair soft and manageable. I also love the way it smells. Its strong enough that the smell lasts all day. Next I will be trying the Silicon mix bamboo. Just because is has vitamins so I want to compare it to the original Silicon Mix.</li>
            <li> great will be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> Received a used product...Will be returning it</li>
            <li> I simply love this product, i&#x27;ve purchased every oz available, it&#x27;s truly worth the money, and in my opinion very affordable if you are on a healthy hair journey. I will continue to support this line. I love everything that I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Silicon Mix. I&#x27;m eager to try the bamboo simply because I&#x27;m in love with this original Intensive Hair Treatment</li>
            <li> I had used this product for years and it is good, I recommend it for dry hair it is a intensive treatment for falling hair</li>
            <li> Stuff works wonders for my hair , it smells awesome. Although I had to change containers because my container came broken open</li>
            <li> Live this stuff. I read somewhere that someone said it smells like a bunch of old ladies, that is so not true. It smells so good and I like the fact that the smells stays in ur hair for a long time. Something g that smells horrible is aphrogee omg it smells so bad..</li>
            <li> I have medium fine dark brown hair, shoulder length hair. I bought goat milk mix and silicone mix after watching a YouTube video that swore the two as a mix was the greatest thing on the planet for hair.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER I bought both of these I read reviews stating that the silicone mix leaves your hair flat greasy and waxy. I decided to just use the goat mix. My hair felt dry and not soft at all. I looked at both these gigantic jars of white goo and thought &amp;#34;what a waste of money&amp;#34;. A month or so later I decided to just try the silicone mix. I washed my hair with baby shampoo and then put a big handful of the silicone mix in my hair and leftist in for 5 to 7 minutes. I rinsed and let my hair air dry. OMG!  I LOVE THE SILICONE MIX! My hair soft, shiny, and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope that my hair does not get the so called build up that I have read about.</li>
            <li> this is straight fire!!!!!! if silicon mix was a man i would get married and have silicon mix babies!!!! i love it and ive only tried it once. i wont order anything less than a 60 oz. jar and it last forever, just like good marriage. i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have yet to use it on my extensions but its awesome on my hair as well as my clients. I have natural hair and it leaves my hair so silky, soft, and moisturized when mixed with kanechom argan hair treatment cream. I haven&#x27;t tried it separate....</li>
            <li> I had high expectations reading the reviews and seeing videos on YouTube explaining how beneficial the silicon mix conditioner is and I have to say it surpassed my expectations I haven&#x27;t had a deep condition that made me hair feel sooo soft it feels healthy and I&#x27;m truly satisfied I also bought the kanechom conditioner and ill be mixing the two tomorrow I don&#x27;t know if its possible to make this product better but maybe. (Yes the smell is strong but doesn&#x27;t last that long and it&#x27;s worth it)</li>
            <li> Works great on natural hair along with weaves and the smell is wonderful. I highly recommend you try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, love the smell and does wonders for my hair. I mix mines with Kanechom and it yields great results.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!! It does wonders on your hair...natural or extensions. I highly recommend it especially in this size.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! It makes my natural hair so manageable and standard shipping arrived early!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing conditioner/ treatment! I use it as a deep conditioner and treatment. I leave it in my hair overnight and it makes my hair so soft and silky and smell so great! I don&#x27;t think the smell is a strong and over powering as some other users have said but everyone has different sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I leaves your hair (and you can use it on weaves as a co-wash as well as conditioner) sooo sliky smooth OMG!!! IT&#x27;S FANTASTIC! Loved it so much I had to buy more...ok..a few more..and I sought out a larger container of it as I don&#x27;t want to ever be without it.  Ladies let me say my weave was a little fried on the ends as I used my curling iron a bit too much but afer I washed my hair ..and conditioned it with this product (left it on for about 20min) my hair was nice and soft again. Warning..don&#x27;t use it too much as it will build up on your hair ( I only use it only every other week)&lt;br /&gt;I also co-washed a few bundles of 100% brazilian hair with this product and the results were wonderful!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product forever!!! Oh and the vendor was good too!! (smile)</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this stop thinking and by it already this stuff made my hair feel so soft and manageable. I haven&#x27;t had a relaxer in a year and this stuff let me run a fine tooth comb through my hair no problem. It worked so well I was afraid that it may have been a relaxer but my curls were popping</li>
            <li> Awesome! My cousins visited me and used my silicon mix and all become big fans of the product. Your hair will be silky and will smell nice, clean and fresh for days even when it is super hot in Florida.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff it makes my hair all shine a bounce</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago and I just love it! You can totally feel the difference since the first aplication, my hair is now so soft and shiny! I aplied my silicon mix three times a week for about an hour, I actually used this only 5 times, but I swear my hair looks so much better and healthier now! And its smell SO GOOD, you should totally get this product because is the best gift you can give to your hair, its worth every dollar, and you will love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a blogger from Brazil talking about this mask and decided to give it a try. Good thing I did, this mask is absolutely amazing. I can use it as a treatment, apply it and leave it on for a while or I can use it as a conditioner (which is what I am doing now). The results are excellent. My hair looks shinny, healthy, it smells really good and it does not leave my hair oily. If you are thinking about trying it, stop thinking and just buy it. I recommended it to all my girlfriends and they all got addicted to it. I wonder why.</li>
            <li> Well, any of you who have bought this 60 ounce container of Silicon Mix will know that it is HUGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I placed my Silicon Mix on the kitchen counter, and went into another room to get something from there. While I was gone, my husband walked into the kitchen, saw this large container of silicon, mistook it for something he had ordered for waxing the car, and out he went to use it on the car!!! OH, MY ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, this could have been a tragedy, however, girls, guess what?  Yep, it&#x27;s even good for waxing a car!!!  LOL, I kid you not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, he didn&#x27;t use very much, and I was able to get it back for using it on my hair. Making my hair soft, and shiny, and luxurious ... all for my man! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could find a way to bring the aroma down a notch or two, it would be the most perfect hair product this side of Heaven!  Thankfully, a little of this product goes a long, long way; so that, in and of itself, will cut down on the strength of the aroma. The fragrance that they use reminds me of sweet little old ladies, and whatever it is they wear.? ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, just wanted to share a laugh or two.  Keeping it light and shining His Light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;jd &amp;lt;&gt;&amp;lt;</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after seeing a lot of reviews, and so far its working good I used it on my real hair and also on my extensions and they are really soft and shiny. The seller has excellent customer service, package came already open .. I contacted them to let them know they sent me a new no questions asked! I would recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> i mixed it with the kanechom ultimate karate butter after washing my hair as a deep conditioning treatment… I sat under the dry for about 30 mins then washed it out and i have never in my life felt my hair so soft and smooth. I absolutely LOVE this product and would defiantly buy more and recommend it to everyone!!!! I&#x27;m still super excited and shocked at how wonderful my hair feels!!!!</li>
            <li> Great packaging by the seller. This product does what it says!! I am AA with natural hair, this leaves my hair soft and shiny with each use. I love the results and the smell is fresh</li>
            <li> Second time buying. I use it for my natural clients to straighten hair. It leaves hair feeling soft and smooth and hair reverts back to natural state with no problems.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this because of all the high recommendations/ratings. I have naturally very curly hair so I thought this would work for me. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and mixed with Kanechom Argan hair treatment cream for damaged hair. It seemed to weight my hair down. I couldnt do anything with it at all. I really dont understand why it didnt work for me but unfortunately I&#x27;m not happy with it.  As far as the SMELL. Its not a nice smell at all. I tried so hard to like it. Almost trying to psych myself out....it didnt work. It smells like a cheap perfume that you might find at the local drug store. Its bad!!  If anyone has any helpful hints for me I would be more then willing to try it and if it works I will change my review.</li>
            <li> While viewing the youtube videos, I&#x27;m never one to go by one person&#x27;s word as the gospel. This is where I was completely wrong. I mixed this with Kanechom Argan Hair Treatment. I took one of my little jars, (think Taliah Wajeed Curly Cream jar) did my little mix and off to the shower I went. I did a cowash, combthrough and then rinse. I didn&#x27;t even leave it on for 10 minutes. I felt the slip and knew this was the one!! A little goes a long way, so no need to slather it on. I used a little bit as a leave in after I conditioned and this is the best my hair felt in a very, very long time. I&#x27;m about a 3c/4a natural mix, so my hair will resist, fight and protest if the product doesn&#x27;t agree with it. My hair drank it in and absolutely loved it!!! This will be my forever mix!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product will buy again thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have hair type 4b.  I use several different conditioners and it wins hands down. It makes my hair soft and it has a little bit of protein. I have used kenra platinum reconstructer for course hair and I like this better. It doesn&#x27;t replace a anti break therapy protein treatment but for deep conditioning I like this best.</li>
            <li> Revives your hair and makes it brand new!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok conditioner.  I expected more natural ingredients tho.  I haven&#x27;t run into any problems so far.</li>
            <li> My hair is so silk soft when I am finished.  I like it because I can tell that I my 4A/3C hair is actually mositerized through and through.  It first appears to be surface oil but then  after you rinse your hair well, my hair is still soft.  I mix it with Brazilian Hair Treatment Goat&#x27;s Milk in a 50/50 ratio.  I also sit under the dryer for 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay here is the kicker ... it has mineral oil in it.  I was very disappointed when I received the package and read that.  It is something that is cheap and I don&#x27;t like to use on my hair.  However, in this case it works so well I don&#x27;t know how not to use it mineral oil or not. If it works Then it works and my hair love it.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy mixture and it may be great for some, but not for me.  It left a very heavy scent that was not pleasant to me or my husband. Also it left my hair very heavy with a coating of something like maybe oily.</li>
            <li> The best one that I have ever used so far.  Very good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have half of the pot and sure will buy another the soon it finishes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use with kanechom treatments.Mixed together these two treatments are awesome. Dont know how well it works by itself. They made my hair so soft band manageble . I&#x27;m Bahamian with 3c/4a hair. So I&#x27;m sure it will do wonders with persons with less dense hair. This is definitely a staple now in my hair care regimine.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Will use forever!</li>
            <li> This is a huge jar, it will last me for 6 - 8 months, I am very happy with this product. My only complaint is the smell - very perfum-ey. I have a very good sense of smell and that flowery strong perfume smell stayed in my hair for a couple of days. I will probably order the bamboo silicon mix after I finish with this jar because there is no smell.</li>
            <li> I cowash my 5 yr olds kinky curly hair with this and have great results!</li>
            <li> works really well for natural hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizing treatments but none of them come close to the conditioning properties of Silicon Mix.  I have thick 4b hair and this transforms my coarse hair to soft, fluffy, and moisturized.  My hair feels buttery soft on application, after rinsing, and until my next wash day.  This conditioner has changed my hair life :)  If you&#x27;ve been battling dry, coarse, and unmanageable hair you should definitely try this product.</li>
            <li> If your hair hates cones this is not a good product for you. HOWEVER, if your hair is not finicky with products and you are able to use cones with no problem than this would probably be a good product. I have 3C/4A curly thick high porosity hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product for conditioning your hair, especially if you have naturally curly hair and trying to achieve a straight look. I have natural curly long (and thin) hair. When I flat iron it without the silicon treatment, it looks frizzy and not professionally done. When I use the silicon mix, then blow dry and flat iron it, it is gorgeous with lots of body. Sometimes I add tracks to thicken my hair. In that case, I put the silicon mix on the tracks (prior to putting in my hair), put them in a ziploc bag and microwave for 3 -5 minutes. I do that 3 times and then wash and rinse the tracks well. Then put in your hair (wet). Blow dry all your hair and tracks together and it blends the textures perfectly! And, it has a great smell that over powers the smell of the flat iron. Y&#x27;all know how burnt hair smells!  :-). None-the-less, I love this product! It is the best. Buy the larger size because I use it generously and let friends &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; it since I always get tons of compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> ive had this for 6 months i use a little bit on days i was my hair and am not planning on styling</li>
            <li> The best intense hair cream I&#x27;ve ever used! My curly hair is sooo smooth and shiny!!!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product for me and my baby girl</li>
            <li> I love this hair product leaves my hair super soft and smells so good. I get compliments on my hair all the time.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this product I didn&#x27;t do it right. I was shampooing and then conditioning with this alone. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but this product will dry your hair out over time. I have biracial hair that tends to be on the DRY side. I&#x27;ve learned that after I shampoo I need to put a moisturising conditioner on first. I am currently using garnier conditioner and I let it sit for a couple of minutes then apply a nice scoop of Silicon mix on top of it. Sit under the dryer for 10 minutes or walk around. Anyway this conditioner is a sealant. Meaning it has so much mineral oil it will block moisture and oils from penetrating the hair. So by adding the moisturising conditioner first then this mix you are locking in the moisture instead of blocking it. When you rinse your hair you really feel the difference. Before when I was using it on its own I would add oil to my hair and my hair would be just as dry and its because the silicon mix was blocking anything from getting into my hair.  I know this is a long review but maybe it will help someone.</li>
            <li> I used this product in my native country. I highly recommend it and it&#x27;s possible to find reviews and tutorials on youtube, on how to use. A must have in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; safely wrapped! Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product hands down!  Great for use on extensions to bring hair to life.  Wonderful smell, works wonders on natural hair as well. For best results use weekly or bi-weekly.</li>
            <li> This item is a life saver for a lazy person that made good hair look like trash one wash with this product and my Brazilian hair came right back to life i got volume, no tangles and to be honest the sent does not bother me at all i really recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> Works great and smells awesome it made my hair soft and smooth I really do love it !!!! Worth the money</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I will repurchase again and agian.  This size will last my family about 8 months. Great value.  I had a smaller Silicon Mix container and I just refill it from this container.</li>
            <li> Good product. I am still enjoying it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>

            <li> this conditioner SAVED my hair from tangling and being ultra frizzy i loooovvveeee it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any major difference between this product and any other of the same category... I expected better results on my hair!</li>
            <li> I heard so much about this product but was shy about ordering.  One of the best purchasing I have ever made.  This makes by own hair as well as my wigs so so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The best product for any type of hair and length :)</li>
            <li> Great hair treatment. A must try product.</li>
            <li> I bought a 60oz container love this conditioner it is great on any hair type. I saturate my hair and my daughters with this and leave in for an hour or more. I even sometimes use heat with a dryer if in a hurry. Leaves hair like silky soft butter and lots of shine and body.  I love this stuff and it isnt salon product expensive. We have african natural no perm or chemical hair and less breakage because of this product.</li>
            <li> I love it , it really helps to mostorise your hair.and smells so good..it&#x27;s the best conditioner I ever used .</li>
            <li> thanks for the shipping, product is very good i encourage all to use i. thanks  SILICON MIX Intensive Hair Treatment 60 oz is great for damage hair.</li>
            <li> While it did make my hair a little softer, it didn&#x27;t hold up to the many reviews of it being the best product ever. Maybe on hard to manage hair or already straight hair, but mine is wavy and it didn&#x27;t really make a lot of difference. It was still kind of frizzy after giving it two weeks to try out. Maybe for some people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. And when I got it in the mail , the cap was broken and about a handful spilled out onto the bubble wrap that was holding it in. To be honest they should&#x27;ve put in a box with more bubble wrap, not in a large envelope with some bubble wrap around it. If I wasn&#x27;t trying to give this product to a friend who loves this stuff, I would&#x27;ve definitely returned it.</li>
            <li> Silicon Mix has done miracles for my hair as well as my weave. I now buy two 60 oz jars at a time because I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> Made my weave feel like brand new!</li>
            <li> When the package arrived half of the product spilled out into the plastic bag.  I scraped up what I could, because I really needed it for my clients. Not happy.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clara</li>
            <li> MADE MY HAIR VERY HARD TO MANAGE INSTEAD OF TREATING IT THERE NOTHING GOOD ABOUT IT BUT THE SMELL WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE my scalp is burning a lost of hair</li>
            <li> Leaves my 4a-c hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> My hairdresser was using this on me.  The smell is wonderful.  I use it everytime I wash my hair.  The longer you leave it on, the better results you receive...</li>
            <li> This mask for hydration and very good...really makes their effect on hair i like her very much!</li>
            <li> This hair treatment is awesome; and I recieved it on time</li>
            <li> the best hair treatment for my weaves. leaves the hair very soft and helps rejuvenate curls</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good deep conditioner; especially for dry course hair.</li>
            <li> I had very high expectations for this product because I LOVE the bambu formula. This formula didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft and de-tangled. Also, I prefer the fragrance of the bambu formula. My hair is extremely thick and dry, so if you have this hair type, I suggest the bambu formula. It&#x27;s not terrible, but for me, it just doesn&#x27;t compare to the bambu formula.</li>
            <li> THIS product....Silicon Mix....absolutely repaired my hair in the first application. If it can transform my hair for the better, it will do it for you. My hair is past my shoulders, receives color every 3-4 weeks and I live in a very humid climate. I am also hypothyroid; thus, I take synthroid. My hair takes a beating and looks like it, sadly. However, this product, with just one application (yesterday), instantly improved my hair. Additionally, I noticed that I am freed up from ceramic blow dryer time AND subsequent product application (buriti oil). Alot less time was spent with my ceramic flat iron, too. I give Silicon Mix five stars. Best hair product investment I have ever made and I&#x27;m on top of my hair care product research for obvious reasons. I bought a couple of the other Silicon Mix products which have not yet arrived. I look forward to trying those out as well. How can anything like this get better? I&#x27;ll let you know!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: April 29, 2013. Yesterday, I ordered my second 60 ounce container of Silicon Mix. Since incorporating Silicon Mix, my hair is in the best shape of its life. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;SECOND UPDATE: October 17, 2013. Once again today, I used Silicon Mix on my now VERY healthy, very long (it is now at the middle of my back and I have trimmed nearly 1.5 inches since January 2013) and silky manageable hair. This sounds like drivel. Its not. I am 52 years old with the best looking long hair; the longest my hair has been in my life. My hair is so healthy and shiny that my bobby pins slipped out two hours. THAT&#x27;S how much success I have enjoyed with Silicon Mix. In fact, I have a friend who is a professional (retired) hairdresser who loyal to expensive professional hair care lines. This friend sings the praises of Silicon Mix, too; this from a 60 year old professional who has tried, used and endorsed some of the world&#x27;s top products. She is very impressed with Silicon Mix. I am very glad to have found this product as it has taken worry and stress off my mind about how my hair looks. The humidity and heat can&#x27;t touch my hair now. Its healthy which makes me happy. BTW, I want you to know that after I rinse Silicon Mix, I apply One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil before blowdrying or letting it air dry. Either way, my once coarse dry brittle hair looks as if it was professionally managed. Sorry so long. But I wanted to share good news, good results with you.&lt;br /&gt;THIRD AND FOURTH UPDATES:&lt;br /&gt;An Amazon customer was great enough to contact me regarding my subsequent purchases of this product, Silicon Mix. What great encouragement for all us to learn how Amazon customer reviews propagate assistance to product information. In Januracy, I bought a third container of Silicon Mix;; in May, I bought my most recent container of the product. Last night, I colored my hair  and followed up, of course, with Silicon Mix. Because of this product, my hair has been restored, purchase by purchase. In fact, I have not cut my hair since April 2011. Can you imagine how trying, how lack luster my hair would be if I had not found Silicon Mix? Perish the thought! I am 53 years old (hmmm, actually, 53.5 years old) with very long (half-way down my back) colored hair. This product provides protection, health and effortless beauty for my hair. VERY worthy product. And, thank you, Amazon friends for providing feedback to my postings about Silicon Mix. Like you, if a product or service fails me, I move away from that prduct or service. Silicon Mix comes beautifully packaged, prooperly sealed and delivers promptly. You will be very happy with this well-priced product. I meant to write this update three weeks ago, but we have been on vacation. I&#x27;m glad to have made time, today, to submit this update. Carry on makers of Silicon Mix. Your product outperforms anything on a store shelf, anything  in any expensive salon.taken worry and stress off my mind about how my hair looks. The humidity and heat can&#x27;t touch my hair now.

            <li> This is a wonderful product for your hair. I use it once a week , leave it on for a few minutes and the rinse it off. It leaves your hair silky-soft, with a delicious smell that stays on for days, and hair is now easier to detangle. Overall this intensive treatment for the hair closes the cuticle on your hair and makes your hair look and feel healthier. I strongly recommend this product, specially for long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product,  the price is to much.</li>
            <li> Very good, but smells realy bad</li>
            <li> I discovered this stuff and I can&#x27;t let it go!!! I use it on my weaves and my real hair. Some say the smell is too strong but I LOVE the smell. Makes my weave and my real hair so silky. I use it with my deep conditioner, so I usually leave it on for up to an hour with heat and my hair or my weave comes out so soft, silky, and smooth.  Since it is a silicone product you have to make sure to use a clarifying shampoo or your hair will have build up.</li>
            <li> I wear full lace wig due to medical issues. Having tried and wasted $$$ low, high and very high priced salon and drugstore products (Joico, Redken, Nexxus, CHI etc) NOTHING compares to this product (mixed with some Kanechom) keeping my full lace wig hair hydrated and smooth longer. I can wash and condition my hair, blow dry and flat iron, and not have to use additional products to keep it flat. The product keeps it flat/smooth naturally and lasts up to 5-6 days. I will add some CHI silk infusion to keep up hydration and extend past 5-6 days. It is a wonderful product and I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I have to order via the states as it isn&#x27;t available in Canada but it is WORTH it. No other product can do what silicon mix does. Do not use a lot or you will end up with gummy hair. Also I believe the silicon mix helps to extend the bond of my wig, because since I&#x27;ve been using it my bond times have extended and I get no lifting.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for curl hair</li>
            <li> I LOVE silicon mix. I was formally introduced to silicon mix about 3 years ago, but my hair dresser has been using this for a lot longer. I am hooked on silicon mix like an addict on crack. My hair has never looked or feel so goood. Silicon mix is a must for all Black and Hispanic hair types. Try it and you will fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> I do use all my hair conditioners..but this one is beyond excellency.  smells good, add shine to your hair...I can comb my hair with my finger...that says a lot...my hair is coarse but manageable.  I strongly recommended for you as well..this product is good for all type of hair.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t live in an urban center where this product is sold everywhere, then you need to order it online.  I have curly hair and I find that this is the only conditioner that I can use.  It keeps my ends from splitting and allows my hair to grow quickly without breaking.</li>
            <li> If you are natural and most importantly if you wear weaves this is the best conditioner to have  To make your weave soft and smell good</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, usually I only use for my extensions, however, this mixed with crece pelo and other oils work great to conditioncondition and moisturize my naturally curly hair, shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> I had always had a hard time keeping my hair soft, and moisturized. I used to use oil and water, but that just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore. I did a search online and found this product. I thought this would be a great choice since it was a large amount for a very affordable price. Once I got it, I loved it!! I added oil to mine to make sure my hair was getting all of the moisture and oils that it needed. After that, it has been a wonder to work with. Around the crown area in front where my baby hair is looked a tad thinned out for some reason, and a few weeks of Silicon Mix has thickened it up and made it grow like magic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave my hair sticky, dry, hard or anything like other conditioners tend to do to many peoples&#x27; hair. I only use this as a leave in conditioner, and it has been great. I would suggest this to anyone looking for a leave in, on wet or dry hair. I cannot comment about it for use as a deep conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I absolutely love the smell.  Cant tell yet how much it will help my hair repair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Leaves your hair sooo soft... Detangles so well... And smells awesome! By far, the best conditioner!</li>
            <li> I brought it was condition my extensions, but I used it on my natural hair first and I LOVE IT. I have kinky hair and my hair smelled so good and felt so soft even after it air dried.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky soft and tangle free. It works best as a deep conditioner once you have already washed your hair with a moisturizing conditioner. It even works great on hair extensions. I am so glad I found this product and I will always keep a jar of it. It truly leaves your hair feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> I first found this product on a saloon.  I loved it but it was very hard to get and very expensive.  I finally found a seller that gives me a good price. I will definitelly come back.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used it to help strengthen my hair. I put it on my hair and cover my hair with a plastic cap and leave it on for 45 minutes. My hair is always shiny and moisturized when I rinse. This is a great product but there is one drawback. This product can actually cause buildup so make sure to cleanse with a very good clarifying shampoo while using this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle for hair extensions!</li>
            <li> Works great I love this product really makes hair silky</li>
            <li> The best cost benefice ever! great product! I&#x27;ve been using this product for over an year. it works!!! You will like it!</li>
            <li> Silicon Mix is a great product. It works wonderfully as a conditioner on my hair. It leaves it feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> this product is extremely cheap for the amount received! It works wonders and only has to be applied once a week which makes the product last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Love it for my weave &amp; natural hair!</li>
            <li> Best treatment for thick curly hair. Too heavy for thin fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! A little goes a long way. However the smell of the mix is very strong and will last till your next washing. It&#x27;s not a bad smell at all it just kinda reminds me of a grandmas perfume kinda smell. But trust me this stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!!!!! If you have frizzy hair this should do the trick! Worked for me And I will continue to buy it :)</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves hair shinny and soft. This huge container is awesome, and the price is really good!</li>
            <li> works great but it stinks to high heaven so you decide.</li>
            <li> ... paired with Brazilian treatment makes my hair feel so wonderful that I love it. So happy I got this big tub. I use it every two weeks due to my bleached damage hair. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Especially on my extentions. A MUST HAVE!! This product may not be all that great on natural African American hair but works wonders on extensions especially deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Its helps treat damaged or hard to manage hair. Great price also</li>
            <li> Best conditioning treatment i have ever used</li>
            <li> Love how this conditions, smells and the price is awesome.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Best hair conditioning treatment out there! Not only does it do wonders for ethnic hair, but for all hair types! My hair is very fine and gets tangles very easily, leading to hair breakage/damage. This conditioner does all that it&#x27;s hyped up to be! Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love love love it. I use this as a deep conditioner and it works well. I saw them use it in the salon and have used it every since!!!</li>
            <li> i love it  will by again</li>
            <li> This silicon mix leaves you hair silky soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair id DRY this makes my hair so silky, it&#x27;s the best, I wash my hair put this on and leave for like an hour, yes the smell is strong, but the good thing is that your hair will smell good for days! I haven&#x27;t found anything else that is better than this.</li>
            <li> I read so many amazing reviews on this product I had to give it a try! Since it&#x27;s so inexpensive I purchased the 60oz! I&#x27;m so glad that I did! This conditioner is so freaking AMAZING!!!..How I used it was I sprayed hot water on my hair to wet it up. Then once my hair was good and damp I applied the Silicon Mix all through it! I only used the Silicon Mix b/c I wanted to see how it would do just by itself without using any other conditioner with it! I got in the shower and let the water run on it a little and then proceeded to take my shower. By the time I was done and was getting ready to rinse this out my hair felt so soft already! And this conditioner has incredible slip! My hair is almost done air drying and it is so soft and silky! No heat what so ever and my hair looks so smooth and straight! I&#x27;m 9 weeks post relaxer and my new growth is so soft it&#x27;s crazy! The next time I use it I will use it as a Deep Conditioner instead of just Co-washing. If I keep getting results like this I will be purchasing more of this when I get down to half of my jar! This is just my first initial review so I will be back to do an update once I&#x27;ve used half the jar! But, as of right now I&#x27;m In LOVE!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this.... I use this along with Kanechom and I leave it on my hair for a deep conditioning treatment. Feels like I went to the hair salon. Great product.</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner I have ever used especially when mixed with kanechom</li>
            <li> My Russian girlfriend likes it. But then again she likes anything that includes spending my money.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff and use it religiously!  It makes your hair soft and silky and I like the smell.  I would recommend this product.  I wear a lot of weave and it does a great job, I also use the shampoo and conditioner that goes along with it for maximum results.  Try it I believe you will like it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m biracial,  and have really long,  thick, curly hair. My hair easily tangles. I use this to detangle my hair and it works. The comb glides right through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before. It does make the hair feel silkier even though some people don&#x27;t like the idea of putting silicon on the hair. For what it&#x27;s worth, the product does what it says it does. Whether you choose to use it or not is as personal of a preference as any other product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly frizzy hair ( and we live in south Florida!!) and this product is as amazing! Leaves her hair very soft and manageable. I still add afterwards silicon drops, and some leave in products, because the humidity here is put if control.</li>
            <li> Im relaxed with 4c hair. i love to use on my new growth... this stuff makes ur hair soft. a must have.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and hair will feel soft as ever.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair never looked this good.  I get many compliments, especially from men how beautiful my&lt;br /&gt;hair is.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, silky, and shines.</li>
            <li> I got it in a decent time but the only thing that I did not like is when I opened it it was already popped open I&#x27;m assuming in the mail it got tossed around but on the say was the good thing was that it was in a ziplock bag so I was able to scoop everything and put it back in the bag</li>
            <li> I tried this product just after shampooing and leaving on for as long as possible, letting the steam of the shower do the work.  Afterwards, my hair didn&#x27;t feel very silky and more or less hung there. I tried it a good handful of times to see if I could tweek it a but or figure out what I was doing wrong.  I tried it again, but after shampooing I put on my normal conditioner and put the Silicon Mix on top of it, and didn&#x27;t use as much.  This time my hair was still silky, had some shine, and less frizz.  My hair is normally on the dry side, so perhaps that program will not be good for people with oilier hair.  So I am happy with this after I played around and learned to use it for my hair.  The downside to this product was the scent.  I knew the smell and for the longest time could not figure it out.  Then as I was driving to work and could smell the waft of my hair, it came to me.  Laundry Mat!  That&#x27;s what it smells like.  Almost like the pink capped Downy.  The scent did go down later in the day, but if I sniffed my hair, it was very apparent.  When I tried using this with the conditioner first, the scent was much more manageable and not overpowering.  Will I buy this big freaky huge container again?  Probably not.  It just doesn&#x27;t do enough for me.  I probably should have gotten a smaller container in the first place, but I thought it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> This has a slightly thined out Texture, the easily helps detangle knots and strengthen the hair. easily coats everything. I wear this one anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes depending on the time I have. you don&#x27;t necessarily have to use it in the shower, your hair just has to be wet and washed you can use a regular conditioner before this but it&#x27;s not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;this detangles, smoothens, and moisturize all of your hair and last a very long time . for more info please visit hoollyd.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> Great product. Best when combined with Ionic Nutritive Treatment. Leaves hair shiny, soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Strong Chemical smell. Diazolidinyl urea, one of the ingredients is a formaldehyde-releasing preservative, made me concerned. Spilled out into bag shipped in.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, normally after wash and go, my hair would be dry as straw, after 2 hours; but this product left my hair soft for days.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Hair feel so soft after using</li>
            <li> Love this deep conditioner. I apply to my hair, put on a plastic bag to cover my hair, sit under the dryer to deep condition with heat. My hair feels so soft after using it and its soooo easy to detangle when I am rinsing it out. I don&#x27;t even have to use a comb, i can finger detangle after using this.</li>
            <li> I had hairlloss after using it...will not repurchase</li>
            <li> love the bargain and product</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! I use it on both my natural 4C hair and for my extensions. It brings them back to life! I use it for both remy and Brazilian hair. I wash and condition the hair and let this sit on it for a couple of hours. I rinse and let air dry. It has revived some hair that should have been gone! I love silicon mix!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner will make the hair silky straight on African American hair when u flat iron it&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order from this site every thing come on time just like they say</li>
            <li> Best thing for your hair esp good for weaves I steamed it on the stove made the hair feel like everything.</li>
