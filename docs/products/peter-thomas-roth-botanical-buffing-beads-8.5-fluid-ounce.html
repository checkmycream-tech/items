            <li>This is a great product for maintaining skin between facials .....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved this product over the years until I read the ingredient label:&lt;br /&gt;guess</li>
            <li>Really good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really loved using this product--</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on all the good reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>Thrilled to find it here, and the price is great.</li>
            <li>You will not find a better price than on Amazon--I tried!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and quality of these buffing beads!</li>
            <li>This is amazing</li>
            <li>I liked what I read</li>
            <li>I have to say that this is absolutely great and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Excellent exfoliator and facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still on the search for a better wash, but if I can&#x27;t find it, I&#x27;ll stick to this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love using this scrub.</li>
            <li>Love the face wash.....</li>
            <li>My skin always feels very clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I had to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>It is the absolute best thing I have ever cleaned my 62 yr old skin with!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product, however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special.</li>
            <li>I would rate this face wash as okay, nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>I follow it with Peter Thomas Roth facial creme and feel great all day.  </li>
            <li>I also originally tried the blemish buffing beads, and I think this works just as well (and is cheaper).  </li>
            <li>I originally received a sample of this product.  </li>
            <li>It gets your face clean but does it without any drying.</li>
            <li>After using this with my Clarisonic, my face feels clean and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Margaret is absolutely right about this product!  </li>
            <li>I should have questioned sooner why it&#x27;s bright blue!</li>
            <li>I bought this at a Sephora sale and that&#x27;s about the only good thing about this product.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and it not only feels good when using it, it neither drys out my skin nor makes it feel oily.</li>
            <li>my knowledge, I consider jojoba beads to be a much better exfoliant (also more pricy) than apricot shells or \\&quot;micro-sized\\&quot; sand/silica etc used by most of the other exfoliating scrubs on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>About 6 months ago, my face started breaking out in a way that no late 20-something (ok ok, 30 something) woman wants to deal with.  </li>
            <li>While the beads were gentle, I honestly didn&#x27;t see much results.</li>
            <li>I satisfied with this product so far.</li>
            <li>There are many more &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; in it than the other exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty mild and seems to do its job.</li>
            <li>I would consider trying another PTR product as it does seem be a good quality product - just not exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Twice a week is just right</li>
            <li>It went right into the trash....</li>
            <li>and it never fails to make my skin look fresh and reinvigorated.</li>
            <li>Not exactly the greatest smelling stuff, but it works and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>It very gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>Stripping your skin only causes it to produce MORE oil.  </li>
            <li>I switch around facial products out of boredom and my love for shopping</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>After opening the package I found the bottle totally damaged and face wash everywhere &amp; unused able.</li>
            <li>You have to use a good amount of product to get enough of the beads onto your skin for them to actually exfoliate anything.</li>
            <li>would highly recommened this product, as it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>One of the main reasons I bought this product was because I was looking for a more mild/simpler way of exfoliating my skin on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I finally found out that I was over-drying my skin trying to clear up the pimples, which only caused more oil and more pimples to occur.  </li>
            <li>it smooth out my skin and prevented many ingrown hairs I usually get from shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s kinda pricy since you can find lots of other scrubs with pretty good reviews for the same amount of product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had read about this in an online blog and immediately went to Amazon to see what real people were saying.  </li>
            <li>is a gentle scrub that does</li>
            <li>After scrubbing my face, i feel much smoother than before.</li>
            <li>I needed something that could deeply clean and exfoliate but would not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>and I would buy it again anytime thanks</li>
            <li>Bought two of them because I go through it so much</li>
            <li>I check Amazon when running low because it&#x27;s not always available.</li>
            <li>I use it every day while showering, and have noticed a much clearner and vibrant appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I like citrus-y smell though, and I also like that this cleanser is mild enough that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry/tight or irritated after I use it(which</li>
            <li>- Update:  I still love this product, but the price is now literally DOUBLE what I paid for it last time I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, I put Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream (natural product that contains olive oil, among other things) at night before bed.  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m going to find a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this with my Clarisonic Mia (another change that I HIGHLY recommend if you can afford it) and like it because the buffing beads are not harsh and are not scratching my skin when I use with my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely try the anti-aging version since it seems to have more beneficial ingredients with the same amount of product for the same price.</li>
            <li>This is a nice non-abrasive scrub made with jojoba beads so no tearing of the skin as with other scrubs that use ground walnut shells or other abrasives.  </li>
            <li>Just physical gentle exfoliation, nothing</li>
            <li>A treated skin is already somewhat sensitive</li>
            <li>It has no harsh chemicals or odor.</li>
            <li>The beads are soft but do the job well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Works well on my temperamental 40 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>This brand is quality thru and thru and costs 3 times as much to buy in local stores.</li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t cheap a little tiny bit goes a long way and it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I recommend this product, but I&#x27;m not sure about the price point--that would be your prerogative :)</li>
            <li>The price here on Amazon is very reasonable compared to other places you may find it.</li>
            <li>the major selling point for me is that it uses Jojoba beads for its exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>No need to scrub; just gently rub in circular motion over wet face and neck.</li>
            <li>The scent is barely there organic botanical scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this product cleared by pimple problems all by itself, as I completely changed my skincare routine, but it is definitely a staple</li>
            <li>The bottle was mailed in a soft yellow envelope.</li>
            <li>The only issue is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last for a particularly long time and that just makes me cringe, in terms of how much money I spent on it.</li>

            <li> so will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is basically the same product as Egyptian Magic, but a bit less expensive.  </li>
            <li> So, I stopped using toner all-together and stopped using extremely harsh products to wash my face that stripped my skin of it&#x27;s natural oil (thus the PTR botanical buffing beads).  </li>
            <li> It buffs off old dead skin cells and helps keep my skin in check with acne problems</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and a half now and, apart from not having to moisturize as often, I don&#x27;t see any major change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> (No, I don&#x27;t work for PTR but the reviews on Amazon have helped me out enough times with other products that I am trying to return the favor).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra, but double?  </li>
            <li> I have dry acne prone skin</li>
            <li> and this does not break me out or dry me out.  </li>
            <li> It seems a little pricey compared to the Oil of Olay products, however, you use far less of this product than anything else.  </li>
            <li> To summarize - I stopped trying to dry out my skin to cure my acne by using harsh products on a daily basis, and instead balanced my skin by adding oil.</li>
            <li> The buffing beads are pretty useless.</li>
            <li> It worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll switch to every other day.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;beads\\&quot; themselves don&#x27;t feel like the typical rough particles that you&#x27;ll find in an exfoliant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually I got this one since I am also on Retin A which itself is exfoliating and leaves my face with lots of dry flakes making me look like I have some serious skin</li>
            <li> I take this into heavy consideration because I do have sensative</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really my only real complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it would help your acne, or trouble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you desperately trying to clear your skin, I&#x27;ll tell you what has worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and am amazed at the disappearance of small skin bumps that I have been plagued with for years.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s scrubbing function with lots of small jojoba</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d buy it again at this price though.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but you only need a couple of drops.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 2 months and no real improvement, I still get the random acne</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time trying to decide between this scrub and the anti-aging version</li>
            <li> My face was a giant, painful mess of cystic pimples, and today I have not one!  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean between monthly or even bi monthly facials.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves your face feeling exfoliated without it over drying or irritating.</li>
            <li> why is it so hard to find??!!  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this scrub, did nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> I used about half the bottle before tossing it out because the smell was horrible</li>
            <li> It smells bad</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Excellent exfoliator and facial cleanser. No need to scrub; just gently rub in circular motion over wet face and neck. Good price too!</li>
            <li> I had read about this in an online blog and immediately went to Amazon to see what real people were saying.  I liked what I read so I got some.  Margaret is absolutely right about this product!  It is the absolute best thing I have ever cleaned my 62 yr old skin with!  I use it every day and am amazed at the disappearance of small skin bumps that I have been plagued with for years.  I follow it with Peter Thomas Roth facial creme and feel great all day.  You will not find a better price than on Amazon--I tried!</li>
            <li> I would rate this face wash as okay, nothing extraordinary.  Its pretty mild and seems to do its job. I have been using it for the past 2 months and no real improvement, I still get the random acne so I&#x27;m still on the search for a better wash, but if I can&#x27;t find it, I&#x27;ll stick to this.</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time trying to decide between this scrub and the anti-aging version also offered by Peter Thomas Roth.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I got this one since I am also on Retin A which itself is exfoliating and leaves my face with lots of dry flakes making me look like I have some serious skin illness.&lt;br /&gt;This is a gentle scrub that does it&#x27;s scrubbing function with lots of small jojoba beads.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kinda pricy since you can find lots of other scrubs with pretty good reviews for the same amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;BUT - the major selling point for me is that it uses Jojoba beads for its exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;From my knowledge, I consider jojoba beads to be a much better exfoliant (also more pricy) than apricot shells or \\&quot;micro-sized\\&quot; sand/silica etc used by most of the other exfoliating scrubs on the market.&lt;br /&gt;It is exactly what I need.  Just physical gentle exfoliation, nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;My retina A treated skin is already somewhat sensitive so I do not want any \\&quot;extra benefits\\&quot; such as fruit acids AHAs in forms of  chemical exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;This scrub is helping to decrease the amount of skin flakes peeling on my face as a side effect of retin A.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, if I were not on Retin A I would definitely try the anti-aging version since it seems to have more beneficial ingredients with the same amount of product for the same price.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product, however, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything special. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and a half now and, apart from not having to moisturize as often, I don&#x27;t see any major change in my skin.  One of the main reasons I bought this product was because I was looking for a more mild/simpler way of exfoliating my skin on a daily basis. The buffing beads are pretty useless. You have to use a good amount of product to get enough of the beads onto your skin for them to actually exfoliate anything. That&#x27;s really my only real complaint. I ended up just going to my local drug store and buying an exfoliating sponge for $1 - I use it with this product and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.  I like citrus-y smell though, and I also like that this cleanser is mild enough that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry/tight or irritated after I use it(which is a blessing in northern OH winters). Not sure I&#x27;d buy it again at this price though. I would consider trying another PTR product as it does seem be a good quality product - just not exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this scrub, did nothing for my acne. Prefer Thomas Roth Blemish Buffing beads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved this product over the years until I read the ingredient label:&lt;br /&gt;guess I should have questioned sooner why it&#x27;s bright blue! It&#x27;s poison in a bottle for your skin. Blue dye number whatever is poison</li>
            <li> I satisfied with this product so far. After scrubbing my face, i feel much smoother than before. I&#x27;m not sure it would help your acne, or trouble.</li>
            <li> I love using this scrub. It smelts wonderful.</li>
            <li> My wife turned me on to this product and it ROCKS! I&#x27;m a competitive bicyclist and motorcyclist and my face gets plenty of sun and road dirt on it. I needed something that could deeply clean and exfoliate but would not dry my skin out. This is amazing and I wish that I found it years ago. It gets your face clean but does it without any drying. In fact, your face with feel softer after using it. The \\&quot;beads\\&quot; themselves don&#x27;t feel like the typical rough particles that you&#x27;ll find in an exfoliant. These don&#x27;t scratch you as they are doing their work. While this isn&#x27;t cheap a little tiny bit goes a long way and it is worth it. The price here on Amazon is very reasonable compared to other places you may find it. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. (No, I don&#x27;t work for PTR but the reviews on Amazon have helped me out enough times with other products that I am trying to return the favor).</li>
            <li> Great use over all . I have used it for 7 years. Don&#x27;t need a lot when using. It has no harsh chemicals or odor.</li>
            <li> I guess I was hoping for my grit and exfoliation but I felt like it was just bumpy soap.  The scent is barely there organic botanical scent.</li>
            <li> This is a nice non-abrasive scrub made with jojoba beads so no tearing of the skin as with other scrubs that use ground walnut shells or other abrasives.  Really good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> July 2, 2014 - Update:  I still love this product, but the price is now literally DOUBLE what I paid for it last time I ordered.  I don&#x27;t mind paying a little extra, but double?  Really?  Guess I&#x27;m going to find a new product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review:  About 6 months ago, my face started breaking out in a way that no late 20-something (ok ok, 30 something) woman wants to deal with.  It was truly embarrassing.  I can&#x27;t say this product cleared by pimple problems all by itself, as I completely changed my skincare routine, but it is definitely a staple and I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle.  I used this with my Clarisonic Mia (another change that I HIGHLY recommend if you can afford it) and like it because the buffing beads are not harsh and are not scratching my skin when I use with my Clarisonic.  I also originally tried the blemish buffing beads, and I think this works just as well (and is cheaper).  After using this with my Clarisonic, my face feels clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you desperately trying to clear your skin, I&#x27;ll tell you what has worked for me.  I finally found out that I was over-drying my skin trying to clear up the pimples, which only caused more oil and more pimples to occur.  So, I stopped using toner all-together and stopped using extremely harsh products to wash my face that stripped my skin of it&#x27;s natural oil (thus the PTR botanical buffing beads).  Stripping your skin only causes it to produce MORE oil.  As I said above, I also bought and use a Clarisonic twice a day.  I started fighting my oil, with oil - which I know is counterintuitive, but it has worked for me!  So, to my moisturizer, I add a couple of drops of Dr. Hauschka Normalizing Day Oil.  It is expensive, but you only need a couple of drops.  I&#x27;ve had my bottle for several months and I&#x27;ve only used 10% of the bottle.  Lastly, I put Sweet Bee Magic Skin Cream (natural product that contains olive oil, among other things) at night before bed.  I let it absorb, and then blot off theexcess before I go to sleep - because it is oily.  This is basically the same product as Egyptian Magic, but a bit less expensive.  You can buy all these products on Amazon, except for the Clarisonic (you can buy it, but if you read reviews, a lot of purchasers feel like they have bought counterfeit products).  That&#x27;s it - hope it helps someone out there.  My face was a giant, painful mess of cystic pimples, and today I have not one!  To summarize - I stopped trying to dry out my skin to cure my acne by using harsh products on a daily basis, and instead balanced my skin by adding oil.</li>
            <li> I switch around facial products out of boredom and my love for shopping but I keep coming back to this one. My skin always feels very clean after using this product. The beads are soft but do the job well.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and I am very happy with it and I would buy it again anytime thanks</li>
            <li> I really loved using this product-- it smooth out my skin and prevented many ingrown hairs I usually get from shaving. It also softened a some calluses I had on my knees. It worked extremely well. The only issue is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t last for a particularly long time and that just makes me cringe, in terms of how much money I spent on it. Overall, I recommend this product, but I&#x27;m not sure about the price point--that would be your prerogative :)</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s uses with cleanser.  Don&#x27;t worry if you have sensitive skin.  Twice a week is just right so will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and quality of these buffing beads!</li>
            <li> Went by reviews and tried this. Works good. Not exactly the greatest smelling stuff, but it works and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Not kidding. I was just looking for a facial product that held up to their claims. THIS IS NOT IT. It smells bad ive had it for over 4 months. Used it once.  Seriously. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> This is a face wash that EVERYONE should have.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a Sephora sale and that&#x27;s about the only good thing about this product.  I bought it based on all the good reviews I read.  I don&#x27;t know, maybe I got a defective product because I thought this sucked!  I used about half the bottle before tossing it out because the smell was horrible - it smells like PTR took a blue plastic doll and ground it up into buffing beads then stuffed it into this bottle.  While the beads were gentle, I honestly didn&#x27;t see much results.</li>
            <li> Love the face wash..... Bought two of them because I go through it so much and o only buy online.. thanks! Arrived on time also</li>
            <li> My dermotologist recommended this product and I have never switched!  It buffs off old dead skin cells and helps keep my skin in check with acne problems</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is absolutely great and well worth the money. I use it every day have bought numerous bottles of the PTR Buffing Beads over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your face feeling exfoliated without it over drying or irritating. I take this into heavy consideration because I do have sensative skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommened this product, as it is well worth it. I use it every day while showering, and have noticed a much clearner and vibrant appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a residue. I used this for my face as well. Sometimes the beads don&#x27;t dissolve. The price is doesn&#x27;t match the results however.</li>
            <li> Works well on my temperamental 40 year old skin.  Cleans and exfoliates without drying.  Does not make me break or or give me red splotchy skin. I&#x27;ve used it once a day for several weeks and now that several problem areas are improved I&#x27;ll switch to every other day.  Could not find this in stores - it&#x27;s an Allure magazine winner why is it so hard to find??!!  Thrilled to find it here, and the price is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for maintaining skin between facials ..... And I don&#x27;t mean between monthly or even bi monthly facials. I use this 2 or 3 times a week and it never fails to make my skin look fresh and reinvigorated.</li>
            <li> The bottle was mailed in a soft yellow envelope. After opening the package I found the bottle totally damaged and face wash everywhere &amp; unused able. It went right into the trash.... Waste of money</li>
            <li> This brand is quality thru and thru and costs 3 times as much to buy in local stores. I check Amazon when running low because it&#x27;s not always available.</li>
            <li> I have dry acne prone skin and this does not break me out or dry me out.  It very gently exfoliates.</li>
            <li> I originally received a sample of this product.  Loved it so much I had to purchase more.  I have combination skin and it not only feels good when using it, it neither drys out my skin nor makes it feel oily.</li>
            <li> She uses it when she gives me facials and recommends using it as a daily exfoliator in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for years now.  It seems a little pricey compared to the Oil of Olay products, however, you use far less of this product than anything else.  Put only a pea size in your palm.  There are many more &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; in it than the other exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried.  One bottle lasts a really long time.</li>
