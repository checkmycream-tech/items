            <li>The product seems very nice.  </li>
            <li>I received this item at no cost in order to facilitate an honest review...and this eye serum is honestly very very good.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see any remarkable results.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for reducing my eye puffiness and making my eyes brighter, they look so much more awake.</li>
            <li>and more you know you are getting the best care for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its about 10 pages of really good information.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I have a really good idea of what works and what doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Product seems to work good</li>
            <li>It’s one of the best oil free moisturizers I’ve ever used.</li>
            <li>it is quite good.</li>
            <li>Good eye serum -</li>
            <li>Hopefully they work as good as this.</li>
            <li>serum is best applied to clean skin after washing or bathing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost comical wondering where it&#x27;s going to fly every morning and night when I try to use it.</li>
            <li>It is a great serum to use in the morning to give you that, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been awake for more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Working out great...definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>IT was my first time using a product that had Sea Kelp in it, but I was impressed!</li>
            <li>This eye serum is the most effective I have ever before used!</li>
            <li>(Tip: put in the refrigerator for an even more refreshed feeling!)</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR MY EYES!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>What woman doesn&#x27;t love to hear that!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve applied it on my face on most days and night and it&#x27;s been a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>texture is great because it absorbs so quick!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second of all, this serum is jam packed with amazing ingredients that are meant to tighten, tone, and fight against discoloration.</li>
            <li>but I would honestly rather die than have my stretchmarks on the</li>
            <li>and it seemed nice.  </li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on my skin</li>
            <li>that worry that women have about time catching up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>packaging is nice, in a substantial-feeling glass jar.</li>
            <li>I received these products for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve pumped more than I need for my eyes, I use the rest on my face and it&#x27;s also good to my face.</li>
            <li>but this is my own opinion.</li>
            <li>the years are catching up to me...</li>
            <li>So I’m going to be honest here.</li>
            <li>Use sparingly, but it is effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure all of the ingredients are good for my skin</li>
            <li>The texture is nice</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t know if it has worked or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Check out their website for more skincare products and I am sure you will be happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li>received the product for free, but my opinion is my own!</li>
            <li>sure comes in handy</li>
            <li>far, I am extremely impressed by the two products I&#x27;ve tried from Petunia Skincare.  </li>
            <li>It blends in nicely and really works great to help in these issues.</li>
            <li>serum feel very smooth going on not the oily feeling we get sometimes.</li>
            <li>love the eye serum, it may be my favorite.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be okay, but it came opened.  </li>
            <li>The box was opened and the top of the container had been opened.  </li>
            <li>so maybe with more use I will notice more improvement.</li>
            <li>It does nothing for the undereye, and dries in a gel layer and peels, so do not wear makeup over top.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was given a free sample to try fo my honest opinion</li>
            <li>I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>More of an eye soother than a corrector of skin problems.</li>
            <li>but I think that this serum is better than any of them.</li>
            <li>I asked him to elaborate and he said my skin looked fresher and brighter and that I looked more rested.</li>
            <li>The best part of it is it actually works.</li>
            <li>It does, however, make my eye makeup stick better when I cover my circles with makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my eyes feel.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried both of these Petunia products.</li>
            <li>My favorite anti-aging eye product has been Caudalie&#x27;s eye cream which costs $99.</li>
            <li>I always seem to be more drawn to serums than creams as I just fell in love with the consistency and texture that serums have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I hope with continued use I will see even better results.</li>
            <li>and I hope with continued use I will see even better results.</li>
            <li>I guess it feels a bit refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have lots of issue with swollen, puffy eyes, so I will continue to use this to see if there is more noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but hopefully with more usages it will fade.</li>
            <li>Probably the caffeine inside doing most of that.</li>
            <li>as of 31 Oct.-------&lt;br /&gt;I have changed the review rating from 4 starts to 5 stars because after more than a week of usage, I have already seen how my eye bags are not puffy anymore</li>
            <li>Plus it makes me feel more awake after I use this.</li>
            <li>received the product for free but the opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li>This eye serum has satisfied all my expectations.</li>
            <li>Use and enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love their products, as they have truly worked for me.</li>
            <li>As for under the eyes, the most noticeable difference this gel made for me is de-puffing.  </li>
            <li>&quot; look and this as been something that has been able to reduce the puffiness around my eyes even during tax</li>
            <li>You can read more about my thoughts on this product on my blog post http://katsdailyinspiration.blogspot.com/2015/02/petunia-skincare-10mm-derma-roller-eye.html</li>
            <li>medieval torture device is this?!”The serums worked great!</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and i already notice more firmness.  </li>
            <li>the pump tends to dispense more than i need for my eyes</li>
            <li>and I suppose that with more prolonged use I might see something.  </li>
            <li>I am not so sure about wrinkles etc.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love feeling it tighten the skin</li>
            <li>my guess is they would look even better if I used it day and night.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the Revitalize Eye Serum.</li>
            <li>My favorite use is before makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I love this products.  </li>
            <li>Petunia Skincare has my vote as a super skincare company that has the BEST NATURAL AND ORGANIC INGREDIENTS - 100% CRUELTY FREE!</li>
            <li>Product has significantly improved dryness around my eyes!</li>
            <li>At this point, I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I feel more time is needed to get a more accurate representation of what it can do.</li>
            <li>Either because of good genes or the fact that we messed with all of this stuff when we were younger (or maybe both), my sister and I have always been told that we have good skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel, the smell and the overall results that I experienced in one week. :)</li>
            <li>I can see a bit of a difference in the appearance of my undereyes and am happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li>I received a free example of this eye gel from Petunia Skin care for a sincere review.</li>
            <li>I like this serum because it works great for sensitive skin and delivers the results that it promises.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>I loved that Sea Kelp is a main ingredient of this.</li>
            <li>and I do notice that my fine lines have reduced in appearance.</li>
            <li>seems to correct your fine lines</li>
            <li>I think with longer use, it would help keep fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li>The fine lines seem to still be there</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to apply and of silky and smooth it is.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s another super important ingredient for skin health!</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this eye serum!</li>
            <li>However, the first time I put it on I significantly noticed my skin around my eyes had that more awake look, and the complexion looked better.</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for about 2 weeks now, I have noticed a huge improvement to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>moisturizer is really light, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>

            <li>I received a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li>They must be have been given the product free or were paid to leave a review?</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much for my eyes honestly.</li>
            <li>I received this for free as a promotional offer, along with the hyaluronic serum.</li>
            <li>They have the fastest absorption rate of any serums I have tried and moisturize and smooth skin as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was given this item for free if I wrote a review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>received product free to review</li>
            <li>Like their Hyaluronic Acid Serum, which I&#x27;ve also used, it is 100% cruelty-free which is important to me.</li>
            <li>Petunia Skincare provided a free sample for review.</li>
            <li>did receive this product free to facilitate my review.  </li>

            <li>I received a free product to</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
            <li>I received this for free to try from Tomoson and Petunia Skincare.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I was given this product free to try, but this is my honest opinion, it really does work.</li>
            <li>The first day it burned a bit but day two and on it was much better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was excited to try this Revitalize Eye Serum from Petunia Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay first of all,  I am a guy.  </li>
            <li>i could not wait to use this product and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>- Cool smooth feeling</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li>My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s the best product for aging lines thus far, I do however feel it is an amazing product for dark circles as well as putting moisture into the skin and worth giving a try.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Clean face.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly and feels light.</li>
            <li>This eye serum is easy to use and absorbs right into your skin.</li>
            <li>Petunia Skincare is not your average “skincare” company, they are committed to delivering the highest formulation standards, and prides themselves with the best skin care ingredients in the world, proven by scientific research and real life testing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than two weeks now and it seems to be really working.</li>
            <li>This is a true serum, not like a cream at all.</li>
            <li>And I still feel that cool, tingly feeling when it is being applied under my eye area.</li>
            <li>I have gone through a full bottle of eye serum versus.</li>
            <li>So my full results aren&#x27;t in yet, but I would give this a recommendation.</li>
            <li>This product does a good job of lifting the upper lid.</li>
            <li>all i need from petunia is there own natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Love this product but don&#x27;t use too much or it will peal off.</li>
            <li>so it really helps me look more awake than I feel.</li>
            <li>(FULL DISCLOSURE:</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a really good job at not only making you appear more awake, but also absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>Within just a couple of days, I viewed fine lines decrease as well as my eye areas was smooth as well as definitely, VERY youthful looking.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I do like how quickly this serum absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>I give it a ten plus for sure and the lines look better as well</li>
            <li>The serum is concentrated and once you apply it absorbs quickly in to your skin.</li>
            <li>and I have been without adequate sleep</li>
            <li>I love this high quality eye serum.</li>
            <li>I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it!</li>
            <li>I love that the two Petunia Skincare products I&#x27;ve tried, the hyaluronic acid serum and this eye serum, are so fast absorbing!  </li>
            <li>Funny thing, I still will purchase another bottle because my husband loves it for his puffy eyes!</li>
            <li>immediate effects are noticeable and regular use will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and promote a healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I feel it absorbing into my skin.  </li>
            <li>This one has not given me amazing results, but I have only used it a couple of weeks -</li>
            <li>A couple of things I like about the company as a whole is that you get a free e-book that talks to you about beauty regimens, I received a follow up email to give me some tips on using their product</li>
            <li>This is gentle, and light, and works well.</li>
            <li>The texture is light and absorbs in fairly fast.</li>
            <li>I did not know that sea kelp or seaweed or dead sea salts were great for skincare.  </li>
            <li>I have used many professional products...</li>
            <li>not as good as expected</li>
            <li>the serum just melts in and is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft, and gently takes off the outer layer of skin, giving my skin a nice fresh look.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I really like this product, but it didn&#x27;t really take the puffiness away from my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is convenient, and the product contains a lot of useful ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I liked the overall product!  </li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t believe it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>my eyes felt fresh and the tiredness seemed to go away at once</li>
            <li>That alone is worth using this eye gel.</li>
            <li>This is a brand/product that is truly worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply, 1 pump is enough for both eyes since it spreads so easily.</li>
            <li>My skin drank it up and the softness was noticeable right away.</li>
            <li>All right</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, be careful with amour used, leaves a while flakey residue.</li>
            <li>product itself is ok but haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference.  </li>
            <li>and she loved what it did for her dark circles overnight.</li>
            <li>Eye Serum may be good for dark circles</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s so important to take good care of the delicate eye area, which is often the first place to show signs of aging.</li>
            <li>This is light, has a pleasant faint fragrance and is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It does provide nice moisture for underneath my eyes, which is an area that I find is often very dry.</li>
            <li>Then, as we got older, we would go to different beauty and makeup stories to buy our own goops to try out.  </li>
            <li>My dark circles have almost completely disappeared and I’m going to continue working on my fine lines and wrinkles because of the great results I’ve noticed so far.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helped the bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li>I first tried some on my hands for a couple of days and then under my eyes</li>
            <li>First using the vitamin C serum and then applying the eye gel serum.</li>
            <li>couple of months ago, I received an email from a lady at Petunia Skincare asking if I would be interested in trying one of their products.  </li>
            <li>I emailed her back that I would be glad to try out her product and received it a couple of days</li>
            <li>I have noticed my skin becoming more firm underneath my eyes as well as around my eyelids.</li>
            <li>when I apply the product, it feels hydrating and at the same time it&#x27;s not too overwhelming for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Skin around the eye is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but, it has most definitely assisted my eyes.</li>
            <li>it felt fabulous around my eyes and made the skin so soft.</li>
            <li>- my only issue is that more then I want to use comes out with a squirt</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>So I alternated use of the serums and my skin took on a pretty glow after a couple days.</li>
            <li>and you can decide for yourself ; )</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older my eyes have become more hooded to the point where my lower eyelid is barely visible.</li>
            <li>I really like both of these products and will most likely reorder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my dark circles, but just for getting rid of the puffiness, I&#x27;m thrilled to have received this product for review!</li>
            <li>I am still using it and looking forward to positive results.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no scent, the pump applicator dispenses just the right amount, so no wasting the product when too much squirts out, it absorbs pretty much on contact, and you really can feel your eye area tighten up immediately.</li>
            <li>I still top it off with my long time</li>
            <li>It dries pretty fast and does not leave any after marks.</li>
            <li>but I have used seaweed products in the past and loved what they did for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how that puffy feeling can bring you down.</li>
            <li>What else I found interesting is the most beneficial ingredients present, the Niacinamide and Sea Kelp bioferment, are of much higher quantities than any of the other much pricier DNA labeled products I investigated.</li>
            <li>There is a very mild stinging effect from the exfoliating ingredients and when applying it under the eyes, care should be taken not to let it actually get into the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I end up in need of more eye cream as it seems to dry the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to push down slowly only to have the serum still fly across the room, hit my mirror, and even hit me in the eyes.</li>
            <li>It really seems to tighten and firm the skin and feels cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Net result - dark circles started getting more prominent, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>This eye gel is nice and thick, yet absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>used this twice a day every day until the bottle was empty (which took about 6 weeks); didn&#x27;t make one bit of difference in my dark circles, puffiness, or fine lines, and if I put any kind of makeup over it, the makeup would discolor or just slide right off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pretty excited when I was invited to work with Petunia Skincare on a Promotion to review not only their Anti-Aging Serum but also their Eye Serum and 540 needle Derma Roller!</li>
            <li>If this serum does eventually fade wrinkles and fine lines, I&#x27;d totally stock up on this stuff.</li>
            <li>We have very high hopes for this serum.</li>
            <li>At certain times of the month, she is really straining her eyes.</li>
            <li>I believe Sea Kelp is a very important ingredient as it will tighten the skin around the eye area, getting rid of puffiness and leaving behind smoother and more tightened</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is packaged in a nice glass bottle with a pump cap that dispenses just a drop and a little goes</li>
            <li>Nice little serum.</li>
            <li>my complexion almost instantly, I haven&#x27;t noticed much with it doing anything for my fine lines.</li>
            <li>I was impressed at how little you have to use, and how quickly it dried.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s just say that, in the last couple of months, I have become a huge fan of Petunia Skincare products.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>The roller looks dangerous at first, and my boyfriend swears it hurts him , but it really doesn&#x27;t lol, its not painful at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this company.</li>
            <li>Much like Petunia Skin Care’s</li>
            <li>Much like Petunia Skin Care’s</li>
            <li>, I need to put my moisturizer on so that my skin is not pulling as much.</li>
            <li>It feels really tingly.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so wishing that this product was my saving grace, but it really didn&#x27;t reduce that for me.  </li>
            <li>When Petunia Skincare gave me this serum to review, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>The color of this eye serum really stuck out to me as it is orange.</li>
            <li>It does not leave behind any sticky or oily residues which makes this great to use both in the morning and night.</li>
            <li>I really see a difference in the texture of my eyelids.</li>
            <li>They had gotten very crepey.</li>
            <li>The serum itself is not sticky at all and absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>like how this product is gel-like but at the same time, it&#x27;s feels so light to the skin when applied.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and package arrived no problems.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am ready to take on the day.</li>
            <li>So with this aspect I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The formula of the serum is not at all sticky; it absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li>but this really helps.</li>
            <li>The serum really soothed my under eye area</li>
            <li>And I absolutely like this product.</li>
            <li>never has caused my eye to water (not even for a couple of minutes straight).</li>
            <li>I bought this product not expecting much</li>
            <li>It is effective even for just few days of use.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I cannot determine if it is really good unless I have used it for at least two months.</li>
            <li>now the only portion they are prominent are near the socket of my eye and nose.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>You really only need a small amount so this bottle will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy!</li>
            <li>The results are too early to tell as far as long term and in comparison to how much more effective this is than other brands.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have tried that contained sea kelp, and I trust it completely because I have tried several other Petunia products and have loved them all.  </li>
            <li>but it is still light enough to penetrate the skin quickly, get deep into pores, and absorbs within a matter of seconds after applying it.</li>
            <li>somehow think it makes me feel more active.</li>
            <li>it is all natural and packed full of all natural and organic materials.</li>
            <li>I have a problem with puffy eyes, more so than dark circles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first one I received is the Professional Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>As I wrote for the hyaluronic serum, &amp;#34;I was going to wait longer to review it, but yesterday my husband remarked that the new stuff I got for my face was really improving my skin.</li>
            <li>The puffiness is reduced less prominent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now, so I am hoping with time I will have even better results.</li>
            <li>According to the instructions, this particular serum can be used alone or part of the 3 step skin care solution.</li>
            <li>but I am not one to expect it to make miracles happen and have realistic expectations from the product.</li>
            <li>I am mid-30&#x27;s and luckily don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles yet though.</li>
            <li>Overall, if your eyes aren&#x27;t super puffy, I think you should try it.  </li>
            <li>It is mainly my lack of sleep</li>
            <li>I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have been on a relentless journey to find a good eye treatment for my fine lines, dark circles, and puffiness.</li>
            <li>I am in school and working two jobs right now so the puffy eyes are still present, cant say it has done much on that end.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;For disclosure purposes</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and have experienced eye irritation from other dark eye products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is moderately viscous and has a golden color from the fermented sea kelp.  </li>
            <li>Many companies don&#x27;t seem to actually take steps away from that age old practice, so it&#x27;s a definite plus for these guys.  </li>
            <li>Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  </li>
            <li>Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  </li>
            <li>However, I can tell it is working and trying to make a difference, but just maybe my bags are just too big (smile).  </li>
            <li>Plus the tiny laugh lines I was developing are diminishing.</li>
            <li>I like to use this in the morning while I am doing my normal morning skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I have not used the product long enough to give you a truthful review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and comes with a pump on top so you can get just a few drops which is all it takes to work.  </li>
            <li>Now this is a favorite of mine at half the cost to boot!</li>
            <li>My eyes seriously look so much better after using this every day!</li>
            <li>This one particular product has so many of these ingredients all in one little bottle!  </li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes are improved when I use this, so I do have some high hopes for the dark circles becoming less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.r, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face</li>
            <li>They are my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I try new ones all the time</li>
            <li>The company realizes this bottle/dispenser is an issue and they are looking for a new bottle/dispenser distributor but in the meantime there is nothing that can be done</li>
            <li>and when there&#x27;s a new development on my skin tone, I shall leave an update on this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well on developing fine lines, dark circles, and firming the skin.</li>
            <li>Moisturizers, helps diminish dark circles, reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>NATURAL INGREDIENTS AGREES WITH MY SENSITIVE SKIN,AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS!</li>
            <li>i had wanted to return it for a refund but have been very busy and just haven&#x27;t had the time.  </li>
            <li>The dark circles are fading away which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>I see a small difference, but I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li>Follow your regular skincare regimen first.</li>
            <li>So far, the product has worked well!</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and serums in the past.</li>
            <li>Having tried many eye creams in the past, I have seen it all.</li>
            <li>; came into my mind - if all these years of trying new stuff has paid off so far, why change what I&#x27;m doing?  </li>
            <li>My eyes look tired a lot, sometimes due to not sleeping good, others just because!</li>
            <li>This serum has rid me of puffiness and significantly reduced the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This will firm up your skin and fix any fine lines and wrinkles that you may have.</li>
            <li>And there are so many ingredients that are used in serums, it is hard to choose.  </li>
            <li>In order to test any skin reactions, since I have sensitive skin, I tried this out on my hand.</li>
            <li>It seems to work so far</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen miraculous results as far as wrinkles go.</li>
            <li>The sea kelp adds anti-inflammatory action for the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Ever since we were young, my sister and I have always played around with skincare products.  </li>
            <li>As I read that email, the old adage &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The skin around my eye feel tighter and soft.</li>
            <li>It feels silky soft to the touch and soaks into the skin immediately.</li>
            <li>My eyes tend to be sensitive</li>
            <li>It is really light and not to heavy on your face.</li>
            <li>It also has a light green tinge to it which could cancel out some discoloration.</li>
            <li>I was far too intimidated by the needles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product for a month now and far as I can tell, it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.  </li>
            <li>So we have to be proactive and take care of our skin early in our lives.  </li>
            <li>This product is all natural, organic and is NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I have had a complete improvement with it taking care of puffiness and</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.</li>
            <li>I SWEAR look.&amp;#34; For those who don&#x27;t know what I mean, is it takes care of the puffiness, while giving you more of an</li>
            <li>Ingredients like Sea Kelp, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl, Vitamin C and Ferulic Acid help me fight all the things that bug me related to my eyes: dark circles, puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>This Eye Serum has plenty of great active ingredients without anything unnecessary.</li>
            <li>I also used this on my hand first, and it also has a weird smell, but the way it gets rid of dark circles is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have to be sure to use  very small amount of it, otherwise it dries into an unattractive flaky consistency.</li>
            <li>Make sure you patch test, this does give off an uncomfortable burning sensation at first.</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem to be smoothing and a slightly saggy upper lid seems to be tightening a bit.</li>
            <li>I did notice it made my eyelids tingle a little when applying, but it was not painful nor did it cause my eyes to water.</li>
            <li>I did notice it made my eyelids tingle a little when applying, but it was not painful nor did it cause my eyes to water.</li>
            <li>am keeping my hopes high that I won’t be getting any wrinkles around my eyes if I keep using the serum, but for the price of $26.77 for only 0.51 fl.oz.</li>
            <li>All of their products are produced in small batches to guarantee freshness and packaged under secure and sanitary conditions in a state of the art, FDA certified facility.</li>
            <li>No lines diminished, no dark circles made lighter, nothing.</li>
            <li>I have not used this long enough to verify that my dark circles have lightened (I have allergic shiners), but I can verify that all the other claims have worked for me - it reduces wrinkles around the eyes and softens the skin as a strong yet mild moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>As a licensed esthetician, I have primarily been using professional products for the past several years however I have been pleasantly surprised by the Petunia Skin Care Products.</li>
            <li>but again when you buy this you really only get half the product since the other half will fly elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I believe surgery or some new procedure will be the only way to alleviate my problem.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Worked better for me than Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair, and far less expensive.</li>
            <li>but after a couple weeks of use, my eye area is tighter, but not in a dry way - the area itself is very hydrated &amp; dewy.</li>
            <li>Your skin around your eyes is delicate, making the skin around the eyes the most thinnest areas than the rest of the face, as we age it only gets thinner.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried other creams, lotions and serums but this was my first time having the opportunity to test a Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petunia</li>
            <li>I like the pump style of the bottle (generally all the serums I have used before</li>
            <li>I used twice a day consistently for 1 month, morning and night and didn&#x27;t see a decrease in my puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li>four years younger, when we would go into mom&#x27;s bathroom (of course, when she was busy elsewhere in the house) and pretend we were her, putting all kinds of goop on our faces.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am 40, I am picky with what I use on my skin and especially around the sensitive areas like my eyes.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of straight use couldn&#x27;t tell any minimal difference.</li>
            <li>My eye area seems to be suddenly perky and also soft to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The professional actually says,”If</li>
            <li>and I pleasantly surprised that it has exceeded my expectations and in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>and I am only 38 years old.  </li>
            <li>I am kind of obsessed with eye creams.  </li>
            <li>I get a slightly stinging sensation when I first apply the serum under my eyes, but it goes away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 30 year old male and have a pretty active lifestyle which often means that I am sleeping less than I should and am not taking much care of my skin.</li>
            <li>All items worked very well with each other.</li>
            <li>I really like the other Petunia Skincare products I have used a lot, too.</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t had much luck with other eye products, I recommend giving this serum a try.</li>
            <li>(Right now, my dark under eyes&#x27; areas are lightened by the smoothness making a great base for my under eye makeup, so that is an improvement while I keep using it to see if the skin itself can</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually a 29 year old female.  </li>
            <li>They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li>They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li>It stings a little when going on at first, but you get used to it after about a week.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really packed this serum with dark circle fighting ingredients</li>
            <li>While this product may work well for dark circles-- which is not my issue,  it really didn&#x27;t do anything for the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was using daily, but really didn&#x27;t notice the results like the other serum&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>This is liquid that spread well onto the skin but took a few seconds longer to absorb than I expected but wasn’t greasy or oily and once absorbed, my skin felt soft and tighter.</li>
            <li>The ONLY thing I will note is that you have to be very careful not to dispense too much.</li>
            <li>I simply apply a few dabs of this serum underneath my eyes and around my eyelids, massage it in gently using upward circular motions, and within a few seconds the serum has completely absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>Eye-Cream is less cream and more like a thick Serum.</li>
            <li>Eye-Cream is less cream and more like a thick Serum.</li>
            <li>I think the eye serum was really good as I have very pale, thin skin.  </li>
            <li>This serum has botanical extracts and other ingredients such as hyaluronic acid that protect and plump the skin while promoting sloughing of older cells to give a fresh appearance and texture to delicate areas of the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this eye serum to anyone suffering with puffiness and dark</li>

            <li> what this eye serum does it makes the skin of my eyes feel great</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, this eye serum has a really great consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that I found this product because it works</li>
            <li> This stuff is great</li>
            <li> This has turned out to be a great way to test out DNA-repairing skincare.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> and I think it does a great job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also great to use it with a dermaroller.</li>
            <li> The product seems very nice.  </li>
            <li> I received this item at no cost in order to facilitate an honest review...and this eye serum is honestly very very good.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see any remarkable results.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for reducing my eye puffiness and making my eyes brighter, they look so much more awake.</li>
            <li> and more you know you are getting the best care for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its about 10 pages of really good information.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so I have a really good idea of what works and what doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Product seems to work good</li>
            <li> It’s one of the best oil free moisturizers I’ve ever used.</li>
            <li> it is quite good.</li>
            <li> Good eye serum -</li>
            <li> Hopefully they work as good as this.</li>
            <li> serum is best applied to clean skin after washing or bathing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost comical wondering where it&#x27;s going to fly every morning and night when I try to use it.</li>
            <li> It is a great serum to use in the morning to give you that, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been awake for more than 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Working out great...definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> IT was my first time using a product that had Sea Kelp in it, but I was impressed!</li>
            <li> This eye serum is the most effective I have ever before used!</li>
            <li> (Tip: put in the refrigerator for an even more refreshed feeling!)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR MY EYES!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> What woman doesn&#x27;t love to hear that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it on my face on most days and night and it&#x27;s been a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> texture is great because it absorbs so quick!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second of all, this serum is jam packed with amazing ingredients that are meant to tighten, tone, and fight against discoloration.</li>
            <li> but I would honestly rather die than have my stretchmarks on the</li>
            <li> and it seemed nice.  </li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin</li>
            <li> that worry that women have about time catching up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> packaging is nice, in a substantial-feeling glass jar.</li>
            <li> I received these products for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve pumped more than I need for my eyes, I use the rest on my face and it&#x27;s also good to my face.</li>
            <li> but this is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> the years are catching up to me...</li>
            <li> So I’m going to be honest here.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly, but it is effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure all of the ingredients are good for my skin</li>
            <li> The texture is nice</li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t know if it has worked or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Check out their website for more skincare products and I am sure you will be happy with all of them.  </li>
            <li> received the product for free, but my opinion is my own!</li>
            <li> sure comes in handy</li>
            <li> far, I am extremely impressed by the two products I&#x27;ve tried from Petunia Skincare.  </li>
            <li> It blends in nicely and really works great to help in these issues.</li>
            <li> serum feel very smooth going on not the oily feeling we get sometimes.</li>
            <li> love the eye serum, it may be my favorite.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be okay, but it came opened.  </li>
            <li> The box was opened and the top of the container had been opened.  </li>
            <li> so maybe with more use I will notice more improvement.</li>
            <li> It does nothing for the undereye, and dries in a gel layer and peels, so do not wear makeup over top.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was given a free sample to try fo my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> More of an eye soother than a corrector of skin problems.</li>
            <li> but I think that this serum is better than any of them.</li>
            <li> I asked him to elaborate and he said my skin looked fresher and brighter and that I looked more rested.</li>
            <li> The best part of it is it actually works.</li>
            <li> It does, however, make my eye makeup stick better when I cover my circles with makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my eyes feel.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried both of these Petunia products.</li>
            <li> My favorite anti-aging eye product has been Caudalie&#x27;s eye cream which costs $99.</li>
            <li> I always seem to be more drawn to serums than creams as I just fell in love with the consistency and texture that serums have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I hope with continued use I will see even better results.</li>
            <li> and I hope with continued use I will see even better results.</li>
            <li> I guess it feels a bit refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have lots of issue with swollen, puffy eyes, so I will continue to use this to see if there is more noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but hopefully with more usages it will fade.</li>
            <li> Probably the caffeine inside doing most of that.</li>
            <li> as of 31 Oct.-------&lt;br /&gt;I have changed the review rating from 4 starts to 5 stars because after more than a week of usage, I have already seen how my eye bags are not puffy anymore</li>
            <li> Plus it makes me feel more awake after I use this.</li>
            <li> received the product for free but the opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This eye serum has satisfied all my expectations.</li>
            <li> Use and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love their products, as they have truly worked for me.</li>
            <li> As for under the eyes, the most noticeable difference this gel made for me is de-puffing.  </li>
            <li> &quot; look and this as been something that has been able to reduce the puffiness around my eyes even during tax</li>
            <li> You can read more about my thoughts on this product on my blog post http://katsdailyinspiration.blogspot.com/2015/02/petunia-skincare-10mm-derma-roller-eye.html</li>
            <li> medieval torture device is this?!”The serums worked great!</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and i already notice more firmness.  </li>
            <li> the pump tends to dispense more than i need for my eyes</li>
            <li> and I suppose that with more prolonged use I might see something.  </li>
            <li> I am not so sure about wrinkles etc.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love feeling it tighten the skin</li>
            <li> my guess is they would look even better if I used it day and night.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the Revitalize Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> My favorite use is before makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I love this products.  </li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare has my vote as a super skincare company that has the BEST NATURAL AND ORGANIC INGREDIENTS - 100% CRUELTY FREE!</li>
            <li> Product has significantly improved dryness around my eyes!</li>
            <li> At this point, I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I feel more time is needed to get a more accurate representation of what it can do.</li>
            <li> Either because of good genes or the fact that we messed with all of this stuff when we were younger (or maybe both), my sister and I have always been told that we have good skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel, the smell and the overall results that I experienced in one week. :)</li>
            <li> I can see a bit of a difference in the appearance of my undereyes and am happy so far with the results.</li>
            <li> I received a free example of this eye gel from Petunia Skin care for a sincere review.</li>
            <li> I like this serum because it works great for sensitive skin and delivers the results that it promises.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I loved that Sea Kelp is a main ingredient of this.</li>
            <li> and I do notice that my fine lines have reduced in appearance.</li>
            <li> seems to correct your fine lines</li>
            <li> I think with longer use, it would help keep fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li> The fine lines seem to still be there</li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to apply and of silky and smooth it is.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s another super important ingredient for skin health!</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with this eye serum!</li>
            <li> However, the first time I put it on I significantly noticed my skin around my eyes had that more awake look, and the complexion looked better.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about 2 weeks now, I have noticed a huge improvement to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> moisturizer is really light, not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>

            <li> I received a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li> They must be have been given the product free or were paid to leave a review?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for my eyes honestly.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as a promotional offer, along with the hyaluronic serum.</li>
            <li> They have the fastest absorption rate of any serums I have tried and moisturize and smooth skin as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was given this item for free if I wrote a review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> received product free to review</li>
            <li> Like their Hyaluronic Acid Serum, which I&#x27;ve also used, it is 100% cruelty-free which is important to me.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare provided a free sample for review.</li>
            <li> did receive this product free to facilitate my review.  </li>

            <li> I received this for free to try from Tomoson and Petunia Skincare.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free to try, but this is my honest opinion, it really does work.</li>
            <li> The first day it burned a bit but day two and on it was much better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I was excited to try this Revitalize Eye Serum from Petunia Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay first of all,  I am a guy.  </li>
            <li> i could not wait to use this product and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> - Cool smooth feeling</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li> My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s the best product for aging lines thus far, I do however feel it is an amazing product for dark circles as well as putting moisture into the skin and worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Clean face.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs quickly and feels light.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is easy to use and absorbs right into your skin.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare is not your average “skincare” company, they are committed to delivering the highest formulation standards, and prides themselves with the best skin care ingredients in the world, proven by scientific research and real life testing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than two weeks now and it seems to be really working.</li>
            <li> This is a true serum, not like a cream at all.</li>
            <li> And I still feel that cool, tingly feeling when it is being applied under my eye area.</li>
            <li> I have gone through a full bottle of eye serum versus.</li>
            <li> So my full results aren&#x27;t in yet, but I would give this a recommendation.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of lifting the upper lid.</li>
            <li> all i need from petunia is there own natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Love this product but don&#x27;t use too much or it will peal off.</li>
            <li> so it really helps me look more awake than I feel.</li>
            <li> (FULL DISCLOSURE:</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a really good job at not only making you appear more awake, but also absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> Within just a couple of days, I viewed fine lines decrease as well as my eye areas was smooth as well as definitely, VERY youthful looking.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I do like how quickly this serum absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> I give it a ten plus for sure and the lines look better as well</li>
            <li> The serum is concentrated and once you apply it absorbs quickly in to your skin.</li>
            <li> and I have been without adequate sleep</li>
            <li> I love this high quality eye serum.</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it!</li>
            <li> I love that the two Petunia Skincare products I&#x27;ve tried, the hyaluronic acid serum and this eye serum, are so fast absorbing!  </li>
            <li> Funny thing, I still will purchase another bottle because my husband loves it for his puffy eyes!</li>
            <li> immediate effects are noticeable and regular use will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and promote a healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and I feel it absorbing into my skin.  </li>
            <li> This one has not given me amazing results, but I have only used it a couple of weeks -</li>
            <li> A couple of things I like about the company as a whole is that you get a free e-book that talks to you about beauty regimens, I received a follow up email to give me some tips on using their product</li>
            <li> This is gentle, and light, and works well.</li>
            <li> The texture is light and absorbs in fairly fast.</li>
            <li> I did not know that sea kelp or seaweed or dead sea salts were great for skincare.  </li>
            <li> I have used many professional products...</li>
            <li> not as good as expected</li>
            <li> the serum just melts in and is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft, and gently takes off the outer layer of skin, giving my skin a nice fresh look.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I really like this product, but it didn&#x27;t really take the puffiness away from my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is convenient, and the product contains a lot of useful ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I liked the overall product!  </li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t believe it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> my eyes felt fresh and the tiredness seemed to go away at once</li>
            <li> That alone is worth using this eye gel.</li>
            <li> This is a brand/product that is truly worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply, 1 pump is enough for both eyes since it spreads so easily.</li>
            <li> My skin drank it up and the softness was noticeable right away.</li>
            <li> All right</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, be careful with amour used, leaves a while flakey residue.</li>
            <li> product itself is ok but haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference.  </li>
            <li> and she loved what it did for her dark circles overnight.</li>
            <li> Eye Serum may be good for dark circles</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s so important to take good care of the delicate eye area, which is often the first place to show signs of aging.</li>
            <li> This is light, has a pleasant faint fragrance and is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It does provide nice moisture for underneath my eyes, which is an area that I find is often very dry.</li>
            <li> Then, as we got older, we would go to different beauty and makeup stories to buy our own goops to try out.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles have almost completely disappeared and I’m going to continue working on my fine lines and wrinkles because of the great results I’ve noticed so far.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helped the bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I first tried some on my hands for a couple of days and then under my eyes</li>
            <li> First using the vitamin C serum and then applying the eye gel serum.</li>
            <li> couple of months ago, I received an email from a lady at Petunia Skincare asking if I would be interested in trying one of their products.  </li>
            <li> I emailed her back that I would be glad to try out her product and received it a couple of days</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin becoming more firm underneath my eyes as well as around my eyelids.</li>
            <li> when I apply the product, it feels hydrating and at the same time it&#x27;s not too overwhelming for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Skin around the eye is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but, it has most definitely assisted my eyes.</li>
            <li> it felt fabulous around my eyes and made the skin so soft.</li>
            <li> - my only issue is that more then I want to use comes out with a squirt</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> So I alternated use of the serums and my skin took on a pretty glow after a couple days.</li>
            <li> and you can decide for yourself ; )</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my eyes have become more hooded to the point where my lower eyelid is barely visible.</li>
            <li> I really like both of these products and will most likely reorder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my dark circles, but just for getting rid of the puffiness, I&#x27;m thrilled to have received this product for review!</li>
            <li> I am still using it and looking forward to positive results.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no scent, the pump applicator dispenses just the right amount, so no wasting the product when too much squirts out, it absorbs pretty much on contact, and you really can feel your eye area tighten up immediately.</li>
            <li> I still top it off with my long time</li>
            <li> It dries pretty fast and does not leave any after marks.</li>
            <li> but I have used seaweed products in the past and loved what they did for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how that puffy feeling can bring you down.</li>
            <li> What else I found interesting is the most beneficial ingredients present, the Niacinamide and Sea Kelp bioferment, are of much higher quantities than any of the other much pricier DNA labeled products I investigated.</li>
            <li> There is a very mild stinging effect from the exfoliating ingredients and when applying it under the eyes, care should be taken not to let it actually get into the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I end up in need of more eye cream as it seems to dry the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to push down slowly only to have the serum still fly across the room, hit my mirror, and even hit me in the eyes.</li>
            <li> It really seems to tighten and firm the skin and feels cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Net result - dark circles started getting more prominent, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is nice and thick, yet absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> used this twice a day every day until the bottle was empty (which took about 6 weeks); didn&#x27;t make one bit of difference in my dark circles, puffiness, or fine lines, and if I put any kind of makeup over it, the makeup would discolor or just slide right off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pretty excited when I was invited to work with Petunia Skincare on a Promotion to review not only their Anti-Aging Serum but also their Eye Serum and 540 needle Derma Roller!</li>
            <li> If this serum does eventually fade wrinkles and fine lines, I&#x27;d totally stock up on this stuff.</li>
            <li> We have very high hopes for this serum.</li>
            <li> At certain times of the month, she is really straining her eyes.</li>
            <li> I believe Sea Kelp is a very important ingredient as it will tighten the skin around the eye area, getting rid of puffiness and leaving behind smoother and more tightened</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is packaged in a nice glass bottle with a pump cap that dispenses just a drop and a little goes</li>
            <li> Nice little serum.</li>
            <li> my complexion almost instantly, I haven&#x27;t noticed much with it doing anything for my fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was impressed at how little you have to use, and how quickly it dried.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just say that, in the last couple of months, I have become a huge fan of Petunia Skincare products.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> The roller looks dangerous at first, and my boyfriend swears it hurts him , but it really doesn&#x27;t lol, its not painful at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this company.</li>
            <li> Much like Petunia Skin Care’s</li>
            <li> Much like Petunia Skin Care’s</li>
            <li> , I need to put my moisturizer on so that my skin is not pulling as much.</li>
            <li> It feels really tingly.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so wishing that this product was my saving grace, but it really didn&#x27;t reduce that for me.  </li>
            <li> When Petunia Skincare gave me this serum to review, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> The color of this eye serum really stuck out to me as it is orange.</li>
            <li> It does not leave behind any sticky or oily residues which makes this great to use both in the morning and night.</li>
            <li> I really see a difference in the texture of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> They had gotten very crepey.</li>
            <li> The serum itself is not sticky at all and absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> like how this product is gel-like but at the same time, it&#x27;s feels so light to the skin when applied.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and package arrived no problems.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am ready to take on the day.</li>
            <li> So with this aspect I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The formula of the serum is not at all sticky; it absorbs really fast.</li>
            <li> but this really helps.</li>
            <li> The serum really soothed my under eye area</li>
            <li> And I absolutely like this product.</li>
            <li> never has caused my eye to water (not even for a couple of minutes straight).</li>
            <li> I bought this product not expecting much</li>
            <li> It is effective even for just few days of use.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> I cannot determine if it is really good unless I have used it for at least two months.</li>
            <li> now the only portion they are prominent are near the socket of my eye and nose.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> You really only need a small amount so this bottle will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy!</li>
            <li> The results are too early to tell as far as long term and in comparison to how much more effective this is than other brands.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have tried that contained sea kelp, and I trust it completely because I have tried several other Petunia products and have loved them all.  </li>
            <li> but it is still light enough to penetrate the skin quickly, get deep into pores, and absorbs within a matter of seconds after applying it.</li>
            <li> somehow think it makes me feel more active.</li>
            <li> it is all natural and packed full of all natural and organic materials.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with puffy eyes, more so than dark circles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first one I received is the Professional Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> As I wrote for the hyaluronic serum, &amp;#34;I was going to wait longer to review it, but yesterday my husband remarked that the new stuff I got for my face was really improving my skin.</li>
            <li> The puffiness is reduced less prominent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now, so I am hoping with time I will have even better results.</li>
            <li> According to the instructions, this particular serum can be used alone or part of the 3 step skin care solution.</li>
            <li> but I am not one to expect it to make miracles happen and have realistic expectations from the product.</li>
            <li> I am mid-30&#x27;s and luckily don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles yet though.</li>
            <li> Overall, if your eyes aren&#x27;t super puffy, I think you should try it.  </li>
            <li> It is mainly my lack of sleep</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have been on a relentless journey to find a good eye treatment for my fine lines, dark circles, and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I am in school and working two jobs right now so the puffy eyes are still present, cant say it has done much on that end.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;For disclosure purposes</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and have experienced eye irritation from other dark eye products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is moderately viscous and has a golden color from the fermented sea kelp.  </li>
            <li> Many companies don&#x27;t seem to actually take steps away from that age old practice, so it&#x27;s a definite plus for these guys.  </li>
            <li> Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  </li>
            <li> Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  </li>
            <li> However, I can tell it is working and trying to make a difference, but just maybe my bags are just too big (smile).  </li>
            <li> Plus the tiny laugh lines I was developing are diminishing.</li>
            <li> I like to use this in the morning while I am doing my normal morning skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product long enough to give you a truthful review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and comes with a pump on top so you can get just a few drops which is all it takes to work.  </li>
            <li> Now this is a favorite of mine at half the cost to boot!</li>
            <li> My eyes seriously look so much better after using this every day!</li>
            <li> This one particular product has so many of these ingredients all in one little bottle!  </li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes are improved when I use this, so I do have some high hopes for the dark circles becoming less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.r, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face</li>
            <li> They are my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I try new ones all the time</li>
            <li> The company realizes this bottle/dispenser is an issue and they are looking for a new bottle/dispenser distributor but in the meantime there is nothing that can be done</li>
            <li> and when there&#x27;s a new development on my skin tone, I shall leave an update on this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well on developing fine lines, dark circles, and firming the skin.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers, helps diminish dark circles, reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> NATURAL INGREDIENTS AGREES WITH MY SENSITIVE SKIN,AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS!</li>
            <li> i had wanted to return it for a refund but have been very busy and just haven&#x27;t had the time.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles are fading away which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I see a small difference, but I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> Follow your regular skincare regimen first.</li>
            <li> So far, the product has worked well!</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and serums in the past.</li>
            <li> Having tried many eye creams in the past, I have seen it all.</li>
            <li> ; came into my mind - if all these years of trying new stuff has paid off so far, why change what I&#x27;m doing?  </li>
            <li> My eyes look tired a lot, sometimes due to not sleeping good, others just because!</li>
            <li> This serum has rid me of puffiness and significantly reduced the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This will firm up your skin and fix any fine lines and wrinkles that you may have.</li>
            <li> And there are so many ingredients that are used in serums, it is hard to choose.  </li>
            <li> In order to test any skin reactions, since I have sensitive skin, I tried this out on my hand.</li>
            <li> It seems to work so far</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen miraculous results as far as wrinkles go.</li>
            <li> The sea kelp adds anti-inflammatory action for the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Ever since we were young, my sister and I have always played around with skincare products.  </li>
            <li> As I read that email, the old adage &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The skin around my eye feel tighter and soft.</li>
            <li> It feels silky soft to the touch and soaks into the skin immediately.</li>
            <li> My eyes tend to be sensitive</li>
            <li> It is really light and not to heavy on your face.</li>
            <li> It also has a light green tinge to it which could cancel out some discoloration.</li>
            <li> I was far too intimidated by the needles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for a month now and far as I can tell, it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.  </li>
            <li> So we have to be proactive and take care of our skin early in our lives.  </li>
            <li> This product is all natural, organic and is NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have had a complete improvement with it taking care of puffiness and</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.</li>
            <li> I SWEAR look.&amp;#34; For those who don&#x27;t know what I mean, is it takes care of the puffiness, while giving you more of an</li>
            <li> Ingredients like Sea Kelp, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl, Vitamin C and Ferulic Acid help me fight all the things that bug me related to my eyes: dark circles, puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> This Eye Serum has plenty of great active ingredients without anything unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I also used this on my hand first, and it also has a weird smell, but the way it gets rid of dark circles is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have to be sure to use  very small amount of it, otherwise it dries into an unattractive flaky consistency.</li>
            <li> Make sure you patch test, this does give off an uncomfortable burning sensation at first.</li>
            <li> Fine lines seem to be smoothing and a slightly saggy upper lid seems to be tightening a bit.</li>
            <li> I did notice it made my eyelids tingle a little when applying, but it was not painful nor did it cause my eyes to water.</li>
            <li> I did notice it made my eyelids tingle a little when applying, but it was not painful nor did it cause my eyes to water.</li>
            <li> am keeping my hopes high that I won’t be getting any wrinkles around my eyes if I keep using the serum, but for the price of $26.77 for only 0.51 fl.oz.</li>
            <li> All of their products are produced in small batches to guarantee freshness and packaged under secure and sanitary conditions in a state of the art, FDA certified facility.</li>
            <li> No lines diminished, no dark circles made lighter, nothing.</li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to verify that my dark circles have lightened (I have allergic shiners), but I can verify that all the other claims have worked for me - it reduces wrinkles around the eyes and softens the skin as a strong yet mild moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> As a licensed esthetician, I have primarily been using professional products for the past several years however I have been pleasantly surprised by the Petunia Skin Care Products.</li>
            <li> but again when you buy this you really only get half the product since the other half will fly elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I believe surgery or some new procedure will be the only way to alleviate my problem.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Worked better for me than Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair, and far less expensive.</li>
            <li> but after a couple weeks of use, my eye area is tighter, but not in a dry way - the area itself is very hydrated &amp; dewy.</li>
            <li> Your skin around your eyes is delicate, making the skin around the eyes the most thinnest areas than the rest of the face, as we age it only gets thinner.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried other creams, lotions and serums but this was my first time having the opportunity to test a Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petunia</li>
            <li> I like the pump style of the bottle (generally all the serums I have used before</li>
            <li> I used twice a day consistently for 1 month, morning and night and didn&#x27;t see a decrease in my puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> four years younger, when we would go into mom&#x27;s bathroom (of course, when she was busy elsewhere in the house) and pretend we were her, putting all kinds of goop on our faces.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am 40, I am picky with what I use on my skin and especially around the sensitive areas like my eyes.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of straight use couldn&#x27;t tell any minimal difference.</li>
            <li> My eye area seems to be suddenly perky and also soft to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The professional actually says,”If</li>
            <li> and I pleasantly surprised that it has exceeded my expectations and in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> and I am only 38 years old.  </li>
            <li> I am kind of obsessed with eye creams.  </li>
            <li> I get a slightly stinging sensation when I first apply the serum under my eyes, but it goes away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old male and have a pretty active lifestyle which often means that I am sleeping less than I should and am not taking much care of my skin.</li>
            <li> All items worked very well with each other.</li>
            <li> I really like the other Petunia Skincare products I have used a lot, too.</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t had much luck with other eye products, I recommend giving this serum a try.</li>
            <li> (Right now, my dark under eyes&#x27; areas are lightened by the smoothness making a great base for my under eye makeup, so that is an improvement while I keep using it to see if the skin itself can</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a 29 year old female.  </li>
            <li> They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li> They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  </li>
            <li> It stings a little when going on at first, but you get used to it after about a week.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve really packed this serum with dark circle fighting ingredients</li>
            <li> While this product may work well for dark circles-- which is not my issue,  it really didn&#x27;t do anything for the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was using daily, but really didn&#x27;t notice the results like the other serum&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is liquid that spread well onto the skin but took a few seconds longer to absorb than I expected but wasn’t greasy or oily and once absorbed, my skin felt soft and tighter.</li>
            <li> The ONLY thing I will note is that you have to be very careful not to dispense too much.</li>
            <li> I simply apply a few dabs of this serum underneath my eyes and around my eyelids, massage it in gently using upward circular motions, and within a few seconds the serum has completely absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Eye-Cream is less cream and more like a thick Serum.</li>
            <li> Eye-Cream is less cream and more like a thick Serum.</li>
            <li> I think the eye serum was really good as I have very pale, thin skin.  </li>
            <li> This serum has botanical extracts and other ingredients such as hyaluronic acid that protect and plump the skin while promoting sloughing of older cells to give a fresh appearance and texture to delicate areas of the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this eye serum to anyone suffering with puffiness and dark</li>

            <li> As far as this goes, I have seen some minor changes with the dark circles under my eyes, however at this current moment I am still using this eye serum, so I cannot yet fully judge just what its end results will be.</li>

            <li> Petunia Skincare is one of the brands that has never let me down so far.</li>

            <li> I have a light dark circle tough which I am trying to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks, I have not really seen a big result.  </li>
            <li> I will update my review over time once I have a few weeks of use but so far this is doing what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it also relieves the puffiness that i sometimes get from working long hours.</li>
            <li> serum is packed with a long list of all-natural ingredients to help nurture and pamper your skin.</li>
            <li> As a college student, I tend to have long nights of studying and doing homework and even when I&#x27;m not doing that, insomnia takes hold of me</li>
            <li> for long hours in front of the computer tends to tire our my eyes, but the serum helped me out with that too as soon as I applied the serum</li>
            <li> and yet I look like I have been sleeping all night long.</li>
            <li> I have tried other eye creams before and the only one that ever made a difference was the Caudalie cream.</li>
            <li> The unique formulation soothed all my eye problems and my eyes were noticeably less tired looking.  </li>
            <li> There was no residue or waiting time to dry.</li>
            <li> Also, the container that it comes in, the spout dry&#x27;s up squirting out sideways wasting a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> I dab it on it after washing my face, allowing it to dry, and then apply my eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> They use only vegan, and cruelty-free formulations containing natural/organic active ingredients.</li>
            <li> So, that being said, the product did not live up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> After using it for about a week, I could definitely see a visible reduction in puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> and the dark circles have actually lightened.</li>
            <li> although i have been using the serum for weeks, i still have the same puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Definitely has reduced dark circles -</li>
            <li> All of those I have tried were clear type gels where this one is a yellow type liquid with a slight smell that smells a little like some other brands of Vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare works hard to live up to all of their claims and strive to over-deliver their consumers expectations.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;m afraid to stop playing with all of these skincare products (haha),</li>
            <li> So a big YES to slowing down the aging process, there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This eye serum is a bit different formulation than other eye gels that I have also tried from other brands.</li>
            <li> The only odd thing about this product is that I find it flakes and clumps a bit as it dries.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight tingly sensation when it is applied but only lasts for about 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> It actually helped my eyes look less baggy and lighter.</li>
            <li> It makes eye area very dry an  product crusts up.</li>
            <li> I do wish that there was a different &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s a dropper, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face</li>
            <li> This eye serum is loaded with the right ingredients to take away eye puffiness, dark circles and those tired eyes look.</li>
            <li> When you apply the serum, it feels tight and stings ever so slightly (not enough to annoy me and it goes away within seconds).  </li>
            <li> Perhaps allowing a little time to pass before multiple efforts of requesting a review may be wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long you need to us it to actually see the results.  </li>
            <li> not sure if I see much of a decrease in under eye shadow w/ use for 1 month, will continue as there is a small improvement</li>
            <li> I do see a difference on my complexion the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> No parabens, no sulfates, no gluten, no alcohol, no phthalates, and absolutely no animal testing.</li>
            <li> She used this eye serum and it takes away those aged eyes signs.</li>
            <li> One final note: I have been using it everyday for about 3 weeks and will update my review if things change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 months ad have seen absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> So just be careful of that.  </li>
            <li> I immediately put a few of the recommended skincare products on my to get list only to find all of them loaded with either perabenes or dimethicone.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the serum is lightweight but a little goes a long way and once applied to the skin</li>
            <li> And believe me a little goes a long way, one drop is sufficient to cover both eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No more squandering cash on the brand names marketed in the department stores that actually just don&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> AND there is a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum twice a day for the past 3 days and already noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> I would think it would be the other way around.  </li>
            <li> Still going to use the other serums though.</li>
            <li> Other than then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used (or noticed) other eye serums I&#x27;ve used contained caffeine....</li>
            <li> Perhaps &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; are puffiness to the extreme.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a product to reduce my extreme under eye puffiness, aka bags...</li>
            <li> That being said, I have tried other products and they didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> The product has a truly weightless feeling and it only takes a small amount twice a day. .</li>
            <li> I already bought the other products for the face.  </li>
            <li> My skin does feel a little dry after i put it on</li>
            <li> /&gt;Natural Active Peptides</li>
            <li> I still had dark circles and wrinkles after using for 3 weeks and nothing changed from using this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work too well for wrinkles or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> However there was no noticeable effect on the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any changes in my dark circles as of yet.</li>
            <li> , it works wonders for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my dark circles yet though.</li>
            <li> It has also helped diminish the appearance of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> have suffered off and on with dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I may still have some dark circles but they are beginning to fade away</li>
            <li> I may still have some dark circles but they are beginning to fade away</li>
            <li> The dark circles are just about gone</li>
            <li> I believe the container is wrong for the product, wasting it by dispensing too much at a time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in puffiness, lines or dark circles.</li>
            <li> a in lightening my dark circles or the skin texture underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> I tend to suffer from puffy under eyes as well as dark circles.</li>
            <li> I place a squirt on each corners of eyes to help with &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; and another one under each eye to help with maybe dark circles or to reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li> It helps to control the puffiness in your eyes and dark circles that you may have.</li>
            <li> but it is not worth the hype...</li>
            <li> I have seen slight improvements in my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I did notice reduction in the puffiness under my eyes as well as the dark circles under my eyes got less noticeable</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> I even took the advice of a few other reviewers and started keeping it in the fridge but no change.</li>
            <li> Its working to lighten circle and slight improvement to skin around eye.</li>
            <li> I have black circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> One less thing.</li>
            <li> It has a slight tingly sensation (you&#x27;re applying it on/close to your eyes).</li>
            <li> There is less puffiness under my eyes and I&#x27;m using not wearing concealer every day.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve probably wasted half the product because when you push the dispenser down the product shoots across the room.</li>
            <li> I was a but haphazard about applying it when I first got it, and I think that may have delayed the results a bit.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for few days now and can see a slight improvement on my skin texture around my baggy eyes.</li>
            <li> According to the directions for use you can use it under your moisturizer, but the serum dried making my under eye area slightly sticky, no matter how little I used.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a trail tester, been using it for a month now and have noticed a little bit of improvement in the texture and color under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of this, but it works wonders for dark circles, and puffy eyes!</li>
            <li> A little bit but nothing too noticeable IMO.</li>
            <li> I like the way my eyes feel and a little goes along way</li>
            <li> But little effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I put a litle on daily and my eyes look brighter and less tired</li>
            <li> From everyday stress on a job this eye serum</li>
            <li> and I also have a few favorites.  </li>
            <li> I gave my friend a few pumps of the serum to try out as well</li>
            <li> the serum just may not fit into my budget to keep using it again and again which is my reason to give it a 4 star rather than</li>
            <li> I have a few complain though...  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s missing is the perabenes and dimethicone.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> Rub it under your eyes and in a few days see the difference.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m noticing a slight difference!</li>
            <li> Due to heavy studying and late night events,  I have seen puffiness and dark circles developed like crazy under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> So over the past few weeks I have been putting this to the test.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, or heavy feeling on the skin too!  </li>
            <li> I am seeing the benefits with small lines and crows feet.</li>
            <li> This is not your ordinary eye-cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil seeds around my eyes from using heavy olay eye creams have started to fade as well!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure of I am seeing any benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been getting 7-8 hours sleep, as I usually do, and getting exercise.</li>
            <li> I was too lazy to do anything about it and landed on this product by chance.</li>
            <li> here are the things I know in the past 5 weeks of usage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With our crazy lifestyles today, I think everyone can relate to having early signs of aging and bags under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> This can lead to seriously dark circles and puffiness under my tired eyes.</li>
            <li> The puffiness under my eyes dramatically decreased and my dark circles  seem to be fading a bit.</li>
            <li> My eyes appear to be much less wrinkled (which is tough for me to believe that a serum could do that - however it did.)</li>
            <li> Also, my eyes feel less tired.</li>
            <li> and I can see myself look less tired.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the product out and when it does come out it</li>
            <li> I feel as if it is overkill as it is too hard to separate application</li>
            <li> As always I spot tested to see if my sensitive skin would react badly</li>
            <li> I should have sent it back, but I was desperate for a serum.</li>
            <li> The product itself does just what it claims; improves the appearance and texture of that delicate under-eye skin.</li>
            <li> The serum is thick and also maintained hygenic in its&#x27; pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> The Revitalize Eye Serum leaves your skin feeling refreshed, hydrated, helps get rid of those nasty dark circles and it also really helps get rid of any puffiness you might have.</li>
            <li> Well, sadly this product doesn&#x27;t reduce dark circles under my eyes as it claims.</li>
            <li> I will continue to search for other products that will \\&quot;COVER\\&quot; my circles as I believe there are no products out on the market that truly reduce/diminish dark circles. :(</li>
            <li> I am always in desperate need for an eye serum that helps with puffiness and dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> i been using the eye serum to relieve my tired eyes</li>
            <li> Posting under my husband&#x27;s account so don&#x27;t be confused by the name Ethan.  </li>
            <li> I do not look as exhausted since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My need to use concealer has decreased.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong</li>
            <li> Like the face serum I use, this eye serum is a pumped gel that has a faint, non-offensive smell that disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump for the bottle can be weird at times..  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles were honest-to-God not affected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product</li>
            <li> I really hate the \\&quot;puffy\\</li>
            <li> The bottle works horribly.  </li>
            <li> but the bottle is awful</li>
            <li> it goes on well but takes time to dry...and the worst part is it peels of like peel off mask.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Saw a noticeable difference in my under eye area. Make sure you patch test, this does give off an uncomfortable burning sensation at first.</li>
            <li> I see a small difference, but I was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> Tthis stuff is the truth.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a trail tester, been using it for a month now and have noticed a little bit of improvement in the texture and color under my eyes. I&#x27;ve switched from using 1x a day to 2x to see results faster. It&#x27;s really easy to apply, 1 pump is enough for both eyes since it spreads so easily. It stings a little when going on at first, but you get used to it after about a week. Defensively have to stick to the routine if you want to see results, though. I was a but haphazard about applying it when I first got it, and I think that may have delayed the results a bit.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helped the bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Just ordered my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Priced well. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of this, but it works wonders for dark circles, and puffy eyes! I have a problem with puffy eyes, more so than dark circles. This has helped drastically reduce the puffiness to my eyes. I use this nightly, and wake up in the morning feeling refreshed.  It is not greasy, or heavy feeling on the skin too!  The smell does dissipate. Sample received for review.</li>
            <li> The product seems very nice.  Goes on smooth and dries quickly.  I have only been using it for a short period of time so I cannot attest to any benefits yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about 2 weeks now, I have noticed a huge improvement to my skin!&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, once in the morning and once at night. After I use an exfoliate. If you download the tips that Petunia emails you after purchasing It help alot. Its about 10 pages of really good information. The roller looks dangerous at first, and my boyfriend swears it hurts him , but it really doesn&#x27;t lol, its not painful at all. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my stretchmarks and I&#x27;m noticing a slight difference! Would post pictures of them but I would honestly rather die than have my stretchmarks on the internet ha!&lt;br /&gt;The products are of very good quality, I was very impressed with the packaging. Doesn&#x27;t even compare to what you would buy in the store.&lt;br /&gt;I love the eye serum, it may be my favorite. I work 2 jobs and dont get a lot of sleep and it helps with the puffiness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is really light, not sticky at all. You really only need a small amount so this bottle will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy! Will continue to use Petunia!!!</li>
            <li> I got this free to try from Tomoson, and i really like it! I also used this on my hand first, and it also has a weird smell, but the way it gets rid of dark circles is amazing! I really like this company.</li>
            <li> I used the Revitalize Eye Serum along with my Derma Roller and Hydrolic Serum. As I posted in my review with the Derma Roller All items worked very well with each other. I used the Derma Roller then applied the Eye Serum under my eyes and Hydrolic Serum on my face. I do see a difference on my complexion the last few weeks. I am seeing the benefits with small lines and crows feet. Petunia Skincare has my vote as a super skincare company that has the BEST NATURAL AND ORGANIC INGREDIENTS - 100% CRUELTY FREE! They use only vegan, and cruelty-free formulations containing natural/organic active ingredients. No parabens, no sulfates, no gluten, no alcohol, no phthalates, and absolutely no animal testing.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be okay, but it came opened.  The box was opened and the top of the container had been opened.  I should have sent it back, but I was desperate for a serum. I first tried some on my hands for a couple of days and then under my eyes and it seemed nice.  I wouldn&#x27;t order it this way again, though, because of it being opened.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare is not your average “skincare” company, they are committed to delivering the highest formulation standards, and prides themselves with the best skin care ingredients in the world, proven by scientific research and real life testing. Petunia Skincare works hard to live up to all of their claims and strive to over-deliver their consumers expectations. All of their products are produced in small batches to guarantee freshness and packaged under secure and sanitary conditions in a state of the art, FDA certified facility. All products are Made in the USA.  Petunia Skincare posts on their website that their products “yield results with no hype included”.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pretty excited when I was invited to work with Petunia Skincare on a Promotion to review not only their Anti-Aging Serum but also their Eye Serum and 540 needle Derma Roller! I’ve tried other creams, lotions and serums but this was my first time having the opportunity to test a Derma Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petunia Skincare Revitalize Eye Serum is a revolutionary eye serum that revitalizes and awakens tired eyes,  reduces dark circles, and helps diminish/fill in wrinkles and fine lines. Its made with  Sea Kelp, which acts as an excellent oil-free moisturizer. Hyaluronic Acid is world renowned for its capacity to retain moisture in the skin thus leaving the skin plumped and youthful This is not your ordinary eye-cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Sea Kelp Bioferment, Water, Sodium PCA, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Niacinamide, Alpha Bisabolol, Coconut Endosperm, Natural Active Peptides, Sodium Hyaluronate, Guaiazulene, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone, Caffeine, Grape Seed Proanthocyanidins, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide, Pomegranate Extract, Carnosine, Carnitine, Tetrahydrocurcuminoids, Natto Gum, Ferulic Acid, Lycopene, Glutathione, Glutaredoxin, Superoxide Dismutase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: Clean face. Follow your regular skincare regimen first. Apply a small amount and gently massage around the eye and eyelid area. Lastly, follow with moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye-Cream is less cream and more like a thick Serum. Much like Petunia Skin Care’s Anti-Aging Serum, their Eye Serum also has a thicker consistency similar to Aloe. You only need a small amount as a little goes a long way, it also absorbs quickly into the skin with no tacky residue. I did notice it made my eyelids tingle a little when applying, but it was not painful nor did it cause my eyes to water. The scent is light and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.e and eyelid area. Lastly, follow with moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eye-Cream is less cream and more like a thick Serum.

            <li> Noticed a difference after 3 days of use !  I have used many professional products...this visibly has tighten my eye area..will buy again !</li>
            <li> Working out great...definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I have had it and used it for a couple days. Haven&#x27;t seen a difference yet.</li>
            <li> Used for 1 week.  Its working to lighten circle and slight improvement to skin around eye.</li>
            <li> Excellent works as advertised</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks, I have not really seen a big result.  You only need a very small amount.  It goes on smooth and I feel it absorbing into my skin.  I&#x27;m not sure how long you need to us it to actually see the results.  I will keep using it.  My skin does feel a little dry after i put it on, I need to put my moisturizer on so that my skin is not pulling as much.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work for me. I used twice a day consistently for 1 month, morning and night and didn&#x27;t see a decrease in my puffiness or dark circles. I even took the advice of a few other reviewers and started keeping it in the fridge but no change. I guess the search for the perfect under eye cream continues..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  Waist of money. Just another scam product.</li>
            <li> It comes in a convenient dispenser bottle. Use two drops, apply to eyes (or face) and rub it in. It feels really tingly. IT was my first time using a product that had Sea Kelp in it, but I was impressed! I love the feel, the smell and the overall results that I experienced in one week. :)&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free, but my opinion is my own!</li>
            <li> I received a free product sample for review. I really like the other Petunia Skincare products I have used a lot, too. This one has not given me amazing results, but I have only used it a couple of weeks - so maybe with more use I will notice more improvement. I do like how quickly this serum absorbs into my skin. It moisturizes well and does not feel sticky. I&#x27;ll keep using it because I like the benefits it can potentially give me. Ingredients like Sea Kelp, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl, Vitamin C and Ferulic Acid help me fight all the things that bug me related to my eyes: dark circles, puffiness and fine lines. Edited to add: I have now been using the product a month and have noticed a decrease in puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than two weeks now and it seems to be really working. I have tried many expensive under eye creams but this one beats them all. I would recommend buying Petunia eye serum.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is a bit different formulation than other eye gels that I have also tried from other brands. All of those I have tried were clear type gels where this one is a yellow type liquid with a slight smell that smells a little like some other brands of Vitamin C serums. According to the instructions, this particular serum can be used alone or part of the 3 step skin care solution. In this case, I am trying this in conjunction with the part 2 of that solution, the separately sold Vitamin C serum. In order to test any skin reactions, since I have sensitive skin, I tried this out on my hand. First using the vitamin C serum and then applying the eye gel serum. This is liquid that spread well onto the skin but took a few seconds longer to absorb than I expected but wasn’t greasy or oily and once absorbed, my skin felt soft and tighter. Since I didn’t get any skin irritation from the two items, I have been trying around my eyes. The results are too early to tell as far as long term and in comparison to how much more effective this is than other brands. It seems to work so far but I am not one to expect it to make miracles happen and have realistic expectations from the product. I will update my review over time once I have a few weeks of use but so far this is doing what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what the hype is with this product. They must be have been given the product free or were paid to leave a review? It does nothing for the undereye, and dries in a gel layer and peels, so do not wear makeup over top.</li>
            <li> Great eye serum, depuffs as well.  I also use it on my cheeks for extra moisture boost.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have puffy eyes and have  tried everything.  This works best for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how good this eye serum made my eyes feel!  I am a constant sufferer of under eye circles and bags.  The unique formulation soothed all my eye problems and my eyes were noticeably less tired looking.  I would recommend this product.  I was given a free sample to try fo my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I have black circles under my eyes and once I&#x27;ve tried this I thought it wasn&#x27;t gonna work but I was wrong it does work. The dark circles are fading away which is a huge plus for me. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> Shipping on time. Good product.</li>
            <li> not as good as expected</li>
            <li> I have used the serum for just over a month now. I have very sensitive skin especially around my eyes. I have not had any problems with sensitivity from the serum. It is a good moisturizer. I haven&#x27;t seen miraculous results as far as wrinkles go. I am mid-30&#x27;s and luckily don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles yet though. The serum absorbs quickly and feels light.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much for my eyes honestly. I still had dark circles and wrinkles after using for 3 weeks and nothing changed from using this product.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent eye serum..I can notice the effects as soon as I apply it...really good stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This serum has botanical extracts and other ingredients such as hyaluronic acid that protect and plump the skin while promoting sloughing of older cells to give a fresh appearance and texture to delicate areas of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is moderately viscous and has a golden color from the fermented sea kelp.  It melts when applied to the skin for rapid absorption.  There is a very mild stinging effect from the exfoliating ingredients and when applying it under the eyes, care should be taken not to let it actually get into the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate effects are noticeable and regular use will reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and promote a healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is best applied to clean skin after washing or bathing.  I like to apply it after my evening shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is packaged in a nice glass bottle with a pump cap that dispenses just a drop and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petunia Skincare provided Revitalize Eye Serum for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work too well for wrinkles or dark circles.  More of an eye soother than a corrector of skin problems.</li>
            <li> From everyday stress on a job this eye serum sure comes in handy i been using the eye serum to relieve my tired eyes what this eye serum does it makes the skin of my eyes feel great and it also relieves the puffiness that i sometimes get from working long hours.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as a promotional offer, along with the hyaluronic serum. I have been using various drugstore products around my eyes but I think that this serum is better than any of them. Fine lines seem to be smoothing and a slightly saggy upper lid seems to be tightening a bit. I have only used it for two weeks and I really like it. As I wrote for the hyaluronic serum, &amp;#34;I was going to wait longer to review it, but yesterday my husband remarked that the new stuff I got for my face was really improving my skin. I asked him to elaborate and he said my skin looked fresher and brighter and that I looked more rested. I really like both of these products and will most likely reorder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Serum reduced wrinkles under eyes so not noticeable. However there was no noticeable effect on the dark circles.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is the most effective I have ever before used! The serum is thick and also maintained hygenic in its&#x27; pump dispenser. When you place it on your skin, it rapidly soaks up without greasy feel. Within just a couple of days, I viewed fine lines decrease as well as my eye areas was smooth as well as definitely, VERY youthful looking. I had no type of allergic reaction or inflammation whatsoever. My skin accepted it as soon as possible. I am additionally beginning to place it on my temple where I have some creases. I simply could not live without this Eye serum They are my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brand. No more squandering cash on the brand names marketed in the department stores that actually just don&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> I love that the two Petunia Skincare products I&#x27;ve tried, the hyaluronic acid serum and this eye serum, are so fast absorbing!  I have not used this long enough to verify that my dark circles have lightened (I have allergic shiners), but I can verify that all the other claims have worked for me - it reduces wrinkles around the eyes and softens the skin as a strong yet mild moisturizer.  (Right now, my dark under eyes&#x27; areas are lightened by the smoothness making a great base for my under eye makeup, so that is an improvement while I keep using it to see if the skin itself can lighten.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box and their website provide a comprehensive list of ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Kelp Bioferment&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Ferulic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin B3&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Endosperm&lt;br /&gt;Natural Active Peptides&lt;br /&gt;Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone&lt;br /&gt;Caffeine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of these ingredients are also in their hyaluronic acid serum formula that I use for my face.  The sea kelp adds anti-inflammatory action for the eyes.  Like the face serum I use, this eye serum is a pumped gel that has a faint, non-offensive smell that disappears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am extremely impressed by the two products I&#x27;ve tried from Petunia Skincare.  They have the fastest absorption rate of any serums I have tried and moisturize and smooth skin as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided]</li>
            <li> I am kind of obsessed with eye creams.  I try new ones all the time so I have a really good idea of what works and what doesn&#x27;t and I also have a few favorites.  One that has made it to my favorites list is the Revitalize Eye Serum that Petunia Skincare sent me to review for my blog, GlamRiver  The consistency of the serum is lightweight but a little goes a long way and once applied to the skin the serum just melts in and is easily absorbed.  The Revitalize Eye Serum leaves your skin feeling refreshed, hydrated, helps get rid of those nasty dark circles and it also really helps get rid of any puffiness you might have. (Tip: put in the refrigerator for an even more refreshed feeling!)</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, be careful with amour used, leaves a while flakey residue.</li>
            <li> The bottle works horribly.  Hard to get the product out and when it does come out it it goes in all different directions.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is ok but haven&#x27;t noticed any major difference.  The company told me they know about the bottle / dispenser problems and are changing it but that doesn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> Worked better for me than Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair, and far less expensive. I have sensitive eyes and have experienced eye irritation from other dark eye products. This did not irritate. It was gentel and silky going on and seems to lighten the shadows beneath and at the inner corners of my eyes. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have circles under my eyes and puffiness and I can already see a big difference in two weeks thank you so much I give it a ten plus for sure and the lines look better as well</li>
            <li> Have not seen any changes in my dark circles as of yet.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is loaded with the right ingredients to take away eye puffiness, dark circles and those tired eyes look. My wife is an accountant and she has some of these problems with her eyes. At certain times of the month, she is really straining her eyes. You can see the affect around her eyes. She used this eye serum and it takes away those aged eyes signs. The serum also makes the area around your eyes look and feel healthier. This eye serum is easy to use and absorbs right into your skin. The best part of it is it actually works.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on my skin but it&#x27;s to soon to tell how well it works.</li>
            <li> Posting under my husband&#x27;s account so don&#x27;t be confused by the name Ethan.  I&#x27;m actually a 29 year old female.  So here&#x27;s how I feel about this product.  This gets 5 stars for not testing on animals.  Many companies don&#x27;t seem to actually take steps away from that age old practice, so it&#x27;s a definite plus for these guys.  As for the actual product - I like it.  When you apply the serum, it feels tight and stings ever so slightly (not enough to annoy me and it goes away within seconds).  The only odd thing about this product is that I find it flakes and clumps a bit as it dries.  This doesn&#x27;t deter me from using it, as I actually do think it works.  I&#x27;m a week in and will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> Well, sadly this product doesn&#x27;t reduce dark circles under my eyes as it claims. It does, however, make my eye makeup stick better when I cover my circles with makeup. Also, my eyes feel less tired. So, that being said, the product did not live up to it&#x27;s claim. I will continue to search for other products that will \\&quot;COVER\\&quot; my circles as I believe there are no products out on the market that truly reduce/diminish dark circles. :( One final note: I have been using it everyday for about 3 weeks and will update my review if things change.</li>
            <li> Ever since we were young, my sister and I have always played around with skincare products.  It began when I was in middle school, my sister four years younger, when we would go into mom&#x27;s bathroom (of course, when she was busy elsewhere in the house) and pretend we were her, putting all kinds of goop on our faces.  Then, as we got older, we would go to different beauty and makeup stories to buy our own goops to try out.  Either because of good genes or the fact that we messed with all of this stuff when we were younger (or maybe both), my sister and I have always been told that we have good skin.  Now that I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;m afraid to stop playing with all of these skincare products (haha), that worry that women have about time catching up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of months ago, I received an email from a lady at Petunia Skincare asking if I would be interested in trying one of their products.  As I read that email, the old adage &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke&amp;#34; came into my mind - if all these years of trying new stuff has paid off so far, why change what I&#x27;m doing?  I emailed her back that I would be glad to try out her product and received it a couple of days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say that, in the last couple of months, I have become a huge fan of Petunia Skincare products.  A couple of things I like about the company as a whole is that you get a free e-book that talks to you about beauty regimens, I received a follow up email to give me some tips on using their product AND there is a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I received is the Professional Vitamin C Serum.  It sits on the counter in the bathroom and is used daily by my mother and myself.  It makes my skin soft, and gently takes off the outer layer of skin, giving my skin a nice fresh look.  I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.  I do wish that there was a different &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s a dropper, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face (I use a cotton ball).&lt;br /&gt;  My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I received a second set of emails, this time talking about the the Revitalize Eye Serum and the Professional Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Just like with the first product, these two products are used daily by myself and my mother (now she uses my stuff haha).  They quickly rushed the product out to me (one was actually delivered from the USPS on a Sunday) and within a few days I was noticing a big difference.  My usual concern (skin sensitivity) was quickly squashed because this stuff makes my face feel great, no allergic reactions of any kind.  When I don&#x27;t get enough sleep, I get the under eye issues that plague a lot of us and those were not only gone within two days of using this stuff, but continued use has caused them to not come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a product that I definitely recommend you give a try to - and remember what I said above, they are so sure that  you will love their product that they offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not happy.r, which makes a mess if you&#x27;re just putting it on your finger to spread on your face (I use a cotton ball).&lt;br /&gt;  My mom uses this in the morning before she puts on her makeup and feels it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, I received a second set of emails, this time talking about the the Revitalize Eye Serum and the Professional Hyaluronic Acid Serum.

            <li> I love the way it makes my eyes feel. It helps with my eye puffiness in the morning.</li>
            <li> Its been two weeks since I have tested this serum.  I have seen slight improvements in my dark circles under my eyes. The skin around my eye feel tighter and soft.The serum is concentrated and once you apply it absorbs quickly in to your skin.</li>
            <li> Ok, I really like this product, but it didn&#x27;t really take the puffiness away from my eyes.  I was so wishing that this product was my saving grace, but it really didn&#x27;t reduce that for me.  However, I can tell it is working and trying to make a difference, but just maybe my bags are just too big (smile).  Overall, if your eyes aren&#x27;t super puffy, I think you should try it.  Funny thing, I still will purchase another bottle because my husband loves it for his puffy eyes!</li>
            <li> I love this high quality eye serum. I put a litle on daily and my eyes look brighter and less tired, it works wonders for my dark circles. Now that I am 40, I am picky with what I use on my skin and especially around the sensitive areas like my eyes. This is gentle, and light, and works well.I love it.</li>
            <li> I was given this item for free if I wrote a review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for a week and I do notice that my fine lines have reduced in appearance. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my dark circles yet though. I did get a couple whiteheads in the eye area but it went away after a day.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of straight use couldn&#x27;t tell any minimal difference. I was expecting to see some change but nothing so I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks as a trial for the product. So far, the product has worked well! I get a slightly stinging sensation when I first apply the serum under my eyes, but it goes away and I can see myself look less tired. It has also helped diminish the appearance of my dark circles. The packaging is convenient, and the product contains a lot of useful ingredients. Overall, very pleased with this eye serum!</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with the Petunia facial serum (I also reviewed). Use it under eye area and around eyes. I don&#x27;t use it on browbone area (but that&#x27;s just me, perhaps). This is light, has a pleasant faint fragrance and is silky smooth. The ONLY thing I will note is that you have to be very careful not to dispense too much. It only takes a wee bit to do the job. I don&#x27;t know if the dispenser can be redesigned but that&#x27;s a thought. Not a problem--just a caution. The product itself does just what it claims; improves the appearance and texture of that delicate under-eye skin. I&#x27;m glad I tried both of these Petunia products. They deliver.</li>
            <li> seems to correct your fine lines</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in a couple of weeks. Maybe as I use it longer it will show results. The first day it burned a bit but day two and on it was much better. I am still using it and looking forward to positive results. I&#x27;m only giving a 3 because I haven&#x27;t used it that long.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work good but the bottle is awful - I&#x27;ve probably wasted half the product because when you push the dispenser down the product shoots across the room. The company realizes this bottle/dispenser is an issue and they are looking for a new bottle/dispenser distributor but in the meantime there is nothing that can be done so I have wasted so much product.  I have tried to push down slowly only to have the serum still fly across the room, hit my mirror, and even hit me in the eyes. It&#x27;s almost comical wondering where it&#x27;s going to fly every morning and night when I try to use it. I do think the product works because the skin under my eyes seem tighter when I use it and I like the feeling but again when you buy this you really only get half the product since the other half will fly elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I often work late into the night, and have to slip in sleep during the day in between kids, cleaning, cooking and fun. This can lead to seriously dark circles and puffiness under my tired eyes. I know it&#x27;s so important to take good care of the delicate eye area, which is often the first place to show signs of aging. That&#x27;s why I was excited to try this Revitalize Eye Serum from Petunia Skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is packed with a long list of all-natural ingredients to help nurture and pamper your skin. These include Sea Kelp Bioferment, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid, Vitamin B3, Coconut Endosperm, Natural Active Peptides, Hesperidin Methyl Chalcone and Caffeine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice, in a substantial-feeling glass jar. This is a true serum, not like a cream at all. It feels silky soft to the touch and soaks into the skin immediately. My skin drank it up and the softness was noticeable right away. After using it for about a week, I could definitely see a visible reduction in puffiness and dark circles. The overall health and smoothness of the skin around my eyes was improved. I think with longer use, it would help keep fine lines at bay.</li>
            <li> ****Disclaimer**** I received these products for free,for review purposes,all thoughts and or opinions are my own and I was not compensated.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the eye gel,i got nice results with it,but once again was not that crazy about the scent.I did notice reduction in the puffiness under my eyes as well as the dark circles under my eyes got less noticeable,that was a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite anti-aging eye product has been Caudalie&#x27;s eye cream which costs $99. Now this is a favorite of mine at half the cost to boot! When Petunia Skincare gave me this serum to review, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I have tried other eye creams before and the only one that ever made a difference was the Caudalie cream. This serum has rid me of puffiness and significantly reduced the dark circles under my eyes. Plus the tiny laugh lines I was developing are diminishing. So a big YES to slowing down the aging process, there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t had much luck with other eye products, I recommend giving this serum a try. I can&#x27;t attest to how well it does on deep wrinkles. It works well on developing fine lines, dark circles, and firming the skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and serums in the past. I always seem to be more drawn to serums than creams as I just fell in love with the consistency and texture that serums have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this eye serum has a really great consistency. It is thicker than a facial serum but it is still light enough to penetrate the skin quickly, get deep into pores, and absorbs within a matter of seconds after applying it. The color of this eye serum really stuck out to me as it is orange. I simply apply a few dabs of this serum underneath my eyes and around my eyelids, massage it in gently using upward circular motions, and within a few seconds the serum has completely absorbed into my skin. It does not leave behind any sticky or oily residues which makes this great to use both in the morning and night. If you want to apply makeup after using it, you will find no issues with doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, this serum is jam packed with amazing ingredients that are meant to tighten, tone, and fight against discoloration. I loved that Sea Kelp is a main ingredient of this. I have never used a product with Sea Kelp before but I have used seaweed products in the past and loved what they did for my skin. Sea kelp helps detoxify the skin, improves skin elasticity, and conditions the skin. I believe Sea Kelp is a very important ingredient as it will tighten the skin around the eye area, getting rid of puffiness and leaving behind smoother and more tightened skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have suffered off and on with dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. It is mainly my lack of sleep and I know it is. As a college student, I tend to have long nights of studying and doing homework and even when I&#x27;m not doing that, insomnia takes hold of me and I tend to go to bed at around 3-4 in the morning when I have to be up at 10. Obviously, I am not getting the sleep I need and it is reflecting on my skin. Ever since I started using this serum I have noticed my skin becoming more firm underneath my eyes as well as around my eyelids. I may still have some dark circles but they are beginning to fade away and I hope with continued use I will see even better results. I would highly recommend this eye serum to anyone suffering with puffiness and dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complementary in exchange for my unbiased review.rneath my eyes as well as around my eyelids.

            <li> I like the product. Usually with other eye products, they&#x27;re often pretty oily and too decadent for my eyes. But with this product, I like that when I apply the product, it feels hydrating and at the same time it&#x27;s not too overwhelming for my eyes. It also has this cooling feeling when I apply it on. I guess it feels a bit refreshing. I&#x27;ve applied it on my face on most days and night and it&#x27;s been a pleasant experience. When I&#x27;ve pumped more than I need for my eyes, I use the rest on my face and it&#x27;s also good to my face.</li>
            <li> I really see a difference in the texture of my eyelids. They had gotten very crepey. Now they are smoother. The improvement was gradual. But noticeable.</li>
            <li> I received this as a review and I liked the overall product!  It forces you to take 5 minutes for yourself if you buy the pokey thing with it and that&#x27;s a good thing!  I think the eye serum was really good as I have very pale, thin skin.  I don&#x27;t have dark circles but noticed my eyes weren&#x27;t as crows feet as normal.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is nice and thick, yet absorbs quickly into the skin. I have lots of issue with swollen, puffy eyes, so I will continue to use this to see if there is more noticeable improvement. I can see a bit of a difference in the appearance of my undereyes and am happy so far with the results. At this point, I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple of weeks, but I feel more time is needed to get a more accurate representation of what it can do. I could see  It does provide nice moisture for underneath my eyes, which is an area that I find is often very dry. Sample provided for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful customer service!!  Product has significantly improved dryness around my eyes!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me ...</li>
            <li> This product is literally an all in one product. It does it all. Moisturizers, helps diminish dark circles, reduces fine lines and wrinkles. I love this product. You can literally feel it working.</li>
            <li> The product is great!!! I use this daily and it IS making a difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> As a licensed esthetician, I have primarily been using professional products for the past several years however I have been pleasantly surprised by the Petunia Skin Care Products. This Eye Serum has plenty of great active ingredients without anything unnecessary. My eyes tend to be sensitive and I have had no problem with this one. The texture is light and absorbs in fairly fast. I still top it off with my long time Environ eye cream however because of it&#x27;s Vitamin A content since this eye gel doesn&#x27;t have any and it&#x27;s another super important ingredient for skin health!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find one thing to complain about with this eye serum.  It’s one of the best oil free moisturizers I’ve ever used. My dark circles have almost completely disappeared and I’m going to continue working on my fine lines and wrinkles because of the great results I’ve noticed so far.</li>
            <li> My eyes look tired a lot, sometimes due to not sleeping good, others just because! I&#x27;m really happy that I found this product because it works well!&lt;br /&gt;The texture is great because it absorbs so quick! There was no residue or waiting time to dry. It didn&#x27;t leave any greasy or stickiness either!</li>
            <li> not sure if I see much of a decrease in under eye shadow w/ use for 1 month, will continue as there is a small improvement</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3QY08K37FHOID]]</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s and have been on a relentless journey to find a good eye treatment for my fine lines, dark circles, and puffiness. I have been using this serum twice a day for the past 3 days and already noticed a big difference. The puffiness under my eyes dramatically decreased and my dark circles  seem to be fading a bit. The fine lines seem to still be there but hopefully with more usages it will fade. The serum itself is not sticky at all and absorbs really well. The oil seeds around my eyes from using heavy olay eye creams have started to fade as well! There is a slight tingly sensation when it is applied but only lasts for about 10 seconds. I gave my friend a few pumps of the serum to try out as well and she loved what it did for her dark circles overnight. We have very high hopes for this serum. If this serum does eventually fade wrinkles and fine lines, I&#x27;d totally stock up on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice little serum. It actually helped my eyes look less baggy and lighter. I used it at night and work up already seeing the improvement.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommendable. ..</li>
            <li> Like another product of theirs that I reviewed -- Meh. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 months ad have seen absolutely no difference. I wonder if there is enough actives in it to actually do anything.</li>
            <li> Still using this currently, I can feel it tightening up my eyes and wakes them up. Probably the caffeine inside doing most of that. The dark circles are just about gone and it has been not quite two months. I am in school and working two jobs right now so the puffy eyes are still present, cant say it has done much on that end. A little bit but nothing too noticeable IMO.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for few days now and can see a slight improvement on my skin texture around my baggy eyes. It is effective even for just few days of use. I can actually feel the coolness of the product when applied on my eye area. My eye area seems to be suddenly perky and also soft to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon to say about the lightening effect and when there&#x27;s a new development on my skin tone, I shall leave an update on this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how this product is gel-like but at the same time, it&#x27;s feels so light to the skin when applied. It doesn&#x27;t have a scent too which what I prefer on my beauty products. I like that it makes my eyes so refreshed too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----Update as of 31 Oct.-------&lt;br /&gt;I have changed the review rating from 4 starts to 5 stars because after more than a week of usage, I have already seen how my eye bags are not puffy anymore and the dark circles have actually lightened. And I still feel that cool, tingly feeling when it is being applied under my eye area. Yes, this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was using daily, but really didn&#x27;t notice the results like the other serum&#x27;s.  I feel as if it is overkill as it is too hard to separate application, may as well use a face serum.  I end up in need of more eye cream as it seems to dry the skin around my eyes.  Also, the container that it comes in, the spout dry&#x27;s up squirting out sideways wasting a lot of product.  I have gone through a full bottle of eye serum versus. 1/2 of the Anti Aging face serum.  So to me, it doesn&#x27;t pan out to go purchase a same size bottle of eye serum and still have plenty of face product left  I would think it would be the other way around.  I believe the container is wrong for the product, wasting it by dispensing too much at a time. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, I just don&#x27;t believe it is worth it.  Maybe if the container was different I would purchase again.  Still going to use the other serums though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT FOR MY EYES! IT&#x27;S ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS AGREES WITH MY SENSITIVE SKIN,AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in puffiness, lines or dark circles. It makes eye area very dry an  product crusts up. The dispenser spits it out halfway around bathroom. Do not buy this.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and package arrived no problems. I used this product religiously for about two months.  I applied the serum at last once if not twice a day,  and I didn&#x27;t see any improvement a in lightening my dark circles or the skin texture underneath my eyes. It did,  however,  moisturize the under eye arts,  but I think any moisturizer could do that.</li>
            <li> I tend to suffer from puffy under eyes as well as dark circles. So over the past few weeks I have been putting this to the test. Here are my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puffy Eyes- I have to say this works wonders for getting rid of my puffiness. The results I get from using this is almost spa like. I like to use this in the morning while I am doing my normal morning skincare routine. Plus it makes me feel more awake after I use this. I feel like I am ready to take on the day. It&#x27;s amazing how that puffy feeling can bring you down. So with this aspect I am very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Circles- As far as this goes, I have seen some minor changes with the dark circles under my eyes, however at this current moment I am still using this eye serum, so I cannot yet fully judge just what its end results will be. The fine lines around my eyes are improved when I use this, so I do have some high hopes for the dark circles becoming less visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this, and as I mentioned above I am still using this. So my full results aren&#x27;t in yet, but I would give this a recommendation. Just for the treatment of the puffy eyes alone it gets a 5 star rating from me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> This was for my mom.  She loves this product as it has reduced the puffy under eye look.  Product is applied morning and night.  No burning or irritation. Skin around the eye is soft and smooth.  Surely a WINNER!!!</li>
            <li> I am almost 30 and I do not have wrinkle or line under my eyes yet, I want to keep it that way. I have a light dark circle tough which I am trying to get rid of. The serum is working its way to help me with that. I like the pump style of the bottle (generally all the serums I have used before came in dropper fitted bottles); the pump makes it easier to use.&lt;br /&gt;Working for long hours in front of the computer tends to tire our my eyes, but the serum helped me out with that too as soon as I applied the serum my eyes felt fresh and the tiredness seemed to go away at once The formula of the serum is not at all sticky; it absorbs really fast. And believe me a little goes a long way, one drop is sufficient to cover both eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;I am keeping my hopes high that I won’t be getting any wrinkles around my eyes if I keep using the serum, but for the price of $26.77 for only 0.51 fl.oz. the serum just may not fit into my budget to keep using it again and again which is my reason to give it a 4 star rather than a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for free but the opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with the derma roller. I place a squirt on each corners of eyes to help with &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; and another one under each eye to help with maybe dark circles or to reduce puffiness. I like how easy it is to apply and of silky and smooth it is. It blends in nicely and really works great to help in these issues. I have been using maybe 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I received product free to review but this is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older my eyes have become more hooded to the point where my lower eyelid is barely visible. This product does a good job of lifting the upper lid. I dab it on it after washing my face, allowing it to dry, and then apply my eyeshadow. It really seems to tighten and firm the skin and feels cool and refreshing. It only takes a TINY amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> I received a free example of this eye gel from Petunia Skin care for a sincere review. This eye serum has satisfied all my expectations. It is not visiting make my &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; eyes appear like they did years ago: but, it has most definitely assisted my eyes. I do not look as exhausted since I started using it. My eyes appear to be much less wrinkled (which is tough for me to believe that a serum could do that - however it did.) My makeup does not crease under my eyes now. That alone is worth using this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Okay first of all,  I am a guy.  A college student at it too.  Due to heavy studying and late night events,  I have seen puffiness and dark circles developed like crazy under my eyes.  I then search around and found this product.  And well.  It worked.  The puffiness is reduced less prominent.  And I have a tendency to forget to use it sometimes too.  I have a few complain though...  The pump for the bottle can be weird at times..  You can squeeze and nothing comes out or it will squirt  out and misses your index finger.  So just be careful of that.  Other than then it is quite good.</li>
            <li> Oh my lord - something finally that removes the puffiness under my eyes! Finally - I have been feeling like the years are catching up to me... but this really helps. The serum really soothed my under eye area and I definitely saw a difference in the amount of puffiness. It didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my dark circles, but just for getting rid of the puffiness, I&#x27;m thrilled to have received this product for review!</li>
            <li> What I like about this eye serum is there&#x27;s no scent, the pump applicator dispenses just the right amount, so no wasting the product when too much squirts out, it absorbs pretty much on contact, and you really can feel your eye area tighten up immediately. I&#x27;ve never used (or noticed) other eye serums I&#x27;ve used contained caffeine....but after a couple weeks of use, my eye area is tighter, but not in a dry way - the area itself is very hydrated &amp; dewy. I received this item at no cost in order to facilitate an honest review...and this eye serum is honestly very very good.  Like their Hyaluronic Acid Serum, which I&#x27;ve also used, it is 100% cruelty-free which is important to me. The only thing to note is my bottle was different than shown in the photos - but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I am always in desperate need for an eye serum that helps with puffiness and dark circles around my eyes. This stuff is great it is all natural and packed full of all natural and organic materials. This will firm up your skin and fix any fine lines and wrinkles that you may have. It helps to control the puffiness in your eyes and dark circles that you may have. It is really light and not to heavy on your face. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product......wonderful experience dealing with merchant!  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> i could not wait to use this product and was not disappointed. it felt fabulous around my eyes and made the skin so soft. all i need from petunia is there own natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product long enough to give you a truthful review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No changes have been observed yet. Perhaps allowing a little time to pass before multiple efforts of requesting a review may be wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have not yet used it for weeks and weeks, yet I can say: in the short time I have used this product, I have noticed an improvement with my eyes.  My need to use concealer has decreased.  Especially on days that I have slept well, concealer is not needed at all.  Use and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I actually see no improvement at all.  although i have been using the serum for weeks, i still have the same puffiness and dark circles. i had wanted to return it for a refund but have been very busy and just haven&#x27;t had the time.  i will not be ordering again</li>
            <li> Good eye serum - I like the way my eyes feel and a little goes along way - my only issue is that more then I want to use comes out with a squirt - I use the extra on my forehead and neck - Cool smooth feeling and I have been without adequate sleep and yet I look like I have been sleeping all night long.</li>
            <li> Goes on well and moisturizes. But little effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Petunia Skincare is one of the brands that has never let me down so far. I love their products, as they have truly worked for me. I like this serum because it works great for sensitive skin and delivers the results that it promises. I like the fact that it is in serum form because my skin absorbs it faster and it has no sticky residue. This is a brand/product that is truly worth checking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> This has turned out to be a great way to test out DNA-repairing skincare. Recently I read about studies showing the benefit of Niacinamide (Vitamin B3) combined with Sea Kelp to reverse and prevent sun damage on a DNA level. I immediately put a few of the recommended skincare products on my to get list only to find all of them loaded with either perabenes or dimethicone. Thankfully Petunia Skincare created this serum geared for the eyes which, to my surprise, combines the Niacinamide and Sea Kelp for cell regenerationI was looking for. What&#x27;s missing is the perabenes and dimethicone. What else I found interesting is the most beneficial ingredients present, the Niacinamide and Sea Kelp bioferment, are of much higher quantities than any of the other much pricier DNA labeled products I investigated. It probably goes without saying that I started using this all over my face, not just under my eyes.    As for under the eyes, the most noticeable difference this gel made for me is de-puffing.  Immediately it gets rid of any puffiness, feels cooling and never stings. It also has a light green tinge to it which could cancel out some discoloration. It&#x27;s never caused milia bumps either and actually feels moisturizing. They&#x27;ve really packed this serum with dark circle fighting ingredients so I hope with continued use to see some improvement.    I will say that even if I saw zero change to my skin I would continue to use Niacinamide and Sea Kelp for its possible skin cancer prevention qualities alone.  Petunia Skincare provided a free sample for review.</li>
            <li> This product is A definite winner in my book. I really hate the \\&quot;puffy\\&quot; look and this as been something that has been able to reduce the puffiness around my eyes even during tax season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free to facilitate my review.  You can read more about my thoughts on this product on my blog post http://katsdailyinspiration.blogspot.com/2015/02/petunia-skincare-10mm-derma-roller-eye.html</li>
            <li> i got it today couldn&#x27;t wait to try...but it is not worth the hype...it goes on well but takes time to dry...and the worst part is it peels of like peel off mask.</li>
            <li> So I’m going to be honest here. When I received this package for review from Petunia Skincare I was stoked about the serums, but when I saw the derma-roller I was like, “What sorta medieval torture device is this?!”The serums worked great! As always I spot tested to see if my sensitive skin would react badly and it didn’t *phew!* So I alternated use of the serums and my skin took on a pretty glow after a couple days. My wrinkles were honest-to-God not affected. They are still there smiling at me &#x3D;) Now this derma-roller I did not attempt to use. I was far too intimidated by the needles. That said, I would go to a licensed esthetician or acupunturist and let them do it! The box has warnings about cleaning the needles thoroughly to avoid infection. Yeah, I was like, “All right… hell no I’m not using this thing.” But I was curious…here is a podcast by thebeautybrains.org discussing whether dermal rolling actually works. The question and answer begins at the 6:20 mark. The cons of derma-rolling at home start at 15:48 . The professional actually says,”If you’re not bleeding, it’s not working.” (18:18) I will let the professionals take it away and you can decide for yourself ; )</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t see result. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Use sparingly, but it is effective.  I am over 60 and have a problem with puffiness under the eyes.  This seems to help, when applied correctly.</li>
            <li> Love this product but don&#x27;t use too much or it will peal off. Have been using for about 2 weeks and can notice a decrease in the bags and circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li> While this product may work well for dark circles-- which is not my issue,  it really didn&#x27;t do anything for the bags under my eyes. Perhaps &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; are puffiness to the extreme. I&#x27;m sure all of the ingredients are good for my skin but I didn&#x27;t see any remarkable results. Or even unremarkable results, regrettably. According to the directions for use you can use it under your moisturizer, but the serum dried making my under eye area slightly sticky, no matter how little I used. Anything I applied afterwards would not absorb evenly. I&#x27;m still looking for a product to reduce my extreme under eye puffiness, aka bags... this is not it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past two weeks. So far so good. I cannot determine if it is really good unless I have used it for at least two months. I will update my review after two months.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this now for almost three weeks and i&#x27;m very happy with it.  it goes on smoothly and i already notice more firmness.  the pump tends to dispense more than i need for my eyes so i use the excess around my lip area.  good product!</li>
            <li> I am not sure of I am seeing any benefit. I have to be sure to use  very small amount of it, otherwise it dries into an unattractive flaky consistency. The texture is nice and I suppose that with more prolonged use I might see something.  I have been using it for two months so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on a product sample from the vendor.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it feels ok on, and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird residue. That being said, it doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve used it for two weeks, morning and night, as the directions say and have seen no results. No lines diminished, no dark circles made lighter, nothing. I&#x27;ve also been getting 7-8 hours sleep, as I usually do, and getting exercise. I don&#x27;t think anything I&#x27;ve done would counteract it, I just don&#x27;t think it works. Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> The package arrived as promised. I purchased the product for puffiness under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve used the product for a month now and far as I can tell, it hasn&#x27;t helped at all.  That being said, I have tried other products and they didn&#x27;t work either. I believe surgery or some new procedure will be the only way to alleviate my problem.&lt;br /&gt;The Eye Serum may be good for dark circles however, I don&#x27;t have that problem so I can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> Your skin around your eyes is delicate, making the skin around the eyes the most thinnest areas than the rest of the face, as we age it only gets thinner. The actives in the eye serum will prevent further thinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum feel very smooth going on not the oily feeling we get sometimes. The product has a truly weightless feeling and it only takes a small amount twice a day. . It does what it says it does and I don’t have to search for the perfect eye serum any longer. One less thing. It is simple to use apply it and go about your day, then apply again at night and your done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30 year old male and have a pretty active lifestyle which often means that I am sleeping less than I should and am not taking much care of my skin. Net result - dark circles started getting more prominent, puffy eyes. I was too lazy to do anything about it and landed on this product by chance. And I absolutely like this product. here are the things I know in the past 5 weeks of usage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It dries pretty fast and does not leave any after marks. I use it in the morning and night&lt;br /&gt;2. It has a slight tingly sensation (you&#x27;re applying it on/close to your eyes). But I actually like it. somehow think it makes me feel more active. never has caused my eye to water (not even for a couple of minutes straight). No red eyes either.&lt;br /&gt;3. Definitely has reduced dark circles - now the only portion they are prominent are near the socket of my eye and nose.&lt;br /&gt;4. eye puffiness has reduced.&lt;br /&gt;5. I am not so sure about wrinkles etc. I do have some but they never were a concern. I did check to see if this product helped but I honestly don&#x27;t know if it has worked or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend and would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about 3 weeks... That being said, I&#x27;ve had several people comment about how youthful I appear. What woman doesn&#x27;t love to hear that! There is less puffiness under my eyes and I&#x27;m using not wearing concealer every day. That is a win for me! I bought this product not expecting much and I pleasantly surprised that it has exceeded my expectations and in a short period of time. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens a month from now.</li>
            <li> I love this. This is the best product I&#x27;ve tried for reducing my eye puffiness and making my eyes brighter, they look so much more awake. I have school during the day and work that doesn&#x27;t get me home until after 4 AM some days so it really helps me look more awake than I feel. I love feeling it tighten the skin and I think it does a great job. I just use this in the mornings instead of at night as well, so my guess is they would look even better if I used it day and night. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;For disclosure purposes I was given this product free to try, but this is my honest opinion, it really does work.</li>
            <li> (FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a free product to review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this twice a day every day until the bottle was empty (which took about 6 weeks); didn&#x27;t make one bit of difference in my dark circles, puffiness, or fine lines, and if I put any kind of makeup over it, the makeup would discolor or just slide right off.</li>
            <li> I have to say that before I started doing reviews I did not know that sea kelp or seaweed or dead sea salts were great for skincare.  This is the first product I have tried that contained sea kelp, and I trust it completely because I have tried several other Petunia products and have loved them all.  With our crazy lifestyles today, I think everyone can relate to having early signs of aging and bags under the eyes.  I know I can and I am only 38 years old.  So we have to be proactive and take care of our skin early in our lives.  And there are so many ingredients that are used in serums, it is hard to choose.  This one particular product has so many of these ingredients all in one little bottle!  With a combination of Sea Kelp, Sodium PCA, Vitamin C, Matrixyl 3000, Hyaluronic Acid, Pomegranate Extract and more you know you are getting the best care for your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is .51 fl oz and comes with a pump on top so you can get just a few drops which is all it takes to work.  Rub it under your eyes and in a few days see the difference.  This product is all natural, organic and is NOT tested on animals.  It also comes with a 100% money-back guarantee so give it a try - I don&#x27;t think you will be sending it back!  Petunia products do not have parabens, gluten or alcohol in them and they are made in the USA.  Check out their website for more skincare products and I am sure you will be happy with all of them.  I received a complimentary product to test :)</li>
            <li> Having tried many eye creams in the past, I have seen it all. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the Revitalize Eye Serum. However, the first time I put it on I significantly noticed my skin around my eyes had that more awake look, and the complexion looked better. I am a big fan of eye serum&#x27;s that have caffeine in it like this one. It is a great serum to use in the morning to give you that, &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been awake for more than 10 minutes I SWEAR look.&amp;#34; For those who don&#x27;t know what I mean, is it takes care of the puffiness, while giving you more of an awake look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a really good job at not only making you appear more awake, but also absorbs fast. I was impressed at how little you have to use, and how quickly it dried. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling either like some gels, nor does it have a smell. It simply sticks to the task, which is fixing the problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have had a complete improvement with it taking care of puffiness and my complexion almost instantly, I haven&#x27;t noticed much with it doing anything for my fine lines. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and a half now, so I am hoping with time I will have even better results. While I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s the best product for aging lines thus far, I do however feel it is an amazing product for dark circles as well as putting moisture into the skin and worth giving a try.</li>
            <li> I love this so much! My eyes seriously look so much better after using this every day! My favorite use is before makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great to use it with a dermaroller. Your eyes will feel fantastic, it helps get rid of those dark undereye circles, the puffy bags, and all of the other icky things you don&#x27;t want anyone to see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it feels. I received this for free to try from Tomoson and Petunia Skincare.</li>
            <li> I started seeing results in two days. I am impressed!  I already bought the other products for the face.  Hopefully they work as good as this.</li>
            <li> I love this products.  I use in the morning and in the evening before my moisturizer. It took 2 weeks to see results so give it some time and you will be just as happy!!</li>
