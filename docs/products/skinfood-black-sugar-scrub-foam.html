            <li>This is a great exfoliator</li>
            <li>But it does a great job as a weekly or twice weekly scrub.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it&#x27;s still a really great product.</li>

            <li>I recommend this solely because it smells so good.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels so good on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many reviews that it smells incredible, but I honestly feel like it smells like my wood cleaner detergent.</li>

            <li>Ooooohhh I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this!</li>
            <li>Excellent product, thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>At this point rinse with warm water, and follow up with whatever your moisturizing routine may be.</li>
            <li>great love it the smell and the smooth feel after using it</li>
            <li>Smells very strongly of lemon, in a cleaning product sort of way, so I can&#x27;t imagine using it on my face.  </li>
            <li>like it very fit for men</li>
            <li>It smells SO Good and delivers a mild cleansing when used with an oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>I find that it is a perfect balance between being gritty and exfoliating, but also cleansing and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It is a keeper:)</li>
            <li>I love this scrub...</li>
            <li>I love it, just as described.</li>
            <li>I love it, and use it twice a week.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use it any more often than that</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin or non-sensitive skin, you might be able to do every day.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>I love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll not need any kind of toner after using this scrub, because your skin is clean, exfoliated, toned and so,</li>
            <li>in love such a nice uplifting scent !!</li>
            <li>love skin food products and this is a great scrub because its not too abrasive and is good for a weekly use or maybe every other day depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and cleared my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Wonderful results...just as expected.  </li>
            <li>and I really have loved all my Skinfood purchases.</li>
            <li>Love it so much, couldn&#x27;t recommend it more!</li>
            <li>Liked the product very much.</li>
            <li>The sweet smell is just heavenly and makes using this sugar scrub incredibly enjoyable.</li>
            <li>but it was actually mildly moisturizing!</li>
            <li>At this point you can really sense the sugar element of the scrub, because the scent is so warm, and the foam is silky and indulgent on the skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and fell in love with it right away.</li>
            <li>I usually dislike anything that is oily, but this has the perfect amount, where the oil seems to help soften your skin, instead of making you feel like a greaseball.  </li>
            <li>, I forget it&#x27;s a cleanser, although it does clean thoroughly without drying my skin.  </li>
            <li>The reviews were right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Korean skin care products in general, but this may be the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a sweet.</li>
            <li>I use this scrub around three to five times in about a ten day period, and it always makes me feel so good.</li>
            <li>I use this scrub around three to five times in about a ten day period, and it always makes me feel so good.</li>
            <li>I personally can&#x27;t rave enough about the scent because to me it&#x27;s the best thing I smell in the morning.</li>
            <li>the sugar melts quickly so it needs to be used quickly as you put it on your hands and massage into your face.</li>
            <li>my favorite scrub so far!!</li>
            <li>The sugar really does dissolve once it&#x27;s been rubbed on your face, and it tastes sweet (which to me means that it does in fact likely have sugar, and likely a lot of glycerin which is incredibly moisturizing and healthy for your skin).  </li>
            <li>Love it makes your skin very soft</li>
            <li>Secondly because it actually works incredibly well.</li>
            <li>the beads dissolve quickly so it feels very gentle and</li>
            <li>Anyways, contrary to the name, this scrub is not black but more the colour of brown sugar.</li>
            <li>My skin has been actually feeling more light and bright after scrubbing off some of my dead skin with this scrub foam.</li>
            <li>A great skin cleanser and not at all irritating to sensitive skin --- I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good product at a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I need something else, very gentle, in between.</li>
            <li>am pretty darn use</li>
            <li>You can even use it as a lip scrub, it is that gentle!</li>
            <li>You can even use it as a lip scrub, it is that gentle!</li>
            <li>first of all, it smells like furniture polish.  </li>
            <li>Any scrub-like product needed to exfoliate without sandpapering my skin, and this product really interested me because it also foams, it has a very fine consistency, and yes -- it smells good, and I&#x27;m obsessed with products that smell good!&lt;br</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and the grain is very fine with a warm sugar/citrus sort of scent.</li>
            <li>This is remarkable: when you put the scrub on your fingers and then put on your face while massaging, the sugar scrubs for 15 or so seconds before slowly dissolving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use other Skinfood products as well, and the Skinfood Black Sugar Scrub Foam was a great introduction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>nice and soft (if you have dry skin like me you would still need to moisturize afterwards)</li>
            <li>I bought this scrub to help prevent acne blemishes, but it really does nothing for acne - prone skin.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t want to add too much water</li>
            <li>The importance of this is that it makes it MUCH easier to wash off when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, but granular, so you can feel that it is really working.  </li>
            <li>It is also a bit oily, which keeps it gentle.  </li>
            <li>This gives my skin such a clean feeling after it is rinsed off.</li>
            <li>(the only time I got it near my eyes, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant and I am always careful now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and it gets the job done as a mild morning cleanser for a fair price, which is why I still gave it three stars... but an exfoliant that doesn&#x27;t exfoliate is pretty useless, whether or not it smells like a household cleaning product.  </li>
            <li>But with some searching I was able to come up with a list of ingredients in the Black Sugar Scrub and everything looked kosher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially I was hesitant to buy a &#x27;Korean&#x27; product because over-sea regulation of what is safe to put in body products is handled  differently than the United States.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product to clean your face after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;This is it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this in Seoul, where I spent days looking for a Skin Food store</li>
            <li>Good packaging, thick content,can last forever, effect is as described.</li>
            <li>no where near where I was located, but eventually I found a Skin Food!</li>
            <li>It also seems to clear up my acne-scarred skin very well and eliminates my extra step of using an exfoliant in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Shipping was also reasonable and much faster than I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li>No little beads getting stuck on your nose or in your washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li>The black sugar dissolves rather quickly</li>
            <li>something gentle but cleansing that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin, or irritate it.</li>
            <li>I definitely get it at least one more time and/or recommend it for my friends.</li>
            <li>Initially when I first used this product, I thought that it was going to dry the heck out of my skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin with large pores, and because it is so terribly pale</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty standard slightly foaming sugar scrub with large-ish granules.  </li>
            <li>an effectiveness standpoint, it&#x27;s probably a little too strong for everyday use for me.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t press down, simple use circular motions all over my face, avoiding my eye area</li>
            <li> slightly floral with a big zesty smell of lemon...but not in a disinfectant kinda way...rather a sweetened hand cream kinda lemon.</li>
            <li> The Black Sugar does the same job exfoliating, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling scratched.  </li>
            <li> To properly cleanse the skin, use this product after the use of Skinfood Black Sugar Cleansing Oil.</li>
            <li> but I was surprised that my black sugar scrub wasn&#x27;t black!</li>
            <li> The only reason I took off a star is because it smells a little too much like industrial cleansers, and the thickness of the scrub can make it a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> I chose this because I wanted an exfoliater that wasn&#x27;t too rough but would help with some of the scarring I have on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> A number of them were either closed or</li>
            <li> it isnt irritating and you can feel very refreshed and smoother after using it</li>
            <li> Instead its a soft honey color, and comes out nicely thick.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something else, but I got this instead, because I don&#x27;t remember the other product&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day, using one of the Face Shop&#x27;s rice water cleansers on the other days.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I pat it almost dry, then squeeze out a little less than a dime size amount of product, and using the edges of fingertips I rub it into my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this whenever my skin feels particularly dull, though I try to use it a couple times spread out during the week in the mornings for a wake up boost and to exfoliate all the last nights</li>
            <li> I definitely have noticed that my skin looks brighter since I&#x27;ve started using it, and I like that the sugar isn&#x27;t too hard on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t burn like a salt scrub might.</li>
            <li> I like a scrub, but I&#x27;ve found some some actually tear the delicate skin-surface.</li>
            <li> Makes my face so luminous and removes all the gunk from my pores and also dead skin.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a BAD product, but it didn&#x27;t really do it for me...</li>
            <li> The little scrubs aren&#x27;t that brutal on the skin and the foam feels really soft after!</li>
            <li> crap off of my face.</li>
            <li> has Methyl paraben, which is a nasty preservative</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this scrub to help prevent acne blemishes, but it really does nothing for acne - prone skin. I&#x27;ve read so many reviews that it smells incredible, but I honestly feel like it smells like my wood cleaner detergent. Will not buy again. Just my two cents.</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne prone skin. I chose this because I wanted an exfoliater that wasn&#x27;t too rough but would help with some of the scarring I have on my cheeks. It feels nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I follow this with a manuka honey mask to bring back all that moisture and follow it with the rest of my skincare routine. I will be trying the black sugar mask soon to see how that goes, but I&#x27;m looking this so far. Great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great! I&#x27;m a big fan of Korean skin care products in general, but this may be the best I&#x27;ve ever found.  I use it almost every day in the shower.  I find that it is a perfect balance between being gritty and exfoliating, but also cleansing and moisturizing.  The sugar really does dissolve once it&#x27;s been rubbed on your face, and it tastes sweet (which to me means that it does in fact likely have sugar, and likely a lot of glycerin which is incredibly moisturizing and healthy for your skin).  I will be using this for as long as I can get it! Love it so much, couldn&#x27;t recommend it more!</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, works.  Makes my face so luminous and removes all the gunk from my pores and also dead skin.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week. My skin feels good after washing. It is a keeper:)</li>
            <li> Smells very strongly of lemon, in a cleaning product sort of way, so I can&#x27;t imagine using it on my face.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a pretty standard slightly foaming sugar scrub with large-ish granules.  I&#x27;m using it up to remove waterproof sunscreen from my neck and shoulders but I won&#x27;t be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliator and I really have loved all my Skinfood purchases. This product makes my skin feel soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> Initially when I first used this product, I thought that it was going to dry the heck out of my skin but it was actually mildly moisturizing! The black sugar dissolves rather quickly so you don&#x27;t want to add too much water but you will need water to get it to lather. I personally can&#x27;t rave enough about the scent because to me it&#x27;s the best thing I smell in the morning. It&#x27;s like a sweet. slightly floral with a big zesty smell of lemon...but not in a disinfectant kinda way...rather a sweetened hand cream kinda lemon. It also seems to clear up my acne-scarred skin very well and eliminates my extra step of using an exfoliant in the mornings. I&#x27;m in love!!!</li>
            <li> like it very fit for men</li>
            <li> Initially I was hesitant to buy a &#x27;Korean&#x27; product because over-sea regulation of what is safe to put in body products is handled  differently than the United States. But with some searching I was able to come up with a list of ingredients in the Black Sugar Scrub and everything looked kosher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a daily use scrub, something gentle but cleansing that wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin, or irritate it. I have sensitive, combination skin with large pores, and because it is so terribly pale any sort of irritation redness or dryness is immediately visible. Any scrub-like product needed to exfoliate without sandpapering my skin, and this product really interested me because it also foams, it has a very fine consistency, and yes -- it smells good, and I&#x27;m obsessed with products that smell good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe you thought this too -- but I was surprised that my black sugar scrub wasn&#x27;t black! Instead its a soft honey color, and comes out nicely thick. A little goes a long way, and the grain is very fine with a warm sugar/citrus sort of scent. After washing my face, I pat it almost dry, then squeeze out a little less than a dime size amount of product, and using the edges of fingertips I rub it into my skin. I don&#x27;t press down, simple use circular motions all over my face, avoiding my eye area (the only time I got it near my eyes, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant and I am always careful now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I have spread the scrub evenly over my face and chin and even my neck, I splash a small amount of water on my face and rub all over, activating the foaming action. At this point you can really sense the sugar element of the scrub, because the scent is so warm, and the foam is silky and indulgent on the skin. At this point rinse with warm water, and follow up with whatever your moisturizing routine may be. You&#x27;ll not need any kind of toner after using this scrub, because your skin is clean, exfoliated, toned and so, so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty darn use I&#x27;ll purchase this product again. I use this scrub around three to five times in about a ten day period, and it always makes me feel so good. You can even use it as a lip scrub, it is that gentle! I&#x27;m excited to use other Skinfood products as well, and the Skinfood Black Sugar Scrub Foam was a great introduction!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-JR-is product again.

            <li> I love this scrub...the beads dissolve quickly so it feels very gentle and the lemony scent is addictive.</li>
            <li> has Methyl paraben, which is a nasty preservative</li>
            <li> AMAZING product! Goes on like a scrub and smoothes as you use it. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this in Seoul, where I spent days looking for a Skin Food store just so I could buy &amp; try this product that I had read tons of reviews where people raved about it. A number of them were either closed or no where near where I was located, but eventually I found a Skin Food! I purchased this and fell in love with it right away. The sweet smell is just heavenly and makes using this sugar scrub incredibly enjoyable. You almost want to eat it because it smells so delicious. Don&#x27;t do that though. Anyways, contrary to the name, this scrub is not black but more the colour of brown sugar. It works incredibly well to help exfoliate your skin, in addition to cleansing and making your face feel refreshed! I use this whenever my skin feels particularly dull, though I try to use it a couple times spread out during the week in the mornings for a wake up boost and to exfoliate all the last nights crap off of my face. Sure makes you feel refreshed! I recommend this solely because it smells so good. Secondly because it actually works incredibly well.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels so good on my face, I forget it&#x27;s a cleanser, although it does clean thoroughly without drying my skin.  I like a scrub, but I&#x27;ve found some some actually tear the delicate skin-surface. The Black Sugar does the same job exfoliating, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling scratched.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s, with skin that tends toward oily, and this product seems to work well with both issues!</li>
            <li> I love it, just as described.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a BAD product, but it didn&#x27;t really do it for me... first of all, it smells like furniture polish.  You know, the fake-ish lemon scent... it&#x27;s like washing your face with Pledge.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate.  At all.  The sugar grains dissolve immediately in the water when you start rubbing it on your face, so it doesn&#x27;t even have a chance to take anything off.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin and it gets the job done as a mild morning cleanser for a fair price, which is why I still gave it three stars... but an exfoliant that doesn&#x27;t exfoliate is pretty useless, whether or not it smells like a household cleaning product.  I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very good for my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and cleared my skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> My son brought this home from Korea for me to try.  I love it, and use it twice a week. I don&#x27;t need to use it any more often than that so it lasts quite a long time.  It does a marvelous job exfoliating and softening skin. Very happy with product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it. It scrubs so nicely!</li>
            <li> This is remarkable: when you put the scrub on your fingers and then put on your face while massaging, the sugar scrubs for 15 or so seconds before slowly dissolving. That creates a foam lather that you can continue to massage into your face if you&#x27;d like.  The importance of this is that it makes it MUCH easier to wash off when you&#x27;re done. No little beads getting stuck on your nose or in your washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;From an effectiveness standpoint, it&#x27;s probably a little too strong for everyday use for me. I have dry/combination skin that&#x27;s sometimes sensitive, and it leaves me looking a little red if I use it several days in a row. But it does a great job as a weekly or twice weekly scrub. I need something else, very gentle, in between. If you have oily skin or non-sensitive skin, you might be able to do every day. Regardless, it&#x27;s still a really great product.</li>
            <li> Another great product by SkinFood!</li>
            <li> Ooooohhh I love it! The reviews were right! The little scrubs aren&#x27;t that brutal on the skin and the foam feels really soft after! I love the smell too. My skin has been actually feeling more light and bright after scrubbing off some of my dead skin with this scrub foam. Definitely will buy it again! I guarantee this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this! the sugar melts quickly so it needs to be used quickly as you put it on your hands and massage into your face. This gives my skin such a clean feeling after it is rinsed off.</li>
            <li> love skin food products and this is a great scrub because its not too abrasive and is good for a weekly use or maybe every other day depending on your skin type. it isnt irritating and you can feel very refreshed and smoother after using it</li>
            <li> my favorite scrub so far!! in love such a nice uplifting scent !! leaves face nice and soft (if you have dry skin like me you would still need to moisturize afterwards)</li>
            <li> I was looking for something else, but I got this instead, because I don&#x27;t remember the other product&#x27;s name. I like this as well.</li>
            <li> Love it makes your skin very soft</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product to clean your face after a long day.&lt;br /&gt;This is it!&lt;br /&gt;It is foamy and cleans the make-up and dirts and oil on the face.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it 2 or 3 times a week though.&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Liked the product very much. I have combination skin and regularly use makeup, the product worked out quite well for me. Good packaging, thick content,can last forever, effect is as described. I can feel the cleanness of my skin. I definitely get it at least one more time and/or recommend it for my friends.</li>
            <li> I love Skin Food and all these products, and this Amazon store is great for selling them here!  I love this scrub.  It is gentle, but granular, so you can feel that it is really working.  It is also a bit oily, which keeps it gentle.  I usually dislike anything that is oily, but this has the perfect amount, where the oil seems to help soften your skin, instead of making you feel like a greaseball.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful results...just as expected.  A great skin cleanser and not at all irritating to sensitive skin --- I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good product at a reasonable cost.  Shipping was also reasonable and much faster than I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> great love it the smell and the smooth feel after using it</li>
            <li> It smells SO Good and delivers a mild cleansing when used with an oil cleanser. The smell is like lemonade and sugar cookies.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. To properly cleanse the skin, use this product after the use of Skinfood Black Sugar Cleansing Oil.</li>
            <li> I like this scrub a lot. I use it every other day, using one of the Face Shop&#x27;s rice water cleansers on the other days. I definitely have noticed that my skin looks brighter since I&#x27;ve started using it, and I like that the sugar isn&#x27;t too hard on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t burn like a salt scrub might. The only reason I took off a star is because it smells a little too much like industrial cleansers, and the thickness of the scrub can make it a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> i liked this very good scrub</li>
            <li> Excellent product, thanks a lot!</li>
