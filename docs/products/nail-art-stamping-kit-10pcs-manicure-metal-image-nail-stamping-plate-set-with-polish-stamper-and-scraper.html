            <li>This is a great stamping tool for nail art and as it comes with a rubber stamp, is a bous.</li>
            <li>and it is a great way to spruce up your nails</li>
            <li>Great work</li>
            <li>never had a successful stamp on my nails with these plates.</li>
            <li>This product does not have a good scraper or a good stamper.</li>
            <li>she us in love with them!</li>
            <li>very good quality and the stamper is great, All though we had to change the scraper cause of the metal part it left scratches, and line in the design</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, I didn&#x27;t hav any repeat plates, but there aren&#x27;t any full nail designs</li>
            <li>I tried it out to make sure it works.</li>
            <li>Was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>A credit card and a pencil eraser work better.</li>
            <li>but i found out that it came with a sticker on top you peel it off the edges</li>
            <li>i did not know that it had a sticker on top</li>
            <li>I love these stamp nail art kits.</li>
            <li>There are many out there....</li>
            <li>The plates really aren&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t tell you how many plates are going to get and the plate all scratched up</li>
            <li>Did not expt the plates to be as strong as they are.</li>
            <li>Its really cool, i&#x27;m going to buy one for myself. :)</li>
            <li>I ordered the kit for my niece because I have something similar that works great, and she loves it.</li>
            <li>After waiting forever, I was so excited that they came.</li>
            <li>Took it off and it worked perfectly, the designs are deep enough, the scraper works.</li>
            <li>so we just use a old credit card or a library card.  : )</li>
            <li>The plates give good impressions &amp; there is a wide selection of impressions -- even a Hello Kitty!  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t understand why it wasn&#x27;t sticking to the rubber stamper</li>
            <li>I really like this a lot!</li>
            <li>Although few of stamps were scratched in shipping, still a good deal for the price</li>
            <li>Was very excited about the different designs on the plates</li>
            <li>and it saves so much money then going to a salon all of the time.</li>
            <li>well fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend just going to a store and paying a little more for a far better product.</li>
            <li>so I was left with a plate full of polish</li>
            <li>but it works perfectly with nice designs i recommend people to buy this item sorry about the wrong report</li>
            <li>I have an old state ID &amp; 3 old AAA cards!!!  </li>
            <li>I am getting a new stamper and scraper to see if it will work.</li>
            <li>I love it, I got this as a gift and because i saw so many bad reviews</li>
            <li>It only works with curtin nail polish and if you don&#x27;t get it stamped off fast it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>These are complete garbage</li>
            <li>Not to mention the color selection of acrylic paint far exceeds the stamping nail polishes..  </li>
            <li>And when I tried them, the polish wasnt able to stay in the design because it was too shallow.</li>
            <li>When I open them and try to try them I noticed that the plates and the holes in the plates were not shallow enough to hold any paint and then the scraper didn&#x27;t want to scrape the nail polish off</li>
            <li>I will probably want to buy another stamper in the near future.</li>
            <li>By the way you can use acrylic paint for stamping on your nails which by passes a lot of the down sides of using the specialty (high priced) nail polish.  </li>

            <li> but a few minutes later  I figured out that its a clear sticker over all of the designs.</li>
            <li> is hard to get the stamp because the figures are not deep enough.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was terrible I received my package before the actual ship date which is the good part</li>
            <li> When I received this, the plates were extremely scratched.</li>
            <li> and then when I try to pick up a design or  pick up any  polish with the little stamp it all just sticks together.</li>
            <li> Clearly the 5-star reviews are FAKE.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;both time and money waste.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bad it&#x27;s a lost of money and time :(</li>
            <li> Waited 2+ weeks for them to arrive, and my daughter was frustrated and disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>

            <li> Bad it&#x27;s a lost of money and time :(</li>
            <li> Dont buy this, the plates dont work, they dont catch any of the polish so the design doesn&#x27;t come out</li>
            <li> The stamping plates aren&#x27;t deep enough to hold the polish. Didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> is hard to get the stamp because the figures are not deep enough.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all, prints are not deep enough. So when you remove the nail polish from dish all of it comes off dish with nothing left over to print on nail. Do not buy</li>
            <li> Was pleased with the product. Did not expt the plates to be as strong as they are. Several dif pictures to chose from</li>
            <li> Some of them where scratched when I got them there ok</li>
            <li> The wells on the plates are not deep enough to hold any nail polish. I used the required nail polish, and when I scrapped off the excess, there was nothing left in the well. This was the case for all of the disks. I ordered the kit for my niece because I have something similar that works great, and she loves it. Unfortunately, this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really like this a lot!</li>
            <li> Was very excited about the different designs on the plates but I cannot, whatsoever, get the nail polish to stay in the design after scraping off the excess polish. never had a successful stamp on my nails with these plates. the polish just wipes off. very disappointed</li>
            <li> This product does not have a good scraper or a good stamper. A credit card and a pencil eraser work better. I am getting a new stamper and scraper to see if it will work.</li>
            <li> I got these plate&#x27;s for my daughter, she us in love with them! very good quality and the stamper is great, All though we had to change the scraper cause of the metal part it left scratches, and line in the design so we just use a old credit card or a library card.  : ) She loves it thank you!</li>
            <li> i bought this item it came scratched but i found out that it came with a sticker on top you peel it off the edges but it works perfectly with nice designs i recommend people to buy this item sorry about the wrong report i did not know that it had a sticker on top</li>
            <li> I love these stamp nail art kits. There are many out there....and it is a great way to spruce up your nails and it saves so much money then going to a salon all of the time.</li>
            <li> It was terrible I received my package before the actual ship date which is the good part but the plates weren&#x27;t even transferring the stamp and I wasn&#x27;t about to be bothered for a refund or to return them.</li>
            <li> It is very good! Buy it!</li>
            <li> The plates really aren&#x27;t great.  The scraper for the stamper doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> Came about 3 weeks earlier than promised.  The plates give good impressions &amp; there is a wide selection of impressions -- even a Hello Kitty!  By the way you can use acrylic paint for stamping on your nails which by passes a lot of the down sides of using the specialty (high priced) nail polish.  Not to mention the color selection of acrylic paint far exceeds the stamping nail polishes..  The scraper was very tiny, but then,,, who cares?  I have an old state ID &amp; 3 old AAA cards!!!  I will probably want to buy another stamper in the near future.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!! It&#x27;s just a waist of time and money..</li>
            <li> Great work well fast shipping thanks</li>
            <li> After waiting forever, I was so excited that they came. When I open them and try to try them I noticed that the plates and the holes in the plates were not shallow enough to hold any paint and then the scraper didn&#x27;t want to scrape the nail polish off so I was left with a plate full of polish and then when I try to pick up a design or  pick up any  polish with the little stamp it all just sticks together. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anybody because it just did not work the description is off they don&#x27;t tell you how many plates are going to get and the plate all scratched up they don&#x27;t work for anything except for maybe  paper weights</li>
