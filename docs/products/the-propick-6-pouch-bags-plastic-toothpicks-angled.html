            <li>Great product and great service.  </li>
            <li>I have been using these toothpicks for over 10 years and always have a great tooth exam.</li>
            <li>They say I am doing a great job flossing</li>
            <li>GREAT CAN&#x27;T FIND THEM IN OUR STORE</li>
            <li>She is happy now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li>Great product for good price</li>
            <li>Shipping and all was good</li>
            <li>price was good.  </li>
            <li>We were delighted to find them on Amazon</li>
            <li>The picks don&#x27;t have the strength needed to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Stores around here quit carrying so was a good find for me..</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased to find them.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy these in my grocery store and loved them, nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>the product has changed - and not for the better!</li>
            <li>I have always liked these toothpicks, but, we checked for them every where we went where there was a Walmart and no one had them anymore.</li>
            <li>They did replace them with new ones which was excellent customer care service.</li>
            <li>They are also stronger than most and come in a handy container.</li>
            <li>But were no longer able to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>amazes me why no stores that I can find carry them any more.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with them.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>They are so much better than a tooth pick</li>
            <li>But glad to find</li>
            <li>Will always order more.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li>MANY YEARS AGO, VS TOBACCO.  </li>
            <li>We have used this brand for many years.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Glad that the pics were still available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ordering ProPicks for more than 10 years because of the unique design and durability.</li>
            <li>The ones I just purchased are the same, except the plastic material is softer and thinner, so not quite as happy with them.  </li>
            <li>I like them better than wood or plastic straight picks because of the angled end.</li>
            <li>Have used these for many years - really like the angle of pick</li>
            <li>I am glad that they are available online through Amazon (don&#x27;t try to order directly from the company).  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the white ProPicks I received from my order.  </li>
            <li>Love the new packaging.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I have used these picks for many years and they are not always available in a local store.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased they are available through mail order as our local stores in this area no longer carry them.  </li>
            <li>Great to have available for the tough jobs.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find the good old standby ProPicks locally</li>
            <li>The shipping was immediate and the product exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>They are much better than wooden toothpicks.  </li>
            <li>The plastic used now is much softer and the tip does not have a fine enough point to really do the job.</li>
            <li>Thanks Jake</li>
            <li>I was very hapy with my order.</li>
            <li>THEY WORKED VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>Unlike the picture, they are not white but transluscent and flimsy compared to the original ones we had.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get these any more any other place.</li>
            <li>Great, hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>work better than wooden ones, can&#x27;t find them here in central fla.</li>
            <li>These are made out of a clear flimsy plastic now</li>
            <li>and they last so much longer also.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t buy them again unless I can order the old style.</li>
            <li>These clear plastic picks are useful, but I prefer the previous ones I&#x27;ve had, made of white, stiffer plastic.  </li>
            <li>They need to be a harder plastic to really work.  </li>
            <li>I think the company is using an old picture which they should change out to match their actual product.</li>
            <li>The reason for the 3 stars is because Armonds has stopped making them the same way and now use a softer material which is to flexible and does not get inside the teeth like the old ones did.</li>
            <li>These are not the same quality as the old ones, softer and thicker plastic.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> They work as well as the originals but don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> They bend easily and give way when flossing at difficult angles.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a long time.</li>
            <li> But love the way they are shaped to enable reaching behind and in hard to reach areas of the teeth.</li>
            <li> These picks are much sturdier than others I have tried and you don&#x27;t have broken fibers from floss or splinters from wooden picks.  </li>
            <li> They also had a problem using to much heat and some, very few, toothpicks were black on the tips.</li>
            <li> Ordered these plastic toothpicks because the store I previously bought a similar item from has stopped carrying them.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I noticed I cannot find them at the grocery chain that previously carried them.</li>
            <li> The other ones I bought were a firmer plastic &amp; didn&#x27;t bend lie these &amp; were a bit thinner</li>
            <li> They reach places that are just hard to get with regular picks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they no longer come in the handy hard plastic flip-top container now but are in little poorly made ziptop baggies.  </li>
            <li> The previous products were a stiffer material.</li>
            <li> Also, they have a little &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; on the side that has to be cut off - presumably from manufacturing en masse?  </li>
            <li> They were stronger than some of the green ones I have used and I like this feature.  </li>
            <li> The new ones are so flimsy that they are virtually useless!</li>
            <li> , We are not sure where we got them, or when.&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> Publix used to sell them but no more....</li>
            <li> My wife uses them, unable to find anything comparable locally.</li>
            <li> I just bought 6 packs because others complained about the quality.  </li>
            <li> pat 2 orders have definatly shown QC has stopped they are weak &amp; break in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you can imagine how disappointed I was to receive this order only to find out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate them since they are all we have but, will look for others next time.</li>
            <li> UNABLE TO BUY THEM IN THE GROCERY STORE,SO WENT ON LINE TO FIND THEM.</li>
            <li> This product was just what I needed and was unable to find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m stuck with six boxes of a useless product!</li>
            <li> We were extremely disappointed when Wal Mart dropped them.  </li>
            <li> however disappointed after they arrived.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sad that the quality of the ProPicks has declined to almost being worthless!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in them.  </li>

            <li> Shipping and all was good but these things are flimsy.  They need to be a harder plastic to really work.  Very disappointed in them.  Should have sent them back because I won&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> best tooth picks ever. amazes me why no stores that I can find carry them any more.</li>
            <li> great way to improve oral health.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. I have always liked these toothpicks, but, we checked for them every where we went where there was a Walmart and no one had them anymore.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find the good old standby ProPicks locally so had to order online.  Unfortunately they no longer come in the handy hard plastic flip-top container now but are in little poorly made ziptop baggies.  Also, they have a little &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; on the side that has to be cut off - presumably from manufacturing en masse?  They work as well as the originals but don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Great picks my husband is so happy</li>
            <li> The previous products were a stiffer material., We are not sure where we got them, or when.&lt;br /&gt;Your price was good.  We shared them with a relative that had also been looking for them.</li>
            <li> My sister told us about these toothpicks that were at Wal Mart, several years ago.  We were extremely disappointed when Wal Mart dropped them.  We were delighted to find them on Amazon however disappointed after they arrived.  Unlike the picture, they are not white but transluscent and flimsy compared to the original ones we had.  I think the company is using an old picture which they should change out to match their actual product.</li>
            <li> UNABLE TO BUY THEM IN THE GROCERY STORE,SO WENT ON LINE TO FIND THEM. GREAT TO REMOVE FOOD STUCK BETWEEN YOUR TEETH.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these ProPik for well over 25 years!&lt;br /&gt;The pat 2 orders have definatly shown QC has stopped they are weak &amp; break in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;I have driven to Athens Ga.just to buy these once wonderful items for gifts to friends &amp; customers.. - Never again</li>
            <li> Excellent product....beats using a water pic ...great for travelling too.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these on Amazon. We bought these for years in supermarkets, and then they disappeared. I like them better than wood or plastic straight picks because of the angled end. They reach places that are just hard to get with regular picks. They are also stronger than most and come in a handy container. Great to have available for the tough jobs.</li>
            <li> These clear plastic picks are useful, but I prefer the previous ones I&#x27;ve had, made of white, stiffer plastic.  Anyway, I tell my friends about these and give them a pack.  They&#x27;re reusable, unlike wooden picks, so a box lasts quite a while.  The hook at one end makes all the difference when digging between teeth.</li>
            <li> Have used these for many years - really like the angle of pick</li>
            <li> The picks don&#x27;t have the strength needed to do a good job.  They bend easily and give way when flossing at difficult angles.</li>
            <li> I have used these picks for many years and they are not always available in a local store.  The shipping was immediate and the product exactly as advertised.  These picks are much sturdier than others I have tried and you don&#x27;t have broken fibers from floss or splinters from wooden picks.  This is the only manufacturer I have found and I hope they will always have this product.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, I can&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore.  I just bought 6 packs because others complained about the quality.  I am satisfied with them.  They are much better than wooden toothpicks.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> These ProPicks are superb. My husband uses them every day of his life. They are so much better than a tooth pick and they last so much longer also. Great product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this style of toothpick and I was very pleased to find them.  Great product for good price</li>
            <li> Great product and great service.  Will do business again if necessary.  Thanks Jake</li>
            <li> I was very hapy with my order.</li>
            <li> work better than wooden ones, can&#x27;t find them here in central fla. Publix used to sell them but no more....</li>
            <li> This product was just what I needed and was unable to find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have been using these toothpicks for over 10 years and always have a great tooth exam. They say I am doing a great job flossing but I never floss, it&#x27;s the toothpicks that are doing the job. The reason for the 3 stars is because Armonds has stopped making them the same way and now use a softer material which is to flexible and does not get inside the teeth like the old ones did. They also had a problem using to much heat and some, very few, toothpicks were black on the tips. They did replace them with new ones which was excellent customer care service. I probably won&#x27;t buy them again unless I can order the old style.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years so you can imagine how disappointed I was to receive this order only to find out the product has changed - and not for the better! The picks are thicker, made from a different material, and are not as flexible. Looks like I&#x27;m stuck with six boxes of a useless product! Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the white ProPicks I received from my order.  They were stronger than some of the green ones I have used and I like this feature.  I am pleased they are available through mail order as our local stores in this area no longer carry them.  They are the best toothpicks I have ever used.</li>
            <li> GREAT CAN&#x27;T FIND THEM IN OUR STORE ANYMORE WE WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> THEY WORKED VERY WELL. THANK YOU FOR ASKING. I WANT TO ORDER A KNIFE SO LET ME DO SO. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Been looking for these for a while.  The stores don&#x27;t sell them anymore.  Don&#x27;t  know why?  But glad to find&lt;br /&gt;them online.  Will always order more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted at a fair price. My wife uses them, unable to find anything comparable locally. She is happy now.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li> Great, hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> everybody needs them in one form or another and I like these.. Stores around here quit carrying so was a good find for me..</li>
            <li> BEST T-PICK SINCE I STARTED USING THEM MANY YEARS AGO, VS TOBACCO.  THEY HAVE SUCH A LONG LASTING LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;KEEP THE PICK IN TOOTHPICK, UP. AAAA +++++</li>
            <li> Ordered these plastic toothpicks because the store I previously bought a similar item from has stopped carrying them.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t but them again because they are a bit flimsy.  The other ones I bought were a firmer plastic &amp; didn&#x27;t bend lie these &amp; were a bit thinner so they it was easier to get them in between teeth.  I don&#x27;t hate them since they are all we have but, will look for others next time.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a long time. I used to buy them at the Drug Stores but then they were discontinued by the Drug Stores.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I found them again I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these in my grocery store and loved them, nice and sturdy. When they became unavailable, I ordered these. These are made out of a clear flimsy plastic now and I&#x27;m stuck with 6 boxes of them.</li>
            <li> Love the new packaging. Glad that the pics were still available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sad that the quality of the ProPicks has declined to almost being worthless! What happened!?!? The new ones are so flimsy that they are virtually useless! I&#x27;ve been ordering ProPicks for more than 10 years because of the unique design and durability. Up until now, nothing else on the market has compared. My search begins for a replacement...</li>
            <li> We have used this brand for many years. Recently, I noticed I cannot find them at the grocery chain that previously carried them. These are not the same quality as the old ones, softer and thicker plastic. I will not purchase these again</li>
            <li> There are alot of toothpicks out there, but none get the job done as expertly as these!  I have been using these for years, and as a result have WAY fewer visits to the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> These picks were for a gift &amp; he loves them. PJ</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at the drug store, but could no longer find them.  I am glad that they are available online through Amazon (don&#x27;t try to order directly from the company).  The quality seems to have suffered.  The plastic used now is much softer and the tip does not have a fine enough point to really do the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get these any more any other place. They are perfect for daily use.</li>
