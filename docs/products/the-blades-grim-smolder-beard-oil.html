            <li>Best beard oil I have used,  the spectacular scent last all</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of the sweet components in a good pipe tobacco, with the slightest hint of smokiness.  </li>
            <li>Very lightly frangranced.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly</li>

            <li>I love it will order more</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my beard smells.</li>
            <li>Great smell, well packaged, fast delivery and</li>
            <li>4th brand of beard oil I&#x27;ve tried, and this one is simply the best.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is better than through the club&#x27;s website</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Already ordered more.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you, the ladies love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>My wife thought it was more manly than the others.</li>
            <li>It does a better job at softening my beard than the others and I do like this more.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to start using beard oil, just because I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would feel.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I am contemplating buying more</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this.</li>
            <li>Tried many oils.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine getting anything better.</li>
            <li>The scent is ok, thought it would be better after the reviews.</li>
            <li>and I already know I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li>The beard immediately feels 100% softer, is shinier, and my wife is already insisting I buy more.</li>
            <li>Just wished it smelled better.</li>
            <li>I use several brands and the control on this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>but I had hoped that it would provide a bit more taming to to wiry whiskers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it</li>
            <li>Good scent, not too powerful.</li>
            <li>Many oils go on and it feels like you just put cologne on</li>
            <li>Love the stuff</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll just buy more before the price rockets to the moon because of demand.</li>
            <li>but it smells much better than beard products that smell like cedar sawdust, the easiest smell for me to discern</li>
            <li>Softens the beard and gets rid of any itch, like most beard oils.</li>
            <li>Smells even better than the $25 beard oil I have.</li>
            <li>Not to mention it&#x27;s a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li>This oil has a very nice vanilla-ish scent, but with a touch of something more masculine I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.</li>
            <li>Four stars not 5 cause bottle didn&#x27;t seem very full is all.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my beard really soft.</li>
            <li>After five days of use I can feel my beard becoming softer.  </li>
            <li>Great shipping time, the scent is a bit sweet kind of like a cross between cotton candy and vanilla.  </li>
            <li>This makes my beard softer than any other oil and smells the best to me.</li>
            <li>The beard absorbs it very nicely, leaving it feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>a nice sweet light fresh smell surrounds you then is gone.</li>
            <li>I honestly have started to begin to get compliments on my beard more frequently, and I truly feel that it is because I have a healthier beard.</li>
            <li>Light scented.  </li>
            <li>Beard itch went away instantly and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I just got it in the mail today shipping was fast and price was amazing and</li>
            <li>Scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I liked this oil so much I have already ordered another bottle.  </li>
            <li>so I applied some beard oil on his baby smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic oil.</li>
            <li>is a light vanilla or marshmallows.  </li>
            <li>I got both from a subscription mens shaving club which is good to try many different products each month for a set price.</li>
            <li>So those went right in the garbage. :)</li>
            <li>If you enjoy fresh roasted Candied Almonds and Pecans, you&#x27;ll find this oil to your liking!</li>
            <li>an has a clean mellow scent to it.</li>
            <li>Rich, robust, and slightly sweet.</li>
            <li>My new beard oil and a nice straightrazor shave got me lucky tonight ...</li>
            <li>feel it smells super clean.</li>
            <li>so much that I am ordering a couple more bottles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly sweet, but it&#x27;s on the sweet side.</li>
            <li>Double plus good, would buy again.</li>
            <li>The scent tends to fade after 4-5 hours anyway, but your beard is nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It really made my beard softer and seemed to even out the colors to be more uniform.</li>
            <li>Not a bad scent at all, just not one I like a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great value compared to some other options.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily feeling and smells tremendous.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty fantastic, though.</li>
            <li>The seller is also very willing to work with you if you have any issues.</li>
            <li>He has bought lots of other brands and has even tried making his own, but none has he liked as much as this one.</li>
            <li>I was worried about my beard feeling overly greasy, but it gets absorbed fairly quickly, so I didn&#x27;t feel any residue during the day.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff calmed my mess of a beard</li>
            <li>Definitely want to try more oils from these guys!</li>
            <li>right down smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells great, use it everyday.</li>
            <li>My wife couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off of my freshly oiled face sweater.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells like a hippie in the middle of a bakery.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil and it makes my beard so soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>I noticed at first a hint of licorice but it quickly fades away and mellows out into a delicious and sturdy roasty-sweet caramel blend that I&#x27;m already hopelessly addicted to.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It goes on like sweet vanilla and licorice then smooths out into pure harmony with the world.</li>
            <li>Im ready to order more and to try the new scent &amp;#34;Cinder&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It does do a good job of making my beard less frizzy, but the effect seems to wear off halfway through the day.</li>
            <li>I actually went back and ordered 3 more bottles of this oil because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li>As if having a manly beard wasn&#x27;t enough to have women flocking to you, now you can have your beard silky soft, the skin under your beard feeling great, and smell AMAZING all day with just a few drops of this oil.</li>
            <li>I will say my wife was very, very worried because she likes my beard and when she opened this box when it arrived at the house, there were instructions included for shaving with a straight razor!  </li>
            <li>The scent is great, it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li>I do find that even though my beard is relatively short, I feel like I need more than the 3-4 drops recommended on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments in combination with the aftershave of the same name.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d recommend getting here especially if you have Prime for free shipping!</li>
            <li>This is the first beard oil I have ever used</li>
            <li>Love this oil and will be buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li>This is my first beard-oil purchase (I use my Wife&#x27;s amazon account)</li>
            <li>My beard is 3 months in and this is the first product I&#x27;ve purchased and used specifically for beards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely by buying more of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several beard oils, this one might be my favorite.</li>
            <li>Oil is nice and thick goes in beard great sine other oils are runny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet smell, but still manages to be a masculine scent  that no man would be ashamed wearing.</li>
            <li>All it accomplished was making my face smell like a 2 x 4.</li>
            <li>Gotta say it was a real steal.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really, really sweet--to the point where I no longer want to use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really smells like cupcake icing.</li>
            <li>Smell is very fruity, the apricot oil comes through.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave as much shine, but did feel softer.</li>
            <li>Mustache rides are now booked at an alarming rate. :)</li>
            <li>My son took a wiff and gently felt my beard.</li>
            <li>This stuff combined with a beard brush or comb really helps keep things in line.</li>
            <li>The hairs are very manageable after application.</li>
            <li>and I use this product along with a balm when I really need to shape it</li>
            <li>But the smell on this one is what really got me.</li>
            <li>Smells great - subtle but masculine.</li>
            <li>This is my third &#x27;flavor&#x27;, the first two from a different company which prominently shows up on Amazon (I still like their scents, but not like this)....</li>
            <li>The smell of it is mostly a sweet, woody/nutty smell with a hint of vanilla and a tiny bit of cloves.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a darker sweet scent that stays with you personally</li>
            <li>it is little sweet with hint of smokeyness like sweet pipe tabacoo.</li>
            <li>Not your typical old spice, Irish spring type of soapy clean, but just fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Its so hard to describe, but AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Upon returning to the house, I was greeted by several freshly made pies and baked goods from the neighborhood women as an offering to my manliness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how there is no dropper, just a normal bottle.</li>
            <li>My favorite everyday beard oil.  </li>
            <li>A very subtle, yet pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, smells great, and actually makes my beard soft and helps it lay down (other ones smelled gross and made me look oily).</li>
            <li>Scent lasts a long time, unfortunately I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been considering trying some beard oil for a year or so, as I have pretty course facial hair, but I never felt like shelling out the money for a grooming product.  </li>
            <li>Wow dad that stinks good!  </li>
            <li>Not sure if this is just me or not, but other than that, it smelled good and worked decently well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need control as much as I needed something to soften my beard and help with dry skin.</li>
            <li>A lot of other oils have a scent that disappates quickly, this one sticks around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll throw my name in with the reviewers raving about the scent; masculine but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>i regularly condition my beard so I can&#x27;t really say what&#x27;s making it softer at this point.</li>
            <li>as far as a description for the scent?</li>
            <li>the manufacturer says something like spicy and toasty...to me I think of a masculine musky incense.</li>
            <li>The oil is more delicate than the others.</li>
            <li>and and some, also leaves your beard soft.</li>
            <li>wife prefers this over the beard products that make you smell like you slept in a cedar coffin by far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, thick oil, which is good if you have a thicker, hard to tame beard like mine.</li>
            <li>I like it, it smells more like subtle butterscotch to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, but I really like the effect its had on my beard!  </li>
            <li>a few different random women tell me I smell delicious and want to get closer to my face to smell closer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it gave me major allergies and a bit of a rash</li>
            <li>This goes on and after a few minutes you forget you even put it on until you move just right and bang</li>
            <li>The scent is a little sweet, which I did not expect, but it does say right in the product description, so that&#x27;s my fault for not catching that.  </li>
            <li>I just recently got into the beard care as my old job did not allow facial hair.</li>
            <li>the first few days I used it.</li>
            <li>So far it has helped with my dry skin under the beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only started using beard products for the past year or less, and so far I have tried one of the popular brands of balm and a heavy duty balm.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like as much is the way the oil just sort of leaks out of the container, and always seems to create a mess.</li>

            <li> The oil works nicely into my beard and face</li>
            <li> It kind of smells like vanilla sugar.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, I&#x27;d say it smells like s&#x27;mores.</li>

            <li> Smells fantastic great product all I need is a great straight razor</li>
            <li> Best beard oil I have used,  the spectacular scent last all</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of the sweet components in a good pipe tobacco, with the slightest hint of smokiness.  </li>
            <li> Very lightly frangranced.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li> Very Good Product, wife likes the smell and it did not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love it will order more</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my beard smells.</li>
            <li> Great smell, well packaged, fast delivery and</li>
            <li> 4th brand of beard oil I&#x27;ve tried, and this one is simply the best.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is better than through the club&#x27;s website</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Already ordered more.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you, the ladies love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> My wife thought it was more manly than the others.</li>
            <li> It does a better job at softening my beard than the others and I do like this more.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to start using beard oil, just because I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would feel.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I am contemplating buying more</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this.</li>
            <li> Tried many oils.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine getting anything better.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, thought it would be better after the reviews.</li>
            <li> and I already know I&#x27;ll be ordering more.</li>
            <li> The beard immediately feels 100% softer, is shinier, and my wife is already insisting I buy more.</li>
            <li> Just wished it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I use several brands and the control on this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> but I had hoped that it would provide a bit more taming to to wiry whiskers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it</li>
            <li> Good scent, not too powerful.</li>
            <li> Many oils go on and it feels like you just put cologne on</li>
            <li> Love the stuff</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll just buy more before the price rockets to the moon because of demand.</li>
            <li> but it smells much better than beard products that smell like cedar sawdust, the easiest smell for me to discern</li>
            <li> Softens the beard and gets rid of any itch, like most beard oils.</li>
            <li> Smells even better than the $25 beard oil I have.</li>
            <li> Not to mention it&#x27;s a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> This oil has a very nice vanilla-ish scent, but with a touch of something more masculine I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on.</li>
            <li> Four stars not 5 cause bottle didn&#x27;t seem very full is all.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my beard really soft.</li>
            <li> After five days of use I can feel my beard becoming softer.  </li>
            <li> Great shipping time, the scent is a bit sweet kind of like a cross between cotton candy and vanilla.  </li>
            <li> This makes my beard softer than any other oil and smells the best to me.</li>
            <li> The beard absorbs it very nicely, leaving it feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> a nice sweet light fresh smell surrounds you then is gone.</li>
            <li> I honestly have started to begin to get compliments on my beard more frequently, and I truly feel that it is because I have a healthier beard.</li>
            <li> Light scented.  </li>
            <li> Beard itch went away instantly and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail today shipping was fast and price was amazing and</li>
            <li> Scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I liked this oil so much I have already ordered another bottle.  </li>
            <li> so I applied some beard oil on his baby smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic oil.</li>
            <li> is a light vanilla or marshmallows.  </li>
            <li> I got both from a subscription mens shaving club which is good to try many different products each month for a set price.</li>
            <li> So those went right in the garbage. :)</li>
            <li> If you enjoy fresh roasted Candied Almonds and Pecans, you&#x27;ll find this oil to your liking!</li>
            <li> an has a clean mellow scent to it.</li>
            <li> Rich, robust, and slightly sweet.</li>
            <li> My new beard oil and a nice straightrazor shave got me lucky tonight ...</li>
            <li> feel it smells super clean.</li>
            <li> so much that I am ordering a couple more bottles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly sweet, but it&#x27;s on the sweet side.</li>
            <li> Double plus good, would buy again.</li>
            <li> The scent tends to fade after 4-5 hours anyway, but your beard is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It really made my beard softer and seemed to even out the colors to be more uniform.</li>
            <li> Not a bad scent at all, just not one I like a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great value compared to some other options.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily feeling and smells tremendous.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty fantastic, though.</li>
            <li> The seller is also very willing to work with you if you have any issues.</li>
            <li> He has bought lots of other brands and has even tried making his own, but none has he liked as much as this one.</li>
            <li> I was worried about my beard feeling overly greasy, but it gets absorbed fairly quickly, so I didn&#x27;t feel any residue during the day.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff calmed my mess of a beard</li>
            <li> Definitely want to try more oils from these guys!</li>
            <li> right down smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells great, use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My wife couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off of my freshly oiled face sweater.</li>
            <li> It kind of smells like a hippie in the middle of a bakery.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil and it makes my beard so soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li> This one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> I noticed at first a hint of licorice but it quickly fades away and mellows out into a delicious and sturdy roasty-sweet caramel blend that I&#x27;m already hopelessly addicted to.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It goes on like sweet vanilla and licorice then smooths out into pure harmony with the world.</li>
            <li> Im ready to order more and to try the new scent &amp;#34;Cinder&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It does do a good job of making my beard less frizzy, but the effect seems to wear off halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> I actually went back and ordered 3 more bottles of this oil because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> As if having a manly beard wasn&#x27;t enough to have women flocking to you, now you can have your beard silky soft, the skin under your beard feeling great, and smell AMAZING all day with just a few drops of this oil.</li>
            <li> I will say my wife was very, very worried because she likes my beard and when she opened this box when it arrived at the house, there were instructions included for shaving with a straight razor!  </li>
            <li> The scent is great, it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> I do find that even though my beard is relatively short, I feel like I need more than the 3-4 drops recommended on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments in combination with the aftershave of the same name.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d recommend getting here especially if you have Prime for free shipping!</li>
            <li> This is the first beard oil I have ever used</li>
            <li> Love this oil and will be buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard-oil purchase (I use my Wife&#x27;s amazon account)</li>
            <li> My beard is 3 months in and this is the first product I&#x27;ve purchased and used specifically for beards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely by buying more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard oils, this one might be my favorite.</li>
            <li> Oil is nice and thick goes in beard great sine other oils are runny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet smell, but still manages to be a masculine scent  that no man would be ashamed wearing.</li>
            <li> All it accomplished was making my face smell like a 2 x 4.</li>
            <li> Gotta say it was a real steal.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really, really sweet--to the point where I no longer want to use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really smells like cupcake icing.</li>
            <li> Smell is very fruity, the apricot oil comes through.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave as much shine, but did feel softer.</li>
            <li> Mustache rides are now booked at an alarming rate. :)</li>
            <li> My son took a wiff and gently felt my beard.</li>
            <li> This stuff combined with a beard brush or comb really helps keep things in line.</li>
            <li> The hairs are very manageable after application.</li>
            <li> and I use this product along with a balm when I really need to shape it</li>
            <li> But the smell on this one is what really got me.</li>
            <li> Smells great - subtle but masculine.</li>
            <li> This is my third &#x27;flavor&#x27;, the first two from a different company which prominently shows up on Amazon (I still like their scents, but not like this)....</li>
            <li> The smell of it is mostly a sweet, woody/nutty smell with a hint of vanilla and a tiny bit of cloves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a darker sweet scent that stays with you personally</li>
            <li> it is little sweet with hint of smokeyness like sweet pipe tabacoo.</li>
            <li> Not your typical old spice, Irish spring type of soapy clean, but just fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Its so hard to describe, but AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> Upon returning to the house, I was greeted by several freshly made pies and baked goods from the neighborhood women as an offering to my manliness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how there is no dropper, just a normal bottle.</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday beard oil.  </li>
            <li> A very subtle, yet pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, smells great, and actually makes my beard soft and helps it lay down (other ones smelled gross and made me look oily).</li>
            <li> Scent lasts a long time, unfortunately I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been considering trying some beard oil for a year or so, as I have pretty course facial hair, but I never felt like shelling out the money for a grooming product.  </li>
            <li> Wow dad that stinks good!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is just me or not, but other than that, it smelled good and worked decently well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really need control as much as I needed something to soften my beard and help with dry skin.</li>
            <li> A lot of other oils have a scent that disappates quickly, this one sticks around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll throw my name in with the reviewers raving about the scent; masculine but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> i regularly condition my beard so I can&#x27;t really say what&#x27;s making it softer at this point.</li>
            <li> as far as a description for the scent?</li>
            <li> the manufacturer says something like spicy and toasty...to me I think of a masculine musky incense.</li>
            <li> The oil is more delicate than the others.</li>
            <li> and and some, also leaves your beard soft.</li>
            <li> wife prefers this over the beard products that make you smell like you slept in a cedar coffin by far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, thick oil, which is good if you have a thicker, hard to tame beard like mine.</li>
            <li> I like it, it smells more like subtle butterscotch to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, but I really like the effect its had on my beard!  </li>
            <li> a few different random women tell me I smell delicious and want to get closer to my face to smell closer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it gave me major allergies and a bit of a rash</li>
            <li> This goes on and after a few minutes you forget you even put it on until you move just right and bang</li>
            <li> The scent is a little sweet, which I did not expect, but it does say right in the product description, so that&#x27;s my fault for not catching that.  </li>
            <li> I just recently got into the beard care as my old job did not allow facial hair.</li>
            <li> the first few days I used it.</li>
            <li> So far it has helped with my dry skin under the beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using beard products for the past year or less, and so far I have tried one of the popular brands of balm and a heavy duty balm.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like as much is the way the oil just sort of leaks out of the container, and always seems to create a mess.</li>
            <li> It helps tame his beard and also softens it so much.</li>
            <li> I gave Smolder a shot when I found it marked down heavily back in January.  </li>
            <li> It has a very subtle sweet scent and makes managing a beard a snap.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a small bottle but highly concentrated.</li>
            <li> I have on my rather long beard.</li>
            <li> To be honest I probably would never have tried this stuff otherwise because it&#x27;s kinda expensive for a small amount.</li>
            <li> I plan to try other scents to see if they are used with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Soft, subtle, ladies will definitely like this one.  </li>
            <li> But rhat simply comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a couple days but already my beard feels softer and seems less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is its not used to scent with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days, so I can&#x27;t say that it is helping with softness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not what I expected, and not really what I think any guy with a mansome beard would be into.</li>
            <li> Minus the razor blade of course.</li>
            <li> I purchased their double pack of Smolder &amp; Cinder after using this after just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long was.</li>
            <li> I will be trying their other scents</li>
            <li> I will be trying the other scents from this shop.</li>
            <li> But I read about other beard oils and wanted to see the difference.</li>
            <li> but I want to try their other products too.</li>
            <li> Have another beard oil product that comes with a glass dropper, which means I use less, waste less, and don&#x27;t get it all over the outside of the bottle trying to put it away during application.</li>
            <li> I unfortunately have hard water where I live and this restores my beard to it&#x27;s natural beauty.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the dispense method itself, I think this would benefit from a dropper or a squeeze bottle; the shake method tends to make a mess and will sometimes spill out wasting the oil</li>
            <li> I have noticed the difference the way my beard look and with less hitching</li>
            <li> It smells a little sweeter than one would expect, but the Mrs. Loves it.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle that leaked a little bit during shipping, got a 50% refund.    </li>
            <li> ...wish the scent was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Few times I have use it since I received it</li>
            <li> and it is not too heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> So I put a few drops on my hands and worked it in my beard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few beard oils, scented and unscented.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of both this and some of the other The Blades Grim oils.</li>
            <li> It is easier to comb and tame.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle but long lasting vanilla scent that drives my wife crazy.  </li>
            <li> He even brings it into to work to share a bit with the other guys who have beards and they are all just as obsessed.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle yet long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and long-lasting, I&#x27;d find I could still smell it during my shower the day after I applied some.</li>
            <li> just not good either.</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t stiff and irritating!</li>
            <li> Grim other oils in a different scent just to try it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a tough one...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend any of the blades grim products I have tried as they are all in my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The scent I chose is very subtle, but</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unfortunate.</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad....</li>
            <li> So I loaded up the brush with shave soap(blades grim smolder) put an ample amount on his cheeks then</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great quality,  I hate the smell though. But rhat simply comes down to preference.</li>
            <li> makes my beard look smooth and smell good. Few times I have use it since I received it I have noticed the difference the way my beard look and with less hitching</li>
            <li> Light scented.  A little goes a long was.</li>
            <li> Just buy it. Smells great and makes my beard really soft. Get the 2 pack, you won&#x27;t regret it. Don&#x27;t forget the Smolder beard wax also!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish this came with more oil, but the quality and scent is exceptional.</li>
            <li> GREAT STUFF!!! Just got burned on a bottle of beard oil that I bought because it offered 2oz instead of 1....I was sorely mistaken.. All it accomplished was making my face smell like a 2 x 4. I thought I was doomed to have an itchy beard forever. However I just got my smolder in today, and after the first use I can honestly say it is F#@# awesome! Beard itch went away instantly and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using beard products for the past year or less, and so far I have tried one of the popular brands of balm and a heavy duty balm. I don&#x27;t really need control as much as I needed something to soften my beard and help with dry skin. I also didn&#x27;t like the smell of earlier products I tried. This oil has a very nice vanilla-ish scent, but with a touch of something more masculine I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on. I wish they sold a cologne to match it. So far it has helped with my dry skin under the beard. I have only been using it a few days, so I can&#x27;t say that it is helping with softness. I do find that even though my beard is relatively short, I feel like I need more than the 3-4 drops recommended on the bottle. I will definitely buy again, perhaps try one of The Blades Grim other oils in a different scent just to try it.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail today shipping was fast and price was amazing and the smell is awesome I love it will order more</li>
            <li> As soon as my Smolder Beard Oil arrived I put some into my beard. The smell enveloped me and I was taken to a memory of outdoor fires and toasted marshmallow. Before I knew what happened I had grabbed my ax and chopped an entire cord of wood. Upon returning to the house, I was greeted by several freshly made pies and baked goods from the neighborhood women as an offering to my manliness. My wife couldn&#x27;t keep her hands off of my freshly oiled face sweater. We now have 8 kids. It should come with a warning label.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product! Scent is fantastic.  I would highly recommend any of the blades grim products I have tried as they are all in my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product lineup. Keep up the good work blades! I can&#x27;t wait to try Cinder next</li>
            <li> Smells great, use it everyday. Keeps my beard soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> great stuff, should be a requirement for all bearded men..or women...smells good and makes the beard feel awesome as well.  the bottle should just have a dropper.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and smells good</li>
            <li> Very Good Product, wife likes the smell and it did not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Good quality product.  Smells good and lasts. The reason for the 1 star off is I would prefer am applicator instead of using my hands.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it makes my beard feel awesome!</li>
            <li> Scent lasts a long time, unfortunately I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. A lot of other oils have a scent that disappates quickly, this one sticks around. Not a bad scent at all, just not one I like a lot.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my beard smells. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments because of it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!! The scent I chose is very subtle, but just right. I honestly have started to begin to get compliments on my beard more frequently, and I truly feel that it is because I have a healthier beard. I unfortunately have hard water where I live and this restores my beard to it&#x27;s natural beauty. Great product from great sellers that provide world class customer service!</li>
            <li> I liked this oil so much I have already ordered another bottle.  The scent is subtle yet long-lasting.  This is a very nice product for those looking to condition their beard/skin.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been considering trying some beard oil for a year or so, as I have pretty course facial hair, but I never felt like shelling out the money for a grooming product.  I gave Smolder a shot when I found it marked down heavily back in January.  Gotta say it was a real steal.  I&#x27;ll throw my name in with the reviewers raving about the scent; masculine but not overpowering.  The wife is a big fan too.</li>
            <li> i regularly condition my beard so I can&#x27;t really say what&#x27;s making it softer at this point. Definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is a pleasure to put on, and get a whiff of. When I put on my motorcycle helmet, one of the best things is getting to smell that oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it smells super clean. Not your typical old spice, Irish spring type of soapy clean, but just fresh and clean. I will be trying their other scents</li>
            <li> Great smell, well packaged, fast delivery and it works. This is one of the best oils I have ever used.</li>
            <li> 4th brand of beard oil I&#x27;ve tried, and this one is simply the best.  Absolutely AMAZING scent and absorbs well into the beard.  Soft, subtle, ladies will definitely like this one.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really nice and smells GREAT! I&#x27;ve had many compliments in combination with the aftershave of the same name. I got both from a subscription mens shaving club which is good to try many different products each month for a set price. To be honest I probably would never have tried this stuff otherwise because it&#x27;s kinda expensive for a small amount. One thing to keep in mind though is you only us 3-4 drops so it&#x27;s a small bottle but highly concentrated. Amazon&#x27;s price is better than through the club&#x27;s website so I&#x27;d recommend getting here especially if you have Prime for free shipping! Oh yeah as far as a description for the scent? That&#x27;s a tough one...the manufacturer says something like spicy and toasty...to me I think of a masculine musky incense.</li>
            <li> Great shipping time, the scent is a bit sweet kind of like a cross between cotton candy and vanilla.  I will be trying the other scents from this shop.</li>
            <li> Best Deal.  Keeps my beard nice and smooth.  Smells really nice and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Already ordered more. And let me tell you, the ladies love the smell.</li>
            <li> If awesome had a scent, this would be it!</li>
            <li> Great beard oil. it smells a lot like that cologne angel. it doesn&#x27;t seem like they use essential oils but use fragrances. I plan to try other scents to see if they are used with essential oils. My only complaint is its not used to scent with essential oils. I think I&#x27;m going to gift the rest to a fellow bearded friend.  I really liked the oil otherwise.</li>
            <li> Only been using it a couple days but already my beard feels softer and seems less frizzy. I keep trying to place the scent, but I haven&#x27;t quite decided what it smells like to me... maybe vanilla with an occasional hint of something smoky. The oil works nicely into my beard and face and I don&#x27;t notice any residue on my hands from stroking my beard throughout the day at work.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and isn&#x27;t overwhelming</li>
            <li> Works great, my beard hasn&#x27;t been softer, and smells great</li>
            <li> The smell is really, really sweet--to the point where I no longer want to use this. It kind of smells like vanilla sugar. It does do a good job of making my beard less frizzy, but the effect seems to wear off halfway through the day.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review for my boyfriend. This stuff is awesome. It&#x27;s smells wonderful. He uses it sparingly but I love it when he is wearing it!</li>
            <li> This is the first beard oil I have ever used and it&#x27;s amazing. It&#x27;s a great scent that people around you can discover instead of hitting their nose if that makes sense. alsi a great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, but I really like the effect its had on my beard!  It&#x27;s also a great value compared to some other options.  The scent is a little sweet, which I did not expect, but it does say right in the product description, so that&#x27;s my fault for not catching that.  I will say my wife was very, very worried because she likes my beard and when she opened this box when it arrived at the house, there were instructions included for shaving with a straight razor!  So those went right in the garbage. :)</li>
            <li> I have just recently got into using beard oil.  This is my third &#x27;flavor&#x27;, the first two from a different company which prominently shows up on Amazon (I still like their scents, but not like this)....this scent blows the others away.  This now is my go to oil...so much that I am ordering a couple more bottles.  The smell reminds me of a campfire marshmallow...my only wish is that they made balm in this scent.</li>
            <li> It does not smell girly or perfumy but rather woodsy or outdoorsy if you can imagine that.</li>
            <li> Great stuff people!  Makes my beard look and smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this oil and will be buying it again in the future. The scent is a perfect musky/vanilla scent. My wife loves the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Works great an has a clean mellow scent to it. Also it arrived in just 3 days!</li>
            <li> Love the smell it is little sweet with hint of smokeyness like sweet pipe tabacoo. Oil is nice and thick goes in beard great sine other oils are runny. Four stars not 5 cause bottle didn&#x27;t seem very full is all. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Anybody who&#x27;s tried to describe this as smelling manly is off their rocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really smells like cupcake icing. Or birthday cake. No, there&#x27;s no smoky undertone to give it that hint of manliness to redeem the cupcake stench.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not what I expected, and not really what I think any guy with a mansome beard would be into.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for boyfriend.  He loves it!  Makes his beard shiny and smells great.  Very lightly frangranced.</li>
            <li> Smell is very fruity, the apricot oil comes through. Still pleasant.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of both this and some of the other The Blades Grim oils. What I don&#x27;t like as much is the way the oil just sort of leaks out of the container, and always seems to create a mess. Have another beard oil product that comes with a glass dropper, which means I use less, waste less, and don&#x27;t get it all over the outside of the bottle trying to put it away during application. The smell is pretty fantastic, though.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Rich, robust, and slightly sweet. Makes me feel like a pirate.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo damn good! Its so hard to describe, but AMAZING.  I bought this for my boyfriend,along with the Cinder scent as well. It helps tame his beard and also softens it so much. Awesome product. I&#x27;ll call him over to me just to smell his beard, ITS THAT AMAZING. Will be buying again and again...and again.</li>
            <li> wonderful smell, keeps my beard smooth</li>
            <li> I bought a beard oil pack with a comb, 2 beard oils and soap. I used the beard oil and it made a difference. But I read about other beard oils and wanted to see the difference. Of the 3, this is the best so far. It&#x27;s not oily feeling and smells tremendous. My wife said I smelled like camping. I felt it smelled like spiced nuts during christmas time or roasted marshmellows. It&#x27;s not overly sweet, but it&#x27;s on the sweet side. My wife thought it was more manly than the others. It does a better job at softening my beard than the others and I do like this more. The oil is more delicate than the others. It didn&#x27;t leave as much shine, but did feel softer. I would reccomend it to others.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday and tried some on.  I love the smell and it feels great. I was hesitant to start using beard oil, just because I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would feel. But this stuff is amazing. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering and it quite pleasant. I was worried about my beard feeling overly greasy, but it gets absorbed fairly quickly, so I didn&#x27;t feel any residue during the day. 10/10 would recommend</li>
            <li> Awesome beard oil! It kind of smells like a hippie in the middle of a bakery. It smells a little sweeter than one would expect, but the Mrs. Loves it. If she is happy, the. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Softens my goatee and love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling beard oil that I have found yet!  I love the smell of this oil and it makes my beard so soft when I use it.  I actually went back and ordered 3 more bottles of this oil because I liked it so much.</li>
            <li> just like my expectation, will buy again</li>
            <li> This is a good oil, the only downside to it is that it smells like cooked smores so when I do wear it I find myself craving them. Other than that it&#x27;s good stuff</li>
            <li> The scent alone makes me want to keep buying. It is amazing. I am recommending this to everyone who uses oil.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I just recently got into the beard care as my old job did not allow facial hair. This is absolutely a great product. It has a very subtle sweet scent and makes managing a beard a snap. I bought 2 while on sale and I am contemplating buying more but I want to try their other products too.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with many beard products trying to find the perfect scent...this oil has done that!!! It works great too! I will continue to buy this oil and will also try the balm too.</li>
            <li> Mine took 3 days from ordering to arriving on my doorstep. It works great, and is one of the manliest smells I&#x27;ve ever smelled. LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> My new beard oil and a nice straightrazor shave got me lucky tonight ...thank you!</li>
            <li> Great oil. Smells awesome and makes makes my beard very soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good that it might be considered an aphrodisiac. Mustache rides are now booked at an alarming rate. :)</li>
            <li> My husband loves this beard oil. He has bought lots of other brands and has even tried making his own, but none has he liked as much as this one. He even brings it into to work to share a bit with the other guys who have beards and they are all just as obsessed. He says it feels great and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> As if having a manly beard wasn&#x27;t enough to have women flocking to you, now you can have your beard silky soft, the skin under your beard feeling great, and smell AMAZING all day with just a few drops of this oil. I&#x27;ve actually had a few different random women tell me I smell delicious and want to get closer to my face to smell closer. Will definitely be using this product for the rest of my bearded life.</li>
            <li> Softens my beard and my wife loves the scent!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  After five days of use I can feel my beard becoming softer.  The smell reminds me of the sweet components in a good pipe tobacco, with the slightest hint of smokiness.  You guys should make this a prime product then watch it fly off your shelves.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like this. It has now become part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Tried many oils. This makes my beard softer than any other oil and smells the best to me. So this is the best oil on both counts. Best feel and best smell.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic great product all I need is a great straight razor</li>
            <li> Smells amazing I will continue to buy it just for the smell!!!!</li>
            <li> It showed up about a week before Amazon predicted it would. It smells amazing. Kinda like S&#x27;Mores with a hint of smokey campfire. Double plus good, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars because it gave me major allergies and a bit of a rash the first few days I used it. Not sure if this is just me or not, but other than that, it smelled good and worked decently well.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it works great as a preshave oil! You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is excellent beard oil.  It has a very nice dropper that dispenses one drop of oil every time you shake it.  Goes on very smoothly and it is not too heavy or greasy.  It has a subtle but long lasting vanilla scent that drives my wife crazy.  Every time she gets close to me she comments on good it smells.  I can&#x27;t imagine getting anything better.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff calmed my mess of a beard right down smells great.</li>
            <li> Best beard oil I have used,  the spectacular scent last all and and some, also leaves your beard soft. My son asked me what is that dad. So I put a few drops on my hands and worked it in my beard.  My son took a wiff and gently felt my beard. Wow dad that stinks good!  Of course I laughed lol.  Then he asked about my razor and why I was shaving my neck.  Here let me show you I exclaimed. So I loaded up the brush with shave soap(blades grim smolder) put an ample amount on his cheeks then proceided to shave him with my 1951 fatboy adjustable. Minus the razor blade of course. After his shave he had to have some beard oil so I applied some beard oil on his baby smooth cheeks.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok, thought it would be better after the reviews. I don&#x27;t like how there is no dropper, just a normal bottle. That&#x27;s unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Great scent (my girlfriend LOVES it), softens and tames my beard so it isn&#x27;t stiff and irritating! Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! My husband loves it!!</li>
            <li> This is my first beard-oil purchase (I use my Wife&#x27;s amazon account) and I already know I&#x27;ll be ordering more. If you enjoy fresh roasted Candied Almonds and Pecans, you&#x27;ll find this oil to your liking! I noticed at first a hint of licorice but it quickly fades away and mellows out into a delicious and sturdy roasty-sweet caramel blend that I&#x27;m already hopelessly addicted to. 5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH!! My beard is 3 months in and this is the first product I&#x27;ve purchased and used specifically for beards. The beard immediately feels 100% softer, is shinier, and my wife is already insisting I buy more.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells even better</li>
            <li> Like the way it feels and the texture and control I have on my rather long beard. Just wished it smelled better. It does not smell bad....just not good either. I use several brands and the control on this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> Oh i dont even know where to start with how great this stuff smells!  It&#x27;s a manly smell that reminds me of being snuggled up in front of a fire, in a cabin,  with it snowing outside...&lt;br /&gt;It just smells great!</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, but I had hoped that it would provide a bit more taming to to wiry whiskers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few beard oils, scented and unscented. This one is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s cheap, smells great, and actually makes my beard soft and helps it lay down (other ones smelled gross and made me look oily). The seller is also very willing to work with you if you have any issues. I had a bottle that leaked a little bit during shipping, got a 50% refund.    This stuff combined with a beard brush or comb really helps keep things in line. The smell of it is mostly a sweet, woody/nutty smell with a hint of vanilla and a tiny bit of cloves. None of that s***ty patchouli oil scent that comes with at lot of scented beard oils; you&#x27;re not gonna smell like a hippie. The scent tends to fade after 4-5 hours anyway, but your beard is nice and soft. I&#x27;ll definitely by buying more of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it...wish the scent was a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I like it, it smells more like subtle butterscotch to me. My only complaint is the dispense method itself, I think this would benefit from a dropper or a squeeze bottle; the shake method tends to make a mess and will sometimes spill out wasting the oil</li>
            <li> Bought as a valentines gift for my boyfriend. It smells so wonderful. He swears that the vitamin e is helping his beard grow in since there are some patchy areas. There is definitely an improvement. It is easier to comb and tame. Already bought him another bottle! He uses daily and it lasts for a while!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It has a nice scent, I&#x27;d say it smells like s&#x27;mores. The scent is subtle and long-lasting, I&#x27;d find I could still smell it during my shower the day after I applied some. It really made my beard softer and seemed to even out the colors to be more uniform.</li>
            <li> Good scent, not too powerful. Smolder is a good name for it since it reminds me of smoldering wood. A very subtle, yet pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic oil. The scent is there but not at the same time. Many oils go on and it feels like you just put cologne on and you are over powered by the smell for hours. This goes on and after a few minutes you forget you even put it on until you move just right and bang a nice sweet light fresh smell surrounds you then is gone. I can&#x27;t even fully describe what the scent is. It goes on like sweet vanilla and licorice then smooths out into pure harmony with the world. Amazing. Love the stuff the only problem I have is I bought 4 bottles and gave one away to a friend. I want it back. Maybe I&#x27;ll just buy more before the price rockets to the moon because of demand. Everyone will want this or should.</li>
            <li> Great beard oil. Goes on nice and is not greasy feeling. The beard absorbs it very nicely, leaving it feel soft and smooth. The hairs are very manageable after application. The smell of the oils is amazing. It&#x27;s a darker sweet scent that stays with you personally and those you want close. Im ready to order more and to try the new scent &amp;#34;Cinder&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My favorite everyday beard oil.  The scent is great, it&#x27;s hard to explain but it smells much better than beard products that smell like cedar sawdust, the easiest smell for me to discern is a light vanilla or marshmallows.  My beard is short on the sides but longer on the chin and I use this product along with a balm when I really need to shape it but often I can get away with just the oil which is what I prefer.  It does indeed make it softer and combs through it very nice and doesn&#x27;t look oily.  It also helps with the itch.&lt;br /&gt;My wife prefers this over the beard products that make you smell like you slept in a cedar coffin by far.  I purchased their double pack of Smolder &amp; Cinder after using this after just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wasn&#x27;t compensated for my review.  Just a good product.</li>
            <li> Smells great - subtle but masculine. Also helps with chin dander which can be a problem with established beards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard oils, this one might be my favorite. Softens the beard and gets rid of any itch, like most beard oils. But the smell on this one is what really got me. It smells delicious. As another reviewer said, reminds me of toasted marshmallows. It&#x27;s a sweet smell, but still manages to be a masculine scent  that no man would be ashamed wearing. Smells even better than the $25 beard oil I have. It&#x27;s a nice, thick oil, which is good if you have a thicker, hard to tame beard like mine. Not to mention it&#x27;s a fantastic deal! Definitely want to try more oils from these guys!</li>
