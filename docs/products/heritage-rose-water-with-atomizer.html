    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I use it to set my makeup and it work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It is great for removing the residual makeup you might miss when washing and always soothes irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product from Youtube beauty gurus and I am so happy I decided to try it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the 4 oz size which is great to carry in a purse or tote.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s is still great.</li>
            <li>great price..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing with a great scent and is excellent for &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I eventually went to a dermatologist, who prescribed a couple of ointments, but neither worked as well as the Rose Water &amp; Glycerin.  </li>
            <li>Because the bottle is a nice size I keep it in my purse and spritz my face whenever it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When you spritz it goes everywhere, so I have to pour this product into another (effective) spritz bottle.</li>
            <li>It feels really refreshing and it smells good, so hooray for that.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice smell, and my face feels moisturized.</li>
            <li>The atomizer is also really nice -- it creates a fine mist instead of a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And if u love roses and the smell of them u will love this.i use it on the hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li>Love this item for my hair</li>
            <li>I love this.. makes my face nice and smooth...</li>
            <li>ordered 2nd time because I liked the product, very soothing with nice refreshing  rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>Refreshing on a hot day!</li>
            <li>It smells like really cheap perfume and like someone has sprayed A LOT of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic smell....</li>
            <li>It smells strongly of roses, (which I love) but the smell goes away pretty quick.</li>
            <li>it has a fresh scent and is very mild for the scalp.</li>
            <li>love this product so much</li>
            <li>This is the best toner I have ever used for my dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely smells good, but I have not been able to see a marked difference in the tone/health of my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li>mist not only smells amazing</li>
            <li>Product itself is great but the dispenser was broken which makes it extremely challenging to use in the bottle it was delivered in.</li>
            <li>The Heritage Rose Water &amp; Glycerin was the only product that I found that could keep it under control.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a normal rose water user.</li>
            <li>Product arrived timely and seems to be fine thus far...</li>
            <li>I tried another brand when I ran out of the Heritage brand, but it did not seem to work as well and required more applications to achieve the same results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as a morning moisturizer for a month or so, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>I like to spray this on my face after I put on my BB cream or powder, or just when I feel like my face could use some refreshing in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>I also sometimes use it after washing my face and applying moisturizer to bring my skin back to a more neutral</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a positive effect on my skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t notice something like that</li>
            <li>I use this product on my natural african american hair and it is great.</li>
            <li>The reason why I am giving it 1 star is because the bottle cracked way too easily in my bag just shortly after purchasing.</li>
            <li>It really does hydrate well.</li>
            <li>It adds much needed moisture to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really change my skin that much.</li>
            <li>As such, I have gone back to the Rose Water &amp; Glycerin.</li>
            <li>This product is great to put on prior to other facial products.</li>
            <li>Great if you are using expensive products.</li>
            <li>This product has glycerin in it so it feels a tad bit thick (just a little little bit) but sprays very easily and smells lovely!</li>
            <li>I have always like the smell or roses whether it was natural or from a product.</li>
            <li>also soft..</li>
            <li>I acquired a rash on my forehead after a hospital stay and tried several products in an attempt to clear it up.  </li>
            <li>face is extremely dry mainly because of the current winter weather and because I use retinol</li>
            <li>The liquid itself looks pink but sprays on clear.</li>

            <li> This is the best toner I have ever used for my dry, sensitive skin.  I should order this stuff by the case.  It is great for removing the residual makeup you might miss when washing and always soothes irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Product itself is great but the dispenser was broken which makes it extremely challenging to use in the bottle it was delivered in. I had to use a different bottle and was frustrated by this.</li>
            <li> My sister ordered this product and she did not like it.  It was a waste of money because she did not even use it</li>
            <li> I acquired a rash on my forehead after a hospital stay and tried several products in an attempt to clear it up.  The Heritage Rose Water &amp; Glycerin was the only product that I found that could keep it under control.  I tried another brand when I ran out of the Heritage brand, but it did not seem to work as well and required more applications to achieve the same results.  I eventually went to a dermatologist, who prescribed a couple of ointments, but neither worked as well as the Rose Water &amp; Glycerin.  As such, I have gone back to the Rose Water &amp; Glycerin.</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely and seems to be fine thus far...it has a fresh scent and is very mild for the scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as a morning moisturizer for a month or so, and I really like it! I was looking for something &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; to use during the summer, and this does the trick. I have dry/combo skin, and while using this, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the dry patches I often get around my nose and lips. It smells strongly of roses, (which I love) but the smell goes away pretty quick. The atomizer is also really nice -- it creates a fine mist instead of a &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; like some do... I will be repurchasing when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> ❤❤❤❤❤it .....the smell is amazing. And if u love roses and the smell of them u will love this.i use it on the hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to be too watered down. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this stuff. The reason why I am giving it 1 star is because the bottle cracked way too easily in my bag just shortly after purchasing.</li>
            <li> Love this product! especially in the winter when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this product from Youtube beauty gurus and I am so happy I decided to try it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is extremely dry mainly because of the current winter weather and because I use retinol so my skin is constantly peeling.&lt;br /&gt;This mist not only smells amazing but it keeps my face hydrated through the day. I use it when I get out of the shower, as a toner after cleansing my face, and as a setting spray before and after make-up application. Because the bottle is a nice size I keep it in my purse and spritz my face whenever it is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product so much and I have recommended it to many of my friends. I even spray it on my fiances face when he feels dry !</li>
            <li> This product is great to put on prior to other facial products. It will stretch them . Make them last longer. Great if you are using expensive products. Again , use underneath .</li>
            <li> I have always like the smell or roses whether it was natural or from a product. This product has glycerin in it so it feels a tad bit thick (just a little little bit) but sprays very easily and smells lovely! The liquid itself looks pink but sprays on clear. I ordered the 4 oz size which is great to carry in a purse or tote. On the bottle it says it can be used as both a face and body lotion.</li>
            <li> I use this spary as a moisturizer when I have dry spots on my face. It really does hydrate well.</li>
            <li> ordered 2nd time because I liked the product, very soothing with nice refreshing  rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> Refreshing on a hot day!</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of rosewater for years. It&#x27;s refreshing with a great scent and is excellent for &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34; your makeup. I use the plain rosewater in summer and the glycerin in the winter. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my natural african american hair and it is great. It adds much needed moisture to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this product is not good. It smells like really cheap perfume and like someone has sprayed A LOT of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other critique is that this bottle is very poorly made. When you spritz it goes everywhere, so I have to pour this product into another (effective) spritz bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I use it to set my makeup and it work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I used something like this on my daughter in the winter when she was around 2 - she&#x27;s 49 now and it&#x27;s is still great.</li>
            <li> I like to spray this on my face after I put on my BB cream or powder, or just when I feel like my face could use some refreshing in the middle of the day. I think it&#x27;s good for a \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; look. It feels really refreshing and it smells good, so hooray for that. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or sting your eyes or anything like that. I also sometimes use it after washing my face and applying moisturizer to bring my skin back to a more neutral pH. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a positive effect on my skin, but I wouldn&#x27;t notice something like that anyway I think, so don&#x27;t take that as a sign that it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell....great price..</li>
            <li> It has a really nice smell, and my face feels moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product definitely smells good, but I have not been able to see a marked difference in the tone/health of my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This seems to do the trick. I was testing it out. I&#x27;m not a normal rose water user. It didn&#x27;t really change my skin that much. Smells like roses. Arrived leaky.</li>
            <li> Love this item for my hair</li>
            <li> I love this.. makes my face nice and smooth...also soft.. I will buy again.</li>
