            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Love this mouistetizer for 3 yearsÔºÅ</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>The silicone elements make for smooth, velvety skin!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy absorbs fast and smells great.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love love love, totally satisfied customer. :)</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this tan extender in which the smell stays with you for most of the day or nite.</li>
            <li>It is silicone based, so be sure to not use before tanning bed appt, as it will block the rays you are paying to receive.</li>
            <li>Love the silicone in this lotion</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Which I love.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, really great lotion and very hydrating.</li>
            <li>If you, like me, prefer a lighter, softer almost scentless lotion while making you feel sexy in the lotion you&#x27;re wearing, this product should be crossed immediately off your radar.</li>
            <li>Love using this when I get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It has, as most of the tan extenders do, a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>This is a great lotion and the silicone makes your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>This will make not only your skin look and feel good but your tan will hold alot longer!:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also light and refreshing</li>
            <li>, I care that I utilized the words of the consumers saying how great this product smells - and those words were completely untrue.</li>
            <li>I have used MANY after tan extenders and moisturizers and this one is hands down THE BEST!  </li>
            <li>However, the smell is VERY strong - and I think that if it were less potent it would be a sort of pleasant smell - kind of a fruity smell - but it is just so strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very light and clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but thanks to this lovely lotion I was able to retain my tan!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product ... Makes my skin soft silky smooth and the hint of bronzer is amazing!</li>
            <li>It smells great and really does make your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it to be strong or overpowering as some others have suggested...</li>
            <li>Love how this lotion keeps your tan staying nice and even, and the silicon feel makes your skin so soft, I also love the scent of the lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, fresh and clean...</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!  </li>
            <li>It smells good and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li>This will be my 3rd bottle and love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>this product is a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>Smooth,</li>
            <li>Smells great will be back!</li>
            <li>No greasy residue like a lot of lotions, just really smooth and moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s silky smooth</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smooth because of the silicon.</li>
            <li>It feels great, but if you need deeper hydration, add another moisturizer later.</li>
            <li>when applying it right after tanning it made my tan look darker and glow more, and it appeared to extend the life of my tan as well.  </li>
            <li>i would tell anyone the price here is fractional to the price in salons, and its worth it too !</li>
            <li>:) i was kinda weary about buying at first</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and my skin is extremely soft, it&#x27;s not greasy and glides on...</li>
            <li>I love how it has the bronzer in it, really makes your skin feel smooth, but it has a real strong lemon cleaner scent, only downfall, but its not bad once it absorbs.</li>
            <li>she said she wants more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell that it is extending my tan but the moisturizers help, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Soft, silky, smooth skin that feels like I baby&#x27;s bottom with a twinge of bronzer for a sexy glow.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make your skin feel like absolute velvet, it smells great too.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is great and smells amazing, but the lid on mine came broken</li>
            <li>The smell is very citrus and fresh, which goes well with many tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>and I think it would be very beneficial to experienced tanners and lighter skin tones, as it gives your skin the extra boost that it needs afterwards.</li>
            <li>If you truly love the smell of rotten orange peels covering your skin, this most definitely is the product for you.</li>
            <li>Smell is very good too, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion it has a nice clean slightly citrus-y smell</li>
            <li>I believe the marketing in it, is it gets you to use lotion more than you normally would to extend your tan.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel pretty and silky!</li>
            <li>Definitely 5stars love it!</li>
            <li>decided to try it, (why not) designer skin is the same brand that makes luminary, my alllllll time FAVORITE tanner!</li>
            <li>Smells great but a little strong, and really moisturizes without leaving your skin greasy.</li>
            <li>Lotion makes skin feel super soft, love the silicone emulsion.</li>
            <li>As a devoted indoor tanner for many many years, I have always had to contend with dry skin</li>
            <li>Love this product and use it even when not tanning....makes skin soft and helps hold a tan.</li>
            <li>well worth itÔºÅ</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping from the seller!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing enough said getting ready to order another bottle!</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because it smells very strong like a lemon cleaner when you initially put it on</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t tell that it is doing anything different than any other lotion you would use daily except that the smell isn&#x27;t great, and sort of lingers.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure different products work well for some &amp; not others</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s the exact product I wanted.</li>
            <li>This one has a different scent, but I still LOVe the way it maked my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Helps make your tan last longer too :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty over powering coconut and pinapple smell.</li>
            <li>love designer skin...would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>And works really well!  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite and that is the only reason why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li>great product, love the silicon base makes your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>U just need to use just a little bit not a whole lot plus its an awesome moisturizer too</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of the original Black tanning lotion, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve certainly tried A LOT in my years tanning</li>
            <li>It smells amazing; I&#x27;m normally not a huge fan of Designer Skin&#x27;s scents, but I really like this one.</li>
            <li>skin doesn&#x27;t really feel moisturized</li>
            <li>much</li>
            <li>works really well when applied, would order this product again, and i would recommend it.it&#x27;s every thing i heard it was.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fabulous except the silicone isn&#x27;t actually hydrating.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as when I have bought in dal although reasonable fast shipping get what pay for</li>
            <li>This is very silky and smells like lemons.</li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and is very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>There is not a better lotion out there, worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>and I still look super dark like I tan everyday, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I am not sure about how well this extends the life of my tan - it does give your skin a nice feel and glow.  </li>
            <li>I have a full bottle left</li>
            <li>Designer skin products  have always been a favorite, and they didn&#x27;t let me down with this new one I tried!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel a little pampered :)</li>
            <li>&amp; the pricing was VERY reasonable it was shipped quickly arriving well before my other tanning supplies.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it not only extends my tan, but if I got a little red in the tanning bed, if I lather it on a few times that day, by the next day I&#x27;m nice and brown :)</li>
            <li>so do your research &amp; even contact the seller if you have questions I found them to be very knowledgable &amp; professional</li>
            <li>The smell, for me, got old extremely fast, and now I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing &amp; the bottles pretty big.</li>
            <li>It is colored going on, so be sure it is dry before wearing white.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also, makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer has a tent to it that leaves you dark and smooth.</li>
            <li>but is a little too strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It dispenses easily and goes on silly smooth, with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I buy this lotion from tanning salons and from Amazon at least every 3 months and have for many years.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to cover body, so don&#x27;t overdo, and it will last longer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li>It also came to me a day early (:</li>
            <li>It does not moisturize your skin and as far as extending your tan, I don&#x27;t see that either.</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money.</li>
            <li>Information directly from tanning salon.</li>
            <li>we no missing parts or products.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this lotion.</li>
            <li>No other lotion compares!</li>
            <li>I have never before had such a rich, dark tan in my life.</li>
            <li>Truth is, if you just use normal lotion regularly, it will extend your tan without the price, and without the smell.</li>
            <li>and I noticed my legs became dry fast.</li>
            <li>left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot</li>
            <li>I use black bronzer to tan and this extender right after</li>
            <li>this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft all day while giving it an extra boost of bronze coloring.</li>
            <li>old, fair-skinned blonde).</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel extra supple and soft.</li>
            <li>minus two pumps to sell if anyone wants to buy them from me.</li>
            <li>Not to impressed with this :(( not very moisturizing ...</li>
            <li>Two thumbs way down, I actually have a new bottle and a new bottle</li>
            <li>Recieved in an orderly fashion but, was very seperated so obviously supplier was dumping old product tried to get it to mix up so could be used but just a waste of time.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast, but the product was not worth it.</li>
            <li>it made my skin feel moisturized and soft for a long time after applying.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their tan dark without having to go tan everyday.</li>

            <li> Price is much better than salon.</li>
            <li> I have used the Designer Skin products for years and absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Have just begun using this tan extender, but I love the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> I do not tan any longer, but I still use this lotion because it makes my skin look so much better.</li>

            <li> There are many better moisturizers out there that are way cheaper and work much better.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin very silky feeling.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love putting it on after my tanning session.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it every day.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Love this mouistetizer for 3 yearsÔºÅ</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> The silicone elements make for smooth, velvety skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy absorbs fast and smells great.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Love love love, totally satisfied customer. :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this tan extender in which the smell stays with you for most of the day or nite.</li>
            <li> It is silicone based, so be sure to not use before tanning bed appt, as it will block the rays you are paying to receive.</li>
            <li> Love the silicone in this lotion</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Which I love.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, really great lotion and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> If you, like me, prefer a lighter, softer almost scentless lotion while making you feel sexy in the lotion you&#x27;re wearing, this product should be crossed immediately off your radar.</li>
            <li> Love using this when I get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It has, as most of the tan extenders do, a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and the silicone makes your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> This will make not only your skin look and feel good but your tan will hold alot longer!:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also light and refreshing</li>
            <li> , I care that I utilized the words of the consumers saying how great this product smells - and those words were completely untrue.</li>
            <li> I have used MANY after tan extenders and moisturizers and this one is hands down THE BEST!  </li>
            <li> However, the smell is VERY strong - and I think that if it were less potent it would be a sort of pleasant smell - kind of a fruity smell - but it is just so strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very light and clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but thanks to this lovely lotion I was able to retain my tan!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product ... Makes my skin soft silky smooth and the hint of bronzer is amazing!</li>
            <li> It smells great and really does make your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be strong or overpowering as some others have suggested...</li>
            <li> Love how this lotion keeps your tan staying nice and even, and the silicon feel makes your skin so soft, I also love the scent of the lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, fresh and clean...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!  </li>
            <li> It smells good and my skin feels so soft!</li>
            <li> This will be my 3rd bottle and love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> this product is a bit cheap.</li>
            <li> Smooth,</li>
            <li> Smells great will be back!</li>
            <li> No greasy residue like a lot of lotions, just really smooth and moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s silky smooth</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth because of the silicon.</li>
            <li> It feels great, but if you need deeper hydration, add another moisturizer later.</li>
            <li> when applying it right after tanning it made my tan look darker and glow more, and it appeared to extend the life of my tan as well.  </li>
            <li> i would tell anyone the price here is fractional to the price in salons, and its worth it too !</li>
            <li> :) i was kinda weary about buying at first</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and my skin is extremely soft, it&#x27;s not greasy and glides on...</li>
            <li> I love how it has the bronzer in it, really makes your skin feel smooth, but it has a real strong lemon cleaner scent, only downfall, but its not bad once it absorbs.</li>
            <li> she said she wants more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell that it is extending my tan but the moisturizers help, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Soft, silky, smooth skin that feels like I baby&#x27;s bottom with a twinge of bronzer for a sexy glow.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make your skin feel like absolute velvet, it smells great too.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is great and smells amazing, but the lid on mine came broken</li>
            <li> The smell is very citrus and fresh, which goes well with many tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> and I think it would be very beneficial to experienced tanners and lighter skin tones, as it gives your skin the extra boost that it needs afterwards.</li>
            <li> If you truly love the smell of rotten orange peels covering your skin, this most definitely is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Smell is very good too, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it has a nice clean slightly citrus-y smell</li>
            <li> I believe the marketing in it, is it gets you to use lotion more than you normally would to extend your tan.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel pretty and silky!</li>
            <li> Definitely 5stars love it!</li>
            <li> decided to try it, (why not) designer skin is the same brand that makes luminary, my alllllll time FAVORITE tanner!</li>
            <li> Smells great but a little strong, and really moisturizes without leaving your skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Lotion makes skin feel super soft, love the silicone emulsion.</li>
            <li> As a devoted indoor tanner for many many years, I have always had to contend with dry skin</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it even when not tanning....makes skin soft and helps hold a tan.</li>
            <li> well worth itÔºÅ</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping from the seller!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing enough said getting ready to order another bottle!</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it smells very strong like a lemon cleaner when you initially put it on</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell that it is doing anything different than any other lotion you would use daily except that the smell isn&#x27;t great, and sort of lingers.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure different products work well for some &amp; not others</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s the exact product I wanted.</li>
            <li> This one has a different scent, but I still LOVe the way it maked my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Helps make your tan last longer too :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty over powering coconut and pinapple smell.</li>
            <li> love designer skin...would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> And works really well!  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite and that is the only reason why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> great product, love the silicon base makes your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> U just need to use just a little bit not a whole lot plus its an awesome moisturizer too</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of the original Black tanning lotion, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly tried A LOT in my years tanning</li>
            <li> It smells amazing; I&#x27;m normally not a huge fan of Designer Skin&#x27;s scents, but I really like this one.</li>
            <li> skin doesn&#x27;t really feel moisturized</li>
            <li> much</li>
            <li> works really well when applied, would order this product again, and i would recommend it.it&#x27;s every thing i heard it was.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fabulous except the silicone isn&#x27;t actually hydrating.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as when I have bought in dal although reasonable fast shipping get what pay for</li>
            <li> This is very silky and smells like lemons.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and is very satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> There is not a better lotion out there, worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> and I still look super dark like I tan everyday, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about how well this extends the life of my tan - it does give your skin a nice feel and glow.  </li>
            <li> I have a full bottle left</li>
            <li> Designer skin products  have always been a favorite, and they didn&#x27;t let me down with this new one I tried!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel a little pampered :)</li>
            <li> &amp; the pricing was VERY reasonable it was shipped quickly arriving well before my other tanning supplies.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it not only extends my tan, but if I got a little red in the tanning bed, if I lather it on a few times that day, by the next day I&#x27;m nice and brown :)</li>
            <li> so do your research &amp; even contact the seller if you have questions I found them to be very knowledgable &amp; professional</li>
            <li> The smell, for me, got old extremely fast, and now I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing &amp; the bottles pretty big.</li>
            <li> It is colored going on, so be sure it is dry before wearing white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Also, makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer has a tent to it that leaves you dark and smooth.</li>
            <li> but is a little too strong in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It dispenses easily and goes on silly smooth, with no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion from tanning salons and from Amazon at least every 3 months and have for many years.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to cover body, so don&#x27;t overdo, and it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft it makes your skin.</li>
            <li> It also came to me a day early (:</li>
            <li> It does not moisturize your skin and as far as extending your tan, I don&#x27;t see that either.</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money.</li>
            <li> Information directly from tanning salon.</li>
            <li> we no missing parts or products.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this lotion.</li>
            <li> No other lotion compares!</li>
            <li> I have never before had such a rich, dark tan in my life.</li>
            <li> Truth is, if you just use normal lotion regularly, it will extend your tan without the price, and without the smell.</li>
            <li> and I noticed my legs became dry fast.</li>
            <li> left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot</li>
            <li> I use black bronzer to tan and this extender right after</li>
            <li> this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft all day while giving it an extra boost of bronze coloring.</li>
            <li> old, fair-skinned blonde).</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel extra supple and soft.</li>
            <li> minus two pumps to sell if anyone wants to buy them from me.</li>
            <li> Not to impressed with this :(( not very moisturizing ...</li>
            <li> Two thumbs way down, I actually have a new bottle and a new bottle</li>
            <li> Recieved in an orderly fashion but, was very seperated so obviously supplier was dumping old product tried to get it to mix up so could be used but just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, but the product was not worth it.</li>
            <li> it made my skin feel moisturized and soft for a long time after applying.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their tan dark without having to go tan everyday.</li>
            <li> &quot; Black, as they smell the same, instead of using it after something with a complete opposite smell but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to know if it actually works on extending the life of my tan or not.</li>
            <li> Works well but still do not love it as much as Enamor, which I understand Designer Skin has discontinued...  </li>
            <li> I will see how long it takes for the smell to lesson.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning every other day up until week before last which was the week before I went on vacation.</li>
            <li> other then that I would definitely recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> its the greatestÔºÅ for lines wrinkles dry skin length of tan everythingÔºÅ</li>
            <li> My skin is rarely dry now and it seems to hold the tan</li>
            <li> , every single tan.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, so I am not sure how well it extends my tan, but I don&#x27;t seem to be fading any between tanning visits so far.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on the smell and people can&#x27;t believe how dark I still am (I&#x27;m italian</li>
            <li> my only hope was that Black Tan Extender would help.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use lotion over it, but I have very dry skin...</li>
            <li> Which highly sucks since I have to open the whole thing up even if I just want a small amount.</li>
            <li> I am 62 and outside almost everyday.</li>
            <li> ......I thought it did, the name of it is misleading...absorbs very quickly not very moisturizing though...</li>
            <li> Its not real greasy, but feels silky on my skin.</li>
            <li> I planned to go everyday that week but only got to go Tuesday &amp; Wednesday due to migraines.</li>
            <li> other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> So after reading other reviews about this product I decided to buy not one but two bottles (to have one in stock...)</li>
            <li> The silicone base makes it so easy to apply and it lasts a long time too!  </li>
            <li> Instead, it contains black walnut extract, among other ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m as dark as I have ever been in 4 months of tanning.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money - and not too expensive either!</li>
            <li> Skin Black 20X bronzer tanning lotion</li>
            <li> The Black Tan Extender makes my skin glow and feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Skin Black 20X bronzer tanning lotion and the Black Tan Extender together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already black</li>
            <li> A recommendation from me is using a HEMPZ moisturizer or LUMINOUS under the BLACK to provide the hydration your skin needs.</li>
            <li> in fact, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it smelled a little stronger and the scent lasted longer.</li>
            <li> and it was a bad bottle, this is rare.</li>
            <li> Buy it year round.</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated it four stars is because the  bottle it came in, the pump was broken.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with the silicone base - that makes my skin feel SOOO smooth.</li>
            <li> Plus, not a huge fan of the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way thanks to the silicone base.</li>
            <li> Was hard to hunt down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the bottle that I received, but the lotion clumps up on the skin and looks like dead skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure - I may return it.  </li>
            <li> Smell is horrible could not even use it more than twice</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I woud recommend to anyone for everyday use!!</li>
            <li> It smells a little weird though.</li>
            <li> The smell is not good.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately have cystic fibrosis and am sick and on bed rest, it&#x27;s been three weeks now that I haven&#x27;t tanned and have been using this as my everyday lotion for after the shower and just regular lotion</li>
            <li> Someone said in a review that their&#x27;s had a bad smell, again, had to be a bad bottle and is rare.</li>
            <li> the pump was broken, so I had to use it by removing the lid.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t throw them away, that would make my garbage smell worse.</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously rocks!</li>
            <li> This company discountinued the silicone emulsion lotion I used to buy (so sad) .</li>
            <li> Not to mention it keeps your skin from drying out and appearing \\&quot;used\\&quot; or like you \\&quot;just got out of the tanning bed\\&quot; or have been \\&quot;fake tanning\\&quot;</li>
            <li> But I took it on a plane with me and the pressure made it chunk up all weird, so buy it, but don&#x27;t take it on air travel.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell is very unappealing.</li>
            <li> a few others mentioned on their reviews, the pump on my bottle was broken, making it very annoying</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t awful and it seems to moisturize for a few hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels good...smells bad.</li>
            <li> Not too bad.</li>
            <li> I was sick</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> I work as a tanning consultant and I am disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Has a silicone base</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I received my product in a timely manner, however the pump was broke on the bottle when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Feels good...smells bad.</li>
            <li> Good color from the lotion, very silky, smells good! Great after tanning care and even every day color. Would reccommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it even when not tanning....makes skin soft and helps hold a tan. Price is much better than salon.</li>
            <li> love this product it works amazingly</li>
            <li> I use this lotion on the days when I don&#x27;t plan on going tanning. It smells great and really does make your skin super smooth. And you get a LOT of it also.</li>
            <li> I have used the Designer Skin products for years and absolutely love them. There is not a better lotion out there, worth every penny and more. Leaves your skin silky and lasts all day. I have seen complaints about the lotion being lumpy, I have bought a bottle like that before and it was a bad bottle, this is rare. Someone said in a review that their&#x27;s had a bad smell, again, had to be a bad bottle and is rare. I buy this lotion from tanning salons and from Amazon at least every 3 months and have for many years. I ask family to buy me this for birthdays, Christmas and Mother&#x27;s Day. It is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for someone else, she loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells great but a little strong, and really moisturizes without leaving your skin greasy. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Have just begun using this tan extender, but I love the way it goes on. The smell is good, also!  I am 62 and outside almost everyday. Doesn&#x27;t take much of this product to cover body, so don&#x27;t overdo, and it will last longer. Guess I will find out how well it extends a tan the longer I use it. Appreciate the fast Great service, too! A+</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. I can&#x27;t believe how soft it makes your skin. I wish I could buy it by the gallon!!!</li>
            <li> would probably pick a different tan extender next time. this product is a bit cheap. skin doesn&#x27;t really feel moisturized and I noticed my legs became dry fast.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing enough said getting ready to order another bottle!</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion as an after tanning product. I do not tan any longer, but I still use this lotion because it makes my skin look so much better. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product soley on reviews and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I got this lotion! I gave 4 stars because it smells very strong like a lemon cleaner when you initially put it on but once that fades a bit it smells good! Soft, silky, smooth skin that feels like I baby&#x27;s bottom with a twinge of bronzer for a sexy glow. Has made my tan remain even when I can&#x27;t get to the salon! love it!</li>
            <li> this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft all day while giving it an extra boost of bronze coloring. It also smells really good! Designer skin products  have always been a favorite, and they didn&#x27;t let me down with this new one I tried!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion it has a nice clean slightly citrus-y smell but the feel is awesome very light but hydrating &amp; it really helps to prolong your tan. I have been tanning every other day up until week before last which was the week before I went on vacation. I planned to go everyday that week but only got to go Tuesday &amp; Wednesday due to migraines. Since I could not visit the bed to get my desired color my only hope was that Black Tan Extender would help. I used it diligently even on the days I was sick my friend helped me apply it. So I ended up not getting to tan Thursday - Sunday &amp; Monday we left for the beach after lunch so I got no sun that day either but thanks to this lovely lotion I was able to retain my tan! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep their tan dark without having to go tan everyday. &amp; the pricing was VERY reasonable it was shipped quickly arriving well before my other tanning supplies. It feels wonderful, has anti aging properties &amp; even diminished the appearance of my cellulite. &amp; y&#x27;all ain&#x27;t gonna believe this but it actually made my breasts perkier! A couple of my friends even asked me igf I had a breast lift!!! I&#x27;ll take that as a compliment any day of the week! But I&#x27;m sure different products work well for some &amp; not others so do your research &amp; even contact the seller if you have questions I found them to be very knowledgable &amp; professional they returned my email within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Lotion makes skin feel super soft, love the silicone emulsion. This lotion also gives a hint of a sunless tan so it gives your skin a beautiful bronze glow.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this lotion. That&#x27;s why I was so disappointed once I got it. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the bottle that I received, but the lotion clumps up on the skin and looks like dead skin. Also, the smell is very unappealing. I would not buy this again. There are many better moisturizers out there that are way cheaper and work much better.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It smells great and leaves my skin very silky feeling. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve been using it long enough to know if it actually works on extending the life of my tan or not.</li>
            <li> Recently, my tanning salon offered a sample of this lotion for clients to try after they tanned. It was wonderful, but I couldn&#x27;t see spending the $40 price tag they were asking. Low and behold, here it is on Amazon for $24... that I can justify spending! I have been using the Designer Skin Black 20X bronzer tanning lotion before I tan, and I have never before had such a rich, dark tan in my life. (I am a 38 yr. old, fair-skinned blonde). The Black Tan Extender makes my skin glow and feel like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I haven&#x27;t been using it very long, so I am not sure how well it extends my tan, but I don&#x27;t seem to be fading any between tanning visits so far. A little goes a very long way thanks to the silicone base. The smell is amazing, fresh and clean... I love it.  I recommend you buy the Designer Skin Black 20X bronzer tanning lotion and the Black Tan Extender together. They have worked wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li> Great lotion! Goes on very nicely and leaves my skin feeling great! Helps maintain a hint of color and doesn&#x27;t stink the way some lotions with self tanner do!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this extends a tan or not but it smells very nice and the feel of it is awesome. I love putting it on after my tanning session. It makes me feel pretty and silky! I don&#x27;t find it to be strong or overpowering as some others have suggested...in fact, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it smelled a little stronger and the scent lasted longer. I think probably any moisturizer after a tanning session will help extend it but I do like this. It makes me feel a little pampered :)</li>
            <li> This will be my 3rd bottle and love, love, love it!  The smell is amazing and my skin is extremely soft, it&#x27;s not greasy and glides on...the best part is the effect lasts all day.  Not to mention, I&#x27;ve noticed it does what it claims and my tan seems to last longer.</li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin even softer than I ever imagined. I grab this lotion every morning instead of my regular lotion because of the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion. Very moisturizing &amp; the bottles pretty big. It smells a little weird though. Not too bad. Kinda like pledge or something.   I would probably buy it again. It also came to me a day early (:</li>
            <li> Excellent product arrived early! And it&#x27;s the exact product I wanted.</li>
            <li> Recieved in an orderly fashion but, was very seperated so obviously supplier was dumping old product tried to get it to mix up so could be used but just a waste of time. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly,great product!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!  Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing. I dont feel like it helps keep my tan much but it smells good and makes my skin feel amazing!</li>
            <li> This company discountinued the silicone emulsion lotion I used to buy (so sad) . This one has a different scent, but I still LOVe the way it maked my skin feel. Unbeatable softness!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and smooth. Love this product and use it every day. Buy it year round. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I have been tanning and also using the sunless tan - I wanted to get something to extend the life of my tan - without paying $50 a bottle at the tanning salon.  I am not sure about how well this extends the life of my tan - it does give your skin a nice feel and glow.  However, the smell is VERY strong - and I think that if it were less potent it would be a sort of pleasant smell - kind of a fruity smell - but it is just so strong.  I am not sure - I may return it.  I will see how long it takes for the smell to lesson.</li>
            <li> When I got it the pump was broke. The smell is not good. I used it a couple times and it now is just taking up space on my dresser. Save yourself the money. Well not every order this again...yuck!</li>
            <li> works really well when applied, would order this product again, and i would recommend it.it&#x27;s every thing i heard it was.</li>
            <li> this is a great price for good tanning lotion. after tan extender smells great. bought for my daughter and she loves it. she said she wants more.</li>
            <li> I love how it has the bronzer in it, really makes your skin feel smooth, but it has a real strong lemon cleaner scent, only downfall, but its not bad once it absorbs.</li>
            <li> this lotion has a silky, smooth consistency when you apply it because of the silicone which feels great on the skin. it made my skin feel moisturized and soft for a long time after applying.  it also has a nice caramel color to it so it gives skin a glow and makes your tan appear to stand out. It has a citrus scent that smells okay but is a little too strong in my opinion. when applying it right after tanning it made my tan look darker and glow more, and it appeared to extend the life of my tan as well.  also the bottle is a generous size so it lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;Like a few others mentioned on their reviews, the pump on my bottle was broken, making it very annoying get the product out of the bottle, and that&#x27;s why I gave it only 4 stars. other then that I would definitely recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love this mouistetizer for 3 yearsÔºÅ its the greatestÔºÅ for lines wrinkles dry skin length of tan everythingÔºÅ well worth itÔºÅ</li>
            <li> Great brown color.  This is my go to when I want a deeper color...</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I have been using it for at least 3 years now. The best!  Smooth, no staining of clothes, smells great and really helps prolong my tan!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is amazing! The silicone elements make for smooth, velvety skin! Highly recommend this product! Helps make your tan last longer too :)</li>
            <li> It smells great and feels great in your skin! Would definitely but it again. Does not feel greasy at all</li>
            <li> Great body lotion, feels and smells good and extend tan.</li>
            <li> Smells great will be back! üëçüèº</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion and the silicone makes your skin very soft.  It has, as most of the tan extenders do, a strong smell.  It&#x27;s not as tropical smelling as the Snookie extender but it was noticed by one of my coworkers after hours of having put it on.  I try to use it at night before I put on long-sleeved pjs so I don&#x27;t have to smell it.  But as a lotion, it is very good.  I can&#x27;t really tell that it is extending my tan but the moisturizers help, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Not to impressed with this :(( not very moisturizing ...</li>
            <li> the pump was broken, so I had to use it by removing the lid.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Not only does it make your skin feel like absolute velvet, it smells great too. I would definitely recommend it and would purchase it again myself.</li>
            <li> ......I thought it did, the name of it is misleading...absorbs very quickly not very moisturizing though...I wanted something different. I will try something different</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer! Has a silicone base so it goes on great, the scent is refreshing and light. I have used it off and on for quite some time and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and my 3 tans I&#x27;ve had are holding very nicely! The scent isn&#x27;t awful and it seems to moisturize for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> Love how this lotion keeps your tan staying nice and even, and the silicon feel makes your skin so soft, I also love the scent of the lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is great and smells amazing, but the lid on mine came broken that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast, but the product was not worth it. It does not moisturize your skin and as far as extending your tan, I don&#x27;t see that either. I would not waste my money.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product !!</li>
            <li> Definitely 5stars love it!</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel like silk and it locks in moisture to seal in the lotions and save your skin</li>
            <li> Works well but still do not love it as much as Enamor, which I understand Designer Skin has discontinued...  Plus, not a huge fan of the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> This is a self-tanner not a tan extender.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! It smells amazing; I&#x27;m normally not a huge fan of Designer Skin&#x27;s scents, but I really like this one. It melts into your skin and feels awesome. No greasy residue like a lot of lotions, just really smooth and moisturized skin. Will definitely get it again!</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 this smells awesome!!! feels good and has helped my tan stay longer and look more glowing then ever highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My tan feels like it has lasted longer</li>
            <li> great product, love the silicon base makes your skin super smooth. Makes Versa spray tan last longer too</li>
            <li> it is a nice addition to any after shower routine.  i dont use all the time but it works well and feel great on the skin. i would tell anyone the price here is fractional to the price in salons, and its worth it too !</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! I have used this item for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m as dark as I have ever been in 4 months of tanning. The moisturizer has a tent to it that leaves you dark and smooth. Make sure you rub it in really good tho. I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. Its not real greasy, but feels silky on my skin. Love, love it! Try it. Its great!!</li>
            <li> Smell is horrible could not even use it more than twice I would recommend a refund considerin I have a full bottle left</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my skin. Non-greasy absorbs fast and smells great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty over powering coconut and pinapple smell. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as other products I&#x27;ve used.  I use it as a back up.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. Was hard to hunt down. This lotion leaves your skin feeling like silk!!! And the added color spreads on evenly</li>
            <li> I used this as soon as I got it and now I&#x27;m hooked! It dispenses easily and goes on silly smooth, with no greasy feeling. This worked great as an after-shaving lotion, too. The smell is very citrus and fresh, which goes well with many tanning lotions. Highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I use black bronzer to tan and this extender right after and I love it I&#x27;m already black and it&#x27;s April it rocks!</li>
            <li> I use this after my tan and after my next shower after my tan...seems to keep my skin moisturized and help my tan last longer...I sometimes use lotion over it, but I have very dry skin...</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this lotion! I&#x27;m a regular tanner (work at a tanning salon) and unfortunately have cystic fibrosis and am sick and on bed rest, it&#x27;s been three weeks now that I haven&#x27;t tanned and have been using this as my everyday lotion for after the shower and just regular lotion and I still look super dark like I tan everyday, and it smells amazing! I always get compliments on the smell and people can&#x27;t believe how dark I still am (I&#x27;m italian too so that helps but my color still fades a bit after not being in the tanning bed for awhile) but this stuff is awesome!! I woud recommend to anyone for everyday use!! This stuff is amazing! Love love love, totally satisfied customer. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff seriously rocks! i&#x27;ve bene tanning 5+ years and never heard about a tan extender! decided to try it, (why not) designer skin is the same brand that makes luminary, my alllllll time FAVORITE tanner! so this is just the perf compliment. :) i was kinda weary about buying at first but so glad i did! its perf to use inbetween tannings as well.. keeps me nice brown and healthy looking!</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells good and my skin feels so soft! I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my color staying longer too!</li>
            <li> Great lotion...goes on so smooth...improved my tan...love designer skin...would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product ... Makes my skin soft silky smooth and the hint of bronzer is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used MANY after tan extenders and moisturizers and this one is hands down THE BEST!  The color of bronzer is AMAZING and it&#x27;s silky smooth and I think it smells GREAT! It&#x27;s probably the best smelling when you use it with it&#x27;s \\&quot;sister tan lotion\\&quot; Black, as they smell the same, instead of using it after something with a complete opposite smell but regardless, it geta the job done! If you use it with something of an opposite smell, you can always plan your tanning sessions at the end of the day so you can shower or bathe a lil while after you tan to get the smell off. But for someone who&#x27;s been tanning over 16 years and has the type of skin tone everyone aims for, trust me on this purchase! I&#x27;ve certainly tried A LOT in my years tanning and I think it would be very beneficial to experienced tanners and lighter skin tones, as it gives your skin the extra boost that it needs afterwards. Not to mention it keeps your skin from drying out and appearing \\&quot;used\\&quot; or like you \\&quot;just got out of the tanning bed\\&quot; or have been \\&quot;fake tanning\\&quot; ;)</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth because of the silicon. I had tried it from the tanning shop, and I loved it. So convenient to get it sent to my home.</li>
            <li> As a devoted indoor tanner for many many years, I have always had to contend with dry skin so I thought I would try this product. So far so good! My skin is rarely dry now and it seems to hold the tan so I dont have to go as often to the tanning booth.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this tan extender in which the smell stays with you for most of the day or nite. U just need to use just a little bit not a whole lot plus its an awesome moisturizer too and it makes your skin feel like silk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for quite some time, and it is a great tan extender. It is not a self tanner, as this contains no DHA. Instead, it contains black walnut extract, among other ingredients. It is colored going on, so be sure it is dry before wearing white. It feels great, but if you need deeper hydration, add another moisturizer later. It is silicone based, so be sure to not use before tanning bed appt, as it will block the rays you are paying to receive. Information directly from tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Excellent tanning lotion. Extends your deep tan for weeks. Makes your skin feel extra supple and soft. Smell is very good too, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I work as a tanning consultant and I am disappointed with this product. The fragrance is fabulous except the silicone isn&#x27;t actually hydrating. The silicone is what makes your skin feel great.  A recommendation from me is using a HEMPZ moisturizer or LUMINOUS under the BLACK to provide the hydration your skin needs. This will make not only your skin look and feel good but your tan will hold alot longer!:)</li>
            <li> Love the silicone in this lotion It feels so nice on my skin after tanning</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t tell that it is doing anything different than any other lotion you would use daily except that the smell isn&#x27;t great, and sort of lingers. I believe the marketing in it, is it gets you to use lotion more than you normally would to extend your tan. Truth is, if you just use normal lotion regularly, it will extend your tan without the price, and without the smell.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent tan extender. The silicone makes it very easy to put on. The smell, for me, got old extremely fast, and now I can&#x27;t stand it. If you like the smell of the original Black tanning lotion, then you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good results with this product.</li>
            <li> Received so many compliments on how nice my tan was after using the extender.  Also, makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> And works really well!  I love this product.  I use it after I tan, every single tan.  Even if it is outside.  The only downside is that it definitely smells like you went tanning.... Although someone told me that I smelled like vacation!</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time about my tan.  This lotion keeps my tan intact and I love it</li>
            <li> This product is a great conditioner for after-tanned skin! But I took it on a plane with me and the pressure made it chunk up all weird, so buy it, but don&#x27;t take it on air travel.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this lotion since Suntan City and local tanning beds stopped carrying it. The feel and smell is incredible! No other lotion compares!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it not only extends my tan, but if I got a little red in the tanning bed, if I lather it on a few times that day, by the next day I&#x27;m nice and brown :)</li>
            <li> left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot so I applied morining and night. I could tell a difference in my skin after only 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as when I have bought in dal although reasonable fast shipping get what pay for I guess</li>
            <li> This is very silky and smells like lemons. Which I love. The only reason I rated it four stars is because the  bottle it came in, the pump was broken. Which highly sucks since I have to open the whole thing up even if I just want a small amount. Hopefully the next bottle wont be like that. Otherwise, really great lotion and very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Has the silicone emulsion thing going on so it leaves your skin nice and silky. It&#x27;s also light and refreshing so it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for summertime. It doesn&#x27;t have any extras to &#x27;tighten&#x27; the skin or claims to have any &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; effects which would be a bonus.</li>
            <li> Since my beloved Enamor lotion is out of stock or discontinued I needed to find a replacement.. I wanted something with the silicone base - that makes my skin feel SOOO smooth. So after reading other reviews about this product I decided to buy not one but two bottles (to have one in stock...) DUMBEST decision ever. I don&#x27;t care that I bought two, I care that I utilized the words of the consumers saying how great this product smells - and those words were completely untrue. If you truly love the smell of rotten orange peels covering your skin, this most definitely is the product for you. If you, like me, prefer a lighter, softer almost scentless lotion while making you feel sexy in the lotion you&#x27;re wearing, this product should be crossed immediately off your radar. Two thumbs way down, I actually have a new bottle and a new bottle minus two pumps to sell if anyone wants to buy them from me. Can&#x27;t throw them away, that would make my garbage smell worse.</li>
            <li> Love using this when I get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> great product! Super fast shipping from the seller!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite and that is the only reason why I gave it four stars. Works really well and a great tan extender!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  The silicone base makes it so easy to apply and it lasts a long time too!  Definitely worth the money - and not too expensive either!</li>
            <li> I made a mistake earlier when I submitted a review.  This product arrived on time and is very satisfactory.  Thjere we no missing parts or products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand of lotion years ago at a tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;It is wonderful. Not greasy and makes your skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;It is very light and clean fragrance.  Costs 3 times as much&lt;br /&gt;at a tanning salon as it does on Amazon.</li>
