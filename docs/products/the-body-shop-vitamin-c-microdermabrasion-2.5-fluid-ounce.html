            <li>This stuff smells amazing &amp; makes my skin feel soo smooth.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure.</li>
            <li>The directions say not to use it more than twice a week</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face scrub.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel fresher and look a tad more radiant...but not like it used to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with this product</li>
            <li>but I was concerned about it becoming more noticeable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if you are looking for fine granules.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and love how smooth my skin feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>i will not re-order this product again because it is too fine for my use.  </li>
            <li>The particles are easy on your skin and my skin feels so smooth and moist afterwards, not taught like some scrubs.</li>
            <li>- my cheeks felt so smooth, my nose wasn&#x27;t so oily, and the milia are noticeably diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then once a month, I only use it now once in a while when I need a good strong face scrub and am prepared to deal with a breakout.</li>
            <li>I originally used it once a week</li>
            <li>I purchased this a week ago and am very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much and used it for around 7 years</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, you can really see a noticeable difference after you use it.</li>
            <li>I still love it because with continuous use it can keep the skin in good shape regarding cleaned pores and dead cells.</li>
            <li>I got this because I wanted to incorporate more Vitamin C into my facial cleansing, and I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>this product is super.</li>
            <li>It has camu camu powder in it, which is apparently a huge source of vitamin C. (I find that vitamin C really helps my trouble-prone skin.)</li>
            <li>Using this once or twice a week makes my skin feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This also contains silicon-based abrasives and contains a silicone as well as some preservatives, so watch out for that if you&#x27;re avoiding certain ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is in general have tiny beads in smooth cream that gently exfoliate the skin of the face and reveal brighter skin.</li>
            <li>It also contains artificial fragrance, although I find the scent light and pleasant and, so far, non-irritating.</li>
            <li>think this is helping get rid of dead skin cells and keeping my facial skin looking nice.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow the directions and if you have sensitive skin (I do) maybe do a small test first before covering your entire face with it?</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and fighting that aging process.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my cheeks felt after using it.</li>
            <li>can see the full ingredients list on the product page if you scroll down.</li>
            <li>The beads are very small yet very exfoliating, and my face always feels so soft and smooth when I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>When Spring/Summer begin, I will use just a bit of this daily for one week, and my skin is soft and glows!  </li>
            <li>skin has usually been pretty clear</li>
            <li>This is a decent product, but the fluid once is way too small as well as goes too fast for me to even know???</li>
            <li>I like this better than some of the other Body Shop skincare products I&#x27;ve tried lately.</li>
            <li>This does not leave any oil or residue on my skin and my skin feels pretty resilient after using this for a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>

            <li> It seems to be visibly smoother as well, after having used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and this product is a little too abrasive for my skin, usually causing me to break out.</li>
            <li> not sure if company change the formula or something.</li>
            <li> I struggle with dull skin, and this helps a lot!</li>

            <li> This is a decent product, but the fluid once is way too small as well as goes too fast for me to even know???</li>
            <li> I like this better than some of the other Body Shop skincare products I&#x27;ve tried lately. I&#x27;ve been trying to do a lot of exfoliation because of some skin troubles, and I definitely think this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this twice a week. I&#x27;m gentle as I scrub my face with it because it would be a little rough if you had a heavy hand. After cleansing (usually in the shower), I apply a bit of this to my fingers and massage it gently over my face. I then rinse it off and I&#x27;m done. (When I get out of the shower I use toner, serum, moisturizer, etc., as usual.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is helping get rid of dead skin cells and keeping my facial skin looking nice. It has camu camu powder in it, which is apparently a huge source of vitamin C. (I find that vitamin C really helps my trouble-prone skin.) This also contains silicon-based abrasives and contains a silicone as well as some preservatives, so watch out for that if you&#x27;re avoiding certain ingredients.

I&#x27;ve had pretty good results with this product so I&#x27;m going to continue using it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything with micro dermabrasion plus vitamin C. Sware this is the best</li>
            <li> This is awesome. At first I was skeptical trying it out at the store. It has the perfect amount of &#x27;scrub&#x27; to it. I use it every other day and I won&#x27;t go without this product as part of my face washing routine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with oily, acne prone skin. My face feels very smooth and refined after using this product. I am very happy with this product and the service.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and fighting that aging process.  Using this once or twice a week makes my skin feel smooth and soft.  I am on my second tube and will keep using it.  You may think it is expensive, but it lasts a long time and is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much and used it for around 7 years (I used the face cleanser from same line for 9 years). It is in general have tiny beads in smooth cream that gently exfoliate the skin of the face and reveal brighter skin. I often use it while I shower for about 2-3 times a week. The problem here is that the product texture on face always change for some reason..not sure if company change the formula or something. Now I have one tube that have different feeling than the tube finished just before it and that different than the one before it. I still love it because with continuous use it can keep the skin in good shape regarding cleaned pores and dead cells. I always have better face texture after 6-9 time of using it for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, you can really see a noticeable difference after you use it. I struggle with dull skin, and this helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I wish I could like this product more! It smells amazing and feels good, leaves my skin smooth - unfortunately I have acne prone skin that dries easily and this product is a little too abrasive for my skin, usually causing me to break out. I originally used it once a week and then once a month, I only use it now once in a while when I need a good strong face scrub and am prepared to deal with a breakout. It works good for décolleté (chest/neck/shoulders) and over scars or stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Really nice product. Love how it makes my skin feel.  Easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use ongoing.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for my face. Vitamin C is excellent for a youthful appearance to your face. Micro derma brain is good.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing &amp; makes my skin feel soo smooth. A little goes a long way so this bottle will last you forever using it one to two times a week. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed &amp; believe me ive tried it all (high &amp; low end) being in my late twenties &amp; still suffering from acne &amp; very oily skin</li>
            <li> Love this! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 years now and I don&#x27;t see that changing anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to incorporate more Vitamin C into my facial cleansing, and I am really pleased with it. The beads are very small yet very exfoliating, and my face always feels so soft and smooth when I&#x27;ve used it. It seems to be visibly smoother as well, after having used it for a few weeks. Also, the smell is wonderful. It is a bit expensive, but you don&#x27;t have to use much to get all of your face, so it actually lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning: it does say on the back of the bottle that it is not suitable for sensitive skin, so that is something to take into account.</li>
            <li> this product is super.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a week ago and am very pleased with it so far. It&#x27;s very simple to use but extremely effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has usually been pretty clear but recently I&#x27;ve started noticing milia under my eyes. I don&#x27;t think it was visible to anyone else but I was concerned about it becoming more noticeable so when I learned that microdermabrasion may help reduce or eliminate milia I was intrigued. I purchased this and used it that day. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my cheeks felt after using it. Even my nose, my problem area, felt cleaner and smoother. I thought the milia looked diminished but I wasn&#x27;t quite sure. The directions say not to use it more than twice a week so I waited a few days and used it again with the same results - my cheeks felt so smooth, my nose wasn&#x27;t so oily, and the milia are noticeably diminished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it twice but as I continue using it I will update this post if anything changes. I would definitely recommend this though. Just be sure to follow the directions and if you have sensitive skin (I do) maybe do a small test first before covering your entire face with it? I didn&#x27;t but it&#x27;s probably a good idea.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if you are looking for fine granules.  I was not so i will not re-order this product again because it is too fine for my use.  I was expecting something with larger granules.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and love how smooth my skin feels after using it.  When Spring/Summer begin, I will use just a bit of this daily for one week, and my skin is soft and glows!  This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; Microdermabrasion product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face scrub. The particles are easy on your skin and my skin feels so smooth and moist afterwards, not taught like some scrubs.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel fresher and look a tad more radiant...but not like it used to.  I know they must have changed the formulations because none of the Body Shop Vitamin C line work as well as they did before.</li>
