            <li>me being 24 now and didn&#x27;t seem to be as affective in regrowing hair but very effective in preventing hair lose.</li>
            <li>but it was as good as anything on the market.</li>
            <li>the pump doesn&#x27;t work on the bottle, I had to transfer the liquid to a spray bottle - this isn&#x27;t good for a product that is 1 dimensional like this</li>
            <li>With spectral F7 I must say this product is amazing amazing amazing!.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have ordered more than 1 bottle when I had the chance!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My own Oz Brew was amazing for 40% of the users , 40% saw no substantial growth and 20% saw nothing.</li>
            <li>It has been discused that Hair Loss is a genetic marker that something you are ingesting (like the medication I mentioned are NOT being kind to your body, but the alternative is a heart attack, so it is YOUR call.</li>

            <li>Easy to use, appears to work.</li>

            <li>Less than $30.00 is not a bad way to try something new and YOUR results may vary in an astounding way from another user.</li>

            <li>BUT .. it is cheap enough to try .</li>

            <li>It is very stimulating around the hair follicles....</li>
            <li>I know results should take up to 6 months to a year to see any real results from a product.  </li>
            <li>and it really has helped my thinning hair spots fill in.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it too much</li>
            <li>If you use spectral dnc n by its self, it makes your hair really greasy, but if you use spectral dnc n with Spectral.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>The main problem you have is that 99.9% of people have no idea what type of hair loss they have.</li>
            <li>and I believe there are far better products out there to combine with each other.  </li>
            <li>I have not bought this product yet , but I consider myself VERY knowledgeable about &amp;#34;hair regrowth&amp;#34;  havinted what once called &amp;#34;Oz Brew&amp;#34; which I never took to market , because of possible side effects on certain people.</li>
            <li>It has helped new growth of hair and stopped my hair from falling out by handfuls.</li>
            <li>I also have notices lots of new hair sprouts.</li>
            <li>I like it but not sure if it works to make my thinning hair any better.  </li>
            <li>My wife says she notices a major difference between before I started the treatments to now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product before, but this particular one seemed really watered down.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product, use it all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this leave-in treatment for over a year now &amp; it works great. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have not bought this product yet , but I consider myself VERY knowledgeable about &amp;#34;hair regrowth&amp;#34;  havinted what once called &amp;#34;Oz Brew&amp;#34; which I never took to market , because of possible side effects on certain people. My experience about ANY hair regrowth product is a gamble. My own Oz Brew was amazing for 40% of the users , 40% saw no substantial growth and 20% saw nothing. My conclusion was that the conventional idea of hair regrowth being caused by DHT &amp;#34;alone&amp;#34; is a fallacy and that if you do not see positive effects within 6 weeks stop it , nothing will happen. My mix were off the shelf products people could mix themselves so I never made a penny(I gave the formula away) out of it but it was as good as anything on the market. The main problem you have is that 99.9% of people have no idea what type of hair loss they have. Male Pattern Baldness is genetic and regaining any hair with this type of loss is VERY difficult almost impossible. I say ALMOST because if you have the money and the time you CAN get follicular injections of various hormones that will stop it while you use it.  My research showed an average of $300 a week (8 years ago) would grow hair back - especially on women)  with MPB (not common.). The other is Alopecia Areata . This is thinning and hair loss all over your scalp but not in a rigid pattern. This hair loss is treatable  UNLESS you are taking medication which explicitly point out hair loss as a side effect. Heart medications will make your hair fall out , even if it is transplanted hair. The fact this HAS NOTHING to to do with DHT and other causes are at work (blood thinners, Antidepressants, Blood Pressure medication)  most likely will make you lose hair. It has been discused that Hair Loss is a genetic marker that something you are ingesting (like the medication I mentioned are NOT being kind to your body, but the alternative is a heart attack, so it is YOUR call. My formula included Rogain with a DMSO . DMSO is a wonder treatmen. It is derived from the wood industry and it is CHEAP.  The MSO capsules you buy at your vitamin shop are derived from DMSO. DMSO is amongst the medical community who KNOWS  extremely efficient in penetrating the skin and pass to your circulation. One of the cautions is that anything that may dilute or is small enough to penetrate the skin will be taken in with the DMSO. I encourage you to look more into this.&lt;br /&gt;I will place an order of Spectral F7 just for curiosity but I am afraid that like Rogaine the penetration and reawakening of follicles doine in a topical way requires a LOT more than the ingredients show. BUT .. it is cheap enough to try . Again if you&#x27;re a male with Male Patter Baldness I assure you this will not help. If you are suffering from general thinnes and fall out it MAY have a chance but someone did an excellent study in the ingredients and it is mostly water, and water is NOT a good agent for skin penetration . Let&#x27;s not forget the psychological factor. During the Rogain studies (Minoxidil) the placebo formula worked as well as the real product. It is devastating for anyone to suffer hair loss, so I would NOT discourage anyone for TRYING something new . Less than $30.00 is not a bad way to try something new and YOUR results may vary in an astounding way from another user. GOD LUCKonder treatmen. It is derived from the wood industry and it is CHEAP.

            <li> Helped regrow my hair Not super thick but better</li>
            <li> It helps my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I use this spray just for support my hair..hopefully it&#x27;s work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results of this product..  In a week I noticed less hair falling down!! ...It is very stimulating around the hair follicles.... I use every day on my scalp for faster results.. Great product!!... don&#x27;t stop selling it</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a shot and combine it with other products from DS Laboratories.  I used the product to spec. which states 10 sprays twice daily.  I know results should take up to 6 months to a year to see any real results from a product.  I decided to only purchase one of these bottles as it would take about two bottles a month and about $40 a month to use this product and I believe there are far better products out there to combine with each other.  For Example, Tricomin follicle copper spray is similar price and you get 4 more oz. and it has something proven to actually work, copper.  I will not use these fancy looking boosters unless the product value is around $5 as I feel they are only worth that or less.  I knew the product was only two oz. prior to purchasing but I am very very disappointed in this products price.</li>
            <li> Very Safisfeid Excellent Seller</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and it really has helped my thinning hair spots fill in. Be patient as it takes a few months to truly see the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before, but this particular one seemed really watered down. I didn&#x27;t really like it too much</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I use it in combination with spectral dnc n. If you use spectral dnc n by its self, it makes your hair really greasy, but if you use spectral dnc n with Spectral.F7, they really compliment each other and it makes your hair really soft. My wife loves it when I use both and hates it when I only use dnc n. You can use spectral F 7 as a stand alone treatment but you must use it twice a day. I wish I would have ordered more than 1 bottle when I had the chance! You can&#x27;t beat buying a product at $7 when it&#x27;s worth 5 times that cost. This is a great product and in the 6 months I have used the combination of both ds laboratories products, I&#x27;m sprouting new hairs it seems like each week. My wife says she notices a major difference between before I started the treatments to now! Buy with confidence! It can change your confidence and hair!</li>
            <li> I like it but not sure if it works to make my thinning hair any better.  I will keep using it and maybe I can get a fro going!  Lol....joking but no really, I want a fro.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 6 weeks and I have noticed hair growth along the hairline where I&#x27;m thinning a bit.  The product was recommended to me by my hairdresser and I&#x27;m happy with it.  It does go quickly so I have reduced the amount of squirts (I do 5 at each temple).  I&#x27;m interested to see if my hairdresser notices the difference.  Ordering from this vendor is very easy and convenient.  The product arrives promptly.  I will definitely continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, appears to work.</li>
            <li> Does not make my hair grow back. It may slow the process of hair loss.</li>
            <li> the pump doesn&#x27;t work on the bottle, I had to transfer the liquid to a spray bottle - this isn&#x27;t good for a product that is 1 dimensional like this</li>
            <li> Use this product with shampoo and conditioner. It has helped new growth of hair and stopped my hair from falling out by handfuls. I color my hair and this product can be used on color treated hair.</li>
            <li> as good as the store, and much more cheap. but the effect are different on individual, works on me</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Ok to start off iv tried Nuhair for about 2 years me being 24 now and didn&#x27;t seem to be as affective in regrowing hair but very effective in preventing hair lose. With spectral F7 I must say this product is amazing amazing amazing!. It does not leave any smell or sticky feeling hair and dries very very quickly, I mean 10-15 minutes less time then wet hair takes to dry itself. In 1 week iv noticed dramatic results that boosted my confidence and spirits all together. I use this product along with NuHair step 1 and 2 which prevent my hair from falling out, Sarsaparilla root,biotin 5,000, and of course spectral F7 in the morning and at night. For those losing hair use these 4 together each day and I can almost promise you that you will not be disappointed. DS Laboratories keep up the great work</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I used it for six months.  Nada.</li>
            <li> Love it! It acts like a root booster without clogging up on my scalp and there is no greasy residue left over. I use it to make my hair grow faster, with the shampoo and it really works. I also have notices lots of new hair sprouts. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Could not notice a difference</li>
            <li> Great product, I have been using it for months now and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price with Amazon is great!</li>
            <li> feels like I&#x27;m rubbing expensive water on my head.  didn&#x27;t notice any results.</li>
    </ol>
