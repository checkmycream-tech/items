            <li>Good quality, you wont regret this purchase.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you if it is good as a body wash since I don&#x27;t want to scrub myself with soaked cardboard.  </li>
            <li>But it does smell good.</li>
            <li>My sister bought me some a couple years ago and I loved it.</li>
            <li>This liquid soap is good</li>
            <li>Found it at Target and loved the scent and the description of what it offered and its origins.  </li>
            <li>good idea</li>
            <li>The bar soap leaves color on your washrags and towels... for a shampoo or shower soap it is okay and smells great, for the bath it isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, it is the magical rainbow unicorn of body wash.  </li>
            <li>It is just simply a good gentle soap with a wonderful fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>so glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order some more!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>i love this!</li>
            <li>In comparison to the bars, even though those Are cheaper I like this much better!</li>
            <li>Love this body wash!  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, it feels amazing</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m buying a bottle for everyone in my family for Christmas, it&#x27;s that amazing.</li>
            <li>A nice product.</li>
            <li>and it suds up nicely in the shower.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers well and cleans effectively.</li>
            <li>I kind of like the smell, I haven&#x27;t been using any of my fragrance oils since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>this has to be the best soap I have ever used...and I have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I have very fair, VERY sesitive skin, easily irrtated by everything.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, produces really nice lather, non-drying even on my really dry skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smells like more of a manly smell...</li>
            <li>maybe more herbal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This body wash smells amazing, and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Completely love it.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this body wash!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture is simply the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Switching to a more hydrating skin regimen (this product as well as homemade jojoba oil-based sugar scrub once a week and argan oil for problem areas) hasn&#x27;t been a miracle cure</li>
            <li>but my skin feels so much better and looks healthier.</li>
            <li>I am 30 and love it.</li>
            <li>Just love this product ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s okay for people used to scents</li>
            <li>, I understand, you will love this.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, it has helped my daughter with her ezema, however, it sells cheaper at Harmon&#x27;s, about $8 per bottle.</li>
            <li>I love it on my body, will never use it again on my face</li>
            <li>it looks better &amp; better.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much better</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love the scent of it</li>
            <li>I have tried many things</li>
            <li>The scent is soothing and the way it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I would not have bought this for more than $5.  </li>
            <li>It was a lovely coconut smell that complemented the shampoo &amp; conditioner I have been using.</li>
            <li>I love the product and the brand but the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a product I will continue to use and its worth the price!!  </li>
            <li>Very nice smell and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rather strong smell</li>
            <li>strong.&lt;br /&gt;CRAZY strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong but we like it.</li>
            <li>Generally reverting to a healthier lifestyle in check has been great, but the Excema and dermatitis is still a problem.  </li>
            <li>I rarely stick to a product always looking for &amp;#34;the nest best thing&amp;#34; but i plan to purchase this as long as they continue making it!</li>
            <li>The scent took a little while to get used to, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference - I bought it because I read</li>
            <li>so I enjoy the aromatics whenever my boyfriend gets out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>smooth-</li>
            <li>I like the light exfoliation it provides.</li>
            <li>It has such great after scent on your body</li>
            <li>Overall Shea Moisture is great for all type of skin conditions, and an affordable fix.</li>
            <li>(i bought the lotion too, which is equally fantastic)</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth after the wash, suds up plenty</li>
            <li>Last week, I put a couple drops in my foot spa bath thing, and my feet have been feeling great ever since.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, has exfoliating beads in it, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most soaps do!</li>
            <li>After the first use, I was in love.</li>
            <li>I told all my Facebook friends because I was so excited about it</li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon for not disappointing!  </li>
            <li>I loved it smelled pretty normal does not cause dryness of the epidermis rich foam</li>
            <li>but it smells clean an</li>
            <li>Another thing I like is that I feel clean but not like</li>
            <li>I care for my elderly mother full time.</li>
            <li>Recently, I came across shea moisture hair products and loved the results those provided.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product &amp; ingredients are very good - none of the bad stuff.</li>
            <li>I feel so fresh and clean after showering and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 2 months pregnant</li>
            <li>free (well, as much as humans and every day cooking etc can be scent free) household.</li>
            <li>I switched to more natural products because I&#x27;ve had skin issues for years.</li>
            <li>Soft, clearer, and more moisturize skin.</li>
            <li>It helps with keeping my skin young :)</li>
            <li>was hoping this could be a nice all natural whole body cleanser.</li>
            <li>smells lovely and leaves hair so soft</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell, but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>and I would be willing to pay far more as this product has saved my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used Shea Moisture&#x27;s body oils in the past and they are great</li>
            <li>would just dry out my skin and didn&#x27;t have a nice smell either.</li>
            <li>The smell is absolutely to die for!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for two days and my skin feels better than it&#x27;s ever felt.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>He loves it, says his skin fees moisturizer and much better overall.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and it was so very soothing to my scalp!  </li>
            <li>but then we sort of negated those effects  by washing with peroxide and baking soda etc to remove the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, if you love heavy strong fragrances, and some people do</li>
            <li>For me,the smell isn&#x27;t as nice as the other soaps that Shea Moisture makes but it functions well</li>
            <li>It has a nice, natural scent; somewhat reminiscent of Play-Doh!</li>
            <li>Like many people with acne, I discounted for a long time the necessity of hydration until I was warned otherwise by a doctor.</li>
            <li>this is pretty much a scent</li>
            <li>Great cleanser after acid peel--or any other time--as it definitely replenishes moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this gentle soap!  </li>
            <li>Both my sisters who visited on different months noticed a huge difference w/ this body wash.</li>
            <li>thing I really like about this body wash is that I seam to heal faster from acne &amp; insect bites &amp; poison ivy when using this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already given away three bottles to my sisters who have stated it leaves their skin feeling so clean and not dry.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cleansing ingredients are coconut based, and it also contains shea butter, aloe, oatmeal and palm kernel oils and vitamin E. Gentle exfoliation comes from jojoba oil beads.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like this soap.</li>
            <li>For the face, I need something that rinses out very well, this doesn&#x27;t, and if you tone, your cotton pad will come out brown, meaning it leaves a residue.</li>
            <li>It really helps with breakouts stem to stern.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s softer and &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; and much easier to comb through.  </li>
            <li>While I have never felt the absolute urge as for writings reviews on this site I felt as though people should be forewarned.</li>
            <li>also purchase their lotion line too since I don&#x27;t like Burts Bees lotions, but if you buy the Shea lotions, it may be a good idea to microwave the bottle to soften the lotion because it can be so thick</li>
            <li>I suffer from Very sensitive skin and this is the only body wash I have used that makes my skin feel clean, smooth, soft, refreshed, and irritation-free after my shower/bath.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s to hoping my skin continues to stay clear!!!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, the new whiteheads have stopped, the scabs literally healed over night &amp; my dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li>When I ran out of my facial cleanser, I would use a small amount of this and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, the &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve struggled with has been perioral dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>So far, it smells great (a calming aroma), a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>It also has a great lather, you only need a small amount!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>And it is obviously in high demand because I&#x27;ve resorted to purchasing it online since Target can not keep it in stock.  </li>
            <li>There are little beads in the soap and the smell is so fresh and clean that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any lotion or perfume you may put on afterwards.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews (even though I rely on them to make purchases!)</li>
            <li>One of the natural ingredients included are oats and the aroma it leaves on the skin hours after use is very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural, it&#x27;s very moisturizing &amp; when I got out of the shower, somehow my skin already looked better &amp; everyday</li>
            <li>shower time is now a small simple escape from life, where I can just enjoy the relaxing smells of coconut that takes me back to my happy childhood of so long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has little bits of something in it that provides a bit of gentle exfoliation, and it makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>I live in AZ, in the desert.</li>
            <li>skin felt softer than I can ever remember following the first use of this body wash.</li>
            <li>Ans the lotion from the same collection is the real deal!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>my face and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>(WOW I just realized they want a ton of $$ for this here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised however, by the scent!  </li>
            <li>I am very surprised on negative comments about the smell, which is not our usually flowery lotion smell, but is rather pleasant and definitely not that strong.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it creates a nice hydrating lather.</li>
            <li>If you have struggled for years with adult acne to face and/or body, sensitive skin, combination dry/oily skin, itching and redness, PLEASE TRY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, this product is incredible and crazy affordable compared to other more expensive and less effective lines!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also helping clear body blemishes.</li>
            <li>The soap goes on clear and produces clear suds.  </li>
            <li>So far, all of the products from this company ROCK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>Overall my skin seems much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>read such great things about the benefits and natural ingredients that I ignored the faint scent that I could smell from the bottle, before it was even opened or protective foil removed and bought it</li>
            <li>We use natural, un-scented deodorants, cleaners</li>
            <li>Which is why I am taking the time to review, if you are at all sensitive to perfumes, then save your money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really needed something to stop the breakouts on my back and shoulders and this works after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin on my face is so soft.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive, acne-prone skin, this is a game changer for sure.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very careful  and aware of what I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several versions of Shea Moisture body washes and this by far is my fave.</li>
            <li>I switched to all-natural products a couple years ago which fixed the itching and redness, but I never found a product that actually cured breakouts and balanced combination skin until I tried this soap.</li>
            <li>Even after 1 use my skin was baby soft and over several weeks by breakouts cleared up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really describe the scent as it&#x27;s not like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before in any other non-SM products</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I typically pay for body wash, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I do not have too many breakouts on my body or any serious skin condition, but my skin can get very dry, especially during the winters.</li>
            <li>I really like the Shea Moisture black soap.</li>

            <li> Good quality, you wont regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell you if it is good as a body wash since I don&#x27;t want to scrub myself with soaked cardboard.  </li>
            <li> But it does smell good.</li>
            <li> My sister bought me some a couple years ago and I loved it.</li>
            <li> This liquid soap is good</li>
            <li> Found it at Target and loved the scent and the description of what it offered and its origins.  </li>
            <li> good idea</li>
            <li> The bar soap leaves color on your washrags and towels... for a shampoo or shower soap it is okay and smells great, for the bath it isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, it is the magical rainbow unicorn of body wash.  </li>
            <li> It is just simply a good gentle soap with a wonderful fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> so glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order some more!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> i love this!</li>
            <li> In comparison to the bars, even though those Are cheaper I like this much better!</li>
            <li> Love this body wash!  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing, it feels amazing</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m buying a bottle for everyone in my family for Christmas, it&#x27;s that amazing.</li>
            <li> A nice product.</li>
            <li> and it suds up nicely in the shower.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well and cleans effectively.</li>
            <li> I kind of like the smell, I haven&#x27;t been using any of my fragrance oils since I&#x27;ve started using this.</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> this has to be the best soap I have ever used...and I have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I have very fair, VERY sesitive skin, easily irrtated by everything.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, produces really nice lather, non-drying even on my really dry skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smells like more of a manly smell...</li>
            <li> maybe more herbal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This body wash smells amazing, and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Completely love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this body wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture is simply the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Switching to a more hydrating skin regimen (this product as well as homemade jojoba oil-based sugar scrub once a week and argan oil for problem areas) hasn&#x27;t been a miracle cure</li>
            <li> but my skin feels so much better and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I am 30 and love it.</li>
            <li> Just love this product ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s okay for people used to scents</li>
            <li> , I understand, you will love this.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it has helped my daughter with her ezema, however, it sells cheaper at Harmon&#x27;s, about $8 per bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it on my body, will never use it again on my face</li>
            <li> it looks better &amp; better.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much better</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love the scent of it</li>
            <li> I have tried many things</li>
            <li> The scent is soothing and the way it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I would not have bought this for more than $5.  </li>
            <li> It was a lovely coconut smell that complemented the shampoo &amp; conditioner I have been using.</li>
            <li> I love the product and the brand but the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a product I will continue to use and its worth the price!!  </li>
            <li> Very nice smell and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rather strong smell</li>
            <li> strong.&lt;br /&gt;CRAZY strong.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong but we like it.</li>
            <li> Generally reverting to a healthier lifestyle in check has been great, but the Excema and dermatitis is still a problem.  </li>
            <li> I rarely stick to a product always looking for &amp;#34;the nest best thing&amp;#34; but i plan to purchase this as long as they continue making it!</li>
            <li> The scent took a little while to get used to, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference - I bought it because I read</li>
            <li> so I enjoy the aromatics whenever my boyfriend gets out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> smooth-</li>
            <li> I like the light exfoliation it provides.</li>
            <li> It has such great after scent on your body</li>
            <li> Overall Shea Moisture is great for all type of skin conditions, and an affordable fix.</li>
            <li> (i bought the lotion too, which is equally fantastic)</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth after the wash, suds up plenty</li>
            <li> Last week, I put a couple drops in my foot spa bath thing, and my feet have been feeling great ever since.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, has exfoliating beads in it, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most soaps do!</li>
            <li> After the first use, I was in love.</li>
            <li> I told all my Facebook friends because I was so excited about it</li>
            <li> Thank you, Amazon for not disappointing!  </li>
            <li> I loved it smelled pretty normal does not cause dryness of the epidermis rich foam</li>
            <li> but it smells clean an</li>
            <li> Another thing I like is that I feel clean but not like</li>
            <li> I care for my elderly mother full time.</li>
            <li> Recently, I came across shea moisture hair products and loved the results those provided.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product &amp; ingredients are very good - none of the bad stuff.</li>
            <li> I feel so fresh and clean after showering and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 2 months pregnant</li>
            <li> free (well, as much as humans and every day cooking etc can be scent free) household.</li>
            <li> I switched to more natural products because I&#x27;ve had skin issues for years.</li>
            <li> Soft, clearer, and more moisturize skin.</li>
            <li> It helps with keeping my skin young :)</li>
            <li> was hoping this could be a nice all natural whole body cleanser.</li>
            <li> smells lovely and leaves hair so soft</li>
            <li> but it is totally worth it</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell, but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> and I would be willing to pay far more as this product has saved my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Shea Moisture&#x27;s body oils in the past and they are great</li>
            <li> would just dry out my skin and didn&#x27;t have a nice smell either.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely to die for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for two days and my skin feels better than it&#x27;s ever felt.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> He loves it, says his skin fees moisturizer and much better overall.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it was so very soothing to my scalp!  </li>
            <li> but then we sort of negated those effects  by washing with peroxide and baking soda etc to remove the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, if you love heavy strong fragrances, and some people do</li>
            <li> For me,the smell isn&#x27;t as nice as the other soaps that Shea Moisture makes but it functions well</li>
            <li> It has a nice, natural scent; somewhat reminiscent of Play-Doh!</li>
            <li> Like many people with acne, I discounted for a long time the necessity of hydration until I was warned otherwise by a doctor.</li>
            <li> this is pretty much a scent</li>
            <li> Great cleanser after acid peel--or any other time--as it definitely replenishes moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this gentle soap!  </li>
            <li> Both my sisters who visited on different months noticed a huge difference w/ this body wash.</li>
            <li> thing I really like about this body wash is that I seam to heal faster from acne &amp; insect bites &amp; poison ivy when using this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already given away three bottles to my sisters who have stated it leaves their skin feeling so clean and not dry.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cleansing ingredients are coconut based, and it also contains shea butter, aloe, oatmeal and palm kernel oils and vitamin E. Gentle exfoliation comes from jojoba oil beads.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this soap.</li>
            <li> For the face, I need something that rinses out very well, this doesn&#x27;t, and if you tone, your cotton pad will come out brown, meaning it leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> It really helps with breakouts stem to stern.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer and &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; and much easier to comb through.  </li>
            <li> While I have never felt the absolute urge as for writings reviews on this site I felt as though people should be forewarned.</li>
            <li> also purchase their lotion line too since I don&#x27;t like Burts Bees lotions, but if you buy the Shea lotions, it may be a good idea to microwave the bottle to soften the lotion because it can be so thick</li>
            <li> I suffer from Very sensitive skin and this is the only body wash I have used that makes my skin feel clean, smooth, soft, refreshed, and irritation-free after my shower/bath.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s to hoping my skin continues to stay clear!!!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, the new whiteheads have stopped, the scabs literally healed over night &amp; my dry patches are gone.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of my facial cleanser, I would use a small amount of this and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older, the &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve struggled with has been perioral dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> So far, it smells great (a calming aroma), a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It also has a great lather, you only need a small amount!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> And it is obviously in high demand because I&#x27;ve resorted to purchasing it online since Target can not keep it in stock.  </li>
            <li> There are little beads in the soap and the smell is so fresh and clean that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any lotion or perfume you may put on afterwards.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews (even though I rely on them to make purchases!)</li>
            <li> One of the natural ingredients included are oats and the aroma it leaves on the skin hours after use is very calming and relaxing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural, it&#x27;s very moisturizing &amp; when I got out of the shower, somehow my skin already looked better &amp; everyday</li>
            <li> shower time is now a small simple escape from life, where I can just enjoy the relaxing smells of coconut that takes me back to my happy childhood of so long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has little bits of something in it that provides a bit of gentle exfoliation, and it makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ, in the desert.</li>
            <li> skin felt softer than I can ever remember following the first use of this body wash.</li>
            <li> Ans the lotion from the same collection is the real deal!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> my face and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> (WOW I just realized they want a ton of $$ for this here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised however, by the scent!  </li>
            <li> I am very surprised on negative comments about the smell, which is not our usually flowery lotion smell, but is rather pleasant and definitely not that strong.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it creates a nice hydrating lather.</li>
            <li> If you have struggled for years with adult acne to face and/or body, sensitive skin, combination dry/oily skin, itching and redness, PLEASE TRY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, this product is incredible and crazy affordable compared to other more expensive and less effective lines!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helping clear body blemishes.</li>
            <li> The soap goes on clear and produces clear suds.  </li>
            <li> So far, all of the products from this company ROCK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> Overall my skin seems much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> read such great things about the benefits and natural ingredients that I ignored the faint scent that I could smell from the bottle, before it was even opened or protective foil removed and bought it</li>
            <li> We use natural, un-scented deodorants, cleaners</li>
            <li> Which is why I am taking the time to review, if you are at all sensitive to perfumes, then save your money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really needed something to stop the breakouts on my back and shoulders and this works after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin on my face is so soft.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive, acne-prone skin, this is a game changer for sure.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very careful  and aware of what I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several versions of Shea Moisture body washes and this by far is my fave.</li>
            <li> I switched to all-natural products a couple years ago which fixed the itching and redness, but I never found a product that actually cured breakouts and balanced combination skin until I tried this soap.</li>
            <li> Even after 1 use my skin was baby soft and over several weeks by breakouts cleared up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really describe the scent as it&#x27;s not like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before in any other non-SM products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I typically pay for body wash, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I do not have too many breakouts on my body or any serious skin condition, but my skin can get very dry, especially during the winters.</li>
            <li> I really like the Shea Moisture black soap.</li>
            <li> and it has worked very well , although it can be a little drying in the long run.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this for my body, it works very well for the small breakouts on my back and upper arms.</li>
            <li> I had to start buying the NH verison of liquid black soap, which is the same exact product for $20 dollars less.</li>
            <li> It smells like sandalwood and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> So far, i have yet to be let down by any Shea Moisture product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a slight masculine scent, musky.</li>
            <li> If you know regular black soap, the smell of this is much less intense.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s going to take a little time before it clears up completely.  </li>
            <li> So this soap was like getting hit in the nostrils with a perfume bat and I feel sort of terrible admitting we can&#x27;t handle this strong scent because I know other people love it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like to rate things harshly, the soap did make our hands soft</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had been using the curl enhancing hair products for some time and decided to branch out to the African Black facial scrub and shower gel.</li>
            <li> The lather comes out completely white, unlike traditional black soap, so it&#x27;s not at all staining your sink either.</li>
            <li> I no longer have dry patches and oily skin and even during hormonal times of the month by breakouts</li>
            <li> In reading a blog, someone with the same issues tried the African Black Soap and it cleared everything up without using steroids or other chemically laced products.  </li>
            <li> Even though that smell can be a small price to pay for all else I chose to switch to my old body wash.</li>
            <li> have been using traditional black soap on my combination, acne prone face for a while</li>
            <li> I just bought 2 since it was buy 1 get the 2nd half off....</li>
            <li> I used to use regular bars of African Black Soap (not Shea Moistures), but it dried me out</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different</li>
            <li> , the bumps on my upper arms, and any little pimples my butt would get from time to time.</li>
            <li> natural oils etc will  be delicate scents.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble skin my entire life and the soaps my parents would buy</li>
            <li> African black soap body wash user for life!</li>
            <li> sure what other reviewers talk about a bad scent...</li>
            <li> I just bought this butter wash because I am slowly changing all of my skincare items over to organic and natural to avoid parabens and other synthetic and harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> so a little does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I started buying some of the other types from Sallys (ie.</li>
            <li> is not worth $30.</li>
            <li> While this soap IS black, it does not make your skin black, or stain black.  </li>
            <li> It does not clean squeakily the way black soap does.</li>
            <li> Every other body i have tried for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; does not compare and usually i feel itchy after i shower.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was a pricing error at Target, and if so, I need to run down and buy it all up at the lower price!  </li>
            <li> Green Tea and Coconut</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> While in the shower I felt that it may be stripping my skin of all of its natural oils, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a few people comment on the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and dark purplish, with jojoba beads giving it some texture.</li>
            <li> I find this soap to be a little hard to rinse out</li>
            <li> I discovered it a couple of years ago and out of desperation for something all natural that would help my painful scalp due to eczema</li>
            <li> The black color of the gel is a little unsettling but it lathers like any other body gel and there&#x27;s no residue in the shower.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is I have only used it for a week and and started developing cysts on my forehead, which is very unusual for me.</li>
            <li> in the dead of winter!</li>
            <li> Usually Organic soaps, or any Organic product in general, are so expensive!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to get out, but once microwaved for about 20 seconds, it comes out effortlessly</li>
            <li> There is some serious sud-action with an amount the size of a pea, in hard water.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a face wash and with other soaps within minutes of my face drying it desperately needs lotion, but not with this product.</li>
            <li> I have very troubled skin- red/dry patches, oily parts, bad acne, white heads, black heads, scabs, scars.....</li>
            <li> The black is probably from the palm ash and tar, which sounds bad but is a common treatment for skin inflammation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s honestly not that bad.</li>
            <li> I want to know why this product became so expensive.  </li>
            <li> But we hated it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great soap. Great scent.</li>
            <li> this is a gift no product revue yet.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, produces really nice lather, non-drying even on my really dry skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Walgreens for 10.49 and have no reason to stop using it. Target also carries the Shea Moisture brand at a price around $10-$11 but not all stores carry all of their products. For me,the smell isn&#x27;t as nice as the other soaps that Shea Moisture makes but it functions well &amp; I like that. I can&#x27;t really describe the scent as it&#x27;s not like anything I&#x27;ve ever smelled before in any other non-SM products but it smells clean an it&#x27;s smells like more of a manly smell... not cologne-like but maybe more herbal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like about this body wash is that I seam to heal faster from acne &amp; insect bites &amp; poison ivy when using this soap. Another thing I like is that I feel clean but not like all of my oils have been stripped from my skin. Another thing I like is that I don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it to get clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a reference point, I have combination skin. I&#x27;m also petite so a nickle-sized amount actually washes me from face to feet. I don&#x27;t use it on my hair but my step Dad did and said it helped him stop itching.</li>
            <li> This body wash smells amazing, and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t manage to keep this stuff. I&#x27;ve already given away three bottles to my sisters who have stated it leaves their skin feeling so clean and not dry.  Both my sisters who visited on different months noticed a huge difference w/ this body wash. I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference - I bought it because I read it&#x27;s a great product &amp; ingredients are very good - none of the bad stuff. I started buying some of the other types from Sallys (ie. Green Tea and Coconut Hibiscus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchase their lotion line too since I don&#x27;t like Burts Bees lotions, but if you buy the Shea lotions, it may be a good idea to microwave the bottle to soften the lotion because it can be so thick, it&#x27;s hard to get out, but once microwaved for about 20 seconds, it comes out effortlessly &amp; it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this line of products for a while now but cant always get out of the house to buy it. I care for my elderly mother full time. This is an excellent product for problem skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and soft. Just feels good for you. The smell is unisex too so I enjoy the aromatics whenever my boyfriend gets out of the shower.  I gave my friends son some as he has acne and he loved it and felt it helped. Good quality, you wont regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> I loved it smelled pretty normal does not cause dryness of the epidermis rich foam</li>
            <li> So far, all of the products from this company ROCK!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt softer than I can ever remember following the first use of this body wash. While in the shower I felt that it may be stripping my skin of all of its natural oils, but I was wrong. Minutes after my shower I realized that it truly cleanses the skin and moisturizes simultaneously. I also use it as a face wash and with other soaps within minutes of my face drying it desperately needs lotion, but not with this product. One of the natural ingredients included are oats and the aroma it leaves on the skin hours after use is very calming and relaxing. I believe there is a body lotion that accompanies this body wash and I plan to purchase it soon!</li>
            <li> Completely love it. This product leaves your skin feeling hydrated and soft. Will not use another body wash product again.</li>
            <li> The smell is absolutely to die for! I love it! And the quality of the product itself is great! I&#x27;ve had trouble skin my entire life and the soaps my parents would buy would just dry out my skin and didn&#x27;t have a nice smell either. Recently, I came across shea moisture hair products and loved the results those provided. Once I found out they sold skin care items, I was on the hunt for the perfect one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this! It smells amazing, has exfoliating beads in it, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most soaps do! Overall my skin seems much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t ran out yet and brought this soap about two months ago. I am a shea moisture African black soap body wash user for life!</li>
            <li> smells awesome and works great</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this body wash! The scent took a little while to get used to, but I&#x27;m very happy with it. It has little bits of something in it that provides a bit of gentle exfoliation, and it makes my skin feel fantastic. I use this exclusively on my body, and the bar form of this soap for my face, but I&#x27;d bet that this would work for the face too. It&#x27;s a great product, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff. It&#x27;s thick and dark purplish, with jojoba beads giving it some texture. A little goes a long way and it creates a nice hydrating lather. It smells like sandalwood and the scent is long lasting. All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture is simply the best. I had been using the curl enhancing hair products for some time and decided to branch out to the African Black facial scrub and shower gel. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This product leaves my skin feeling silky smooth- that&#x27;s not an exaggeration, and I noticed an immediate difference. The scent profile is honeysuckle with sandalwood. It&#x27;s a rather strong smell but I find it pleasant. The black color of the gel is a little unsettling but it lathers like any other body gel and there&#x27;s no residue in the shower. The black is probably from the palm ash and tar, which sounds bad but is a common treatment for skin inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing ingredients are coconut based, and it also contains shea butter, aloe, oatmeal and palm kernel oils and vitamin E. Gentle exfoliation comes from jojoba oil beads. Salicylic acid for acne treatment. Like many people with acne, I discounted for a long time the necessity of hydration until I was warned otherwise by a doctor. Switching to a more hydrating skin regimen (this product as well as homemade jojoba oil-based sugar scrub once a week and argan oil for problem areas) hasn&#x27;t been a miracle cure but my skin feels so much better and looks healthier. I&#x27;m a Shea Moisture convert for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several versions of Shea Moisture body washes and this by far is my fave. I picked it up on a whim because I was going out of town and... I am impressed. There are little beads in the soap and the smell is so fresh and clean that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any lotion or perfume you may put on afterwards. It lathers like a dream and your skin feels great after you&#x27;re done. I switched to more natural products because I&#x27;ve had skin issues for years. I&#x27;ve only used it for two days and my skin feels better than it&#x27;s ever felt. AND my skin has a glow...in the dead of winter!</li>
            <li> Product showed up coating the inside of the box and my sidewalk. Can&#x27;t tell you if it is good as a body wash since I don&#x27;t want to scrub myself with soaked cardboard.  But it does smell good.</li>
            <li> Soft, clearer, and more moisturize skin. I use it all over and as my face wash.  It is great stuff! My sister bought me some a couple years ago and I loved it. I forgot about it until we moved back to the states again and I was suffering from breakout along with my cycle and after thinking about buying an acne wash. I bought this and was happy to have it again!  I am 30 and love it. It helps with keeping my skin young :)</li>
            <li> A nice product. I like the light exfoliation it provides. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I was 2 months pregnant and now I&#x27;m entering 8 months, my skin has never looked amazing ever!!!! I also use this on my daughter and it brings out her beautiful tan color.</li>
            <li> Great product...I&#x27;m about to order some more!</li>
            <li> Just love this product ... Great feel on the skin!</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this soap. But we hated it.&lt;br /&gt;I read such great things about the benefits and natural ingredients that I ignored the faint scent that I could smell from the bottle, before it was even opened or protective foil removed and bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s strong.&lt;br /&gt;CRAZY strong. I like that there are no added fragrances but don&#x27;t assume as I did that natural oils etc will  be delicate scents.&lt;br /&gt;We diluted the soap in a pump foam dispenser to try it out and both of us ended up rewashing our hands with baking soda etc to remove the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s okay for people used to scents and I should qualify this is pretty much a scent free (well, as much as humans and every day cooking etc can be scent free) household. We use natural, un-scented deodorants, cleaners no air fresheners etc. So this soap was like getting hit in the nostrils with a perfume bat and I feel sort of terrible admitting we can&#x27;t handle this strong scent because I know other people love it. Which is why I am taking the time to review, if you are at all sensitive to perfumes, then save your money.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to rate things harshly, the soap did make our hands soft but then we sort of negated those effects  by washing with peroxide and baking soda etc to remove the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo, if you love heavy strong fragrances, and some people do, I understand, you will love this.</li>
            <li> my gosh this body wash is so awesome. It has such great after scent on your body</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different but I like it. I have used almost the entire bottle and seen no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it has helped my daughter with her ezema, however, it sells cheaper at Harmon&#x27;s, about $8 per bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it on my body, will never use it again on my face through!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this could be a nice all natural whole body cleanser. I have been using it for over a week on my body  and used it 4 times on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using traditional black soap on my combination, acne prone face for a while and it has worked very well , although it can be a little drying in the long run. So I thought this would be a milder version.It does not clean squeakily the way black soap does. For the face, I need something that rinses out very well, this doesn&#x27;t, and if you tone, your cotton pad will come out brown, meaning it leaves a residue.But the worst part is I have only used it for a week and and started developing cysts on my forehead, which is very unusual for me. My forehead is not prone to breakouts, and definitely not with cysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this is great for the body. It&#x27;s not at all drying.  I am very surprised on negative comments about the smell, which is not our usually flowery lotion smell, but is rather pleasant and definitely not that strong. The lather comes out completely white, unlike traditional black soap, so it&#x27;s not at all staining your sink either.I will keep using this for my body, it works very well for the small breakouts on my back and upper arms. Ans the lotion from the same collection is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> I ordered this product out of desperation. I really needed something to stop the breakouts on my back and shoulders and this works after a couple of weeks. I feel the bar soap works must faster but could not find it. I also would recommend trying the Ambi bar cleansing soap it also stops breakouts. Overall Shea Moisture is great for all type of skin conditions, and an affordable fix.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, it is the magical rainbow unicorn of body wash.  It really helps with breakouts stem to stern.  It has a pleasant fragrance too.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Order again and again! Nice scrub, smells great! No reservations.</li>
            <li> So far, i have yet to be let down by any Shea Moisture product. I usually do not write reviews (even though I rely on them to make purchases!) I have very fair, VERY sesitive skin, easily irrtated by everything. I rarely stick to a product always looking for &amp;#34;the nest best thing&amp;#34; but i plan to purchase this as long as they continue making it! I live in AZ, in the desert. Every other body i have tried for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; does not compare and usually i feel itchy after i shower. My skin feels so moisturized and soothed that i don&#x27;t even feel a need for lotion! (i bought the lotion too, which is equally fantastic) I have also noticed clearer skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this product is incredible and crazy affordable compared to other more expensive and less effective lines!</li>
            <li> I just bought this butter wash because I am slowly changing all of my skincare items over to organic and natural to avoid parabens and other synthetic and harmful chemicals.  I have used Shea Moisture&#x27;s body oils in the past and they are great so I gave this wash a shot.  So far, it smells great (a calming aroma), a little goes a long way and it suds up nicely in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily but I did feel moisturized.  I do not have too many breakouts on my body or any serious skin condition, but my skin can get very dry, especially during the winters. I like it.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Very sensitive skin and this is the only body wash I have used that makes my skin feel clean, smooth, soft, refreshed, and irritation-free after my shower/bath. It has a nice, natural scent; somewhat reminiscent of Play-Doh! It&#x27;s got exfoliating beads, but they aren&#x27;t too rough for sensitive skin. This body wash has cleared up the acne that I would get on my shoulders, the bumps on my upper arms, and any little pimples my butt would get from time to time. When I ran out of my facial cleanser, I would use a small amount of this and it worked great. It also has a great lather, you only need a small amount! It lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this! If you have sensitive, acne-prone skin, this is a game changer for sure.</li>
            <li> Great for clearing acne and cleansing your skin! Skin feels smooth after the wash, suds up plenty so a little does go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what other reviewers talk about a bad scent...it&#x27;s a slight masculine scent, musky. It&#x27;s nice! But PLEASE BUY IT ELSEWHERE....you can find it at your local Walgreens for $10!!! Seriously. I just bought 2 since it was buy 1 get the 2nd half off....that&#x27;s two bottles for what Amazon is charging for one!!!</li>
            <li> Terrific loc shampoo feel it working in three minutes</li>
            <li> smells lovely and leaves hair so soft</li>
            <li> I bought this soap on a whim at Target for $8.09.  I have very troubled skin- red/dry patches, oily parts, bad acne, white heads, black heads, scabs, scars.....ugh. After the first use, I was in love. It smells amazing, it feels amazing, it&#x27;s all natural, it&#x27;s very moisturizing &amp; when I got out of the shower, somehow my skin already looked better &amp; everyday it looks better &amp; better. My skin tone is more even, the new whiteheads have stopped, the scabs literally healed over night &amp; my dry patches are gone. I told all my Facebook friends because I was so excited about it &amp; I&#x27;m buying a bottle for everyone in my family for Christmas, it&#x27;s that amazing. Here&#x27;s to hoping my skin continues to stay clear!!!</li>
            <li> This soap is a miracle for problem sensitive/combination skin. I switched to all-natural products a couple years ago which fixed the itching and redness, but I never found a product that actually cured breakouts and balanced combination skin until I tried this soap. Even after 1 use my skin was baby soft and over several weeks by breakouts cleared up. I no longer have dry patches and oily skin and even during hormonal times of the month by breakouts are 95% gone! I buy this soap at Walgreens for $10 and recently switched to the bar soap version because it is only $5 there and it works equally well. I did have to check several Walgreens as they all stock this brand differently but it is totally worth it and I would be willing to pay far more as this product has saved my skin. If you have struggled for years with adult acne to face and/or body, sensitive skin, combination dry/oily skin, itching and redness, PLEASE TRY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I find this soap to be a little hard to rinse out but my husband swears by it. The bar soap leaves color on your washrags and towels... for a shampoo or shower soap it is okay and smells great, for the bath it isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I really like the Shea Moisture black soap. This liquid soap is good but I prefer the bar hence 4 stars. The soap lathers well and cleans effectively. Smells pleasant to me.</li>
            <li> I am just about allergic to everything.  Years of hives were from allergies to sodium lauryl sulfate which is found in soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, and detergents.  Now that I&#x27;m older, the &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve struggled with has been perioral dermatitis.  Now it&#x27;s on my scalp, causing my hair to fall out.  Generally reverting to a healthier lifestyle in check has been great, but the Excema and dermatitis is still a problem.  In reading a blog, someone with the same issues tried the African Black Soap and it cleared everything up without using steroids or other chemically laced products.  I bought this at Target which is about $3.00 cheaper and I use it from head to toe.  I thought it would make my hair greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s softer and &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; and much easier to comb through.  My skin feels much better but it&#x27;s going to take a little time before it clears up completely.  My skin on my face is so soft.  I love it.  If you have &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; skin problems, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try.  A little goes a long way.  There is some serious sud-action with an amount the size of a pea, in hard water.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who is always breaking out in acne on his body.  He loves it, says his skin fees moisturizer and much better overall.  The scent is strong but we like it.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT stuff. Spend the money &amp; get this along with the lavender skin therapy lotion...it&#x27;s a guys dream!</li>
            <li> While I have never felt the absolute urge as for writings reviews on this site I felt as though people should be forewarned. In the case of a bottle I purchased I opened the lid and thought the smell (aroma) would change after I&#x27;d showered. Once I finished my shower there was somewhat of an intoxicating smell of clay and trash. Even though that smell can be a small price to pay for all else I chose to switch to my old body wash.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser after acid peel--or any other time--as it definitely replenishes moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this it moisturizes my skin and I love the scent of it I feel so fresh and clean after showering and it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> Perfect! It&#x27;s my body wash, shampoo, and face wash! Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this soap.  I discovered it a couple of years ago and out of desperation for something all natural that would help my painful scalp due to eczema I purchased it.  Found it at Target and loved the scent and the description of what it offered and its origins.  I tried it and it was so very soothing to my scalp!  The only place that I have &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; skin is on my scalp but I have had skin cancer and I&#x27;m very careful  and aware of what I put on my skin.  I have tried many things but this is by far the best.  My entire family uses it...not because they need it but because it is wonderful! The scent is soothing and the way it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth is wonderful.  I highly recommend this product.  And it is obviously in high demand because I&#x27;ve resorted to purchasing it online since Target can not keep it in stock.  Thank you, Amazon for not disappointing!  You always have what I need!</li>
            <li> i love this! I already use Shea Moisture on my hair, and one day I was at Walmart and saw this and decided to try it. It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than I typically pay for body wash, but it&#x27;s worth it. I use it everywhere except my face and my skin is so soft! It&#x27;s also helping clear body blemishes. I used to use regular bars of African Black Soap (not Shea Moistures), but it dried me out and I didn&#x27;t like it. If you know regular black soap, the smell of this is much less intense. I&#x27;ve seen a few people comment on the smell but it&#x27;s honestly not that bad. I kind of like the smell, I haven&#x27;t been using any of my fragrance oils since I&#x27;ve started using this. In comparison to the bars, even though those Are cheaper I like this much better! Last week, I put a couple drops in my foot spa bath thing, and my feet have been feeling great ever since.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell, but other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash!  Lots of suds and feels good on my skin!</li>
            <li> Just get the bar. ..good idea but it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is a product I will continue to use and its worth the price!!  I Love it.!!</li>
            <li> this has to be the best soap I have ever used...and I have sensitive skin...and this is just wonderful for when my face is breaking out.</li>
            <li> While this soap IS black, it does not make your skin black, or stain black.  The soap goes on clear and produces clear suds.  I also do not believe it is for African skin as the name and description implies.  It is just simply a good gentle soap with a wonderful fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened upon this by chance at my local Target store.  I was looking for an Organic body soap, but this one stood out as different.  Very different!  Not only because of the bottle and name, but because it was so affordable!  Usually Organic soaps, or any Organic product in general, are so expensive!  Not this one.  So I picked it up, along with the face bar of the same brand. (WOW I just realized they want a ton of $$ for this here on Amazon! Let me tell you, I would not have bought this for more than $5.  Perhaps it was a pricing error at Target, and if so, I need to run down and buy it all up at the lower price!  DO yourself a favor and look for it in the store before buying it online!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised however, by the scent!  It was a lovely coconut smell that complemented the shampoo &amp; conditioner I have been using. [[ASIN:B005I0JWWE Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin Straightening Shampoo, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] &amp; [[ASIN:B005I0JWU6 Renpure Originals Brazilian Keratin Straightening Conditioner, 16 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shower time is now a small simple escape from life, where I can just enjoy the relaxing smells of coconut that takes me back to my happy childhood of so long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this gentle soap!  It cleans well, and does not leave any residue on the shower stall or on my skin.</li>
            <li> I want to know why this product became so expensive.  I love the product and the brand but the size of the bottle is not worth $30. Shame on you SM. I had to start buying the NH verison of liquid black soap, which is the same exact product for $20 dollars less.</li>
