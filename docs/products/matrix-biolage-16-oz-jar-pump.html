            <li>This lid fits on the top of a CeraVe lotion tub perfectly -- which is precisely why I bought it.</li>
            <li>I bought this to fit on the top of a Cerave tub &amp; it fits &amp; works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It fits perfectly and makes it much easier to use.</li>
            <li>I got this for Cerave tub thanks to another review and it fits perfectly!~</li>
            <li>Great to be able to pump my favorite conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The plastic seems sturdy and good quality, it fit nicely on the jar.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this thing would actually be any good on a Matrix Biolage tub, but for a CeraVe tub it works absolutely perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This pump is a great option for keeping your moisturizer sanitary, and it&#x27;s pretty cheap and worked great for a while.</li>
            <li>It looked like it might be a good fit, and it is.</li>
            <li>Fits my CeraVe Cream tub perfectly, which is important for me as it&#x27;s more hygienic than putting my hands straight into the product.</li>
            <li>What I freaking LOVE</li>
            <li>the most about this pump?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad because I have a 12 oz CeraVe tub</li>
            <li>Much more sanitary than just digging your fingers into the tub.</li>
            <li>Product is ok, but the pump is garbage.  </li>
            <li>I can now use my moisturizer in a more sanitary way than dipping my fingers into the container.</li>
            <li>It basically matched my CeraVe :)</li>
            <li>I know when I use up most of the product I&#x27;m gonna have to dig my fingers in there.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for the Cerave cream jar and it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is awesome until the jar gets to about the halfway point then it no longer works properly.</li>
            <li>So much more hygienic then scooping it out.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Makes using the cerave much more practical &amp; convienient.</li>
            <li>Makes the moisturizer so much easier to use, and it&#x27;s great not having to worry about getting bacteria inside it.</li>
            <li>Well, my opinion as a prospective customer is that an item being advertised as available (even as I type this!)</li>
            <li>More work is needed on updating product inventory.</li>
            <li>Finally an inexpensive pump that perfectly fits my CeraVe tub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product, it fits my cerave moisturizing cream tub</li>
            <li>and they work fantastic!</li>
            <li>But the foam part itself seemed to be okay, so I plunged it</li>
            <li>Does not come close to fitting the size jar it claims.</li>
            <li>It was white and it fit perfectly!  </li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li>The pump fit perfectly, except I had to cut off 1/2-1 in of the straw because it was too long.  </li>
            <li>The part that dips into the moisturizer easily attaches to the pump mechanism.</li>
            <li>If you think the cost is worth it for 6 months of use then this would be perfect, but if you&#x27;re hoping for a product that will last then skip this one.</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>it was more of a pain, then what its worth.</li>
            <li>should, in fact, be available for purchase.</li>
            <li>and I have to trim it to fit.  </li>
            <li>These pumps fit both my Cetaphil moisturizing cream &amp; my CeraVe SA cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect fit.</li>
            <li>The blue-capped pumped I received probably fit the Biolage jars they had years ago.</li>
            <li>This pump works very well and, most importantly, fits my CeraVe in the tub!  </li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>and it looks like a part of the original packaging.</li>
            <li>great product, planning to buy a few more to use w/16 oz.</li>
            <li>as expected fits great.</li>
            <li>its a bright blue..</li>
            <li>I had a full jar of conditioner</li>
            <li>It was a pain to unscrew the very large lid, and now just a small tap pumps out the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product came quickly, was wrapped in a way that the product was not damaged from shipping, and works well.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased and would recommend it if you are looking for a pump for your Cerave.</li>
            <li>which is exactly what I bought it for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use cerave 16oz cream, but i think it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li>It matches the CV label perfectly, but I would&#x27;ve expected white from the pictures</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit my Kerastase Intensive Nutrition Masque, 16.9 Ounce (that I only buy from Amazon).  </li>
            <li>For that first half it works great.</li>
            <li>This pump fit my CeraVe in the tub perfectly, and it actually had a blue lid and a white pump, not all</li>
            <li>Just remember as others have mentioned, if you&#x27;re trying to pump a good amount to go on your face, aim for about half a pump.</li>
            <li>second of all barely fit the jar of conditioner that its supposed to fit.</li>
            <li>I purchased this so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep using cotton swabs to get my night lotion out, and it is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>Suuper fast shipping!</li>
            <li>had I not read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry for those that it didn&#x27;t work for the Biolage as it was intended, but I&#x27;m very happy that it works on the Kerastase jar.</li>
            <li>At first I was sceptical, because a plastic component of the seal at the bottom appears to be cracked.</li>
            <li>Cover is blue not white good for the price.</li>
            <li>It shipped pretty quickly and fit the CeraVe moisturizer tub as expected.</li>
            <li>It came loose in a box, so I made sure to sterilize it before attaching it to my lotion jar.</li>
            <li>The Amazon ad copy stated the pump would fit \\&quot;the Matrix Biolage Conditioning Balm 16.9 oz.\\&quot; , however it does not fit and is not the correct shape to fit.  </li>
            <li>It matches the CeraVe design really well.</li>
            <li>so you have some control over how much is dispensed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks /r</li>
            <li>It really does make using the conditioner easier.</li>
            <li>I have actually considered buying another one but haven&#x27;t yet just because I&#x27;m hesitant to give more of my money to a company that sold me a product that broke with standard use.</li>
            <li>OK COLOR has changed in transit from white to blue....</li>
            <li>High quality pump.  </li>
            <li>This pump offers a much cleaner and easier way to use products.</li>
            <li>I wasted more of my hair conditioner trying to get the pump to work.</li>
            <li>My recommendation, keep the normal lid with your Biolage and scoop it out with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even reach far enough into the jar when full.</li>
            <li>If you have the new design bottle for conditioning balm, this will not reach to the bottom.</li>
            <li>Pretty much exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>No more unsanitary application issues :)</li>
            <li>First of all its not white...</li>
            <li>Order came in 4 days early.  </li>
            <li>Worked fine, as other reviews said it&#x27;s blue, not white or clear.</li>
            <li>If you wanted this to fit products you purchased in the last few years, you will be dissapointed as I am.</li>
            <li>Although it is not white as pictured it is the exact same shade of blue on the package.</li>
            <li>Gotta love false advertising.</li>
            <li>I normally buy a much larger size of Matrix to save money; I spent additional funds to specifically purchase this 16.9 oz.</li>
            <li>My only complaint would be the way it smells when I first received it, it smelled seriously toxic but after washing it with a mild soap the smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li>it does fit the new packaging for the hair balm but is not easy to get it screwed on - won&#x27;t purchase from this vendor again -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Seller did notify me that they order in bulk, which didn&#x27;t address my complaint -</li>

            <li> I normally buy a much larger size of Matrix to save money; I spent additional funds to specifically purchase this 16.9 oz.</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be the way it smells when I first received it, it smelled seriously toxic but after washing it with a mild soap the smell is completely gone.</li>
            <li> it does fit the new packaging for the hair balm but is not easy to get it screwed on - won&#x27;t purchase from this vendor again -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Seller did notify me that they order in bulk, which didn&#x27;t address my complaint -</li>
            <li> At first it takes a few seconds to get it seated correctly due to the balm being super thick</li>
            <li> The item I received was blue, not white, and it never really worked.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I actually like the blue color of the lid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually dark blue, not white, but I like that; my daughter thinks it makes the lotion look like it&#x27;s wearing at tutu.</li>
            <li> The straw part arrived too long</li>
            <li> packaged in a cardboard box, and not wrapped in plastic - my only negative so far.</li>
            <li> I use this for the Cerave tub, and the pump only reaches about halfway down.</li>
            <li> The pump only works for about half of the container.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a white lid, like the picture shows, that sucks because it&#x27;s blue.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s blue, it&#x27;s not extremely cheap or flimsy.</li>
            <li> but there are no issues it twisted right into place.</li>
            <li> it only reaches half way down.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t there I would have a little more peace of mind; I&#x27;m not sure if a slight amount of air is getting through (in the wrong way), so we&#x27;ll see how the cream holds up over a year.</li>
            <li> When checking on the shipping progress, it was noted that shipping times may vary due to product availability.</li>
            <li> since is was under $5.00, not worth returning - still won&#x27;t purchase from this vendor again - lowered my review to 2 stars -</li>
            <li> the tubing went down a liiittle</li>
            <li> So Have you the plan to cut down this pump?</li>
            <li> It works half the time</li>
            <li> The Matrix Biolage conditioner is thick, this pump will pump it but the thick conditioner reqires that I keep banging the container to get conditioner near the pick up tube.</li>
            <li> However, after a few months of use the amount that came out with each pump stated to be less and less until eventually I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Luckily the pump still works, however it is annoying to use because it is not straight once you screw it into the shampoo, it is lopsided.</li>
            <li> this pump is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Either it&#x27;s too short or mine came broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll advised in another review how this guy stands up to some heavy usage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pump believing it to be white as shown in the photo - it came in an ugly blue which matches nothing in my house -</li>
            <li> not sure what the heck I&#x27;m supposed to call it) comes with an extension that you can take out....</li>
            <li> No more dipping hands in and spreading germs.</li>
            <li> Use it for my kids thick lotion/cream.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Fits my Cerave jar perfectly, and pumps well. Hopefully it holds up!&lt;br /&gt;Came packaged in a cardboard box, and not wrapped in plastic - my only negative so far.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Cerave tub.</li>
            <li> Fits my 16oz CeraVe cream jar perfectly.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Cerave Moisturizer jar and cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> What I freaking LOVE the most about this pump? It works on a 12 oz jar! The pump stem (? not sure what the heck I&#x27;m supposed to call it) comes with an extension that you can take out.... I&#x27;m so glad because I have a 12 oz CeraVe tub and I was going to buy a 16 oz tub so I could use this pump, but now I don&#x27;t have to! Unlike other reviewers, I actually like the blue color of the lid. It matches the CeraVe design really well.</li>
            <li> It works half the time</li>
            <li> The item I received was blue, not white, and it never really worked.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This fits perfectly on my Cerave lotion tubs. No more unsanitary application issues :)</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a pump for my CeraVe and Cetaphil creams that come in jars so that I don&#x27;t have to stick my hand in the moisturizer every time. This works great.</li>
            <li> It works great for my Biolage 16.9 0z conditioning balm. At first it takes a few seconds to get it seated correctly due to the balm being super thick but there are no issues it twisted right into place. Yes its blue and not white but its not a big deal...its just a pump.</li>
            <li> Luckily the pump still works, however it is annoying to use because it is not straight once you screw it into the shampoo, it is lopsided.</li>
            <li> Bought it exclusively for the CeraVe Moisturizer in a tub and it fits perfectly. And the one I got is blue, so it matches!</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my cerave cream tub</li>
            <li> This lid fits on the top of a CeraVe lotion tub perfectly -- which is precisely why I bought it. It looked like it might be a good fit, and it is.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with CeraVe Moisturizing Cream (the one in the tub). It fits perfectly and makes it much easier to use. It&#x27;s actually dark blue, not white, but I like that; my daughter thinks it makes the lotion look like it&#x27;s wearing at tutu.</li>
            <li> This pump works very well and, most importantly, fits my CeraVe in the tub!  I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep using cotton swabs to get my night lotion out, and it is exactly what I need.  Fits perfectly on the tub CeraVe, which is what I used it for.  High quality pump.  I&#x27;ve had it for months and it shows no signs of wear. Awesome purchase!</li>
            <li> Fits CeraVe perfectly. Cover is blue not white good for the price. Much more sanitary than just digging your fingers into the tub.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: The pump does not reach the bottom of the tub, so you end up having to use your fingers at the end.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in different color than pictured and described here. The lid is royal blue and the pump is white. Product page depicts white/white. Still happy with it, fits on CeraVe tub and compliments quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Product is ok, but the pump is garbage.  It does not get below the halfway point and you end up having to scoop the product out with your hands.</li>
            <li> In ordered this pump for my 16 oz container of CeraVe moisturizer. It works great! Although it is not white as pictured it is the exact same shade of blue on the package. I can now use my moisturizer in a more sanitary way than dipping my fingers into the container. The pump responds well to the amount of pressure applied so you have some control over how much is dispensed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in two pieces. The part that dips into the moisturizer easily attaches to the pump mechanism. For those that have reviewed that the pump does not dip into the product, they may have not noticed/attached the second piece. I almost didn&#x27;t notice it.&lt;br /&gt;The product came quickly, was wrapped in a way that the product was not damaged from shipping, and works well. I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Suuper fast shipping! Idk how this fits with what it&#x27;s advertised for, but it&#x27;s perfect for my CeraVe cream...just like everyone else says :P&lt;br /&gt;Mine was a blue lid with a white pump. It basically matched my CeraVe :) well, if you&#x27;re not looking TOO closely at shades..&lt;br /&gt;Wish the tubing went down a liiittle further though- I know when I use up most of the product I&#x27;m gonna have to dig my fingers in there.</li>
            <li> as expected fits great.</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s the perfect size, it&#x27;s blue, it&#x27;s not extremely cheap or flimsy. Happy with the purchase so far.</li>
            <li> great product, planning to buy a few more to use w/16 oz. Cerave jars</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for the Cerave cream jar and it fits perfectly. No more dipping hands in and spreading germs. This pump offers a much cleaner and easier way to use products. A must for any germaphobe! :P</li>
            <li> I had a full jar of conditioner and I could never get the pump to actually pump the conditioner out.</li>
            <li> This pump fit my CeraVe in the tub perfectly, and it actually had a blue lid and a white pump, not all white like pictured. That didn&#x27;t bother me, I think it looks nicer and it looks like a part of the original packaging. However, after a few months of use the amount that came out with each pump stated to be less and less until eventually I had to stop using it. This pump is a great option for keeping your moisturizer sanitary, and it&#x27;s pretty cheap and worked great for a while. I have actually considered buying another one but haven&#x27;t yet just because I&#x27;m hesitant to give more of my money to a company that sold me a product that broke with standard use. If you think the cost is worth it for 6 months of use then this would be perfect, but if you&#x27;re hoping for a product that will last then skip this one.</li>
            <li> It shipped pretty quickly and fit the CeraVe moisturizer tub as expected. Just remember as others have mentioned, if you&#x27;re trying to pump a good amount to go on your face, aim for about half a pump.</li>
            <li> This is awesome until the jar gets to about the halfway point then it no longer works properly. For that first half it works great.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the CeraVe tub. Came with the lid a royal blue color. It matches the CV label perfectly, but I would&#x27;ve expected white from the pictures had I not read the reviews first. Shipped with lots of bubble wrap in a bubble mailer. Thanks /r/SkincareAddiction for the recommendation!</li>
            <li> This fits my Cerave moisturizer in the tub. So much more hygienic then scooping it out. Love it. It is definitely blue and not white but that just makes it match the Cerave logo!</li>
            <li> I bought this to fit on the top of a Cerave tub &amp; it fits &amp; works perfectly.  Makes using the cerave much more practical &amp; convienient.</li>
            <li> So far so good and it fits the CeraVe 16oz Moisturizing Cream Jar perfectly. My only complaint would be the way it smells when I first received it, it smelled seriously toxic but after washing it with a mild soap the smell is completely gone. Recommended for those that don&#x27;t want to dip your hands in the jar and would prefer a pump. Oh, and the lid was blue not white, but it matches the jar, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this thing would actually be any good on a Matrix Biolage tub, but for a CeraVe tub it works absolutely perfectly.  Makes the moisturizer so much easier to use, and it&#x27;s great not having to worry about getting bacteria inside it.</li>
            <li> I got this for Cerave tub thanks to another review and it fits perfectly!~</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a white lid, like the picture shows, that sucks because it&#x27;s blue. Gotta love false advertising.</li>
            <li> As others have said, this is blue rather than white. It came loose in a box, so I made sure to sterilize it before attaching it to my lotion jar. The plastic seems sturdy and good quality, it fit nicely on the jar.</li>
            <li> This makes my life a million times easier. Use it for my kids thick lotion/cream.</li>
            <li> Order came in 4 days early.  Like others, I ordered this pump to use on my Cerave lotion in the tub.  The pump fit perfectly, except I had to cut off 1/2-1 in of the straw because it was too long.  Overall, I am very pleased and would recommend it if you are looking for a pump for your Cerave.</li>
            <li> I use this for the Cerave tub, and the pump only reaches about halfway down.</li>
            <li> Fits my CeraVe Cream tub perfectly, which is important for me as it&#x27;s more hygienic than putting my hands straight into the product.</li>
            <li> pump doesn&#x27;t reach to bottom of jar. it only reaches half way down. it was more of a pain, then what its worth. I wasted more of my hair conditioner trying to get the pump to work.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again. The Matrix Biolage conditioner is thick, this pump will pump it but the thick conditioner reqires that I keep banging the container to get conditioner near the pick up tube. My recommendation, keep the normal lid with your Biolage and scoop it out with your fingers. this pump is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Despite the product actually being blue rather than white as pictured, I decided to order it for the value and low shipping cost for standard rates. The 1-star rating is for the length of time the company took to cancel the order of this &amp;#34;in stock&amp;#34; item. When checking on the shipping progress, it was noted that shipping times may vary due to product availability. 3 weeks later, my order has been cancelled. Well, my opinion as a prospective customer is that an item being advertised as available (even as I type this!) should, in fact, be available for purchase. More work is needed on updating product inventory.</li>
            <li> Pretty much exactly what I expected.  It isn&#x27;t all white, but I don&#x27;t know why that would matter to anyone.  It really does make using the conditioner easier.</li>
            <li> Waster of money. Either it&#x27;s too short or mine came broken. Doesn&#x27;t even reach far enough into the jar when full. Skip it.</li>
            <li> The pump only works for about half of the container. Then there isn&#x27;t enough conditioner inside for it to pull through the pump.</li>
            <li> Great to be able to pump my favorite conditioner.  The straw part arrived too long and I have to trim it to fit.  It also allows water in somewhere and somehow ... but not continually.  Just about once a week I pump out watery conditioner.</li>
            <li> Finally an inexpensive pump that perfectly fits my CeraVe tub. Mine came in blue and it looks like they&#x27;re meant to be &lt;3&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with this product, it fits my cerave moisturizing cream tub which is exactly what I bought it for! The blue of the lid even matches the blue on the cerave logo.</li>
            <li> It dispenses cream. All sorts of creams and lotions. Currently my wife is using it for face cream. Standard usage, and its holding up well. If it ever gets attached to my jar of lotion I&#x27;ll advised in another review how this guy stands up to some heavy usage.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the conditioning balm for years.  Just found the jar pump on amazon and they work fantastic!</li>
            <li> Worked fine, as other reviews said it&#x27;s blue, not white or clear. I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d care if you&#x27;re using it for Cerave, as it matches anyway.</li>
            <li> I found this pump at my local Ulta Store.  Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit my Kerastase Intensive Nutrition Masque, 16.9 Ounce (that I only buy from Amazon).  It was white and it fit perfectly!  I&#x27;m sorry for those that it didn&#x27;t work for the Biolage as it was intended, but I&#x27;m very happy that it works on the Kerastase jar.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my tub of CeraVe.</li>
            <li> These pumps fit both my Cetaphil moisturizing cream &amp; my CeraVe SA cream. I did need to trim the straw for the SA cream. Hakuna Matata!</li>
            <li> OK COLOR has changed in transit from white to blue....&lt;br /&gt;if it were in the description I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t buy this for Matrix Biolage, but instead for Cerave moisturizer. Fits perfectly. At first I was sceptical, because a plastic component of the seal at the bottom appears to be cracked. But the foam part itself seemed to be okay, so I plunged it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect fit. Pumps great. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars out of 5, though, because of that crack. If it weren&#x27;t there I would have a little more peace of mind; I&#x27;m not sure if a slight amount of air is getting through (in the wrong way), so we&#x27;ll see how the cream holds up over a year.</li>
            <li> Does not come close to fitting the size jar it claims.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with the cream.  It was a pain to unscrew the very large lid, and now just a small tap pumps out the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> great pump, never gets stuck and works perfect</li>
            <li> The Amazon ad copy stated the pump would fit \\&quot;the Matrix Biolage Conditioning Balm 16.9 oz.\\&quot; , however it does not fit and is not the correct shape to fit.  I purchased a 16.9 oz sized product to use with this and I cannot.  I normally buy a much larger size of Matrix to save money; I spent additional funds to specifically purchase this 16.9 oz. size and this pump.  The blue-capped pumped I received probably fit the Biolage jars they had years ago. If you wanted this to fit products you purchased in the last few years, you will be dissapointed as I am.</li>
            <li> First of all its not white... its a bright blue.. second of all barely fit the jar of conditioner that its supposed to fit. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have the new design bottle for conditioning balm, this will not reach to the bottom.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use cerave 16oz cream, but i think it&#x27;s not cheap. So Have you the plan to cut down this pump?</li>
