            <li>this info will help any ladies who are buying on amazon find the honest sellers and avoid the scammers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also smells really nice.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful if your skin produces too much oil.</li>
            <li>I have to be cautious with the products I use on my face because I am prone to breaking out very easily.  </li>
            <li>Been using this stuff for years and like it, great for combination skin, no weird smell and never blocks pours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect light summer moisturizer, not greasy at all, and I enjoy the scent (no artificial fragrance according to the ingredient list).</li>
            <li>Very light weight, no oily/greasy residue.   </li>
            <li>Very light on the skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a good moisturizer that dries quickly and leaves skin feeling not oily.  </li>
            <li>My favorite skin product</li>
            <li>Now that I am it is already looking so much better.</li>
            <li>I love it, keeps my skin moist and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out from using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First and foremost it has a nice, light smell.</li>
            <li>It also lasts about 6 months (pea size, no need to use more).</li>
            <li>Most of the Dermalogica line I use is with the mediBac Clearing line -</li>
            <li>Love this product and did not notice any difference in quality between the one I bought here and the ones I&#x27;ve paid way more for at a retailer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY moisturizers that have just made my skin more oily.</li>
            <li>lovely product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but my skin likes it better than drugstore brands, and they don&#x27;t add too many funky ingredients.</li>
            <li>LOVE all the Dermalogica stuff.</li>
            <li>and I really do love it.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m glad I did as I hope</li>
            <li>I love Dermalogica products.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have gotten a discount off retail price by buying on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a year and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>i have a tendency to breakout and this lotion is nice and light.</li>
            <li>Love dermalogica</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>my face feels soft and smooth when i use it and not oily, very happy with Dermologica moisturizer :)</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous over the counter and store bought products and have found the Dermalogica to be the best for my touchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Awesome the only moisturizer that works for me!</li>
            <li>I love this line of products.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It gives me a really nice smooth skin and prevents breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to so many things that I&#x27;m not even sure of some of my allergies, but Dermalogica seems to work fine for me.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten a whiff of it after it&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s not scented, which may be a good thing if you are looking for a more pure product.  </li>
            <li>Find it to be great for my sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li>Love that this lotion is so light.  </li>
            <li>The original aveeno age defense was my favorite</li>
            <li>It is very light and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>Normally I have good experiences on Amazon</li>
            <li>I am a 29-year-old with very sensitive, breakout prone fair skin.</li>
            <li>used for day and night; light, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>It is light, even in summer humidity, and keeps my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>Added bonus were the the two free Dermologica gifts that came with the order.</li>
            <li>It is light weight so it does not create excess oil and moisturizes</li>
            <li>Light and fresh-smelling, with lavender extract that soothes skin.</li>
            <li>All genuine Dermalogica products have the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Great daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fragrance free, which means it doesn&#x27;t smell *</li>
            <li>Oil free moisture.</li>
            <li>It feels good on my face and keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li>Normally I feel like i need to add more and more moisturizer when it&#x27;s oil free.  </li>
            <li>Great for a hot Aussie sun, my skin feels hydrated all day, and is deliciously soft.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to Dermalogica in a salon, and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>and the service was super quick!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was in original box with seal.  </li>
            <li>Oil of Olay has a great feel but brings out my oils a little more around mid-day.  </li>
            <li>I got a great deal on some facials, and my esthetician suggested I use this product for my dry but problematic skin.  </li>
            <li>BUT I often find they don&#x27;t clean as well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s always so great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer I ever tried that is actually pleasant, absorbed quickly, and doesn&#x27;t make me sweat the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ever since I began using this moisturizer with the Special Cleansing gel, I get lots of compliments on my skin, which I thought I&#x27;d never hear in my life.</li>
            <li>Active Moist is a great light weight, non greasy moisturizer that I use at night in conjunction with my Obagi regimen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years and it is the only moisturizer that is good for my super-sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The safety seal had been opened already and the container about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>It really does moisturize and keeps the shiny face at bay for many hours.</li>
            <li>Jack Black is good, but only good in the moisturizing and oil mitigations categories, the two I care most about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful and has actually helped lessen my breakouts more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Its not a thick lotion, it&#x27;s just perfect for everyday use and leaves my skin feeling totally moisturized and amazing!  </li>
            <li>Great to use when mixing other Dermalogica products--like the night serum and the map 15.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer - Dermalogica Active Moist:  </li>
            <li>I have been using Dermalogica Active Moist for 20 years and it is a great product.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light enough for oily skin, and effectively prevents dryness.</li>
            <li>I have used various products from this line for over a year and have been very pleased with everything.  </li>
            <li>Best light moisturizer for middle aged skin and no pimples or clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Some may find that it does not moisturize enough, but I love it!</li>
            <li>It is great in the morning before I apply a little powder and blush.  </li>
            <li>This was the only product and product line that makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite product from dermalogica so far.  </li>
            <li>An old favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But in this case it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The wife says it&#x27;s the best year round moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it contained SPF, but odds are that would make it greasy enough that I&#x27;d no longer like it...</li>
            <li>By far this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good deal and cheaper than other sellers.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>I know the Dermalogica website recommends having your face mapped to pick the right products for you</li>
            <li>It is just the right amount of moisture for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scrub feels nice, but I don&#x27;t notice as significant a difference in my skin for better or worse when I use it.</li>
            <li>I very much like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Would consider ordering again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this and their Special Cleansing Gel.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product with</li>
            <li>I love it and use it daily and never break out from it.  </li>
            <li>slightly better frangrance, which brings me to the only knock, and the reason for the 4 star rating.  </li>
            <li>Anyway until someone tells me my face smells funny, I will continue to use Dermalogica with confidence.</li>
            <li>, I decided to pay the higher price for it.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing without the oily effect that most facial lotions give you</li>
            <li>Love this product so glad amazon has it for less!!</li>
            <li>My skin looks clean and feels soft.</li>
            <li>I own the dermalogica dermal clay cleanser, microfoliant, skin refining masque and active moist.</li>
            <li>I tend to buy natural based products because they are free of the chemicals that really irritate my skin</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have spf included, but for spf I use Eucerin Sensitive (recommended by my dermatologist) on top of the active moist and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>just light enough to leave a soft and smooth finish.</li>
            <li>However, as I turned 30 this year and needed more specific nutrition to my &#x27;older&#x27; skin during harsher winters (moved to the Nordics), I decided to let go switch products.</li>
            <li>i do have more combination skin that is towards the dry side.  </li>
            <li>pure night lightening cream&lt;br</li>
            <li>same as most seals on a new jar of peanut butter or medicine/vitamin bottle</li>
            <li>I do however switch to the heavier creams in the dermalogica range for use on my cheeks during winter, but active moist works superbly on my forehead all year round!</li>
            <li>This is a soft cream, and with a little bit of product is sufficient for all the face, the size is good.</li>
            <li>and it works really well in the summer months.</li>
            <li>Use this product daily and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked out very well.</li>
            <li>I have been using for five years, and would recommend the whole Dermalogica line.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very upsetting.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My cosmetologist swears by this whole line of products.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and does not feel sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is very mild, but it does a decent job mitigating the acne (although it doesn&#x27;t prevent it entirely).</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is not too heavy, absorbs well, and does a good job keeping my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Love how this moisturizer soaks right into my skin so that I am ready to put on foundation in just a few minutes after applying it...</li>
            <li>product and Clinique are probably tied right now, and this one gives more bang for the buck, so I will continue using it, maybe switching off every few bottles to compare.  </li>
            <li>Very nice non irritating face cream not oily</li>
            <li>Received my active moist today in good condition with basic packaging (but w/o box).  </li>
            <li>am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them.</li>
            <li>After years of searching I have found the perfect moisturizer for my crazy sensitive combination face.</li>
            <li>Original grey box with barcode sticker sealing the lid of the box</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dermalogica product.  </li>
            <li>The Dermalogica was recommended by a woman in a high end make-up store.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>but I wanted something that had a little more moisturizing abilities.  </li>
            <li>For those living in hot climates, suggest checking mailbox in a timely manner as the product was very hot after a few hours in the unseasonably hot 100 degree weather we have been having in Chicago this week.</li>
            <li>I love a good deal but these products are expensive and I don&#x27;t want anyone to loose their money on a scam.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely noticeable when you first apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it may be a bit pricey</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, it&#x27;s just heavy enough to really feel like your skin is getting nice and moisturized but</li>
            <li>I was almost out of the moisturizer and was glad to see it arrive a few days early.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used this for few years now and my skin got so much better.</li>
            <li>I use this when I feel oilier than normal, when I go out for a run etc.</li>
            <li>Still not sure the high price is worth it, but until I find a similar or better product that does the job, I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li>My first experience with Dermalogica was at a high end spa for a facial.  </li>
            <li>Product was new, and sealed.  </li>
            <li>This was suppose to be new and when I got it, it looked tampered with.</li>
            <li>and this is the only product that has been consistent in keeping my face in check.</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old woman that has oily to normal skin-</li>
            <li>New to this product, only been using about 2 months, so far I like very much.  </li>
            <li>I will mix a little of this with my foundation and it blends easily and helps.</li>
            <li>My skin behaves much better now that I use Dermlogica Active Moist regularly.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying a larger size bottle with a pump top there will be a half barcode/ half dermalogica brand name sticker that connects the top of the bottle with the bottom of the lid, proving it has never been open</li>
            <li>There was no free gift as advertised and the packaging was not like the picture, however the product itself was fine.</li>
            <li>I no longer wear foundation thanks to the chrome white product line.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Dermalogica for years and have been so irritated that no retail store ever offers a discount.</li>
            <li>but they changed it and messed it up completely.  </li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is not a heavy formula at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny spent to have my face under control.</li>
            <li>I purchased the large bottle of Active Moist through Pink Lady Super Store because it was cheaper, but this one is thicker and creamier...not as nice as other bottles I&#x27;ve received from other companies selling through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item with active tone and special cleanser, this three products are very generic and applicable to normal face types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is fake dermalogica.</li>
            <li>But I have extremely sensitive eczema-prone skin, and after about a week of using this new product I realized my face was getting red and irritated.</li>
            <li>* when it goes on (the smell is a little like poster paint) , but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Active moist is exactly what my face needs to blend my oily T-line.  </li>
            <li>The Active Moist facial moisturizer for me is the right amount of moisture without leaving any greasy or oily feeling to my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product gives your face and neck just the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy or messy.</li>
            <li>Trust me when I tell you , I&#x27;ve used many different face creams,from the least expensive to the most with only moderate results.</li>
            <li>I use all year round and have found it be especially useful during the warmer months when other creams may be a bit too heavy for the face.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Make up goes on nicely after this product.  </li>
            <li> No greasy feeling either which is nice.</li>
            <li> this info will help any ladies who are buying on amazon find the honest sellers and avoid the scammers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also smells really nice.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful if your skin produces too much oil.</li>
            <li> I have to be cautious with the products I use on my face because I am prone to breaking out very easily.  </li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years and like it, great for combination skin, no weird smell and never blocks pours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect light summer moisturizer, not greasy at all, and I enjoy the scent (no artificial fragrance according to the ingredient list).</li>
            <li> Very light weight, no oily/greasy residue.   </li>
            <li> Very light on the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a good moisturizer that dries quickly and leaves skin feeling not oily.  </li>
            <li> My favorite skin product</li>
            <li> Now that I am it is already looking so much better.</li>
            <li> I love it, keeps my skin moist and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out from using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First and foremost it has a nice, light smell.</li>
            <li> It also lasts about 6 months (pea size, no need to use more).</li>
            <li> Most of the Dermalogica line I use is with the mediBac Clearing line -</li>
            <li> Love this product and did not notice any difference in quality between the one I bought here and the ones I&#x27;ve paid way more for at a retailer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY moisturizers that have just made my skin more oily.</li>
            <li> lovely product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but my skin likes it better than drugstore brands, and they don&#x27;t add too many funky ingredients.</li>
            <li> LOVE all the Dermalogica stuff.</li>
            <li> and I really do love it.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m glad I did as I hope</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products.  </li>
            <li> Glad to have gotten a discount off retail price by buying on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a year and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion.</li>
            <li> i love this product.</li>
            <li> i have a tendency to breakout and this lotion is nice and light.</li>
            <li> Love dermalogica</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> my face feels soft and smooth when i use it and not oily, very happy with Dermologica moisturizer :)</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous over the counter and store bought products and have found the Dermalogica to be the best for my touchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Awesome the only moisturizer that works for me!</li>
            <li> I love this line of products.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It gives me a really nice smooth skin and prevents breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to so many things that I&#x27;m not even sure of some of my allergies, but Dermalogica seems to work fine for me.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten a whiff of it after it&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s not scented, which may be a good thing if you are looking for a more pure product.  </li>
            <li> Find it to be great for my sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love that this lotion is so light.  </li>
            <li> The original aveeno age defense was my favorite</li>
            <li> It is very light and soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> Normally I have good experiences on Amazon</li>
            <li> I am a 29-year-old with very sensitive, breakout prone fair skin.</li>
            <li> used for day and night; light, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> It is light, even in summer humidity, and keeps my skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> Added bonus were the the two free Dermologica gifts that came with the order.</li>
            <li> It is light weight so it does not create excess oil and moisturizes</li>
            <li> Light and fresh-smelling, with lavender extract that soothes skin.</li>
            <li> All genuine Dermalogica products have the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Great daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrance free, which means it doesn&#x27;t smell *</li>
            <li> Oil free moisture.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my face and keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li> Normally I feel like i need to add more and more moisturizer when it&#x27;s oil free.  </li>
            <li> Great for a hot Aussie sun, my skin feels hydrated all day, and is deliciously soft.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to Dermalogica in a salon, and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> and the service was super quick!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product was in original box with seal.  </li>
            <li> Oil of Olay has a great feel but brings out my oils a little more around mid-day.  </li>
            <li> I got a great deal on some facials, and my esthetician suggested I use this product for my dry but problematic skin.  </li>
            <li> BUT I often find they don&#x27;t clean as well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always so great for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer I ever tried that is actually pleasant, absorbed quickly, and doesn&#x27;t make me sweat the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ever since I began using this moisturizer with the Special Cleansing gel, I get lots of compliments on my skin, which I thought I&#x27;d never hear in my life.</li>
            <li> Active Moist is a great light weight, non greasy moisturizer that I use at night in conjunction with my Obagi regimen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it is the only moisturizer that is good for my super-sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The safety seal had been opened already and the container about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li> It really does moisturize and keeps the shiny face at bay for many hours.</li>
            <li> Jack Black is good, but only good in the moisturizing and oil mitigations categories, the two I care most about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful and has actually helped lessen my breakouts more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Its not a thick lotion, it&#x27;s just perfect for everyday use and leaves my skin feeling totally moisturized and amazing!  </li>
            <li> Great to use when mixing other Dermalogica products--like the night serum and the map 15.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer - Dermalogica Active Moist:  </li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica Active Moist for 20 years and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light enough for oily skin, and effectively prevents dryness.</li>
            <li> I have used various products from this line for over a year and have been very pleased with everything.  </li>
            <li> Best light moisturizer for middle aged skin and no pimples or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Some may find that it does not moisturize enough, but I love it!</li>
            <li> It is great in the morning before I apply a little powder and blush.  </li>
            <li> This was the only product and product line that makes my skin look amazing.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite product from dermalogica so far.  </li>
            <li> An old favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But in this case it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The wife says it&#x27;s the best year round moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it contained SPF, but odds are that would make it greasy enough that I&#x27;d no longer like it...</li>
            <li> By far this is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good deal and cheaper than other sellers.</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> I know the Dermalogica website recommends having your face mapped to pick the right products for you</li>
            <li> It is just the right amount of moisture for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scrub feels nice, but I don&#x27;t notice as significant a difference in my skin for better or worse when I use it.</li>
            <li> I very much like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Would consider ordering again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this and their Special Cleansing Gel.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product with</li>
            <li> I love it and use it daily and never break out from it.  </li>
            <li> slightly better frangrance, which brings me to the only knock, and the reason for the 4 star rating.  </li>
            <li> Anyway until someone tells me my face smells funny, I will continue to use Dermalogica with confidence.</li>
            <li> , I decided to pay the higher price for it.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing without the oily effect that most facial lotions give you</li>
            <li> Love this product so glad amazon has it for less!!</li>
            <li> My skin looks clean and feels soft.</li>
            <li> I own the dermalogica dermal clay cleanser, microfoliant, skin refining masque and active moist.</li>
            <li> I tend to buy natural based products because they are free of the chemicals that really irritate my skin</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have spf included, but for spf I use Eucerin Sensitive (recommended by my dermatologist) on top of the active moist and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li> just light enough to leave a soft and smooth finish.</li>
            <li> However, as I turned 30 this year and needed more specific nutrition to my &#x27;older&#x27; skin during harsher winters (moved to the Nordics), I decided to let go switch products.</li>
            <li> i do have more combination skin that is towards the dry side.  </li>
            <li> pure night lightening cream&lt;br</li>
            <li> same as most seals on a new jar of peanut butter or medicine/vitamin bottle</li>
            <li> I do however switch to the heavier creams in the dermalogica range for use on my cheeks during winter, but active moist works superbly on my forehead all year round!</li>
            <li> This is a soft cream, and with a little bit of product is sufficient for all the face, the size is good.</li>
            <li> and it works really well in the summer months.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily and it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This product has worked out very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using for five years, and would recommend the whole Dermalogica line.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very upsetting.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My cosmetologist swears by this whole line of products.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and does not feel sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is very mild, but it does a decent job mitigating the acne (although it doesn&#x27;t prevent it entirely).</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is not too heavy, absorbs well, and does a good job keeping my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love how this moisturizer soaks right into my skin so that I am ready to put on foundation in just a few minutes after applying it...</li>
            <li> product and Clinique are probably tied right now, and this one gives more bang for the buck, so I will continue using it, maybe switching off every few bottles to compare.  </li>
            <li> Very nice non irritating face cream not oily</li>
            <li> Received my active moist today in good condition with basic packaging (but w/o box).  </li>
            <li> am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them.</li>
            <li> After years of searching I have found the perfect moisturizer for my crazy sensitive combination face.</li>
            <li> Original grey box with barcode sticker sealing the lid of the box</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dermalogica product.  </li>
            <li> The Dermalogica was recommended by a woman in a high end make-up store.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>
            <li> but I wanted something that had a little more moisturizing abilities.  </li>
            <li> For those living in hot climates, suggest checking mailbox in a timely manner as the product was very hot after a few hours in the unseasonably hot 100 degree weather we have been having in Chicago this week.</li>
            <li> I love a good deal but these products are expensive and I don&#x27;t want anyone to loose their money on a scam.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely noticeable when you first apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it may be a bit pricey</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s just heavy enough to really feel like your skin is getting nice and moisturized but</li>
            <li> I was almost out of the moisturizer and was glad to see it arrive a few days early.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have used this for few years now and my skin got so much better.</li>
            <li> I use this when I feel oilier than normal, when I go out for a run etc.</li>
            <li> Still not sure the high price is worth it, but until I find a similar or better product that does the job, I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> My first experience with Dermalogica was at a high end spa for a facial.  </li>
            <li> Product was new, and sealed.  </li>
            <li> This was suppose to be new and when I got it, it looked tampered with.</li>
            <li> and this is the only product that has been consistent in keeping my face in check.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old woman that has oily to normal skin-</li>
            <li> New to this product, only been using about 2 months, so far I like very much.  </li>
            <li> I will mix a little of this with my foundation and it blends easily and helps.</li>
            <li> My skin behaves much better now that I use Dermlogica Active Moist regularly.  </li>
            <li> If you are buying a larger size bottle with a pump top there will be a half barcode/ half dermalogica brand name sticker that connects the top of the bottle with the bottom of the lid, proving it has never been open</li>
            <li> There was no free gift as advertised and the packaging was not like the picture, however the product itself was fine.</li>
            <li> I no longer wear foundation thanks to the chrome white product line.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica for years and have been so irritated that no retail store ever offers a discount.</li>
            <li> but they changed it and messed it up completely.  </li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is not a heavy formula at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny spent to have my face under control.</li>
            <li> I purchased the large bottle of Active Moist through Pink Lady Super Store because it was cheaper, but this one is thicker and creamier...not as nice as other bottles I&#x27;ve received from other companies selling through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item with active tone and special cleanser, this three products are very generic and applicable to normal face types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is fake dermalogica.</li>
            <li> But I have extremely sensitive eczema-prone skin, and after about a week of using this new product I realized my face was getting red and irritated.</li>
            <li> * when it goes on (the smell is a little like poster paint) , but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Active moist is exactly what my face needs to blend my oily T-line.  </li>
            <li> The Active Moist facial moisturizer for me is the right amount of moisture without leaving any greasy or oily feeling to my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product gives your face and neck just the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I tell you , I&#x27;ve used many different face creams,from the least expensive to the most with only moderate results.</li>
            <li> I use all year round and have found it be especially useful during the warmer months when other creams may be a bit too heavy for the face.  </li>
            <li> A little high on the price point but</li>
            <li> The formula is light and the smell is a very subtle botanical smell.</li>
            <li> You need to use very little and it will cover the whole face,</li>
            <li> The odor only last a moment and once lotion is dry is gone all together.  </li>
            <li> After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Active Moist and was pleasantly surprised it was delivered prior to the expected date.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, this is one of the few products that I can use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensitive and prone to redness so a lot of products are too harsh.</li>
            <li> I follow up with the mattifier in the T-Zone when I know that I&#x27;m going to have a long day and shine</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin that is sensitive from using Accutane a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have had to deal with the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; issue for so long.</li>
            <li> It gave me a good base to apply mineral makeup over.</li>
            <li> smell a little different than my old Active Moist.  </li>
            <li> Despite the price I will definitely be sticking with this product and I look forward to trying other Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> I have tried other store brands but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive,T zone dry skin</li>
            <li> so I do not get dry spots.  </li>
            <li> I use a penny to nickel sized amount(depending on the oily patch to dry skin ratio)I got a 3.4 oz tube about a month ago and</li>
            <li> (I would recommend that to anyone who battles eczema and dry skin).</li>
            <li> note, if my skin gets too dry from ..</li>
            <li> M lotion seems to be equal in moisture, slightly less efficient at preventing the oil at mid-day, and</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried very single item on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used Aveeno (several versions including age-defense), Jack Black daily (not the oil control, which is good for spot treatment but a terrible idea as an every day face lotion), Oil of Olay rejuvenate and Clinique Men M lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin, and I suffer from adult acne, so it was difficult to find a product that would control the acne without drying out my skin or causing a reaction.</li>
            <li> Its just the way I expected.</li>
            <li> but a little truly goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have received products from other companies, that was not legit.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I use the product for years and off and on use an other product.</li>
            <li> You only have to apply a small amount to your face.</li>
            <li> a little moisturizer goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> The product was received prof, packed with the box and tube both with the dermalogia seal..  Being in texas for few months i would have been lost and wrinkled due to dry airconditioned environment, which i am not used to..  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Active moist that was recommended to me by an esthetician for almost a year now.   </li>
            <li> I have been using Active Moist for 4 years.</li>
            <li> This proof no matter how dry or harsh the environement...</li>
            <li> They recommended Active Moist, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> but this was super disappointing.</li>
            <li> Being 60 didn&#x27;t stop me from having oily skin, and I still am active swimming</li>
            <li> I use the Active Moist shown here, the Skin Clearing Wash and the Skin Prep Scrub.</li>
            <li> active moist (</li>
            <li> 3.4 fl oz sounds little but a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but works as expected</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t lie and say that I use less of this item than of any other face lotion</li>
            <li> One complaint I would have is I wish they made a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> and I feel this helps cut down on my mid-day blotting.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> I use it day and night, a little goes a very long way, there is no sticky or greasy feeling left behind.</li>
            <li> There is an odor to the product that causes me to hold my breath when applying- the smell reminds me of a cleaning product - I think they were going for something that smelled herbal but missed the mark slightly.  </li>
            <li> Consistancy, smell, and packaging are slightly off.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up ordering the wrong product, as I got in a hurry and didn&#x27;t read the front close enough.</li>
            <li> Dermalogica has a slightly medicinal smell when applying.  </li>
            <li> I have an oily forehead and drier cheeks, typical combination skin.  </li>
            <li> am now using their Dermal Clay Cleanser,Oil control lotion when I have problems with excess oil, and Active Moist for everyday use.</li>
            <li> just added to the mess, This goes on and NO break out, I also use their calming mist.</li>
            <li> if I attempt to use it, in 1-2 days I start having at least 4-5 strange acnes all over my face.</li>
            <li> My face broke out a little when I began using it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way, not greasy.</li>
            <li> get a few hours into the day, but it does prevent flaky skin in the winter, and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> Does not feel heavy at all</li>
            <li> Only wish they were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I strongly not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have had bad skin my whole life.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if Dermalogica has changed formula,</li>
            <li> Box did not have the usual seal of authencity</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s really hard finding a product that combats oiliness, dryness, prevents irritation, keeps my skin moisturized, AND doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so expensive in the stores, but I got it on here for like half the price!</li>
            <li> Fairly thin formula.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, provides a thin layer of moisturize, and does not clog my pores or make me break</li>
            <li> Wish it wasnt so expensive</li>
            <li> But since I started using this product my skin became awful, it is unbelievable, I paid a lot of money</li>
            <li> have very weird skin.</li>
            <li> I still get some brake outs but not as bad as before</li>
            <li> My skin was in horrible condition,so I searched around and found I could get them again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite skin product</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. You can put it over your eyes which is problematic for me personally. It is very light and soaks in quickly. The only downside is it has no spf.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer - Dermalogica Active Moist:  used for day and night; light, not greasy.  A little high on the price point but a little moisturizer goes a very long way.  Was delivered promptly and in good condition.  Was satisifed.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Very nice non irritating face cream not oily</li>
            <li> I had stopped using Dermalogica products because I moved and I thought I could not get them any longer. My skin was in horrible condition,so I searched around and found I could get them again. Now that I am it is already looking so much better.My pores are tightening up again, it is not excessively oily anymore and does not look red and damaged like it does when I use the other products on the market. I will never go without Dermalogica products again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now using their Dermal Clay Cleanser,Oil control lotion when I have problems with excess oil, and Active Moist for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I got a great deal on some facials, and my esthetician suggested I use this product for my dry but problematic skin.  She was right. My skin behaves much better now that I use Dermlogica Active Moist regularly.  Now I order it online because it&#x27;s cheaper than from the spa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for 10yrs.  It is light, even in summer humidity, and keeps my skin smooth.  I use with Dermalogica dermal skin cleanser and multi-active toner.  Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts with me.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful and has actually helped lessen my breakouts more than any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m so glad I bought two of them!</li>
            <li> Very nice product and it works really well in the summer months.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I like the savings</li>
            <li> I like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and can see a big difference. My skin looks clean and feels soft. I still get some brake outs but not as bad as before and I think it&#x27;s normal. I think this is a good deal and cheaper than other sellers. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s been using this for years and she looking younger as the years goes by!!!&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a soft cream, and with a little bit of product is sufficient for all the face, the size is good. You must use it after the Multi-active toner. All the dermalogica products helps with acne skin. I love it!</li>
            <li> The Dermalogica skin care line was recommended to me by a licensed esthetician.  She warned me about online \\&quot;imposters\\&quot; using dermalogica packaging but selling an inferior product.  I&#x27;ve never run into that before. I purchased the large bottle of Active Moist through Pink Lady Super Store because it was cheaper, but this one is thicker and creamier...not as nice as other bottles I&#x27;ve received from other companies selling through Amazon.  My face broke out a little when I began using it.  Of course, I can&#x27;t prove anything...&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this product in the future, because my complexion has improved A LOT since using Dermalogica products, but I won&#x27;t buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> Product was new, and sealed.  No box.  Im not sure if Dermalogica has changed formula, smell a little different than my old Active Moist.  Works great though!</li>
            <li> Trust me when I tell you , I&#x27;ve used many different face creams,from the least expensive to the most with only moderate results. I have been using the Active moist that was recommended to me by an esthetician for almost a year now.   I have sensitive,T zone dry skin and this is the only product that has been consistent in keeping my face in check. Use it morning and night and you should see great results. If you&#x27;ve been in my situation,what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> Been using this moisturizer for over three years and it served me well...in Australia.  However, as I turned 30 this year and needed more specific nutrition to my &#x27;older&#x27; skin during harsher winters (moved to the Nordics), I decided to let go switch products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and the best price from this supplier. Added bonus were the the two free Dermologica gifts that came with the order.</li>
            <li> Best light moisturizer for middle aged skin and no pimples or clogged pores. Have used since about age 50 and now 56.</li>
            <li> I have been using Active Moist for 4 years. I love it, keeps my skin moist and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out from using it.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily and it is fantastic.  It is not greasy therefore it does not clog your pores.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite product from dermalogica so far.  I have used various products from this line for over a year and have been very pleased with everything.  Active moist is exactly what my face needs to blend my oily T-line.  It is light weight so it does not create excess oil and moisturizes so I do not get dry spots.  It is great in the morning before I apply a little powder and blush.  I no longer wear foundation thanks to the chrome white product line.  This product has worked out very well.</li>
            <li> After years of searching I have found the perfect moisturizer for my crazy sensitive combination face. I know the Dermalogica website recommends having your face mapped to pick the right products for you but I had a gift card and this moisturizer got really good reviews so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost it has a nice, light smell. It&#x27;s not overly chemical nor is it overly fruity/musky/earthy. It&#x27;s barely noticeable when you first apply it.&lt;br /&gt;Second, it may be a bit pricey but a little truly goes a long way. I use a penny to nickel sized amount(depending on the oily patch to dry skin ratio)I got a 3.4 oz tube about a month ago and the end is no where in sight.&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s just heavy enough to really feel like your skin is getting nice and moisturized but just light enough to leave a soft and smooth finish. Best of all it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very weird skin. It&#x27;s sensitive and prone to redness so a lot of products are too harsh. I tend to buy natural based products because they are free of the chemicals that really irritate my skin BUT I often find they don&#x27;t clean as well and I end up with a lot of acne in my T zone.&lt;br /&gt;The sides of my forehead, nose and cheek line are prone to dryness and sometimes flaking. So it&#x27;s really hard finding a product that combats oiliness, dryness, prevents irritation, keeps my skin moisturized, AND doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Despite the price I will definitely be sticking with this product and I look forward to trying other Dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for over 2 years now. I first came across this product with I purchased a set for normal/oily skin (face wash, moisturizer, toner and mask).  Out of all the products, the only one I continue to use is the moisturizer.  I have to be cautious with the products I use on my face because I am prone to breaking out very easily.  After using it moisturizes my face without an oily feeling and doesn&#x27;t create pumps on my face.  It is just the right amount of moisture for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this I used to use a moisturizer with spf made in Australia, but my face seemed oily and after awhile I started to notice pumps on my face.  The only thing is that it doesn&#x27;t have spf included, but for spf I use Eucerin Sensitive (recommended by my dermatologist) on top of the active moist and I am good to go.  With both I do not get an oily feeling.  I do feel that this is pricey, but if you can find on amazon at $30 for 3.4 fl oz. then that is a deal.  It also lasts about 6 months (pea size, no need to use more).</li>
            <li> Fairly thin formula. Similar to Lubriderm.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old woman that has oily to normal skin- I do suffer from occasional acne issues.  Most of the Dermalogica line I use is with the mediBac Clearing line - but I wanted something that had a little more moisturizing abilities.  This lotion is a good moisturizer that dries quickly and leaves skin feeling not oily.  There is an odor to the product that causes me to hold my breath when applying- the smell reminds me of a cleaning product - I think they were going for something that smelled herbal but missed the mark slightly.  The odor only last a moment and once lotion is dry is gone all together.  I follow up with the mattifier in the T-Zone when I know that I&#x27;m going to have a long day and shine is a concern.  Make up goes on nicely after this product.  Yes the product is pricey- I can&#x27;t lie and say that I use less of this item than of any other face lotion -but I will buy again since it works well and does not cause any excess oils or acne problems.</li>
            <li> A moisturizer that actually moisturizes! Very light weight, no oily/greasy residue.   Perfect for my oily/combination skin. Great for wearing under makeup or without. Just wish it had spf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years since an aestheitician recommended it. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so expensive in the stores, but I got it on here for like half the price! Love this product and did not notice any difference in quality between the one I bought here and the ones I&#x27;ve paid way more for at a retailer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light enough for oily skin, and effectively prevents dryness. Light and fresh-smelling, with lavender extract that soothes skin. I am a 29-year-old with very sensitive, breakout prone fair skin. I have been using for five years, and would recommend the whole Dermalogica line. Ever since I began using this moisturizer with the Special Cleansing gel, I get lots of compliments on my skin, which I thought I&#x27;d never hear in my life.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin that is sensitive from using Accutane a few years ago. I&#x27;ve tried MANY moisturizers that have just made my skin more oily. This one can&#x27;t be beat!  It&#x27;s worth every penny spent to have my face under control.</li>
            <li> Its just the way I expected. It&#x27;s amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Active Moist is a great light weight, non greasy moisturizer that I use at night in conjunction with my Obagi regimen.  I have used this product for over 15 yrs.  I have tried other store brands but always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is fake dermalogica. Consistancy, smell, and packaging are slightly off.</li>
            <li> lovely product. it&#x27;s always so great for my dry skin. and the service was super quick! thank you so much</li>
            <li> My mother recommended it. I was looking for a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t block my pores and did NOT have an SPF. This has worked wonderfully. Feels great!</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that keeps my skin properly moistirized all day.  As a surfer, my skin is subjected to harch south african sun and sea daily.  The product was received prof, packed with the box and tube both with the dermalogia seal..  Being in texas for few months i would have been lost and wrinkled due to dry airconditioned environment, which i am not used to..  This proof no matter how dry or harsh the environement... This procuct has allways worked perfectly for me..  Seller included some really great samples no charge. 3.4 fl oz sounds little but a little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> Only moisturizer I use! It&#x27;s pricey but my skin likes it better than drugstore brands, and they don&#x27;t add too many funky ingredients. I&#x27;m allergic to so many things that I&#x27;m not even sure of some of my allergies, but Dermalogica seems to work fine for me. This lasts me quite a while too.</li>
            <li> Finally a moisturizer for oily skin that makes your skin feel moisturized.  Normally I feel like i need to add more and more moisturizer when it&#x27;s oil free.  This works in one use but doesn&#x27;t make me oily.  LOVE all the Dermalogica stuff.</li>
            <li> An old favorite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;I Have been using this moisturizing lotion for years and I really do love it.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up ordering the wrong product, as I got in a hurry and didn&#x27;t read the front close enough. It is still a good product, feels nice and the service was great!</li>
            <li> Love how this moisturizer soaks right into my skin so that I am ready to put on foundation in just a few minutes after applying it...great product!  No greasy feeling either which is nice.</li>
            <li> Great products. Only wish they were a little less expensive. But in this case it is worth every penny. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dermalogica for years and have been so irritated that no retail store ever offers a discount. So I checked Amazon and of course they have it and at a discounted rate!!! Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> All genuine Dermalogica products have the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Original grey box with barcode sticker sealing the lid of the box&lt;br /&gt;2. Silver stay-fresh seal on the opening of the tube, same as most seals on a new jar of peanut butter or medicine/vitamin bottle&lt;br /&gt;3. If you are buying a larger size bottle with a pump top there will be a half barcode/ half dermalogica brand name sticker that connects the top of the bottle with the bottom of the lid, proving it has never been open&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These barcode stickers and seals are only put on by the dermalogica company. If your product does not have them YOU ARE GETTING A TAMPERED WITH, EXPIRED, or KNOCK-OFF PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please list the seller who sold the inferior product so we can avoid them! I love a good deal but these products are expensive and I don&#x27;t want anyone to loose their money on a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy these on amazon and ended up chickening out and paid the extra from a legitimate salon company because I didn&#x27;t want to get screwed over. Now I&#x27;m glad I did as I hope this info will help any ladies who are buying on amazon find the honest sellers and avoid the scammers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Product Review**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> A friend recommend this and now I&#x27;m hooked on it. It leaves my skin feeling smooth without being greasy. I have oily skin and I feel this helps cut down on my mid-day blotting. It also smells really nice.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer I have ever used.  Find it to be great for my sensitive, oily skin. Use morning and night.</li>
            <li> The wife says it&#x27;s the best year round moisturizer for sensitive skin she&#x27;s ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> Love that this lotion is so light.  I can use it during the day and night, and sometimes I mix it with the Dermalogica tinted lotion with SPF for day use.</li>
            <li> For those of us with oily skin - this is the only moisturizer to use.  I love it and use it daily and never break out from it.  I highly recommend this dermalogica product.  I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> My first experience with Dermalogica was at a high end spa for a facial.  They recommended Active Moist, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Amazon is the cheapest you can find this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it is the only moisturizer that is good for my super-sensitive skin.  Highly recommend this and their Special Cleansing Gel.</li>
            <li> Great cr√®me.  Smalls great and seems to do the trick.  I very much like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Would consider ordering again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Active Moist and was pleasantly surprised it was delivered prior to the expected date.  I was almost out of the moisturizer and was glad to see it arrive a few days early.&lt;br /&gt;Product was in original box with seal.  I have received products from other companies, that was not legit.&lt;br /&gt;This one is.</li>
            <li> I use the product for years and off and on use an other product. But still this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I love Dermalogica products.  They always feel so luxurious and great on my skin.  This was no different.  Great daily moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The Dermalogica was recommended by a woman in a high end make-up store. One 3.4 oz. bottle was $50.00. This is an incredible bargain and a perfect moisturizer for someone with dry skin and acne since it contains no oil. My daughter loves it. We will re-order often.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but works as expected</li>
            <li> Box did not have the usual seal of authencity</li>
            <li> Great product as always. Been using for years. Glad to have gotten a discount off retail price by buying on Amazon. Would be nice if it contained SPF, but odds are that would make it greasy enough that I&#x27;d no longer like it... So, that said, it&#x27;s perfect as is!</li>
            <li> Works well. No oily residue. I have very sensitive skin, this is one of the few products that I can use. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for a year and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Very upsetting. This was suppose to be new and when I got it, it looked tampered with. The safety seal had been opened already and the container about 2/3 full. Normally I have good experiences on Amazon but this was super disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It feels good on my face and keeps me looking young.</li>
            <li> Being 60 didn&#x27;t stop me from having oily skin, and I still am active swimming but chlorine can do a number on skin, Using oily lotion just added to the mess, This goes on and NO break out, I also use their calming mist.</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion. I have oily skin and this controls it while moisturizing wonderfully. I use it day and night, a little goes a very long way, there is no sticky or greasy feeling left behind. Love this product and will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, my skin is the best it&#x27;s been in years! Great for a hot Aussie sun, my skin feels hydrated all day, and is deliciously soft. It&#x27;s fragrance free, which means it doesn&#x27;t smell *great* when it goes on (the smell is a little like poster paint) , but absorbs quickly. Very light on the skin.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this moisturizer for a while and I don&#x27;t know why. (I think I was trying to find something comparable at a cheaper price) I LOVE this lotion! From the smell to the consistency, I think this is the perfect moisturizer. I recommend it to just about everyone I can. Its not a thick lotion, it&#x27;s just perfect for everyday use and leaves my skin feeling totally moisturized and amazing!  I don&#x27;t have oily skin, so i cant say that its good for oily skin. i do have more combination skin that is towards the dry side.  My only wish is that this had a sunscreen in it. Hopefully soon, they&#x27;ll add it. however, for now, I am happy and will use it forever!</li>
            <li> This product is great for oily skin.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent the shine we oilers get a few hours into the day, but it does prevent flaky skin in the winter, and moisturizes well.  Does not feel heavy at all either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference I have used Aveeno (several versions including age-defense), Jack Black daily (not the oil control, which is good for spot treatment but a terrible idea as an every day face lotion), Oil of Olay rejuvenate and Clinique Men M lotion.  The original aveeno age defense was my favorite but they changed it and messed it up completely.  Won&#x27;t go back.  Oil of Olay has a great feel but brings out my oils a little more around mid-day.  Jack Black is good, but only good in the moisturizing and oil mitigations categories, the two I care most about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product and Clinique are probably tied right now, and this one gives more bang for the buck, so I will continue using it, maybe switching off every few bottles to compare.  M lotion seems to be equal in moisture, slightly less efficient at preventing the oil at mid-day, and slightly better frangrance, which brings me to the only knock, and the reason for the 4 star rating.  Dermalogica has a slightly medicinal smell when applying.  I have never gotten a whiff of it after it&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s not scented, which may be a good thing if you are looking for a more pure product.  Anyway until someone tells me my face smells funny, I will continue to use Dermalogica with confidence.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin, and I suffer from adult acne, so it was difficult to find a product that would control the acne without drying out my skin or causing a reaction. I was first introduced to Dermalogica in a salon, and I loved it so much, I decided to pay the higher price for it. I use the Active Moist shown here, the Skin Clearing Wash and the Skin Prep Scrub. The cleanser is very mild, but it does a decent job mitigating the acne (although it doesn&#x27;t prevent it entirely). The moisturizer is not too heavy, absorbs well, and does a good job keeping my skin soft. I never observe any dryness or flakiness on my face. The scrub feels nice, but I don&#x27;t notice as significant a difference in my skin for better or worse when I use it. I suspect if I went without for awhile, I&#x27;d notice. I&#x27;ll have to run that experiment and get back to you. Still not sure the high price is worth it, but until I find a similar or better product that does the job, I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> i love this product. i have a tendency to breakout and this lotion is nice and light. I wear it day and night.</li>
            <li> This product gives your face and neck just the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy or messy. Feels great!</li>
            <li> This product is my lifesaver when it comes to a moisturizer.  It makes my skin look Fab and I do not breakout. You only have to apply a small amount to your face. This is my go to Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Using this product with the Dermal clay cleanser has help resolved my mid twenties acne and I&#x27;ve tried very single item on the market. This product works on my Asian combination oily/dry skin well and does not leave a residue. The formula is light and the smell is a very subtle botanical smell. One complaint I would have is I wish they made a bigger bottle!!</li>
            <li> Oil free moisture. Love dermalogica</li>
            <li> There was no free gift as advertised and the packaging was not like the picture, however the product itself was fine. I have been using Dermalogica Active Moist for 20 years and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Very good moisture i love it my face feels soft and smooth when i use it and not oily, very happy with Dermologica moisturizer :)</li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizer I ever use, and the price is good!</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin.  I have tried numerous over the counter and store bought products and have found the Dermalogica to be the best for my touchy skin.  The Active Moist facial moisturizer for me is the right amount of moisture without leaving any greasy or oily feeling to my skin.  I use all year round and have found it be especially useful during the warmer months when other creams may be a bit too heavy for the face.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product so glad amazon has it for less!! I highly recommend this product! I have acne/oily skin and does not cause me to breakout</li>
            <li> I loved this moisturizer! It&#x27;s a perfect light summer moisturizer, not greasy at all, and I enjoy the scent (no artificial fragrance according to the ingredient list). It gave me a good base to apply mineral makeup over. But I have extremely sensitive eczema-prone skin, and after about a week of using this new product I realized my face was getting red and irritated. I&#x27;m giving this moisturizer to my husband and I will go back to using the  Intensive Moisture Balance from Dermalogica (I would recommend that to anyone who battles eczema and dry skin).</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used this for few years now and my skin got so much better.</li>
            <li> Came on time and with seal.</li>
            <li> Awesome the only moisturizer that works for me!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and have had to deal with the &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; issue for so long. This moisturizer helps in that department. It really does moisturize and keeps the shiny face at bay for many hours.</li>
            <li> Received my active moist today in good condition with basic packaging (but w/o box).  For those living in hot climates, suggest checking mailbox in a timely manner as the product was very hot after a few hours in the unseasonably hot 100 degree weather we have been having in Chicago this week.</li>
            <li> I especially liked that it wasn&#x27;t greasy but, moisturized well.Great to use when mixing other Dermalogica products--like the night serum and the map 15.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years and like it, great for combination skin, no weird smell and never blocks pours. I still use a matte primer when going out since it doesnt get rid of oil, but it lets my skin breath. Wish it wasnt so expensive but it does last awhile, 6+ months.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for chronically oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this line of products.  Does the job, and won&#x27;t irritate. My cosmetologist swears by this whole line of products.</li>
            <li> New to this product, only been using about 2 months, so far I like very much.  A little goes along way, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great price and Quality</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost one year now. I have an oily forehead and drier cheeks, typical combination skin.  This product works well by keeping my oily skin shine-free while not over drying my cheeks.  I do however switch to the heavier creams in the dermalogica range for use on my cheeks during winter, but active moist works superbly on my forehead all year round!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year and I am happy with it. You need to use very little and it will cover the whole face,</li>
            <li> I own the dermalogica dermal clay cleanser, microfoliant, skin refining masque and active moist. By far this is one of my favorite products. I have had bad skin my whole life. I&#x27;ve tried to find a lotion that would not make my skin break out. This was the only product and product line that makes my skin look amazing.Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product has changed the health of my skin. Best moisturizer I have ever used. Wouldnt use anything else. It is very lightweight and does not feel sticky or oily. Great product, will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS</li>
            <li> This is the first moisturizer I ever tried that is actually pleasant, absorbed quickly, and doesn&#x27;t make me sweat the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I am 30 and struggle with oily/dry acne prone skin...and am prone to clogged pores. My esthetician suggested this for me. I use this in the morning and at night and I love it. It is not greasy, provides a thin layer of moisturize, and does not clog my pores or make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this company does not test on animals, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note, if my skin gets too dry from ..whatever..lol...I will mix a little of this with my foundation and it blends easily and helps.</li>
            <li> UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also on my shortlist of DM products to keep on buying. I use this when I feel oilier than normal, when I go out for a run etc. It gives me a really nice smooth skin and prevents breakouts. No SPF though. Would combine with SPF booster or BB cream with SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLDER REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product along with a bunch of other dermatologica products for my everyday routines and can honestly say I am seeing great results, but am not sure if they can be attributed to this particular product or the whole suit of them. After my pregnancy I developed a lot of dark spots and sebum production seems to have increased resulting in lots of outbreaks in the t zone. All these issues have been satisfactorily addressed. Here is my routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Wash with DM essential cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;DM oil control lotion&lt;br /&gt;Murad rapid age spot serum AND DM c12 bright serum&lt;br /&gt;Either DM dynamic skin recovery moisteurizer or DM active moist (the former if i feel a bit dry)&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;Makeup as usual&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening&lt;br /&gt;DM wash&lt;br /&gt;DM daily microfoliant&lt;br /&gt;Murad and c12 serums&lt;br /&gt;DM pure night lightening cream&lt;br /&gt;DM total eye care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week I use a DM sebum clearing mask&lt;br /&gt;Every two weeks or as needed I use a chemical peel, followed by DM power recovery masque to restore moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Map15 generator dust mixed with moisteurizer as needed but rarely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are massive. Well worth the cost as I no longer need laser spot removal as I thought.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful if your skin produces too much oil. It is moisturizing without the oily effect that most facial lotions give you</li>
            <li> Feels and smells lovely! This is not a heavy formula at all. Some may find that it does not moisturize enough, but I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item with active tone and special cleanser, this three products are very generic and applicable to normal face types. I never had any acne problem, I never had any skin problem before, I was using Babe until now and my skin was perfect even when I was at 17s I never had any acne problem. But since I started using this product my skin became awful, it is unbelievable, I paid a lot of money and I can not use it, if I attempt to use it, in 1-2 days I start having at least 4-5 strange acnes all over my face. I strongly not recommend anyone to buy it.</li>
