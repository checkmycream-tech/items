            <li>This glaze is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>It is not at all the result I used to get with beautiful color and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>delivery was great, everything was intact.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I can order it on line and buy in quanity.    </li>
            <li>Glad I could still find this great product on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>but I honestly just put it on parts that i think I&#x27;m gonna be showing with the way I style my hair, this way it lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>It ends up giving it a nice chestnut color.  </li>
            <li>Works well, price was good and was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the box, I noticed that there was a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>My hair is looking great again and the TG keeps the highlights beautifully tinted even though I only add it to my conditioner twice per week!</li>
            <li>It seemed more runny and</li>
            <li>i use this product after i shampoo and condition and it makes my hair color brighter and more \\&quot;alive.\\</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Many people say this product can make your hair look greasy</li>
            <li>John Frieda Color Glaze Radiant Red is amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Okay, so this stuff was on sale once at the drugstore for like $2</li>
            <li>After using this product, i not only found that my hair was a deeper and more chocolatey brown color (which is awesome)</li>
            <li>I searched the internet and found Amazon carried my favorite product and I stocked up...</li>
            <li>This red color glaze is the best product I have found in years.  </li>
            <li>I love it......</li>
            <li>The bronze hair mascara I purchased for $3.00 did much more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and LOVE IT for my hair, but when John Freida stopped its manufacture I searched for it on line.</li>
            <li>THANKS!!!!</li>
            <li>While it sounds like a great product in theory, I wish the greasy aspect could be fixed.</li>
            <li>I have bought plenty of items from Amazon and loved them and thought about writing a review because I myself find them very helpful...</li>
            <li>This, combined with a couple of other products all together made my hair look way awesome.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and been happy with it.</li>
            <li>I received this product and was excited to use it.  </li>
            <li>but I am confident if I had used it the first wash after getting my hair dyed the color</li>
            <li>John Frieda stopped production of this item, which was originally ~$6.00.  </li>
            <li>but it was also super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Radiant Red Luminous Color Glaze a couple times a week and loved the results.</li>
            <li>but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s pretty freaking cool.</li>
            <li>It provides enough color that the line between my gray roots and the red haircolor is greatly blurred.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It can not be found locally any more.</li>
            <li>I left it on longer than the bottle said because I did read online reviews that said that it worked better if that was done.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, especially in these lean economic times.</li>
            <li>I love this product and only wish i could still purchase in the U.K. Service is very good from this supplier but postage from America may mean that future purchase may be prohibited</li>
            <li>finally this red head is having way more fun!</li>
            <li>you will be able to tell the difference once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>it it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>but you just need to wash it out really well....</li>
            <li>In 3 minutes you revive everything, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, or do it really often to keep up the color.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really helped retain my color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It did absolutely NOTHING for the roots that were showing.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t imagine why John Frieda discontinued this fantastic product to maintain red hair!</li>
            <li>No fading of the color, and I actually paid 5 times the original price, just to get the last one available.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other mouse or gel i&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>One in the shower and the other on the counter. :]</li>
            <li>I decided to put it in first, yes first, and wash my hair, even that left an oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Was able to find a few bottles but the price was raised FOUR TIMES its normal price!</li>
            <li>The stuff I ordered here was more orange than red, and sure enough closer inspection of the ingredient revealed this stuff was missing Maroon color from the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It said it was brand new and unopened.</li>
            <li>This product is now unfortunately hard to find -- and at such a good price.  </li>
            <li>even in some lighting my hair looks like an ugly gray color, but by using this, it keeps everything to a really warm toned brunette look which I just love.</li>
            <li>My hair color fades very quickly, and loses it&#x27;s pretty color and some shine.  </li>
            <li>Wow, no comparison!</li>
            <li>&quot; it turned my bright red hair ORANGE (the day before vacation non the less)!!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this stuff for nearly three years and it had gotten to where I could not find it it any store or on-line except for here.  </li>
            <li>I unpacked all the bottles and put them away ready for when my very last bottle of store bought ran out.  </li>
            <li>It says to use enough to really coat all of your hair</li>
            <li>When I finally pulled a bottle to use it, I noticed right away the scent was different as well as the color of the bottle and cap.  </li>
            <li>I switched back to Kerastase products and included Ted Gibson conditioner in captivating copper, which I use by adding a small amount to my Kerastase condtioner.</li>
            <li>But, this helps keep the color and vibrancy that I do not naturally have as much of any longer.</li>
            <li>After the third incident I was convinced it was the glaze since I had made no other changes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The price was a bargain compared to the normal $9.99 I typically paid</li>
            <li> Im not sure how others finally got the greasy look to wash out because I certainly couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> after using my normal wash, condition, Glaze routine, I noticed after my hair dried it looked as though I hadn&#x27;t washed it in two weeks</li>
            <li> I use the glaze to stretch the time between my haircolor appointments now (trying to save money by going to the salon less often) - gray roots are far, far less noticeable if you use this glaze faithfully each time you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> The TG colored conditioner is by far less costly since it works so well</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps it was some strange event</li>
            <li> Also, when i get out of the shower, i put some on my hair again and blow dry with a diffuser</li>
            <li> All I can say is it made my hair extremely dry and gave me split ends, and didnt do ANYTHING AT ALL to help my color.</li>
            <li> Redhead&#x27;s color fades faster than any other color.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want the other bottle but don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
            <li> When I dried my hair, it was a little brighter, but only on the ends.  </li>
            <li> Red hair is hard to keep up.  </li>
            <li> The bottle will probably last me at least 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> I mix it with the dark brown glaze.  </li>
            <li> I am desperate for the original red product but will not waste my money again on Glaze from Impossible Discounts because there is NO way</li>
            <li> and I use a very small amount only twice per week.</li>
            <li> It smelled and looked as if it might have been opened and used previously.  </li>
            <li> The only negative comment I have is unrelated to the product performance, but connected to stores: WHY doesn&#x27;t Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc etc sell this anymore IN the stores, much less offer it on their websites??????!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like dying your hair a little</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> leave it in for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> When I got my bottle it had been half USED!</li>
            <li> and... Holy cow my hair has been restored!!!</li>
            <li> My hair gets dull or too yellow-orange looking without this glaze.</li>
            <li> I mean I could understand a color change, but John Frieda is not going to sell a product that is so oily your hair looks like you put baby oil in it.</li>
            <li> I ordered four bottles of this Red Glaze from Impossible Discounts through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is obviously not as bright as it was before Ulta damaged it</li>
            <li> I had initially skipped over the TG and went for the JF because of reviews and price but in the end I wasted my money on the JF products which are some of the worst I have ever used!</li>
            <li> but instead is a rip-off.  </li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> and I thought it couldn&#x27;t be any worse than it already was...</li>
            <li> It has very subtle color payoff</li>
            <li> Scores of (faux) redheads will keel over in a dead faint if this product ever goes off the market!!</li>
            <li> The color boost wasn&#x27;t enough to divert my attention from how awful my hair felt.</li>
            <li> and I bought it because i was mega bored with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have some gray hair randomly throughout my head, and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> After using these products for 2 weeks, my highlights still weren&#x27;t evenly tinted plus my hair was probably in the worst condition it has ever been in!</li>

            <li> I ordered four bottles of this Red Glaze from Impossible Discounts through Amazon.  I have been using this stuff for nearly three years and it had gotten to where I could not find it it any store or on-line except for here.  The price was a bargain compared to the normal $9.99 I typically paid but now I know why.  I unpacked all the bottles and put them away ready for when my very last bottle of store bought ran out.  When I finally pulled a bottle to use it, I noticed right away the scent was different as well as the color of the bottle and cap.  The stuff I ordered here was more orange than red, and sure enough closer inspection of the ingredient revealed this stuff was missing Maroon color from the ingredients.  But that is not where the differences ended.  It seemed more runny and after using my normal wash, condition, Glaze routine, I noticed after my hair dried it looked as though I hadn&#x27;t washed it in two weeks it was so oily!  I had to rewash twice to get the oil out.  I thought perhaps it was some strange event but after using it again, the same thing happened!  After the third incident I was convinced it was the glaze since I had made no other changes.  I decided to put it in first, yes first, and wash my hair, even that left an oily residue.  So I am now convinced this is not a legitimate John Frieda product but instead is a rip-off.  I mean I could understand a color change, but John Frieda is not going to sell a product that is so oily your hair looks like you put baby oil in it. Because I had thrown away the packaging weeks ago, I can&#x27;t return it and am out the money.  I am desperate for the original red product but will not waste my money again on Glaze from Impossible Discounts because there is NO way it it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and only wish i could still purchase in the U.K. Service is very good from this supplier but postage from America may mean that future purchase may be prohibited</li>
            <li> Not happy. Each time I use it (which has been twice now) after using both the [[ASIN:B000GCWP28 John Freida Radiant Red Shampoo 8.45 oz.]] and its accompanying conditioner, it has left my hair feeling like hay.    The color boost wasn&#x27;t enough to divert my attention from how awful my hair felt.</li>
            <li> i use this product after i shampoo and condition and it makes my hair color brighter and more \\&quot;alive.\\&quot; It doesn&#x27;t however make my hair softer. I leave that to my conditioner. Also, when i get out of the shower, i put some on my hair again and blow dry with a diffuser and it makes my hair so curly and the color brighter. It works better than any other mouse or gel i&#x27;ve used before. I get so many compliments on my hair. I love this product. Buy 2. One in the shower and the other on the counter. :]</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, especially in these lean economic times. It provides enough color that the line between my gray roots and the red haircolor is greatly blurred. I use the glaze to stretch the time between my haircolor appointments now (trying to save money by going to the salon less often) - gray roots are far, far less noticeable if you use this glaze faithfully each time you wash your hair. The only negative comment I have is unrelated to the product performance, but connected to stores: WHY doesn&#x27;t Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc etc sell this anymore IN the stores, much less offer it on their websites??????!!  Glad I could still find this great product on Amazon.  Scores of (faux) redheads will keel over in a dead faint if this product ever goes off the market!!</li>
            <li> Many people say this product can make your hair look greasy but you just need to wash it out really well....Im not sure how others finally got the greasy look to wash out because I certainly couldn&#x27;t. While it sounds like a great product in theory, I wish the greasy aspect could be fixed.</li>
            <li> John Frieda Color Glaze Radiant Red is amazing!!!  My hair color fades very quickly, and loses it&#x27;s pretty color and some shine.  This glaze is just wonderful.  In 3 minutes you revive everything, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, or do it really often to keep up the color.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this product. Or anything from this seller. When I got my bottle it had been half USED! It said it was brand new and unopened. The product didnt work anyways. All I can say is it made my hair extremely dry and gave me split ends, and didnt do ANYTHING AT ALL to help my color.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this stuff was on sale once at the drugstore for like $2 and I bought it because i was mega bored with my hair. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, it&#x27;s pretty freaking cool. It&#x27;s almost like dying your hair a little but it fades quickly. After using this product, i not only found that my hair was a deeper and more chocolatey brown color (which is awesome) but it was also super shiny and smooth. This, combined with a couple of other products all together made my hair look way awesome. I still use this product. I have some gray hair randomly throughout my head, and even in some lighting my hair looks like an ugly gray color, but by using this, it keeps everything to a really warm toned brunette look which I just love. What you do is shampoo and condition, and then when that&#x27;s all done, go ahead and put this stuff in your hair. It says to use enough to really coat all of your hair but I honestly just put it on parts that i think I&#x27;m gonna be showing with the way I style my hair, this way it lasts longer.  leave it in for a few minutes. you will be able to tell the difference once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Red hair is hard to keep up.  This helps.  I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  Thank goodness I could find it on line.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has very subtle color payoff however, it did make my hair glossy and brightened up the color a bit. I really helped retain my color.</li>
            <li> Since ULTA no longer carries John Frieda Hair Glaze as they are trying to sell their home brand which is inferior - I searched the internet and found Amazon carried my favorite product and I stocked up...delivery was great, everything was intact.  Thanks! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought the entire line of red enhancing John Freida products including shampoo, conditioner and glaze. After using these products for 2 weeks, my highlights still weren&#x27;t evenly tinted plus my hair was probably in the worst condition it has ever been in! I switched back to Kerastase products and included Ted Gibson conditioner in captivating copper, which I use by adding a small amount to my Kerastase condtioner. Wow, no comparison! My hair is looking great again and the TG keeps the highlights beautifully tinted even though I only add it to my conditioner twice per week! I had initially skipped over the TG and went for the JF because of reviews and price but in the end I wasted my money on the JF products which are some of the worst I have ever used! The TG colored conditioner is by far less costly since it works so well and I use a very small amount only twice per week. The bottle will probably last me at least 6 months to a year.</li>
            <li> This red color glaze is the best product I have found in years.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find.  I can go 3 months between salon coloring with this product, colors the roots, keeps my hair the same color constantly.  I love it......</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and been happy with it. It can not be found locally any more. I&#x27;m happy I can order it on line and buy in quanity.    It works well to keep that red tint in my hair. Redhead&#x27;s color fades faster than any other color.    My hair gets dull or too yellow-orange looking without this glaze.</li>
            <li> I received this product and was excited to use it.  Upon opening the box, I noticed that there was a very strong smell.  When I took the bottle out of the box, I noticed some red on the bottle.  It smelled and looked as if it might have been opened and used previously.  About a 1/4 of the bottle was gone.  I proceeded to use the product on my hair as directed.  I left it on longer than the bottle said because I did read online reviews that said that it worked better if that was done.  When I dried my hair, it was a little brighter, but only on the ends.  It did absolutely NOTHING for the roots that were showing.  I would not use this again.  The bronze hair mascara I purchased for $3.00 did much more.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Radiant Red Luminous Color Glaze a couple times a week and loved the results. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores in my area anymore. When I stumbled upon it at Amazon I purchased two bottles. Perhaps they have changed the formula. When I use it now it makes my hair look dirty/greasy. It is not at all the result I used to get with beautiful color and shiny hair. I can only use it on the weekend when I am not going to see anyone. I don&#x27;t even want the other bottle but don&#x27;t know what to do with it.</li>
            <li> I have bought plenty of items from Amazon and loved them and thought about writing a review because I myself find them very helpful...but then I never do. So me writing this review says quite a bit!  I used Ulta&#x27;s red hair glaze while I was waiting for my John Frieda brand to come in the mail.Ya...my hair was not \\&quot;Vivid\\&quot; it turned my bright red hair ORANGE (the day before vacation non the less)!!! Yesterday my John Frieda red hair glaze came in the mail and I thought it couldn&#x27;t be any worse than it already was... and... Holy cow my hair has been restored!!! It is obviously not as bright as it was before Ulta damaged it but I am confident if I had used it the first wash after getting my hair dyed the color would have lasted longer. Because of this product I am no longer questioning staying a red head...finally this red head is having way more fun!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imagine why John Frieda discontinued this fantastic product to maintain red hair! No fading of the color, and I actually paid 5 times the original price, just to get the last one available.  Susan Ajnderson</li>
            <li> I dont see any difference to my dyed red hair after this. I bought it in hopes it&#x27;d give my hair a boost once it started to fade but all I noticed what my shower curtains were getting redder.</li>
            <li> John Frieda stopped production of this item, which was originally ~$6.00.  Now, you too can buy hair glaze for $35.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and LOVE IT for my hair, but when John Freida stopped its manufacture I searched for it on line. Was able to find a few bottles but the price was raised FOUR TIMES its normal price! I&#x27;ll just have to learn to get along without it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why they quit making this stuff. Works well, price was good and was so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I am 51 and not yet at a place that I need to dye my hair.  But, this helps keep the color and vibrancy that I do not naturally have as much of any longer. I mix it with the dark brown glaze.  It ends up giving it a nice chestnut color.  This product is now unfortunately hard to find -- and at such a good price.  THANKS!!!!</li>
