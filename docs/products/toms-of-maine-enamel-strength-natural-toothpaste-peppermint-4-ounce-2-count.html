    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very impressed with this whitening toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that upon trying it again, I&#x27;ve had a change of opinion.</li>
            <li>My teeth and mouth felt great after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine has always had great toothpastes and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>Foremost, it does a great job of cleaning my teeth, and because it has mineral fluoride included, it will continue to protect my teeth between cleanings.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant taste.  </li>
            <li>While brushing the peppermint taste was pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It had a pleasant mint taste and not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>If you want to feel good about buying from a good company, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>If I can get a good sale on it, I stock up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I felt good about the ingredients and the fact that it is made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>I will gladly spend my money with a company like that!</li>
            <li>Happily, it tastes fine.  </li>
            <li>The best that I can say at this point is it tastes OK to me, no allergic reactions of any sort, no unpleasant aspects, except</li>
            <li>This Tom&#x27;s toothpaste has a really nice minty flavor.</li>
            <li>One camp declares it poisnous and another claims its safe and good for teeth.  </li>
            <li>The peppermint oil is perfect, not too strong and not artificial tasting.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I gave this another</li>
            <li>texture was okay.</li>
            <li>Uh, interesting.  </li>
            <li>I just unscrewed the top to sniff it, and it smells like pepperment.  </li>
            <li>Many of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes that I have used do not have fluoride in them, so that sets this one apart for me.</li>
            <li>I am more of a spearmint flavor fan, but enjoyed the refreshing feeling of using this peppermint toothpaste that is geared toward strengthening enamel.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed brushing with this toothpaste, it has a discernible mintyness and zing with the peppermint oil that I like.</li>
            <li>My favorite, the [[ASIN:B00JUJ17R2</li>
            <li>and my mouth had a very clean feel.  </li>
            <li>This natural toothpaste tastes really good and has a nice non-chalky consistency.</li>
            <li>I prefer a mild mint toothpaste, I currently use Crest &amp;#34;Original Paste&amp;#34; which is delightful.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good toothpaste; I don&#x27;t enjoy the taste much.</li>
            <li>Although you get the peppermint sensation while brushing, it is very mild.  </li>
            <li>It has a very mild mint taste, and a noticeable aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice bit of foam and tastes clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It tasted even more strongly and freshly minty than I&#x27;m used to with the baking-soda paste.  </li>
            <li>For me, I need to use something that is SLS free.</li>
            <li>, I use several of their toothpastes, so I was happy to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s thoughtfully lists its ingredients, their sources, and their purposes.</li>
            <li>To me, it tastes like a cheap tea bag smells-the scent of Orange Pekoe dust.  </li>
            <li>This new &amp;#34;Enamel Strength&amp;#34; version is part of a somewhat baffling proliferation of toothpastes from Tom&#x27;s of Maine, all of which are wonderful in subtly different ways.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly minty for fresh breath, but still works well, which I don&#x27;t always feel that natural toothpaste does.</li>
            <li>I have become more aware of where products are made and that does affect my decisions on what to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their mouthwash is fine, the deodorant does not work for me, and my kids liked the children&#x27;s toothpaste when they were young.  </li>
            <li>It did seem to clean my teeth</li>
            <li>After using for a week, I felt that my mouth was exceptionally clean.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term effectiveness of the &amp;#34;enamel strengthening&amp;#34; of the toothpaste, but it is a pleasant paste to use for daily brushing.</li>
            <li>First of all, the mintiness is much better and for me that is what gives me the fresh feeling after brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as sweet as a brand like Crest</li>
            <li>It seems like just good basic toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I love Tom&#x27;s peppermint Whole Care toothpaste for</li>
            <li>So when I was offered the opportunity to try their Enamel Strength Natural toothpaste, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste foams nicely and cleans teeth adequately.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very good natural toothpaste that will clean your teeth and gives you that extra fluoride protection.</li>
            <li>In texture this is a very soft, smooth, almost gooey paste, more like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Nice light minty flavor without that gritty feeling that paste often has.</li>
            <li>It gets my teeth nice and smooth and seems to get my teeth whiter than my regular brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;m glad I tried this new on, in the end</li>
            <li>Flouride is very good for your teeth and that this product seems to have a little more than their standard formulation.  </li>
            <li>It tastes like other mint toothpastes and leaves a pleasant aftertaste</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone looking for a slightly more natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li>A plus is that there are no artificial sweeteners, unless you count xylitol, a low-calorie sweetener which is supposed to help in remineralization of enamel.</li>
            <li>And I appreciate that there&#x27;s no artificial dyes or sweeteners.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s Enamel Strength Natural Toothpaste hits most of these.  </li>
            <li>I like to have the peppermint taste linger on to keep my mouth feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s also leaves my mouth fresh.  </li>
            <li>states &amp;#34;whitening | fresh breath&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try for those looking for an enamel strengthening toothpaste.</li>
            <li>and I was convinced for years that he is right.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did clean my teeth real well though.</li>
            <li>But it is a very nice light tasting toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t leave a bitter or gritty aftereffect.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, like all Tom&#x27;s this peppermint-flavored gel is strongly and refreshingly flavored (peppermint), while being nowhere as sweet as the big traditional brands.</li>
            <li>, this new enamel strength has fluoride which the original one that I used does not.</li>
            <li>the difference here is the inclusion of mineral fluorspar as a source of fluoride, which is claimed to help strengthen tooth enamel more than the regular [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I still enjoyed the experience of brushing with it, and it left my mouth feeling ultra-clean.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t-my husband noticed the tea-taste, my son said it tasted funny, and my daughter spit it out almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use Sensodyne whitening, so naturally that does a better job of whitening my teeth whereas this is enamel strengthening.</li>
            <li>The mint is strong enough to leave a lasting scent and keeps your breath cool and pleasant long after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say that I have loved Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste when I&#x27;ve tried it in the past.</li>
            <li>It is smoother, relatively palatable, and more bubbly - more like a conventional toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh and though it&#x27;s not much different than other toothpastes, this one definitely leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve done a good job brushing your fangs after every use.</li>
            <li>One thing that I really liked about it is that my mouth feels a little like when I brush my teeth with my Sonic toothbrush--cleaner than when I use my regular--manual--toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>really tell if my tooth enamel has improved with 2 brushings, but</li>
            <li>appreciate that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;enamel strengthening&amp;#34; but really I have no way to tell.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, and not gritty.  </li>
            <li>There is some foaming, but not so much that it starts dribbling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like about the product</li>
            <li>It cleans well, and I can&#x27;t vouch for the strength of my enamel, but the toothpaste seems gentle.</li>
            <li>immediate reaction was there seemed to be more of a baking-soda dryness in my mouth right after brushing my teeth, but that wasn&#x27;t such a big deal.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know of many other manufacturers who list every ingredient, its purpose, and its source</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>This Tom&#x27;s of Maine Enamel Peppermint toothpaste was too strong, bitter and sharp-tasting for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really do an objective or even subjective test on my own teeth that my enamel is getting stronger day by day, but I can tell you about some other qualities,  </li>
            <li>It tastes more natural than other brands.</li>
            <li>This enamel one basically retains all the great qualities of the regular one with a little extra flouride.</li>
            <li>(Side note: pretty much every toothpaste as well as regular US drinking water has</li>
            <li>It tastes fine and cleans well, but unfortunately, it has SLS, sodium laurel sulfate, which is linked to many health issues.</li>
            <li>Also, the consistency and grittiness is so much better now than my past experiences with Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;ll stick with my original if only because it&#x27;s SO much cheaper (this new one is more expensive AND</li>
            <li>but I will certainly check with my dentist at my next checkup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I would certainly consider a purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s]], has a much more dry, scrubby feel, by comparison; this one is very wet and foamy.</li>
            <li>I always wanted to like the natural, healthier toothpaste</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m too old school, but when I use a mint toothpaste I want it to slap me in the face and call me</li>
            <li>It may be that I am sensitive to this.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that Tom&#x27;s is using it.</li>
            <li>I stop getting them so, if you are sensitive, like I am, you should probably stay away from this.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use and see if the enamel strengthening also helps with sensitive teeth as well.</li>
            <li>And after rinsing my mouth when done, the peppermint taste has almost completely dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But perhaps the biggest advantages of the Tom&#x27;s are the natural ingredients, including fluoride, and that it is ADA approved.</li>
            <li>but when I saw that Tom&#x27;s had an all natural enamel strengthening toothpaste that advertised it also whitens and freshens breath, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if there is anything different with my enamel although my teeth are healthy overall.</li>
            <li>It will go into the cabinet for when we run out of toothpaste, and we will go back to our more pleasantly flavored (and less expensive!)</li>
            <li>It does have a gritty feel (which I enjoy) and doesn&#x27;t foam as much as conventional toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t gritty or anything, the actual paste was decent to use...</li>
            <li>Too slight because I mostly tasted plain paste.</li>
            <li>Not for any particular reason other than momentum.</li>
            <li>And, if I had used it long enough I probably would see some whitening because my teeth were getting sensitive after a week of use.</li>
            <li>The Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel harsh like my regular brand, yet I get the exact results....</li>
            <li>Considering Tom&#x27;s isn&#x27;t using any artificial sweeteners, I expected this toothpaste might not be that pleasant to taste.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> appreciate that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;enamel strengthening&amp;#34; but really I have no way to tell.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, and not gritty.  </li>
            <li> There is some foaming, but not so much that it starts dribbling out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like about the product</li>
            <li> It cleans well, and I can&#x27;t vouch for the strength of my enamel, but the toothpaste seems gentle.</li>
            <li> immediate reaction was there seemed to be more of a baking-soda dryness in my mouth right after brushing my teeth, but that wasn&#x27;t such a big deal.</li>

            <li> It tastes more natural than other brands.</li>
            <li> This enamel one basically retains all the great qualities of the regular one with a little extra flouride.</li>

            <li> I always wanted to like the natural, healthier toothpaste</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too old school, but when I use a mint toothpaste I want it to slap me in the face and call me</li>
            <li> It may be that I am sensitive to this.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that Tom&#x27;s is using it.</li>
            <li> I stop getting them so, if you are sensitive, like I am, you should probably stay away from this.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use and see if the enamel strengthening also helps with sensitive teeth as well.</li>
            <li> And after rinsing my mouth when done, the peppermint taste has almost completely dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But perhaps the biggest advantages of the Tom&#x27;s are the natural ingredients, including fluoride, and that it is ADA approved.</li>
            <li> but when I saw that Tom&#x27;s had an all natural enamel strengthening toothpaste that advertised it also whitens and freshens breath, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if there is anything different with my enamel although my teeth are healthy overall.</li>
            <li> It will go into the cabinet for when we run out of toothpaste, and we will go back to our more pleasantly flavored (and less expensive!)</li>
            <li> It does have a gritty feel (which I enjoy) and doesn&#x27;t foam as much as conventional toothpastes.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t gritty or anything, the actual paste was decent to use...</li>
            <li> Too slight because I mostly tasted plain paste.</li>
            <li> Not for any particular reason other than momentum.</li>

            <li> Considering Tom&#x27;s isn&#x27;t using any artificial sweeteners, I expected this toothpaste might not be that pleasant to taste.  </li>

            <li> think the company has come a long way to improve upon the quality of the product over the years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an AquaFresh man for as long as I can remember.</li>

            <li> I do not think it does anything different than any other tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> Note that the tube is significantly smaller for this product than for other Tom&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t give you the long breath freshness of other harsher toothpastes so if that is something you like this one will disappoint.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Toothpastes are hard to review in my opinion because I think you need to be a scientist to prove some of the claims they advertise on the box.  I have no clue if this strengthens my enamel.  My teeth are bad.  I have multiple cavities and crowns.  They hurt with hots and colds.  Some of my crowns hurt when I floss.  Bottom line is that this toothpaste did not change any of this.  It has a pleasant taste.  Unfortunately it does not make my breathe fresh for very long.  It also doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for the stains on my teeth.  So it is what it is.  I do not think it does anything different than any other tooth paste.  If you want to feel good about buying from a good company, this is the way to go.  If you don&#x27;t care about your toothpaste, I recommend going with a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say that I have loved Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste when I&#x27;ve tried it in the past. I always wanted to like the natural, healthier toothpaste but it always left me disappointed and not very refreshed - like it was just a bland mixture of baking soda, salt and a touch of flavoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say that upon trying it again, I&#x27;ve had a change of opinion. First of all, the mintiness is much better and for me that is what gives me the fresh feeling after brushing. Also, the consistency and grittiness is so much better now than my past experiences with Tom&#x27;s. It has a nice bit of foam and tastes clean and fresh. My teeth and mouth felt great after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not qualified to say whether or not this will do anything to improve my enamel but I will certainly check with my dentist at my next checkup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the company has come a long way to improve upon the quality of the product over the years and I&#x27;m glad I gave this another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Considering Tom&#x27;s isn&#x27;t using any artificial sweeteners, I expected this toothpaste might not be that pleasant to taste.  Happily, it tastes fine.  It&#x27;s not as sweet as a brand like Crest but that isn&#x27;t a bad thing in my view.  It&#x27;s simple and missing artificial flavors and colors.  It seems like just good basic toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Toms toothpaste for a while. Pleasantly minty for fresh breath, but still works well, which I don&#x27;t always feel that natural toothpaste does. I would recommend to anyone looking for a slightly more natural toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Flouride is very good for your teeth and that this product seems to have a little more than their standard formulation.  I can&#x27;t really do an objective or even subjective test on my own teeth that my enamel is getting stronger day by day, but I can tell you about some other qualities,  I love Tom&#x27;s peppermint Whole Care toothpaste for it&#x27;s pleasing &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; (not sugary) and low suds factor.  The peppermint oil is perfect, not too strong and not artificial tasting.  If I can get a good sale on it, I stock up.  This enamel one basically retains all the great qualities of the regular one with a little extra flouride.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for toothpaste that says it strengthens enamel. This Tom&#x27;s toothpaste has a really nice minty flavor. It tastes more natural than other brands. It is nice that it doesn&#x27;t have artificial dyes or sweeteners. It has fluoride derived from fluorspar. I will keep using this brand.</li>
            <li> Hubby likes it, but I was very disappointed to see that it contains fluoride.  It says it on the box, and I should have paid more attention when ordering, but I ASSUMED (stupidly) that Tom&#x27;s would have made it without fluoride.</li>
            <li> My two main concerns about natural toothpaste in the past have been bad taste and lack of ADA approval.  Tom&#x27;s has overcome both with this toothpaste.  It tastes like other mint toothpastes and leaves a pleasant aftertaste afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box clearly has ADA approved marked on it and its active ingredients are similar to other comparable mainstream toothpastes.  If I can get the same active ingredient without extra unnecessary chemicals, why would I choose anything else?</li>
            <li> The best that I can say at this point is it tastes OK to me, no allergic reactions of any sort, no unpleasant aspects, except sometimes I noticed afterwards a feeling like my mouth and teeth were &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; with something. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s an actual coating or if it&#x27;s the aftertaste of the flavoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to tell if the enamel thing is working yet. A plus is that there are no artificial sweeteners, unless you count xylitol, a low-calorie sweetener which is supposed to help in remineralization of enamel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t confirm the claims of this toothpaste being a &amp;#34;natural enamel strengthening&amp;#34; product, but I can say this toothpaste worked well.  It left my mouth feeling clean.  While brushing the peppermint taste was pleasant. However, there is an aftertaste that took some time to get accustomed to the taste.  My husband disliked the taste so much he only used it twice.  Again, the toothpaste works well, but the after taste may be a turnoff to some people.</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was skeptical at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It had a pleasant mint taste and not too overpowering.  It did seem to clean my teeth well and my mouth had a very clean feel.  After using for a week, I felt that my mouth was exceptionally clean.  There was no possible way for me to determine if the enamel on my teeth was strengthened, but I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt good about the ingredients and the fact that it is made in the USA.  I have become more aware of where products are made and that does affect my decisions on what to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this toothpaste is expensive, but considering the benefits, I would certainly consider a purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I must admit I like gel over paste in a toothpaste. It usually takes me about a week to get used to a paste whenever I decide to try a new one. However, I just couldn&#x27;t get used to the taste of this Tom&#x27;s of Maine peppermint paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The peppermint is very slight. Too slight because I mostly tasted plain paste. It left a bad taste in my mouth, causing me to drink a lot of water after brushing to get rid of the taste. Since I&#x27;ll brush my teeth if I have a bad taste in my mouth, having a toothpaste that leaves a bad taste is not what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did clean my teeth real well though. And, if I had used it long enough I probably would see some whitening because my teeth were getting sensitive after a week of use. That&#x27;s usually caused by the whitening ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paste isn&#x27;t for me because of the taste, but it does do the job it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too old school, but when I use a mint toothpaste I want it to slap me in the face and call me Sally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture was okay. Not too gritty. Not too creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t really tell if my tooth enamel has improved with 2 brushings, but we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re into Tom&#x27;s of Maine products, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I like this toothpaste a lot.  The peppermint tastes natural and is subtle compared to other brands.  It does contain fluoride and that is a matter I struggle with.  One camp declares it poisnous and another claims its safe and good for teeth.  My brother in law believes it is poison and I was convinced for years that he is right.  I have had some molars crack in the last few years and can&#x27;t help but wonder if using a fluoride toothpaste would have made a difference there.  The dentist who is repairing my molars obviously believes in fluoride because she includes fluoride application after cleanings.  But can simply brushing with it then rinsing actually help?  Who knows.  Anyway, I do like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good toothpaste; I don&#x27;t enjoy the taste much. There&#x27;s not much flavor, though I see it includes peppermint oil.  Uh, interesting.  I just unscrewed the top to sniff it, and it smells like pepperment.  Not a strong flavor while brushing though.  One thing that I really liked about it is that my mouth feels a little like when I brush my teeth with my Sonic toothbrush--cleaner than when I use my regular--manual--toothbrush.  And I appreciate that there&#x27;s no artificial dyes or sweeteners.  (Toothpaste has sweeteners?!)  The label says that it has flouride, strengthens enamel, whitens, fights cavities, and freshens bresth too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that they don&#x27;t do animal testing and give sources, etc. on their website.  (I wonder if other products do that?)  And read the directions.  Don&#x27;t swallow!  (I confess that hydrated silica always gives me pause.)</li>
            <li> If you like your toothpaste with a lot of flavoring and coloring, this is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paste is white and the flavor is a VERY subtle peppermint. Many of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpastes that I have used do not have fluoride in them, so that sets this one apart for me. I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term effectiveness of the &amp;#34;enamel strengthening&amp;#34; of the toothpaste, but it is a pleasant paste to use for daily brushing. It may take some time for you to acclimate if you typically use any of the mainstream pastes and expect the amount of flavor contained in those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know of many other manufacturers who list every ingredient, its purpose, and its source -- you can get this information on Tom&#x27;s website at tomsofmaine.com</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is known as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; toothpaste. It tastes fine and cleans well, but unfortunately, it has SLS, sodium laurel sulfate, which is linked to many health issues. I cannot tell you if those claims are factual or not, however, I can tell you that when I use any toothpastes with SLS I tend to get ulcerations in my mouth. It may be that I am sensitive to this. For me, I need to use something that is SLS free. I am surprised that Tom&#x27;s is using it. The ulcerations I get are like cold sores and when I stop using it I stop getting them so, if you are sensitive, like I am, you should probably stay away from this. If not, then give it a try.</li>
            <li> I like Tom&#x27;s of Maine, I use several of their toothpastes, so I was happy to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;enamel strengthening&amp;#34; but really I have no way to tell.  Other than that, recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice light minty flavor without that gritty feeling that paste often has. It gets my teeth nice and smooth and seems to get my teeth whiter than my regular brand. It has a plain screw on cap.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine has always had great toothpastes and this one is no exception. Leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh and though it&#x27;s not much different than other toothpastes, this one definitely leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve done a good job brushing your fangs after every use. The mint is strong enough to leave a lasting scent and keeps your breath cool and pleasant long after you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine products are a trusted brand in our house, from their lotions to body washes and now toothpastes.  I am more of a spearmint flavor fan, but enjoyed the refreshing feeling of using this peppermint toothpaste that is geared toward strengthening enamel.  I felt the amount of foaming was less than my usual (non-natural) toothpaste, but that is to be expected since the formulations are different.  I will continue to use and see if the enamel strengthening also helps with sensitive teeth as well.</li>
            <li> When evaluating a toothpaste, I look for cleaning ability, enamel protection, mouth feel, and flavor in my mouth.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s Enamel Strength Natural Toothpaste hits most of these.  Foremost, it does a great job of cleaning my teeth, and because it has mineral fluoride included, it will continue to protect my teeth between cleanings.  From a mouth feel, this toothpaste also scores well. It is smooth, and not gritty.  There is some foaming, but not so much that it starts dribbling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weakness for me is the amount of peppermint flavor.  I like to have the peppermint taste linger on to keep my mouth feeling fresh.  Although you get the peppermint sensation while brushing, it is very mild.  And after rinsing my mouth when done, the peppermint taste has almost completely dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good natural toothpaste that will clean your teeth and gives you that extra fluoride protection.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed brushing with this toothpaste, it has a discernible mintyness and zing with the peppermint oil that I like. It does have a gritty feel (which I enjoy) and doesn&#x27;t foam as much as conventional toothpastes. (But it still foams, it&#x27;s not like some baking soda toothpastes that&#x27;s just a paste)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like about the product is that the company seems to be about sustainability and giving back. I will gladly spend my money with a company like that!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this whitening toothpaste.  I typically use another national brand, but I put it aside to test the Tom&#x27;s version.  The Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t feel harsh like my regular brand, yet I get the exact results....whiter teeth!  Tom&#x27;s also leaves my mouth fresh.  But perhaps the biggest advantages of the Tom&#x27;s are the natural ingredients, including fluoride, and that it is ADA approved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an AquaFresh man for as long as I can remember. Not for any particular reason other than momentum. But whenever I try another toothpaste, it just doesn&#x27;t have the same flavor I suppose I associate with freshness and cleanliness. I didn&#x27;t, however, have this issue with the Tom&#x27;s Enamel Strength: with fluoride. (Side note: pretty much every toothpaste as well as regular US drinking water has fluoride.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Tom&#x27;s Brand and my wife LOVES them. I&#x27;ve tried her Baking Soda Tom&#x27;s from time to time but always found it, well, gritty - you know, like baking soda. This one didn&#x27;t have that issue for me. Here&#x27;s what my wife had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I have used Tom&#x27;s of Maine Fluoride-free Antiplaque and Whitening (Peppermint flavor) for 10 years or so now, but when I saw that Tom&#x27;s had an all natural enamel strengthening toothpaste that advertised it also whitens and freshens breath, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My immediate reaction was there seemed to be more of a baking-soda dryness in my mouth right after brushing my teeth, but that wasn&#x27;t such a big deal. I thought in the last week or so that perhaps my teeth were looking slightly whiter and feeling slightly stronger, and my breath a bit fresher, but I also think that might just be a sort of placebo effect: the Tom&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used for all these years also states &amp;#34;whitening | fresh breath&amp;#34; among it&#x27;s claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this new enamel strength has fluoride which the original one that I used does not. That may make a difference in one direction or another for some of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m glad I tried this new on, in the end, I think I&#x27;ll stick with my original if only because it&#x27;s SO much cheaper (this new one is more expensive AND 4 oz instead of 5.5 oz).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This natural toothpaste tastes really good and has a nice non-chalky consistency. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if there is anything different with my enamel although my teeth are healthy overall. It won&#x27;t give you the long breath freshness of other harsher toothpastes so if that is something you like this one will disappoint.</li>
            <li> I used to use Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpastes exclusively before Colgate Palmolive bought the company. Now, I switch around quite a bit, and I haven&#x27;t tried a Tom&#x27;s product in a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste isn&#x27;t like the Tom&#x27;s I remember. It is smoother, relatively palatable, and more bubbly - more like a conventional toothpaste. It cleans well, and I can&#x27;t vouch for the strength of my enamel, but the toothpaste seems gentle. Tom&#x27;s thoughtfully lists its ingredients, their sources, and their purposes. They don&#x27;t do animal testing, even after having been bought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one concerning ingredient in this toothpaste (besides fluoride - depending on your perspective) is sodium laurel sulfate, which can be an irritant.</li>
            <li> I prefer a mild mint toothpaste, I currently use Crest &amp;#34;Original Paste&amp;#34; which is delightful. This Tom&#x27;s of Maine Enamel Peppermint toothpaste was too strong, bitter and sharp-tasting for me. It wasn&#x27;t gritty or anything, the actual paste was decent to use... but I just didn&#x27;t like the flavor. Neither did my spouse, citing it was &amp;#34;like unsweetened mint&amp;#34; and unpleasant for him too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a spearmint flavor might not be so bitter. I know I won&#x27;t be getting this again.</li>
            <li> This new &amp;#34;Enamel Strength&amp;#34; version is part of a somewhat baffling proliferation of toothpastes from Tom&#x27;s of Maine, all of which are wonderful in subtly different ways. Apparently (if I&#x27;ve understood the packaging correctly, which I&#x27;m not sure of even after spending some time on it) the difference here is the inclusion of mineral fluorspar as a source of fluoride, which is claimed to help strengthen tooth enamel more than the regular [[ASIN:B00JUJ14EI Tom&#x27;s peppermint toothpaste]]. (I obviously can&#x27;t evaluate that claim scientifically, but I do note that the FDA endorsement only covers the claims about this being fluoridated, same as the regular one. Skepticism is probably warranted.)  Anyhow, like all Tom&#x27;s this peppermint-flavored gel is strongly and refreshingly flavored (peppermint), while being nowhere as sweet as the big traditional brands. (The lower level of sweetening can take some getting used to, but once you&#x27;re used to it the other stuff tastes unpleasant and candy-like.) In texture this is a very soft, smooth, almost gooey paste, more like [[ASIN:B00JUJ17EA Tom&#x27;s gel]] than the other products. My favorite, the [[ASIN:B00JUJ17R2 baking soda Tom&#x27;s]], has a much more dry, scrubby feel, by comparison; this one is very wet and foamy. I still enjoyed the experience of brushing with it, and it left my mouth feeling ultra-clean. It tasted even more strongly and freshly minty than I&#x27;m used to with the baking-soda paste.  Note that the tube is significantly smaller for this product than for other Tom&#x27;s: this is 4 oz., not their regular 4.7 or 5.5 ounces (it&#x27;s sold by weight, and not labeled with its volume, as I keep trying and failing to explain to the TSA).</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine products have been hit or miss for me over the years.  Their mouthwash is fine, the deodorant does not work for me, and my kids liked the children&#x27;s toothpaste when they were young.  So when I was offered the opportunity to try their Enamel Strength Natural toothpaste, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste foams nicely and cleans teeth adequately.  It is not gritty, and I did not notice any problems with burning or stinging from the ingredients.  However, I did have issues with the taste.  It has a very mild mint taste, and a noticeable aftertaste.  To me, it tastes like a cheap tea bag smells-the scent of Orange Pekoe dust.  I notice this every time I use the paste.  I asked the other members of my family to use it, to see if the after taste was just me.  It wasn&#x27;t-my husband noticed the tea-taste, my son said it tasted funny, and my daughter spit it out almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste was not for us, simply due to the taste.  It will go into the cabinet for when we run out of toothpaste, and we will go back to our more pleasantly flavored (and less expensive!) Arm &amp; Hammer paste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for roughly a month now. I had never tried Toms of Maine before and overall I like it. I normally use Sensodyne whitening, so naturally that does a better job of whitening my teeth whereas this is enamel strengthening. But it is a very nice light tasting toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t leave a bitter or gritty aftereffect. It&#x27;s worth a try for those looking for an enamel strengthening toothpaste.</li>
