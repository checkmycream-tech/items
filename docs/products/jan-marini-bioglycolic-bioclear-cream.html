            <li>but I can&#x27;t be sure about that.  </li>

            <li>LOVE the price</li>
            <li>The cleanser is amazing and I will stick with that, but still looking for a GOOD cream that does the job for a reasonable price.</li>

            <li>I use and love</li>

            <li>It is a very light cream, cream doesn&#x27;t even seem like the right word to describe the consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li>And the results make it completely worth it!  </li>
            <li>The texture was not as rich as I like, and&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream version is great for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>So, I just rinsed it off my face with cool water and skipped an application here and there.</li>
            <li>Skin care is something you have to commit to to see results (much like fitness and healthy eating).   </li>
            <li>I was diagnosed with mild rosacea and my insurance will not cover any prescribed meds for this condition.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very light and almost completely unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>That would have been worth it if I had noticed an improvement but NO IMPROVEMENT was seen.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this cream works for people with regular acne and not the kind that I have.  </li>
            <li>After receiving my product, I was dismayed to find out it was not be right color as the product I bought from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>New packaging (meaning it&#x27;s not an expired product) for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I use it on my entire neck and decolletage, as well, and I&#x27;ve gotten the same great results.  </li>
            <li>The price of the product what very reasonable compared to department stores.  </li>
            <li>I like her products very much.</li>
            <li>Fine lines, brown patches/spots and small soon-to-be full-fledged pimples disappear.</li>
            <li>The thing about it you have to use it consistently to get resultws</li>
            <li>The first product ever that helped my skin.</li>
            <li>The product, Jan Marini Bioclear cream, was exactly what I ordered and came on time.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>When it arrived in the mail I was pleased to find that it was the exact same product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone who wants clear, healthy, smooth skin and smaller pores.</li>
            <li>The part of the jar where the cap goes on disintegrates far too easily during normal use and leaves shards of lucite/plastic in the cream.</li>
            <li>I only put it on at night, but you could easily wear it under makeup or even under your daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>My product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>It really does resurface your skin.</li>
            <li>When I wash my face, I can feel how much softer and smoother my skin is now.</li>
            <li>This really helps.</li>
            <li>I found them much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After using this for about 2 weeks, several of my friends told me my skin looked fantastic and wanted to know what I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>it has worked tremendous wonders with my skin resolving my acne, I only get breakouts when I have my period.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and young looking, I can still pass for 28!</li>
            <li>I now have a new facial cream that I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>This cream has helped to clear up my skin in just weeks.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin (like I do)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>wow, what a difference it makes.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this product to me and as long as I am faithful in using it, I have no acne, which is a first for me.</li>
            <li>and my skin has actually cleared up a bit, but not as much as I have hoped for.</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from adult acne for years.</li>
            <li>This is after only ONE WEEK of continuous, uninterrupted, consistent use.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper than from the actual Jan Marini site, but like others, I am starting to think its not the exact product.</li>
            <li>Which is important since I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past and received it in discontinued packaging with rancid contents.</li>
            <li>I use once daily, the first few times I felt tingling/burning, but that went away and texture has improved so much!</li>
            <li>As a bride-to-be with 5 month left before the big day, I needed something that would work fast.</li>
            <li>My skin looks younger with less-visible lines, is noticeably brighter, and the congestion I used to deal with, particularly around my nose, mouth and under-eye area have improved radically in only 3 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>In fact tonight was the first time in a loooong time, that I actually received a compliment on the condition of my skin, from none other than a Clinique sales woman.</li>
            <li>She gave me a small sample and within a few days my skin looked brighter and more youthful.</li>

            <li> In fact tonight was the first time in a loooong time, that I actually received a compliment on the condition of my skin, from none other than a Clinique sales woman.</li>
            <li> She gave me a small sample and within a few days my skin looked brighter and more youthful.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product I now only have 2 on my face which are already a lot smaller, and only a small amount on my back.</li>
            <li> I just noticed in the last year or so that my skin (I&#x27;m 31) was looking dull, I saw new lines around my eyes and had problems with dryness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled adult acne for about 20 years now and finally I can say I have it under control with very few breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Just have to work your way up to 2x a day as it tends to dry out your skin if you over do it.</li>
            <li> I know that sometimes when products are working, your skin will appear worse at first as the impurities are lifted to the surface</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab of cream, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And this product did not cause any initial reddening like the previous product she had recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> It feels thinner and smells different than my previous purchases of this face cream.</li>
            <li> The only negative aspect is that it has a mild, irritating burn for about 15 minutes after it&#x27;s applied, but it&#x27;s to be expected considering the glycolic acid content.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy Jan Marini products except from the manufacturer directly, unless you want a poor imitation, or one that is about to expire!</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended this cream to me when I complained that my skin was looking dull and old</li>
            <li> then you may take the stinging as a sign to use it less often.</li>
            <li> This cream does have a slight stingy sensation sometimes, but it&#x27;s not bothersome</li>
            <li> And with the Bioclear Cream, a very small bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Well, yes it goes on a little greasy, but ones your skin soaks it up the greasy feeling goes away.</li>
            <li> but I was able to feel them forming a tough, painful lump under my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that it made my ance worse</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, my skin is clearer, brighter, and glowing.  </li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended this to remove and prevent dead skin build up on my face in order to prevent clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Though Proactive has worked in the past for me, it is not working this time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what this does for my face, but I have acne &amp; its helped with the appearance.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but the jar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My cream smells terribly, goes on feeling oily, got used up very quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;the product was a little irritating to my face.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s so thick), and didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne.  </li>
            <li> This bioclear cream is very expensive for the small amount that you receive.  </li>
            <li> I thought I will get something fake.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it from amazon for $32 I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received my order within 2-3 days.  I absolutly love this cream it has worked tremendous wonders with my skin resolving my acne, I only get breakouts when I have my period.  The thing about it you have to use it consistently to get resultws</li>
            <li> The first product ever that helped my skin. I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne for the last 20 years. It really works.</li>
            <li> I just noticed in the last year or so that my skin (I&#x27;m 31) was looking dull, I saw new lines around my eyes and had problems with dryness.  I went for a facial and my esthetician recommended Jan Marini products when I told her about my skin concerns.  She sent me home with a sample of the Bioglycloic (BioClear?) Cleanser and the Bioglycolic Bioclear cream.  I noticed an immediate difference and could feel the products&#x27; effect as I used them; a tingly sensation meant the exfoliants were working.  They exfoliated and moisturized at the same time.  My skin looks younger with less-visible lines, is noticeably brighter, and the congestion I used to deal with, particularly around my nose, mouth and under-eye area have improved radically in only 3 weeks of use.  The products also feel amazing on my skin.  ONE TIP FROM MY ESTHETICIAN: Always use a washcloth to make sure all residue is removed from your skin before applying your cream.  And with the Bioclear Cream, a very small bit goes a long way.  I use it on my entire neck and decolletage, as well, and I&#x27;ve gotten the same great results.  I will definitely buy this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My product arrived fast. New packaging (meaning it&#x27;s not an expired product) for a cheap price. I can&#x27;t believe it:)!!! I thought I will get something fake. Totally love it and will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand the glowing reviews.  Did I get a defective product perhaps?  My cream smells terribly, goes on feeling oily, got used up very quickly (it&#x27;s so thick), and didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne.  Because it&#x27;s so oily, I only used it at night.  The tingling sensation was actually uncomfortable and kept me from being able to fall asleep.  That would have been worth it if I had noticed an improvement but NO IMPROVEMENT was seen.  It&#x27;s possible that it made my ance worse but I can&#x27;t be sure about that.  I know that sometimes when products are working, your skin will appear worse at first as the impurities are lifted to the surface but I&#x27;ve been using Proactive for several months and have already had that happen.  Though Proactive has worked in the past for me, it is not working this time.  My hormones have changed recently so that&#x27;s probably why.  Maybe this cream works for people with regular acne and not the kind that I have.  I use the Jan Marini glycolic cleanser that costs around $20 and absolutely love it. This bioclear cream is very expensive for the small amount that you receive.  I wish that I could return it. So disappointed!</li>
            <li> I loe jan marini and swear by her products but sometimes paying 50 plus dollars is not within reach. I know this stuff works great because everytime I run out I can see a difference in my skin. One time I ran out before my husband went to Hawaii for work and I bought some while he was away- when he came back he thought my skin looked airbrushed and amazing. The product on amazon is authentic and I am happy to have found it for this price.</li>
            <li> I love this face cream!  After just a few uses, my skin is clearer, brighter, and glowing.  The only negative aspect is that it has a mild, irritating burn for about 15 minutes after it&#x27;s applied, but it&#x27;s to be expected considering the glycolic acid content.  And the results make it completely worth it!  I would recommend this cream to anyone.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended this cream to me when I complained that my skin was looking dull and old (I&#x27;m 35). She gave me a small sample and within a few days my skin looked brighter and more youthful. It really was an incredible difference. My skin is so clear and young looking, I can still pass for 28! It is expensive, but the jar lasts a long time. You only need a little dab of cream, it goes a long way. It is a very light cream, cream doesn&#x27;t even seem like the right word to describe the consistency. It&#x27;s very light and absorbs right into the skin. I only put it on at night, but you could easily wear it under makeup or even under your daytime moisturizer. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This cream has helped to clear up my skin in just weeks. You can feel it at work, tingling, when you put it on. I now have a new facial cream that I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in the same packaging that was pictured. Which is important since I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past and received it in discontinued packaging with rancid contents. The smell is very light and almost completely unnoticeable. I&#x27;ve been using this every evening and morning for a week now to target acne and acne scarring on my face and back. As a bride-to-be with 5 month left before the big day, I needed something that would work fast. Jan Marini BioGlycolic Cream was the answer to my many tearful frustrations with my skin. I could not be happier or more relieved with these results.   You may notice others saying this product is greasy or that it stings. Well, yes it goes on a little greasy, but ones your skin soaks it up the greasy feeling goes away. If you have sensitive skin (like I do) then you may take the stinging as a sign to use it less often. My skin didn&#x27;t start stinging until about the third day, which was a sign that I was overusing it. So, I just rinsed it off my face with cool water and skipped an application here and there. It worked out perfectly and even my dark acne scars that I thought would never go away are now vanishing. I also had very deep blemishes that had not come to the surface but I was able to feel them forming a tough, painful lump under my skin. My chin, cheeks and back were covered with these. Thanks for this product I now only have 2 on my face which are already a lot smaller, and only a small amount on my back. This is after only ONE WEEK of continuous, uninterrupted, consistent use. Skin care is something you have to commit to to see results (much like fitness and healthy eating).   I would recommend this product to everyone who wants clear, healthy, smooth skin and smaller pores. I used this as a teenager when my mom used to purchase it for me, and had almost forgotten all about it. It saved me during prom time and it&#x27;s saving me just in time for my wedding.   EXCELLENT PRODUCT! A Must have for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I started using the Jan Marini products about a year ago after the recommendation of an esthetician, I&#x27;d never heard of them before then.  I&#x27;ve battled adult acne for about 20 years now and finally I can say I have it under control with very few breakouts.  In fact tonight was the first time in a loooong time, that I actually received a compliment on the condition of my skin, from none other than a Clinique sales woman. This cream does have a slight stingy sensation sometimes, but it&#x27;s not bothersome and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this! Keeps my skin free of breakouts for the most part. Just have to work your way up to 2x a day as it tends to dry out your skin if you over do it.</li>
            <li> A great product. I have sensitive skin so it can be drying if you don&#x27;t layer with moisturizer, but wow, what a difference it makes.  Fine lines, brown patches/spots and small soon-to-be full-fledged pimples disappear. It really does resurface your skin. My skin is smoother, plumper and has a healthy glow when I use JM products. I use this, the Bioglycolic Cleanser, and the C-Esta face cream and eye cream. Every now and then I try something else and always come back to Jan Marini products. There does seem to be a problem with the latest packaging. The part of the jar where the cap goes on disintegrates far too easily during normal use and leaves shards of lucite/plastic in the cream. I never had this problem with the prior packaging that had the gold cap. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me and as long as I am faithful in using it, I have no acne, which is a first for me. It is my answer for my acne!</li>
            <li> The product, Jan Marini Bioclear cream, was exactly what I ordered and came on time.  The price of the product what very reasonable compared to department stores.  Will definitely order again on the site on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Jan Marini products!  It keeps away acne &amp; much more.  I like the cream in the winter &amp; the lotion in the summer.  It&#x27;s great for oil skin.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended this to remove and prevent dead skin build up on my face in order to prevent clogged pores. What a difference! When I wash my face, I can feel how much softer and smoother my skin is now. My complexion is more radiant. And this product did not cause any initial reddening like the previous product she had recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Also, buying through Amazon saved me 50% of what the salon was charging!!</li>
            <li> Love it, should I say more....This product has helped my face get back that youthful skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best price on amazon and does everything it says it does. Leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So I have mixed feelings about this product. Its cheaper than from the actual Jan Marini site, but like others, I am starting to think its not the exact product. It seems to vanish...it evaporates in the jar. Also, this is the second time I have bought this product and its not as tingly or seem as powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that sent me the product, I can&#x27;t find them on Amazon anymore, which makes me think even more now that I got scammed. When my product came, THEY didn&#x27;t pay enough to ship it, so I had to pay extra...ON TOP of what I already paid to have it shipped. If i find the name of them I will post it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the price and my skin has actually cleared up a bit, but not as much as I have hoped for. The cleanser is amazing and I will stick with that, but still looking for a GOOD cream that does the job for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. I have been suffering from adult acne for years. This really helps. I will order it again</li>
            <li> Great to reduce the size of pores and exfoliate!  This cream version is great for my dry skin.  I&#x27;ve used it for several years with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of a friends recomendation.&lt;br /&gt;Not impressed.  The texture was not as rich as I like, and&lt;br /&gt;the product was a little irritating to my face.</li>
            <li> It feels thinner and smells different than my previous purchases of this face cream. I like her products very much. I found them much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use and love jan marini cleanser so wanted to try their additional products. I bought this thinking it was a moisturizer. It is not! Step 4 is the moisturizer. I like the product and the suite of products seem to work well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what this does for my face, but I have acne &amp; its helped with the appearance.</li>
            <li> I paid $78 for this from a skin care spa! When I ordered it from amazon for $32 I was skeptical. When it arrived in the mail I was pleased to find that it was the exact same product. It has changed my skin dramatically. I have rosacea and enlarged pores. After using this for about 2 weeks, several of my friends told me my skin looked fantastic and wanted to know what I&#x27;ve been using. If you buy this you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> After receiving my product, I was dismayed to find out it was not be right color as the product I bought from the manufacturer. It did not have the same potency or consistency. After some research, I was especially upset to find out that it is a counterfeit product. Do not buy Jan Marini products except from the manufacturer directly, unless you want a poor imitation, or one that is about to expire!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my rosacea and it does seem to keep it in check.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with mild rosacea and my insurance will not cover any prescribed meds for this condition.  I was looking for something comparable to the pharmaceuticals.  This is great, smoothed texture and redness is getting better.  I use once daily, the first few times I felt tingling/burning, but that went away and texture has improved so much!</li>
