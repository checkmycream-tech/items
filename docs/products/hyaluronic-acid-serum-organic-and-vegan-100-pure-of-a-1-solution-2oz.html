            <li>Great products, great service, great prices!</li>
            <li>The acid seems to help retain moisture that&#x27;s put into skin, which is why I think this works best when paired with a good moisturizer.   </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I still think this is a great product if you don&#x27;t have skin problems like me.  </li>
            <li>Works Great on my skin.</li>

            <li>This works great if you use it correctly.  </li>
            <li>My face has never looked better!!</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I have been using the 1% hyaluronic acid for 2 weeks now and am flabberghasted at how good my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>It is odorless and fairly non-sticky.</li>
            <li>am using it also on my hands, what is good for my face and neck, is good for my hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was initially very pleased.</li>
            <li>LOVE that it is organic and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for always making great products that I can trust.</li>
            <li>and eczema-prone (perfect, right?).</li>
            <li>The best time that I have ever used this product is right after I shower.  </li>
            <li>I love those people!).  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better - THANK GOD for this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about perspective and what you hope to see in the mirror:) I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li>just knew it would be healthy for my aging face!  </li>
            <li>I love this serum!</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing after just one week of using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, though, that using the acid on its own has made me a believer.  </li>
            <li>But yes, it still hydrates on its own, so</li>
            <li>and HA is great in this product, it feels very emollient and just glides on my skin and seems to do the job!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much going on in terms of wrinkles, but as a child of the 80&#x27;s, I loved a good tan, so</li>
            <li>This product is moisturizing and feels very light on the face.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product many times and love it.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it though because I love how the product makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>Do NOT fear the \\&quot;acid\\&quot; factor as many are harmless for the skin...  </li>
            <li>If you want to look younger and have a wonderful glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you Passport To Organics!! :-)</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t see more results then I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li>I do love the texture of this</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>My skin looks much better, smother.</li>
            <li>You get more in this product than others that I ordered afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much more luck with that.</li>
            <li>and I have told too many women already.  </li>
            <li>I tried this based on the reviews and I am glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>The results are fantastic!</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t get any better than that.  </li>
            <li>This serum is excellent for facial skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is 100% more hydrated than using moisturizer alone.</li>
            <li>(I love their charcoal cleanser too), or I spray water on my face before applying.</li>
            <li>I think it will be an easy way to ensure more moist skin year around.</li>
            <li>This serum is absolutely wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the best solutions I have found and am very excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>, it is very mild and doesn&#x27;t have any burning or tingling on your skin.  </li>
            <li>quality is amazing, great packaging and a few added touches :) Cons: the tincture I had wasn&#x27;t able to take in a full amount; it holds 2-3 drops.</li>
            <li>I notice the serum helps plump up the skin and keep it looking smooth; it has not caused any acne and may even be helping since I think the dryness irritates my skin and encourages breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>and I make sure to apply right after I cleanse my face and neck</li>
            <li>&quot; fresh all day!</li>
            <li>Have been using it - but can&#x27;t say for sure that I really see a difference!  </li>
            <li>It applies smoothly, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Just good things that keep face fresh and breathing naturally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 and have generally good skin, but the eye area is starting to wrinkle.</li>
            <li>Great product that I use in combination of the other products that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of note, it does have a mild stink until it dries.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin without stickiness.  </li>
            <li>It took me a lot of time to choose a hyaluronic acid on the web, cuz I wanted it to be at its strongest concentration and with the minimum of other chemicals (ladies, the shorter the list, the better!!).</li>
            <li>Great hyaluronic acid serum to mix with other serums and create your own facial treatments.</li>
            <li>I live a healthy lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>Literally, within the first week of using this serum the crease was plumped up!  </li>
            <li>In my deeper smile lines, no.</li>
            <li>I use a few drops as instructed and find this to be the most effective for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this serum together with a nourishing cream at night and a day cream in the morning, and it makes the creams go a long way making it spread more easily using less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply it right out of the shower after toweling off and it locks in that moisture.  </li>
            <li>use it right after the shower in the morning</li>
            <li>All of which my delicate skin tolerates beautifully.</li>
            <li>: I have sensitive oily skin with very large and easily clog pores around the T-zone.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great deal for the money, it&#x27;s hard to find pure organic ingredients that don&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li>It feels so awesome on the skin and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>When used nightly as a moisturizer after applying a thin layer of vitamin C serum to clean skin, this miracle serum makes skin look amazingly bright, healthy and young.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have a glass product, but you do need to be careful with it.  </li>
            <li>Most topical chemicals \\&quot;burn\\</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the fast, free shipping and the multiple free samples that were included in my order.</li>
            <li>So, I have used products with hyaluronic acid in them and was pretty neutral about whether it made a difference.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li>Not expensive and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I love this product, because it actually works.</li>
            <li>You have to keep using it consistently to see results.</li>
            <li>No need to use very much or you will use to much.</li>
            <li>Good serum compared to other brands, it is not watered down like so many others.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product, goes on well with other products, and doesn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions to my skin.</li>
            <li>What I find interesting about it is that when I apply it to my face and allow it to dry, my face feels tighter.  </li>
            <li>Also miraculous is the large pore diminishment, smoothness &amp; tightening</li>
            <li>My face did seem to have a bit  more moisture and didn&#x27;t feel dry as much as it did before.</li>
            <li>very thick, works great</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>What it seems to be doing is \\&quot;healing\\&quot; my skin very rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I give 2 stars because this serum is fragrance free and contains simple ingredients with organic aloe vera (1 star), and it is NOT tested on animals (1 star).  </li>
            <li>I have seen and heard advertisements my whole life talking about visible results</li>
            <li>Too much makes oily skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a change.  </li>
            <li>I was using lots of things - Aveeno lotion, Aquaphor, all kinds of eye creams, but they didn&#x27;t really improve the condition.    </li>
            <li>Because my face breaks out from oil products I have to use oil free moisturizer which is not enough moisture for my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider this a fault of the product, because in actuality, I know it is working since my skin feels much softer and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I do have two lines around my mouth ( from too much smiling), and those got much softer after using the Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have had sensational results with hyaluronic acid injections in my osteoarthritic knee and figured that, since it is a natural human body element, it just might do all it is touted to do for skin as a topical application as well.</li>
            <li>The only advice is to mix it with your favorite oils or moisturizers (I mix it straight up with one of my numerous pure skin oils).</li>
            <li>Normally after I wash my face I spritz on some Avene water, which I&#x27;ve found really helps with dryness, and then use Passport to Organic&#x27;s turmeric moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this acid serum for the past 6 months and it appeared to work nicely.  </li>
            <li>Most of us actually \\&quot;worshipped\\&quot; the sun and sauted ourselves in sun TAN lotion, the only thing on the market at the time.</li>
            <li>like it really wasn&#x27;t absorbed), the firming/tightening feeling goes away and my \\&quot;naked\\&quot; skin doesn&#x27;t seem different.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with water when using since I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with putting the direct acid on my face (considering that water is acidic also...</li>
            <li>The serum is applied twice daily, morning and evening, and my face has been soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After application, my face feels tight, not hydrated, so I use a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>I get breakouts when I use products that contain high amount of salt (e.g. sodium chloride, potassium chloride,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is a true bargain, since you only use a couple drops, I&#x27;m sure the bottle will last anyone a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make some adjustments and give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>I suspect that if you apply this to your face in the morning, without anything else to interfere with it, people may notice you look a little more well rested.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product for a few more months and will update my review even if my experience doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li>I love this product and put it on my face &amp; neck everyday.</li>
            <li>I always choose natural products, and appreciate the the Passport to Organics is pure and natural.</li>
            <li>of the important factors about Passport to Organics is that it is organic and vegan and does not contain parabens nor other chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Just apply moisturizer and continue on with your new skin care routine.</li>
            <li>my face looks nice and firm especially around my eyes</li>
            <li>It goes well with the Clear Face Turmeric Cream!  </li>
            <li>On a separate occasion, I dropped it and completely broke it in an airport bathroom!  </li>
            <li>I first noticed the beginnings of these benefits after only three days of use.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading everything I could find on the internet, and based on the reviews, and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>It is so sensitive!  </li>
            <li>This was a little too strong for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In 2 weeks I already noticed a big positive change.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For other serums sold on Amazon with thousands of reviews, I have to use a full tincture to get the desired level of coverage on my face.</li>
            <li>I am 49 yrs old and prone to dry facial skin, and this product has made a huge difference in terms of softness, and visibly healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>Facial skin feels somewhat tight after application, but I apply a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li>I prefer moisturizing products that are as pure and natural as possible with no parabens, scents, colors or additives.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing to do with the product, but their packing is cute; it comes in a little sheer bag with some eye</li>
            <li>and I clearly noticed a change in my skin</li>
            <li>It was shoved too far into the rubber bulb and was shattered.  </li>
            <li>and as early as our 40s began showing the consequences of that behavior.</li>
            <li>I am often told I look like I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m applying it for 3 mo</li>
            <li>So far I bought 4 - bottles.</li>
            <li>made my skin feel soo soft</li>
            <li>so I had to put moisturizer on directly after.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and no allergic reaction thus far.  </li>
            <li>I am not big on cosmetics and do not wear much make-up.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to really see any visual changes...</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid is a recommendation from every dermatologist and skin care professional so make it organic and affordable by ordering from this company.  </li>
            <li>I admit in the first few days of using this, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this serum due to high ratings from Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>Great serum to use underneath moisturizer and definitely beats many serums from other expensive skincare lines I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>was the ONLY new skin care product I added to my skin care regimen, so I knew this product was causing breakout on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>About an hour later I checked and noticed that the treated side felt obviously more dewy and cool, while the other side was a bit dry and the usual temperature.</li>
            <li>Just exactly what I have been trying to achieve with a multitude of other products for years now.</li>
            <li>After using this serum for a while, I noticed that since my skin is already oily (I&#x27;m Asian American), I tend to shine a lot more than usual.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to others, providing their skin is not extremely oily.</li>
            <li>A few drops glides on smoothly, I allow to dry completely before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician and use it professionally in my treatment room and use it personally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old female</li>
            <li>(apparently, this is how the HA works - it captures the water to stay on your skin).</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li>Although I hoped it could be even better to use hyaluronic acid serum only, it turns out that my skin goes reallly tight with  a little rash when I do.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive dry cheeks</li>
            <li>With the addition of the hyaluronic acid to my regimen, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in dry patches that pop up, so much so that I&#x27;ve used some on similar dry patches on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I never expected to see such a drastic change and in such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, but I always add it to my other products, and have never had a problem when applying it this way.</li>
            <li>I have to choose topical chemicals very selectively as my 64 year old delicate, thinner skin rebels against them.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Do NOT fear the \\&quot;acid\\&quot; factor as many are harmless for the skin...  </li>
            <li> If you want to look younger and have a wonderful glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you Passport To Organics!! :-)</li>
            <li> and if I don&#x27;t see more results then I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li> I do love the texture of this</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> My skin looks much better, smother.</li>
            <li> You get more in this product than others that I ordered afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much more luck with that.</li>
            <li> and I have told too many women already.  </li>
            <li> I tried this based on the reviews and I am glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li> The results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t get any better than that.  </li>
            <li> This serum is excellent for facial skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is 100% more hydrated than using moisturizer alone.</li>
            <li> (I love their charcoal cleanser too), or I spray water on my face before applying.</li>
            <li> I think it will be an easy way to ensure more moist skin year around.</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best solutions I have found and am very excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on.</li>
            <li> , it is very mild and doesn&#x27;t have any burning or tingling on your skin.  </li>
            <li> quality is amazing, great packaging and a few added touches :) Cons: the tincture I had wasn&#x27;t able to take in a full amount; it holds 2-3 drops.</li>
            <li> I notice the serum helps plump up the skin and keep it looking smooth; it has not caused any acne and may even be helping since I think the dryness irritates my skin and encourages breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> and I make sure to apply right after I cleanse my face and neck</li>
            <li> &quot; fresh all day!</li>
            <li> Have been using it - but can&#x27;t say for sure that I really see a difference!  </li>
            <li> It applies smoothly, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Just good things that keep face fresh and breathing naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and have generally good skin, but the eye area is starting to wrinkle.</li>
            <li> Great product that I use in combination of the other products that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of note, it does have a mild stink until it dries.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin without stickiness.  </li>
            <li> It took me a lot of time to choose a hyaluronic acid on the web, cuz I wanted it to be at its strongest concentration and with the minimum of other chemicals (ladies, the shorter the list, the better!!).</li>
            <li> Great hyaluronic acid serum to mix with other serums and create your own facial treatments.</li>
            <li> I live a healthy lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> Literally, within the first week of using this serum the crease was plumped up!  </li>
            <li> In my deeper smile lines, no.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops as instructed and find this to be the most effective for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum together with a nourishing cream at night and a day cream in the morning, and it makes the creams go a long way making it spread more easily using less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply it right out of the shower after toweling off and it locks in that moisture.  </li>
            <li> use it right after the shower in the morning</li>
            <li> All of which my delicate skin tolerates beautifully.</li>
            <li> : I have sensitive oily skin with very large and easily clog pores around the T-zone.  </li>
            <li> This product is a great deal for the money, it&#x27;s hard to find pure organic ingredients that don&#x27;t break the bank!</li>
            <li> It feels so awesome on the skin and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> When used nightly as a moisturizer after applying a thin layer of vitamin C serum to clean skin, this miracle serum makes skin look amazingly bright, healthy and young.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a glass product, but you do need to be careful with it.  </li>
            <li> Most topical chemicals \\&quot;burn\\</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the fast, free shipping and the multiple free samples that were included in my order.</li>
            <li> So, I have used products with hyaluronic acid in them and was pretty neutral about whether it made a difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Not expensive and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love this product, because it actually works.</li>
            <li> You have to keep using it consistently to see results.</li>
            <li> No need to use very much or you will use to much.</li>
            <li> Good serum compared to other brands, it is not watered down like so many others.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product, goes on well with other products, and doesn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions to my skin.</li>
            <li> What I find interesting about it is that when I apply it to my face and allow it to dry, my face feels tighter.  </li>
            <li> Also miraculous is the large pore diminishment, smoothness &amp; tightening</li>
            <li> My face did seem to have a bit  more moisture and didn&#x27;t feel dry as much as it did before.</li>
            <li> very thick, works great</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> What it seems to be doing is \\&quot;healing\\&quot; my skin very rapidly.  </li>
            <li> I give 2 stars because this serum is fragrance free and contains simple ingredients with organic aloe vera (1 star), and it is NOT tested on animals (1 star).  </li>
            <li> I have seen and heard advertisements my whole life talking about visible results</li>
            <li> Too much makes oily skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a change.  </li>
            <li> I was using lots of things - Aveeno lotion, Aquaphor, all kinds of eye creams, but they didn&#x27;t really improve the condition.    </li>
            <li> Because my face breaks out from oil products I have to use oil free moisturizer which is not enough moisture for my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider this a fault of the product, because in actuality, I know it is working since my skin feels much softer and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I do have two lines around my mouth ( from too much smiling), and those got much softer after using the Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have had sensational results with hyaluronic acid injections in my osteoarthritic knee and figured that, since it is a natural human body element, it just might do all it is touted to do for skin as a topical application as well.</li>
            <li> The only advice is to mix it with your favorite oils or moisturizers (I mix it straight up with one of my numerous pure skin oils).</li>
            <li> Normally after I wash my face I spritz on some Avene water, which I&#x27;ve found really helps with dryness, and then use Passport to Organic&#x27;s turmeric moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this acid serum for the past 6 months and it appeared to work nicely.  </li>
            <li> Most of us actually \\&quot;worshipped\\&quot; the sun and sauted ourselves in sun TAN lotion, the only thing on the market at the time.</li>
            <li> like it really wasn&#x27;t absorbed), the firming/tightening feeling goes away and my \\&quot;naked\\&quot; skin doesn&#x27;t seem different.  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with water when using since I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with putting the direct acid on my face (considering that water is acidic also...</li>
            <li> The serum is applied twice daily, morning and evening, and my face has been soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After application, my face feels tight, not hydrated, so I use a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> I get breakouts when I use products that contain high amount of salt (e.g. sodium chloride, potassium chloride,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a true bargain, since you only use a couple drops, I&#x27;m sure the bottle will last anyone a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make some adjustments and give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> I suspect that if you apply this to your face in the morning, without anything else to interfere with it, people may notice you look a little more well rested.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product for a few more months and will update my review even if my experience doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> I love this product and put it on my face &amp; neck everyday.</li>
            <li> I always choose natural products, and appreciate the the Passport to Organics is pure and natural.</li>
            <li> of the important factors about Passport to Organics is that it is organic and vegan and does not contain parabens nor other chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Just apply moisturizer and continue on with your new skin care routine.</li>
            <li> my face looks nice and firm especially around my eyes</li>
            <li> It goes well with the Clear Face Turmeric Cream!  </li>
            <li> On a separate occasion, I dropped it and completely broke it in an airport bathroom!  </li>
            <li> I first noticed the beginnings of these benefits after only three days of use.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading everything I could find on the internet, and based on the reviews, and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> It is so sensitive!  </li>
            <li> This was a little too strong for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In 2 weeks I already noticed a big positive change.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For other serums sold on Amazon with thousands of reviews, I have to use a full tincture to get the desired level of coverage on my face.</li>
            <li> I am 49 yrs old and prone to dry facial skin, and this product has made a huge difference in terms of softness, and visibly healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> Facial skin feels somewhat tight after application, but I apply a moisturizer on top of it.</li>
            <li> I prefer moisturizing products that are as pure and natural as possible with no parabens, scents, colors or additives.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing to do with the product, but their packing is cute; it comes in a little sheer bag with some eye</li>
            <li> and I clearly noticed a change in my skin</li>
            <li> It was shoved too far into the rubber bulb and was shattered.  </li>
            <li> and as early as our 40s began showing the consequences of that behavior.</li>
            <li> I am often told I look like I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m applying it for 3 mo</li>
            <li> So far I bought 4 - bottles.</li>
            <li> made my skin feel soo soft</li>
            <li> so I had to put moisturizer on directly after.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and no allergic reaction thus far.  </li>
            <li> I am not big on cosmetics and do not wear much make-up.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to really see any visual changes...</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid is a recommendation from every dermatologist and skin care professional so make it organic and affordable by ordering from this company.  </li>
            <li> I admit in the first few days of using this, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this serum due to high ratings from Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> Great serum to use underneath moisturizer and definitely beats many serums from other expensive skincare lines I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> was the ONLY new skin care product I added to my skin care regimen, so I knew this product was causing breakout on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> About an hour later I checked and noticed that the treated side felt obviously more dewy and cool, while the other side was a bit dry and the usual temperature.</li>
            <li> Just exactly what I have been trying to achieve with a multitude of other products for years now.</li>
            <li> After using this serum for a while, I noticed that since my skin is already oily (I&#x27;m Asian American), I tend to shine a lot more than usual.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to others, providing their skin is not extremely oily.</li>
            <li> A few drops glides on smoothly, I allow to dry completely before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician and use it professionally in my treatment room and use it personally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old female</li>
            <li> (apparently, this is how the HA works - it captures the water to stay on your skin).</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> Although I hoped it could be even better to use hyaluronic acid serum only, it turns out that my skin goes reallly tight with  a little rash when I do.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive dry cheeks</li>
            <li> With the addition of the hyaluronic acid to my regimen, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in dry patches that pop up, so much so that I&#x27;ve used some on similar dry patches on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I never expected to see such a drastic change and in such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, but I always add it to my other products, and have never had a problem when applying it this way.</li>
            <li> I have to choose topical chemicals very selectively as my 64 year old delicate, thinner skin rebels against them.</li>
            <li> After one week, half of my face was cleared, and the other half with serum applied daily was full of bumps and blackheads!  </li>
            <li> Recently, however, I&#x27;m having break-outs (really unusual for me) and my skin is red and raw.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much of an improvement in my skin in these past two weeks, but,</li>
            <li> Previously, my skin was dry with large rough spots and nothing worked to regain the softness.  </li>
            <li> Oil free serums are the only way that I can go without ill effects.</li>
            <li> I found this odd, because I don&#x27;t consider myself to have overly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> my face has some faint brown freckled patches and I have very mild sagging in some areas.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because my skin is often oily but dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> Not tight like soap drying tight.  </li>
            <li> At first I was little dissatisfied but came to think that it should be used with other moisturizers, like seen in other comments on this product.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Long time ago I started reading the labels of what I put inside my body and on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried alot of other different facial creams/lotions trying to get rid of my facial dryness, to no avail; the products work for a few hours, and then I see the flakiness coming back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but it lasts longer</li>
            <li> The trick for my use of topical hyaluronic acid has been to find 1% without a menagerie of other chemicals added to its solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s and have mostly dry skin that is acne-</li>
            <li> Just remember, use on a water-moistened face, not on a dry face.  </li>
            <li> I think it will work wonders for me during the winter since my skin tends to dry a bit then...</li>
            <li> I am 54, and do not have wrinkles or have a dry skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot use cream or ointment based products because of their pore clogging characteristic.</li>
            <li> In the past months, the area around my eyes has been dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> But, finding such a serum with less than 5 added chemicals is a feat in and of itself.  </li>
            <li> It readily accepts topical retinol, 2% salicylic acid, moisturizer, sunblocker &amp; mineral makeup all in combination with it without ill effects.</li>
            <li> I do not really see any difference.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make a expected difference.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but a few years ago a deep crease formed between my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t compare this to any other brand of hyaluronic acid, I do like this one a lot.</li>
            <li> Once this bottle is done, I may try other brands to see how they measure up.  </li>
            <li> When reading the reviews for this, or any other product touting wrinkle reduction, its all a matter of subjectivity: One will never know what a product does until they try it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to keep using the watered down versions.</li>
            <li> 5/5 hands down.</li>
            <li> I have used half a bottle, applying it liberally for about a month to eyes, face and neck</li>
            <li> It did not help the slight skin sagginess I have either, which I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> AND... the redness and dryness is GONE, and even the lines under my eyes have softened and now are A LOT less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I knew about what hyaluronic acid does to skin as I previously used a product with some of this substance.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel tight</li>
            <li> This way it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight when it dries.</li>
            <li> used this serum for 3 days morning and night, then I started to develop blackheads and little bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li> I then follow with just a little bit of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This last time I received my order, the glass dropper was broken.  </li>
            <li> It is just the hyaluronic acid facilitating the sloughing off of an already dead skin patch/layer.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin plump, firm and youthful.</li>
            <li> otherwise you face feels and looks like covered with dead skin</li>
            <li> I read about it a few weeks ago while browsing eczema discussion sites, and I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday</li>
            <li> I searched for an organic product with few ingredients and kept coming across Passport to Organics hyaluronic acid serum.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately two months and have seen a definite change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs easily, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Another advice is to spray very little water on your face before applying it, so it can work its wonders</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s intentional</li>
            <li> I do notice a small difference around my eyes, but nowhere else.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it did otherwise.</li>
            <li> It has very few ingredients in it, esp.</li>
            <li> It is hard to not take a bath in the Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> but I do use it at least three times per week.</li>
            <li> no glycerin or silicone products in it to provide that fake slick feeling</li>
            <li> It is my secret weapon</li>
            <li> and I was feeling NOT attractive and quite self-conscious about both these things.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of obsessing about my eyes, checking them in the mirror, putting makeup over my eczema to hide the redness, etc.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry...  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this serum CAUSED ACNE on me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rather expensive.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> disappointed that this serum did not work for me.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it. very thick, works great no drying</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product many times and love it.  It us often the only facial moisturizer I use!  I apply it right out of the shower after toweling off and it locks in that moisture.  This last time I received my order, the glass dropper was broken.  It was shoved too far into the rubber bulb and was shattered.  I had to toss it and use the dropper from my last bottle.  It is nice to have a glass product, but you do need to be careful with it.  On a separate occasion, I dropped it and completely broke it in an airport bathroom!  I will continue to buy it though because I love how the product makes my skin feel.  It even seems to be helping minimize stretch marks on my tummy from baby #2!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several hyaluronic acid serums, but never have they been this concentrated. For other serums sold on Amazon with thousands of reviews, I have to use a full tincture to get the desired level of coverage on my face. This product -- one drop. It&#x27;s a little more expensive, but it lasts longer and I don&#x27;t have to keep using the watered down versions. 5/5 hands down. Pros: quality is amazing, great packaging and a few added touches :) Cons: the tincture I had wasn&#x27;t able to take in a full amount; it holds 2-3 drops. Doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. Not sure if that&#x27;s intentional</li>
            <li> This product has helped with my skin dramatically.  It goes well with the Clear Face Turmeric Cream!  I&#x27;d recommend them both together.</li>
            <li> I chose this product for its 1% strength and it&#x27;s VERY SHORT ingredient list. I have to choose topical chemicals very selectively as my 64 year old delicate, thinner skin rebels against them. Most topical chemicals \\&quot;burn\\&quot; my complexion creating soreness, peeling and redness wherever I apply the substance. Not so with this product! It consists of aloe barbadensis juice, hyaluronic acid (sodium hyauronate), potassium sorbate &amp; citric acid. All of which my delicate skin tolerates beautifully. Do NOT fear the \\&quot;acid\\&quot; factor as many are harmless for the skin...  I apply this miraculous compound to my face, neck and hands twice daily. It readily accepts topical retinol, 2% salicylic acid, moisturizer, sunblocker &amp; mineral makeup all in combination with it without ill effects. For my aging, cantankerous skin that is miraculous!  Also miraculous is the large pore diminishment, smoothness &amp; tightening I am seeing in the three areas on which I apply it. I first noticed the beginnings of these benefits after only three days of use. (thought it was my imagination!) I have been using the 1% hyaluronic acid for 2 weeks now and am flabberghasted at how good my skin looks and feels. Just exactly what I have been trying to achieve with a multitude of other products for years now. What it seems to be doing is \\&quot;healing\\&quot; my skin very rapidly.  I have had sensational results with hyaluronic acid injections in my osteoarthritic knee and figured that, since it is a natural human body element, it just might do all it is touted to do for skin as a topical application as well. It has for me!  The trick for my use of topical hyaluronic acid has been to find 1% without a menagerie of other chemicals added to its solution. I cannot use cream or ointment based products because of their pore clogging characteristic. Oil free serums are the only way that I can go without ill effects. But, finding such a serum with less than 5 added chemicals is a feat in and of itself.  I am hoping that the citricacid in this product will eventually help to fade my sun spots. We baby boomers did not have the benefit of today&#x27;s knowledge of sun exposure damage or the technology of sunscreens and sunblockers when we were teens growing up. Most of us actually \\&quot;worshipped\\&quot; the sun and sauted ourselves in sun TAN lotion, the only thing on the market at the time. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! and as early as our 40s began showing the consequences of that behavior. You&#x27;ve heard of \\&quot;leathery\\&quot; skin/leatherface... Uh huh, yep...  Should you experience some painless, redless, peeling; do not panic and quit using the product. I had some of this on my nose which ceased in a day or two. It is just the hyaluronic acid facilitating the sloughing off of an already dead skin patch/layer. Just apply moisturizer and continue on with your new skin care routine. You will not be sorry...  It is ever so blissful to wake up each morning, look in the mirror and see continuing, youthful improvement in my skin. I fully expect that my mirror will once again someday soon say to me \\&quot;...the fairest in the land\\&quot;. (age considered, of course!)</li>
            <li> If you want to look younger and have a wonderful glow to your skin. This is one of the best Hyaluronic Acid Serums I have use. I&#x27;m a licensed Esthetician and use it professionally in my treatment room and use it personally. I sometimes use it with vitamin c serum and essentials oils. This stuff is great. It is good for all skin types too!! Thank you Passport To Organics!! :-)</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have used half a bottle, applying it liberally for about a month to eyes, face and neck 2x/day.  It applies smoothly, absorbs quickly.  However, it did sting and leave my face red initially.  It has subsided but not totally, even after a month.  I found this odd, because I don&#x27;t consider myself to have overly sensitive skin.  After application, my face feels tight, not hydrated, so I use a moisturizer on top of it. I&#x27;m 49 and have generally good skin, but the eye area is starting to wrinkle. I do notice a small difference around my eyes, but nowhere else.  I&#x27;ll finish the bottle and if I don&#x27;t see more results then I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li> At 41 years of age, I have come to take all beauty product claims with a grain of salt. I bought this after reading everything I could find on the internet, and based on the reviews, and all I can say is WOW! It is hard to not take a bath in the Hyaluronic Acid. A few drops glides on smoothly, I allow to dry completely before my moisturizer. This product does what it says. It has made my skin plump, firm and youthful. I use it on my face and decolletage. I always choose natural products, and appreciate the the Passport to Organics is pure and natural.</li>
            <li> I was initially very pleased. I mixed a drop or two with my day and night time moisturizers and noticed improvement in my skin tone and texture. Recently, however, I&#x27;m having break-outs (really unusual for me) and my skin is red and raw. I&#x27;ll make some adjustments and give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> This product is a great deal for the money, it&#x27;s hard to find pure organic ingredients that don&#x27;t break the bank! I also appreciate the fast, free shipping and the multiple free samples that were included in my order. Will purchase again!  Alexandra B.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this serum due to high ratings from Amazon.com!  Unfortunately, this serum CAUSED ACNE on me!&lt;br /&gt;This was the ONLY new skin care product I added to my skin care regimen, so I knew this product was causing breakout on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this serum for 3 days morning and night, then I started to develop blackheads and little bumps on my face.  I didn&#x27;t want to believe that it was causing breakouts on my face, so I tested it on one side of my face.  After one week, half of my face was cleared, and the other half with serum applied daily was full of bumps and blackheads!  I suspect it&#x27;s the potassium sorbate (a type of salt) that is breaking me out.  I get breakouts when I use products that contain high amount of salt (e.g. sodium chloride, potassium chloride, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed that this serum did not work for me.  I give 2 stars because this serum is fragrance free and contains simple ingredients with organic aloe vera (1 star), and it is NOT tested on animals (1 star).  I still think this is a great product if you don&#x27;t have skin problems like me.  This product is moisturizing and feels very light on the face.  I do love the texture of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I have sensitive oily skin with very large and easily clog pores around the T-zone.  I also have deep rolling and ice pick scars on around the T-zone because I suffer from acne for 15 years.  I have sensitive dry cheeks and I get rash around the hair line sometimes.</li>
            <li> This was a little too strong for my sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t say if it did anything or not because I had to stop using it when my skin began to peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about two weeks.  Of note, it does have a mild stink until it dries.  What I find interesting about it is that when I apply it to my face and allow it to dry, my face feels tighter.  Not tight like soap drying tight.  My skin feels firmer and if I&#x27;m not tricking myself, when I look in the mirror it looks smoother.  I am 43.  I live a healthy lifestyle.  I dont&#x27; wear any makeup.  I am often told I look like I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s (sometimes younger...I love those people!).  I don&#x27;t have much going on in terms of wrinkles, but as a child of the 80&#x27;s, I loved a good tan, so my face has some faint brown freckled patches and I have very mild sagging in some areas.  Probably only noticeable to me.  Back to the product...so, anyway, the minute I wash it off (you can feel the slimy serum wash off...like it really wasn&#x27;t absorbed), the firming/tightening feeling goes away and my \\&quot;naked\\&quot; skin doesn&#x27;t seem different.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much of an improvement in my skin in these past two weeks, but, I suspect that if you apply this to your face in the morning, without anything else to interfere with it, people may notice you look a little more well rested.  That seems to be the best way to categorize my experience.  I will continue to use the product for a few more months and will update my review even if my experience doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on. Makes skin feel tight. Do not see any difference yet. Will wait and see.</li>
            <li> So, I have used products with hyaluronic acid in them and was pretty neutral about whether it made a difference. I have to say, though, that using the acid on its own has made me a believer.  I&#x27;m in my 30s and have mostly dry skin that is acne- and eczema-prone (perfect, right?). Normally after I wash my face I spritz on some Avene water, which I&#x27;ve found really helps with dryness, and then use Passport to Organic&#x27;s turmeric moisturizer. With the addition of the hyaluronic acid to my regimen, I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in dry patches that pop up, so much so that I&#x27;ve used some on similar dry patches on my hands.  I notice the serum helps plump up the skin and keep it looking smooth; it has not caused any acne and may even be helping since I think the dryness irritates my skin and encourages breakouts. The acid seems to help retain moisture that&#x27;s put into skin, which is why I think this works best when paired with a good moisturizer.   While I can&#x27;t compare this to any other brand of hyaluronic acid, I do like this one a lot. I appreciate that the source of the acid is vegan, since I do not use animal products. Once this bottle is done, I may try other brands to see how they measure up.  **I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.**</li>
            <li> I do not really see any difference. Rather expensive. Purchased after hearing Dr. Oz talk about the benefits of using H.A.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Thursday and received it on Friday! I immediately did a test by using a couple of drops from the dropper on one side of my damp face, to see how it worked. About an hour later I checked and noticed that the treated side felt obviously more dewy and cool, while the other side was a bit dry and the usual temperature. I&#x27;ll use it on my face and neck starting tomorrow. It is odorless and fairly non-sticky. I think it will be an easy way to ensure more moist skin year around.</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely wonderful for dry skin. I am 49 yrs old and prone to dry facial skin, and this product has made a huge difference in terms of softness, and visibly healthier looking skin. I&#x27;ve tried alot of other different facial creams/lotions trying to get rid of my facial dryness, to no avail; the products work for a few hours, and then I see the flakiness coming back. Since my first application of this product there has been no more flakiness. Facial skin feels somewhat tight after application, but I apply a moisturizer on top of it. Now, does this product reduce/eliminate wrinkles? In my deeper smile lines, no. In my lighter frown lines, it softened them. It did not help the slight skin sagginess I have either, which I was hoping it would. I will buy this product again for its moisturizing abilities. When reading the reviews for this, or any other product touting wrinkle reduction, its all a matter of subjectivity: One will never know what a product does until they try it.</li>
            <li> Love this product my face looks nice and firm especially around my eyes</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this product. I started to use it with watermelon seed oil and after two weeks I could see the difference. My skin looks much better, smother. I would definitely recommend this product ! Don&#x27;t buy any cheaper ones, I did and now regret it.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t like it. The only way to use it- you can mix with oil or cream otherwise you face feels and looks like covered with dead skin</li>
            <li> Seemed to make my skin feel smoother.  You get more in this product than others that I ordered afterwards. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product that I use in combination of the other products that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use just a litte to plump my skin up.  I use a few drops as instructed and find this to be the most effective for my skin.  I apply it at night and my skin is moisturised when I wake up.  The best time that I have ever used this product is right after I shower.  My face is damp and receptive to the ingredients.  LOVE that it is organic and safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for always making great products that I can trust.</li>
            <li> This serum is predominantly aloe. All it did was flake off my skin and leave it drier than ever before. Either pony up the extra cash for a 100% hyaluronic acid serum (this is only 1%), or simply get a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid like the one from CeraVe. I&#x27;ve had much more luck with that.</li>
            <li> It is my secret weapon and I have told too many women already.  I have seen and heard advertisements my whole life talking about visible results and I have never witnessed it until now.  I just purchased their face lift serum and can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way. No need to use very much or you will use to much. Too much makes oily skin. Good serum compared to other brands, it is not watered down like so many others.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since receipt.  I don&#x27;t really see a change.  There are no side effects though.</li>
            <li> Works Great on my skin. I use it before applying a face moisturizer with Amino acid + Vitamin C, E, A. In 2 weeks I already noticed a big positive change.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m applying it for 3 mo and I see no issues.&lt;br /&gt;My pores are smaller the skin is radiant and tighter.&lt;br /&gt;I use it right after the shower in the morning and I apply a Moisturizing cream over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the serum for my friend and her co-worker noticed the change. So far I bought 4 - bottles. 2 for me and 2 for friends.</li>
            <li> This product smelled like mackerel to me. Not sure why. But I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Not sure how it did otherwise.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is amazing!  I read about it a few weeks ago while browsing eczema discussion sites, and I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t heard of it before.  I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema and dry/sensitive skin off and on all my life.  In the past months, the area around my eyes has been dry and sensitive.  I was using lots of things - Aveeno lotion, Aquaphor, all kinds of eye creams, but they didn&#x27;t really improve the condition.    For those who know eczema, I also have some Dennie-Morgan lines under my eyes as a result of using steroid creams which end up thinning the skin (which I learned my lesson and will not do again!) I&#x27;m a 25 year old female and I was feeling NOT attractive and quite self-conscious about both these things.  I was so tired of obsessing about my eyes, checking them in the mirror, putting makeup over my eczema to hide the redness, etc. etc.  I admit in the first few days of using this, I didn&#x27;t really see a difference and I had my doubts.  But I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now (a drop or two under my eyes and on my eyelids, morning and night) AND... the redness and dryness is GONE, and even the lines under my eyes have softened and now are A LOT less noticeable.  My skin looks so much better - THANK GOD for this stuff!  And don&#x27;t worry that it&#x27;s called &#x27;acid&#x27;, it is very mild and doesn&#x27;t have any burning or tingling on your skin.  This is a true bargain, since you only use a couple drops, I&#x27;m sure the bottle will last anyone a long time.  I hope my review will help anyone else out there considering buying this!</li>
            <li> Just remember, use on a water-moistened face, not on a dry face.  It has very few ingredients in it, esp. no glycerin or silicone products in it to provide that fake slick feeling that I don&#x27;t like.  Just good things that keep face fresh and breathing naturally.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on the reviews and I am glad I took the chance. I mixed it with water when using since I wasn&#x27;t comfortable with putting the direct acid on my face (considering that water is acidic also...LOL!) I like it and it worked. My face did seem to have a bit  more moisture and didn&#x27;t feel dry as much as it did before. I don&#x27;t use it everyday but I do use it at least three times per week.</li>
            <li> I love this product and put it on my face &amp; neck everyday.</li>
            <li> made my skin feel soo soft</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any improvements in skin. Made my skin feel tight so I had to put moisturizer on directly after.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I will definitely be buying it again. Not expensive and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out, but I feel like my wrinkles have diminished in the three weeks I&#x27;ve had this product and my skin seems to look healthier. It&#x27;s all about perspective and what you hope to see in the mirror:) I&#x27;ll buy it again!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make a expected difference. disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I have to ask my friends in china bring the H.A. which is made in China and just 6 bucks each bottle. ...</li>
            <li> Long time ago I started reading the labels of what I put inside my body and on my skin and it&#x27;s been paying off... It took me a lot of time to choose a hyaluronic acid on the web, cuz I wanted it to be at its strongest concentration and with the minimum of other chemicals (ladies, the shorter the list, the better!!). Well, I can say that the combo of aloe vera juice and HA is great in this product, it feels very emollient and just glides on my skin and seems to do the job!! The only advice is to mix it with your favorite oils or moisturizers (I mix it straight up with one of my numerous pure skin oils). This way it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight when it dries. Another advice is to spray very little water on your face before applying it, so it can work its wonders (apparently, this is how the HA works - it captures the water to stay on your skin).</li>
            <li> Appreciate the glass bottle and quality dropper.  Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I add this to both my toner and my face cream.  The results are fantastic! My skin stays so moisturized and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; fresh all day! I read another review in which the person said that the product made her skin feel \\&quot;tight\\&quot; and that it burned. I have VERY sensitive skin, but I always add it to my other products, and have never had a problem when applying it this way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this acid serum for the past 6 months and it appeared to work nicely.  It absorbs quickly into the skin without stickiness.  My skin feels soft and no allergic reaction thus far.  Great serum to use underneath moisturizer and definitely beats many serums from other expensive skincare lines I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Bought this to add moisture to my skin.  Have been using it - but can&#x27;t say for sure that I really see a difference!  Maybe it takes awhile.  Have to put my moisturizer on after I apply as it is dries out.</li>
            <li> Great hyaluronic acid serum to mix with other serums and create your own facial treatments. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using alone. Great product and great value</li>
            <li> BEST. SERUM. EVER.  I have used hyaluronic acid serum for years as a part of my daily skin care regimen.  I am not big on cosmetics and do not wear much make-up.  I prefer moisturizing products that are as pure and natural as possible with no parabens, scents, colors or additives.  This serum has ONE ingredient. You just can&#x27;t get any better than that.  When used nightly as a moisturizer after applying a thin layer of vitamin C serum to clean skin, this miracle serum makes skin look amazingly bright, healthy and young.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my skin is often oily but dry at the same time. I knew about what hyaluronic acid does to skin as I previously used a product with some of this substance. Although I hoped it could be even better to use hyaluronic acid serum only, it turns out that my skin goes reallly tight with  a little rash when I do.  At first I was little dissatisfied but came to think that it should be used with other moisturizers, like seen in other comments on this product. But yes, it still hydrates on its own, so Im happy with it.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid Serum has been a miracle for my face!!! Because my face breaks out from oil products I have to use oil free moisturizer which is not enough moisture for my face. I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum after I was my face and it holds in the moisture. My face has never looked better!! I&#x27;m a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> I am 44 and after hearing about Hyaluronic Acid and it&#x27;s importance to our skin I decided to give it a shot.  I searched for an organic product with few ingredients and kept coming across Passport to Organics hyaluronic acid serum.  I didn&#x27;t expect to really see any visual changes... just knew it would be healthy for my aging face!  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but a few years ago a deep crease formed between my eyebrows.  Literally, within the first week of using this serum the crease was plumped up!  I never expected to see such a drastic change and in such a short period of time.  This serum should be used on a damp face so I add a drop to my moisturizer in the morning and night.  A small drop really is all you need!  My skin feels great and the serum has no smell that I can detect.  Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> This product is a steal of a deal!!  It feels so awesome on the skin and a little goes a long way.  It is packaged in a glass bottle and it is a generous amount of product.  Hyaluronic Acid is a recommendation from every dermatologist and skin care professional so make it organic and affordable by ordering from this company.  Great products, great service, great prices!</li>
            <li> This serum is excellent for facial skin. Performs well. Absorbs easily, not greasy at all. Helps with wrinkles a bit also. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After using this serum for a while, I noticed that since my skin is already oily (I&#x27;m Asian American), I tend to shine a lot more than usual. I don&#x27;t consider this a fault of the product, because in actuality, I know it is working since my skin feels much softer and moisturized. So instead of adding several drops to my moisturizer, I only use one or two drops. Overall, great product, goes on well with other products, and doesn&#x27;t cause any adverse reactions to my skin. I would recommend to others, providing their skin is not extremely oily. I think it will work wonders for me during the winter since my skin tends to dry a bit then...</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing after just one week of using this product.  I have to do double takes when looking in the mirror.  My skin is 100% more hydrated than using moisturizer alone. This is a definite must have for me.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best solutions I have found and am very excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It does not have a scent to it.  I like buying organic products because chemicals irritate my skin.  It is so sensitive!  This works great if you use it correctly.  I apply it to damp skin as directed and I make sure to apply right after I cleanse my face and neck (I love their charcoal cleanser too), or I spray water on my face before applying.I then follow with just a little bit of moisturizer.  This leaves my skin in wonderful condition and I hope to prevent aging too!</li>
            <li> I love this product, because it actually works. You have to keep using it consistently to see results. I am using this now for about 6 months and I clearly noticed a change in my skin, I can actually walk out the door without any make up. My skin looks fresh and healthy. I am 54, and do not have wrinkles or have a dry skin. I do have two lines around my mouth ( from too much smiling), and those got much softer after using the Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it also on my hands, what is good for my face and neck, is good for my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now part of my skin care lifestyle, will be using it till the day I am leaving this earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to do with the product, but their packing is cute; it comes in a little sheer bag with some eye creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately two months and have seen a definite change in my skin.  The serum is applied twice daily, morning and evening, and my face has been soft and smooth.  Previously, my skin was dry with large rough spots and nothing worked to regain the softness.  When I began using this serum, it helped my skin&#x27;s improvement starting within a week. I&#x27;ve used this serum together with a nourishing cream at night and a day cream in the morning, and it makes the creams go a long way making it spread more easily using less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the important factors about Passport to Organics is that it is organic and vegan and does not contain parabens nor other chemicals.  I am very impressed with the excellent quality and results.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
