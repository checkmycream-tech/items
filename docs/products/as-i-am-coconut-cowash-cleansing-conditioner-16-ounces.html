            <li>I don&#x27;t look for a product to be perfect, but I do look for it to work.:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my hair!</li>
            <li>The best it did for me was make my hair nice for one day, and made it smell nice.</li>
            <li>The way it smells is pleasant ...</li>
            <li>♦ Has a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprise.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found this brand, love their products!</li>
            <li>I am ridiculously happy with this product, and am so glad I decided to try it!</li>
            <li>Not bad for a cowash one of the best cowashes on the market for now the smell is very nice and not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have 3c fine hair and this works so well for me, not to mention the delicious smell.</li>
            <li>This co-wash is great, I use it about every four days, and my hair looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using the leave in conditioner and styling gel too, those also smell amazing and work great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>This probably the best all-in-one hair cleanser I&#x27;ve tried, but I get better results when I use Aubrey&#x27;s Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li>As good as all the reviews say</li>
            <li>My hair looks gorgeous after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Cowash did a good job of cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good cowash to cleanse my 3B hair.</li>
            <li>The cowash smells good and feels good applying.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent of this and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aloe in it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I leave this conditioner in overnight and it works really good on my hair.</li>
            <li>It a good product, and it coats the hair well, but its a conditiner, they have a creamy shampoo too.</li>
            <li>The good</li>
            <li>I like the product, it smells good.</li>
            <li>Co-washing seemed like a good idea at the time when I bought this.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t even work good.</li>
            <li>but both are good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This co-wash smells good and washes/conditions</li>
            <li>and I feel I&#x27;ve given it a good test drive.</li>
            <li>wonderful!!!!!I read good reviews about as I am coconut cowash.grrreat stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go...</li>
            <li>Anyway, I tried it and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good for dryness</li>
            <li>Smells good and makes my hair feel really good.</li>
            <li>Cowash to be a particularly good one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cowash for over a month now, and despite the good reviews here, I did not have a good experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice (not a must but a great bonus).</li>
            <li>As others said, my hair sometimes appears greasy a couple of days after using it, but then I use the As I Am shampoo and the leave in conditioner, and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>This is really good</li>
            <li>it smells really good</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel so good.</li>
            <li>This co-wash leaves my hair feeling and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a good amount when washing hair.</li>
            <li>I will say that I did notice that it DID NOT STRIP my color which is good.  </li>
            <li>Good for the hair.</li>
            <li>use this in my daughters hair and it works really good for them</li>
            <li>Loved this cowash.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and the consistency.  </li>
            <li>Loved it</li>
            <li>Sooooo good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>SOOO HOOKED, SMELLS GOOD, DETANGLES, CLEANS WELL, CONDITIONS.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>and it smells good.</li>
            <li>So, to be fair, I can’t compare this product to WEN as I’ve never used it.</li>
            <li>The cowash smells good.  </li>
            <li>It smalls so so good.</li>
            <li>Works as good as Wen but 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend however using a good leave in conditioner and moisturizer after using this product.</li>
            <li>I had been using Hair One cleansing conditioner and loved the way it made my hair feel but it wouldn&#x27;t get out my hair product (hairspray, texture wax, etc)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cowash for some time now and stumbled upon this one.</li>
            <li>it smells so good</li>
            <li>I stated in the title, I found it cheaper elsewhere (which is surprising from Amazon).</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>I tried Wen and loved it....</li>
            <li>I section my hair into 4 sections and wash each with a good sided dollop of the stuff, then I spaltter a bit of water on without rinsing and let it sit for 5 min then rinse.</li>
            <li>it almost does too good of a job.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>if you have a lot of product buildup in your hair, otherwise, one pass is good.</li>
            <li>Did not look good.</li>
            <li>but the reviews which I rely on with amazon were so good,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had people tell me it smells good after I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>and it smell so good.</li>
            <li>A good conditioner and cleanser</li>
            <li>I am switching over from Wen to this product for good.</li>
            <li>I just tried this after seeing some good reviews.</li>
            <li>It smells so good.</li>
            <li>It is a good value cowash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried three, including his, and have loved, loved, loved them all.  </li>
            <li>For best results, follow the instuctions and massage into hair as if its a shampoo to leave your hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s vegan too--no animal products, and it smells great! :)</li>
            <li>Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery.</li>

            <li>I liked the smell and consistency.  </li>
            <li>Cleanses well without drying out your hair &amp; it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I think the product is good for the most part.  </li>
            <li>The slip was excellent; I didn&#x27;t even really need a comb, just my fingers.</li>
            <li>Conditions well, smells nice.</li>
            <li>I use this product and although it is nice my hair cannot handle the chemicals.</li>
            <li>I read many good reviews about this product but in my case it was a fiasco.</li>
            <li>My type of hair is kind of curly kind of kinky</li>
            <li>Honestly, I had no clue whether or not it would work, but it did.</li>
            <li>It probably is great for many people, and we&#x27;ve enjoyed using it, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and has a creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and really cleans my hair well without drying it out or causing it to feel too stripped.</li>
            <li>It helped me detangle my hair so nicely with ease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>After reading so many good reviews I was convinced and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so moisturizing and has a really nice scent.</li>
            <li>i can honestly say i like it...</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know how effective it was.</li>
            <li>Its detangling properties are effective.  </li>
            <li>But to each his own.</li>
            <li>and I liked the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many reviews on this product all good</li>
            <li>It has a lot of slip and it detangles my hair so nicely.</li>
            <li>Good, sure, but not what my hair needs.</li>
            <li>It smells great, nice and light smell.</li>
            <li>The coconut scent is so nice and inviting when waking up in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The product has a nice scent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I have used Wen and I wasn&#x27;t totally thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It is not cost effective for the amount that you have to distribute through out your hair and once the product is distributed it did not detangle my hair or give this curl definition that I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I used one or twice a week with my Honest Company shampoo/bath wash.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not as slippery as Wen...</li>
            <li>I also liked that it did not strip my hair even after using twice.</li>
            <li>It leaves it healthy, no frizz, and removes split ends for good.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative -- it was on sale for $6.99</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this product As I am Cowash is the Absolute BEST.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>This was a nice conditioner, but didn&#x27;t work well as a cowash for me.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, and leaves</li>
            <li>It reminds me of pina coladas beachside which is really nice.  </li>
            <li>it works: Nicely.</li>
            <li>This product has a very good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; which means my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and feels very smooth, yet clean when rinsed out.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  </li>
            <li>It smells good and feels good and leaves my hair feeling conditioned and clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean, smells great and is manageable after use.</li>
            <li>I am also very impressed with the price on this particular product as compared to others.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great for me, my hair gets clean and my scalp feels nourished.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this cowash and it&#x27;s all true!</li>
            <li>After using a full container did not see any great results.  </li>
            <li>And in a good way.. the smell is lovely, not too perfume-y but also not too one note, but what i enjoyed about this product was how nice it felt on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>The ingredient list alone is impressive, but the real wow factor came in the use of the product.</li>
            <li>This is my new best find!</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with hair care products for about 4 to five years now and I am loving these items as well as Shea Moisture which is another line I own and just love.</li>
            <li>My hair is very easy to style.</li>
            <li>Made it very easy to detangle and no buildup either.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it one more chance before passing it on, and I am so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>My curls are shiny and defined (well, except I kept putting my hands in &#x27;em, so they probably could have looked even better if I had more self-control!)  </li>
            <li>This lovely CoWash is SILICONE FREE!!</li>
            <li>The best hair product for my co wash leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feels soft and smells great!</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best cowash products Ive ever used!</li>
            <li>Best results for natural hair wearers.</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful on natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>They are both excellent natural alternatives</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy, leaves my hair easy to manage and looking the best that it can.  </li>
            <li>This stuff make it shiny, soft and smells great!!</li>
            <li>I can detangled my hair and wash it perfect for my transition to natural</li>
            <li>The smell is great like fresh coconuts.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST PRODUCT I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>One of the best products that I have purchased since going natural.</li>
            <li>Out of them all As I Am&#x27;s Co Wash is by far the best to cleanse and condition the hair.</li>
            <li>A natural girl&#x27;s best friend!</li>

            <li>I was able to very easily run this product through my hair after fully saturating my hair with water.</li>
            <li>This cleans better, I don&#x27;t feel the hair oily and washes very easily.  </li>
            <li>This product is the first product I&#x27;ve found which leaves my hair and scalp looking and feeling great after a wash.</li>
            <li>I had heard really good things about this product and now having tried it for myself I can say they are all true.</li>
            <li>It provides a good clean without stripping the hair of precious moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on my daughter who has fine, curly hair and it made her curls lovely!</li>
            <li>Loved it and help to hydrate my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li>but it also has a nice strong coconut smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Jamaican with fine relaxed hair this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great solution for when you need to clean your hair but don&#x27;t want to go through the full washing process.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t like to wash it more than twice a week.</li>
            <li>the magic is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and all I can say is I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more products from</li>
            <li>I love Wen co- wash</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is such a perfect product.  </li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoyed his presentation and now follow his routine to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>All the while, they&#x27;re both FANTASTIC conditioners, softeners, and reduce combing forces!</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s an awesome product with a simple ingredient list and it</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s an awesome product with a simple ingredient list and it</li>
            <li>I love the feel and consistency.</li>
            <li>It is beyond me how this product got so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li>Just FYI :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now, and I am in love.</li>
            <li>But I am ok with that.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>; had great reviews and was comparable (but much cheaper)</li>
            <li>I was extremely pleased with the results and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li>It also wasn&#x27;t a great detangler and it didn&#x27;t really soften my hair either.</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product!</li>
            <li>As I Am CoWash is more of a CoWash product than a conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I think she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Something I have never been able to do without tangles.</li>
            <li>I was able to detangle with my fingers instead of using a comb.</li>
            <li>And I love the smell.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li>love this stuff and would not be without it</li>
            <li>I tried it and love it.  </li>
            <li>However, I do notice that after a month or so it starts to get more and more greasy between washes.</li>
            <li>, co-washing isn&#x27;t ok to do often.</li>
            <li>It was just okay to me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The packaging could be better.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon carries these type products</li>
            <li>so I have to use more of this than the recommendations suggest.</li>
            <li>I think As I Am is might be slightly better than Renpure for my hair type</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s manageable, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Awesome results in just a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Use it more than shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>and its so cheap!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used Wen&#x27;s Cowash and I like this product better.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>and I love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this cowash.</li>
            <li>I am trying to go more days in between washing.</li>
            <li>So I added some more joico</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>It cleans the hair better than shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The smell is great since I love coconut so much.</li>
            <li>I truly love this.</li>
            <li>but I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But please be sure to use a dentangling condintioner with this Co-Wash.</li>
            <li>I happen to love co-wash products, and have found As I Am</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love using this cowash--I just avoid my scalp</li>
            <li>and i bought this product out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Most of it ends up in the tub than on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this product</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I am in love plus</li>
            <li>and I know I will love it</li>
            <li>I would hope that they would ship this in a better way.</li>
            <li>So yes, I would recommend, and I love it.</li>
            <li>(lathers a bit  the more you use and work into hair)&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I chopped my hair twice in hopes it would grow healthy, but nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thinking that he wouldn&#x27;t understand (he is a man) and probably better to fib a reason but honesty paid here.</li>
            <li>Light bulb moment!  </li>
            <li>My waves are more defined and even have a bit of bounce.</li>
            <li>but it better then</li>
            <li>You can never be too sure these days.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is close to 4 stars because my hair is noticeably better, but I find myself dreading washing my hair with this because of the lack of ease and the slippery tub.</li>
            <li>This cowash conditioner smells lovely and works well as a cowash.</li>
            <li>It smells okay.</li>
            <li>Upon more research, you have to rinse quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Make sure you thoroughly rinse.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite cleaning cowwash.</li>
            <li>I ended up switching to Pantene&#x27;s Cleansing conditioner which gave much better detangling slip and menthol for my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the price, the smell, the way my hair looks after.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It has helped with static fly-always this winter season.</li>
            <li>so glad i tried it</li>
            <li>Love the product by cant afford the cost.</li>
            <li>I found As I Am online and love the price.</li>
            <li>This product is OK</li>
            <li>I have received better results co washing with V05 Moisture Milks.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my hair was super clean but also felt moisturized, it was great.</li>
            <li>I love that</li>
            <li>This is better in price, amount needed, and effect.</li>
            <li>I will try once more with a shower cap and heat and update my review with the results.</li>
            <li>It has more of a &#x27;no smell&#x27; to me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and seems to work for many different hair types.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love how the cowash smooths my hair with out streaking it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I used the WEN instructions when I used this and made sure my hair was drenched when I started working this in.  </li>
            <li>I used an argon oil hair mask in lieu of a detangler, but I&#x27;m sure that using just a bit of this as a leave in conditioner like I&#x27;ve always done with WEN would work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to learning how to get the most from my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>I like this better.</li>
            <li>My hair got softer and has more volume I love it.</li>
            <li>That being said, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your hair feeling a lot more manageable.</li>
            <li>I love Coconut</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>cowash has made me love my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>As I Am Coconut CoWash :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure part of that is because of shampoos.</li>
            <li>I guess you just use alot and make sure you cover every portion, and it takes the place of what lathering does.</li>
            <li>try this you will love it!!!1</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m being more selective with the products I put on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yay!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It works better than shampoo followed by conditioner.  </li>
            <li>But got better result from cheaper conditioners.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>, my hair got 50% better, but still frizzy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It became shiny and bouncy, even better than before!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend this, but before buying try getting the sample to make sure It works for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>yes I would say I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Along with many, I wanted to use Wen.</li>
            <li>Okay but needs conditioner after for sure.</li>
            <li>This product really does a good job for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been better.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li>And I love the fact that it has organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair, smooth and shiny with nice curls.  </li>
            <li>I love it when I put this in my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell &amp; it feels so creamy.</li>
            <li>I believe you will LOVE it too.</li>
            <li>vs. when I was shampooing, but the results are much better.</li>
            <li>I used this three to four times and just found it to be just okay.</li>
            <li>I was able to give this to a friend of my daughter who has dreadlocks and she loves it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>:)  Would recommend co-washing, and using this co-wash to every curly head.</li>
            <li>A lot of ladies complain about the container, so I purchase a plastic container with a pump top and put all 16 ounces in it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different cleansing conditioners, but this is the most creamy and has excellent slip.</li>
            <li>Elation (the deep condition) is also a great product!</li>
            <li>This product makes me want to stop shampooing, I love it.</li>
            <li>When I tried to add more conditioner, it would get that greasy feeling the day after I washed my hair</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Packaging could be better.  </li>
            <li>A bottle would definitely be a better option with a pop up top.</li>
            <li>Even better is walgreens sells it for about 7 bucks.</li>
            <li>I love cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer  and smoother after using it and a my curly cream works better.</li>
            <li>number of pumps, comb it through hair, leave on for so many minutes--that I just gave up.</li>
            <li>The top layer is blond</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love As I Am.  </li>
            <li>I use the leave in as well as the curly jelly and love them all.</li>
            <li>I have found my wavey hair has become more curly</li>
            <li>so not every one is going to be able to use this product.</li>
            <li>so well my stylist asked what I&#x27;ve been using :) You can&#x27;t find a better price than on Amazon.</li>
            <li>However, this product is just okay</li>
            <li>There was no seal when i opened the top so there was conditioner all around the top, sort of oozing</li>
            <li>and it seems ok</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this cowash and will continue to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I went through that routine for about a month, hoping that eventually it would get better.</li>
            <li>and it was two times too many.  </li>
            <li>If you do, I am glad it worked for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m REALLY pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I can let my hair air-dry after using this without looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ALOT cheaper than WEN and works better.</li>
            <li>I was looking for more moisture for my 3b curls, but this didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>After a couple more months I realized I&#x27;d lost about 1/3 of my volume</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll probably pass this product along to one of my AA friends whom it might be better suited for.</li>
            <li>a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I would have better results if I would use it every day.</li>
            <li>I love use</li>
            <li>I want more order this</li>
            <li>I love the texture of my hair after towel drying.  </li>
            <li>Aside from this concern, I love the product.</li>
            <li>It works ok with my curls.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied with it for the price.</li>
            <li>The product is great, and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Like many before me, I like Wen, but I do not like the price.  </li>
            <li>Waaaaaaay better than when I co-wash with Vo5 conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m in the minority there -- as most people love it.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but it was ok but</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>a pump would have been so much more convenient.</li>
            <li>I love this and hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner when i use it</li>
            <li>I like the smell because I love coconuts</li>
            <li>I love this conditioning cleanser.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>I had to use more of it than I did the</li>
            <li>I got my product on time and was able to track it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the moisture it leaves on the hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite, but I am just not a coconut fan.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it was in a pump but overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get product build up from the coconut co wash and it spreads throughout my hair better than hair one.</li>
            <li>I product is okay.  </li>
            <li>My hair was more manageable after washing.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I am able to shampoo my wavy/curly shoulder length hair just once a week now.</li>
            <li>I have tried many cleansing conditioners, and this is my favorite alongside Wen products.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I never was satisfied with how my hair looked or felt.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel this did anything more for my hair than using a cheapie conditioner to cowash.</li>
            <li>Love this line</li>
            <li>Better than shampoo.</li>
            <li>If you wash, rinse, repeat a section twice or more, it feels more \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a 16 ounce jar</li>
            <li>Smells nice, goes on hair smoothly, hair feels softer.</li>
            <li>I think that some of the ingredients strip your hair more than the product description suggests.</li>
            <li>So even though it is meant to be used by itself, I like it better than any conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>This is an ok cowash cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have to use a conditioner with more slip afterwards.</li>
            <li>On hair that is more course it does not do well.</li>
            <li>Joico is a better choice for a detangler.</li>
            <li>I used up that bottle, and knew I had to buy more.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of this product on my scalp</li>
            <li>but it was comparable to Wen, maybe even better as the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; in Wen has been known to burn my eyes and cause my scalp to itch.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have had many of their product&#x27;s before throwing them away.  </li>
            <li>So much better than WEN.  </li>
            <li>and this product does a much better job.</li>
            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>Hair Rules was okay</li>
            <li>so I maybe had to use more than somebody else)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my color stays a lot better with this also, so if you color your hair, this is a way to keep it, and it doesn&#x27;t strip the color out.</li>
            <li>Yes I would recommend this coconut cowash cleansing conditioner, for me it works better than the wen.</li>
            <li>Glad you have it in stock.</li>
            <li>This is cleansing more than conditioning.</li>
            <li>My curls enjoyed the combo.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>I will use this 1st when I co-wash and then follow with Organix Argan Oil conditioner for more moisture and to detangle.  </li>
            <li>I wish this had better smell.</li>
            <li>(this has been a very successful use of this product :).I will not likely repurchase.</li>
            <li>wonderful cleansing cowash leaves you hair soft and clean helps remove build ups and hair products.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair feel soft and clean, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t strip any of the colour from my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But after drying, my hair &amp; scalp are clean, soft, shiny, and perfectly manageable.  </li>
            <li>The product smells okay and has a nice consistency, but doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and my hair is very clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more of this!!!</li>
            <li>Just got this and used it and so far so good!</li>
            <li>This one had great feedback and was a decent price so of course I had to try it.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this conditioner is great for 4a,4b,4c hair textures in particular.</li>
            <li>Lol, but overall, this is the best co wash so far</li>
            <li>It still works pretty well and smells good.</li>
            <li>and I am noticing that my hair is becoming softer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>All the good reviews are real!</li>
            <li>Its kind of coconut-y, and sweet.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the ingredients are great and it left a nice slip to it.</li>
            <li>and her hair was soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li>Co-wash is a product that is perfect for if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a bottle from Sally&#x27;s to make it much more easy for application.</li>
            <li>Super nice product for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and is super conditioning.</li>
            <li>My hair is more easily untangled and shinier when it dries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter weight than conditioners I&#x27;ve used to detangle before, which seems like it helps the comb and brush to glide through more easily.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Cleansing Conditioner is better for my hair, and I&#x27;ll keep this until my order for L.C.C. comes in (thankfully, Amazon makes it easy to find things I can&#x27;t find in the stores) and for backup when I run out.  </li>
            <li>- it would also be excellent for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is softer and easy to manage and I would encourage anyone looking to eliminate dryness and wanted to promote their healthy hair to try this product.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and really leaves the hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Incredible products I am a female of Caucasian but absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>Great for natural and synthetic hair!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even need to finger detangler after using it because my hair is so slippery and clean that the knots just detangler themselves!</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp are clean and moisturized!</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of cleaning the scrap and left my hair really clean.</li>
            <li>the conditioner is made my hair silky smooth and an adorable sent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Light fragrance and ease of use makes this a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>I would have to say I even like this product better than my shea products and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>i love it, makes my hair so smooth</li>
            <li>Please consider buying this product it is a great staple for your natural hair care collection.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this product works great.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing wash for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>A great product, it leaves your hair soft but you still sit with loads of tangles.</li>
            <li>leaves your hair soft and manageable and smells great.</li>
            <li>Makes my natural hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li>, she loved it so much I gave her the container.  </li>
            <li>it smells so good and my hair really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>I hope not, since I&#x27;ve loved my hair since using it, but I have a very itchy scalp, and my skin seems to be reacting as well.  </li>
            <li>Also, I gave a friend with straight hair a container of this, and both she and her husband loved it immediately.</li>
            <li>It smells good but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it is cleaning my hair.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product so much that I had to write a review on Amazon even though I ended up purchasing at Sally&#x27;s because of time constraints.</li>
            <li>So I say this all the good reviews  are correct in saying it is a fine product because certain texture it works well.</li>
            <li>this stuff kind of runs right out of your hand...</li>
            <li>Although the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, my hair tends to tangle more after using it than I&#x27;d like requiring me to use significant amounts of leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li>or if I&#x27;m doing the gym 2 days in a row) but the best thing is still  to wash every other day.</li>
            <li>so excited :)</li>
            <li>definitely a keeper and a good price !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other non-sudsing cleansers and found this one to be the best and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other co-washes but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this co-wash!  </li>
            <li>Overall great product and I will buy more from Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s an easy fix at home.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit scared about using the cowash because I wasn&#x27;t sure about how it would get my hair clean.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair easy to manage</li>
            <li>The smell is delightful and it really seems to do the job for cleansing my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about how clean it gets your hair though.</li>
            <li>My braid pony tail is easily 18+ inches in length.</li>
            <li>It spread through my hair easily and rinsed out easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rinses out easily and detangles quite well.</li>
            <li>and now my conditioner is sitting in my shower for easy access.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair can stay clean all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to distribute through your hair.</li>
            <li>but you can still detangle your hair but not as easily.</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed is that I have to use quite a bit of the cowash to feel like I&#x27;m drenching my hair with it, so I&#x27;ll be going through it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It smelled ok and did make my hair feel clean which I was worried about.</li>
            <li>easy to use and rinse out.</li>
            <li>but I found a way to get it to work better for me and make my scalp clean.  </li>
            <li>it made my hair easy to detangle..</li>
            <li>Luckily, most of it stayed in the container, but then the shower floor was slippery from the spilled cowash, so I had to clean the shower floor.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff, i like the way my hair looks so clean and moisturized, and it detangles easily..</li>
            <li>My hair is  looser in pattern and the part of my head that consist a cotton texture is looser and easy to detange with my fingers. .</li>
            <li>I have type 4 hair and it gets tangled easily and needs products with a lot of slip for detangling.</li>
            <li>Did not style easily or well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with or without shampoo.</li>
            <li>-- soooo easy to style.  </li>
            <li>It massages into the scalp easily and I could even detangle with it.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a strong smell for you ladies and gentlemen that don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>and my hairdresser strongly discouraged me from using it.</li>
            <li>Dear Amazon, I have been using this cowash and I can say that it is very gentle and effective for my two kinds of hair.  </li>
            <li>my first use of this product, my hair felt AMAZING...</li>
            <li>It does not have the sweet mint scent that I love from Wen, but it cleanses and conditions my hair just as well.</li>
            <li>I used it a second time and my hair got so beautiful</li>
            <li>My wonderful stylist recommended this product and other sulfate free brands.</li>
            <li>I only used it once and the product made my daughter&#x27;s curls stand out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>With this cowash you may not need to condition afterwards because it leaves your hair pretty nice, but with my hair I need a conditioner and a leave in.  </li>
            <li>Great results, hair are very soft and clean, no need to apply conditioner because hair become very smooth and silky right away.</li>
            <li>If you use a lot of butters and get buildup, this product may be fine for you.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fine and the consistency too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has  a light, almost gel-like texture, and distributes into hair easily.</li>
            <li>I have fine then hair</li>
            <li>We all have fine hair that&#x27;s prone to dryness, breakage, yet oily scalp.</li>
            <li>For some background: I have fine, pin-straight hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first real cowash I&#x27;ve tried, and it works great.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but I have a LOT of it, and it is wavy.</li>
            <li>I guess that would be fine</li>
            <li>This  coconut cowash is fine.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Detangling is super breezy too!</li>
            <li>I would advise mostly using it on the roots unless you use quite a lot of product on the lengths of your hair, since otherwise you will probably find yourself going through this jar fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly though!</li>
            <li>This has quickly become 1 of my favorite go to products.  </li>
            <li>I love how the mild scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>It is the best cowash and detangling product, but generally the most pleasing product that I&#x27;ve used as far as giving me the results that I want without any complaints.</li>
            <li>The curl/coils were still tight and looking great when I arrived to work!</li>
            <li>, my hair was strong and growing beautifully &amp; now it is dry and brittle and breaking off.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair moist and is not heavy, great for keeping hair clean between salon visits, smells good and hair was clean without stripping natural oils</li>
            <li>HUGE plus.  </li>
            <li>and I had huge flakes of dandruff.</li>
            <li>My hair was very greasy at first, but after about two weeks my hair looked amazing!</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the product and that my hair is free from buildup after I wash.  </li>
            <li>I have ethnic hair and this cowash is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sulfate Free</li>
            <li>But as soon as I smooth this cowash in, I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth</li>
            <li>You need to use a clarifying shampoo free of those ingredients THEN use this...  </li>
            <li>/&gt;♦ Light texture&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this 16 ounce size will last me about 10 washes, which is great.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;This is worth more than 5 stars 👍🏽</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and the price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I use a sulfate free wash and comb my hair out in the shower, I then rinse and apply AS I AM and comb it through; I allow this product to sit in my hair for a while, as I shave my legs, and then rinse it out.</li>
            <li>My hair is light weight, silky, and frizz/ flyaway free.</li>
            <li>enjoy yinz</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m giving the product 3 stars for the smell only, it smells great.</li>
            <li>how it makes her hair style is not yet important.</li>
            <li>My hair has never before been shiny, smooth and manageable as it is now that I&#x27;m using As I Am.</li>
            <li>She had been looking into sulfate free shampoos and decided to try this.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh smell but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>That way my hair doesn&#x27;t get stripped but my scalp still feels flake free and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it about 4 days a week and the rest I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner (dermorganics).</li>
            <li>The smell is also really nice, very tropical.</li>
            <li>the heat from the hair dryer makes me look like I stuck my finger in a light switch.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes it so easy to brush and comb the tangles out, and also helps to clean product buildup out of my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>w/ a water bottle that is filled w/ conditioner &amp; tea tree oil &amp; generously apply the co wash cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product works excellent for those of us that want fresh/clean hair everyday.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>My hair is light colored and almost to my waist.</li>
            <li>The product works very well but after careful research, I found it for way cheaper than this, its okay, I&#x27;ll just research before buying, but the products is Great!</li>
            <li>This product has a light coconut scent that stays in your hair even after you rinse off.  </li>
            <li>I found that my hair liked Curl Junkie (very moisturizing) and Spiral Solutions (boutique brand) and Jessicurl (also boutique).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the hunt for \\&quot;on</li>
            <li>is sulfate free, but</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought this at Sally&#x27;s because I heard so many good reviews</li>
            <li>smells really good and it leaves my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white girl with straight hair and this product works awesome for me.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and hydrated, But i have to use quite a bit of the product to work it on my scalp, it does have a nice smell, like most AS I AM products.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely, delicate coconut fragrance that is not overpowering at all, detangles my hair wonderfully, and cleanses my hair along with moisturizing it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 15yrs now and this is by far one of the best products that I have used.</li>
            <li>Simply put: the absolute best!!!</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s good slip, so it spreads easily, and my hair comes out looking clean (but not a stiff, squeaky clean) and voluminous.</li>
            <li>Shed hairs slide right on out:)</li>
            <li>When used with a good shampoo, my hair feels soft, smooth, weightless, and clean.</li>
            <li>The cleansing part didn&#x27;t really work for my hair though,OH POO!!!</li>
            <li>It smells good and my hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Since infant hair is much finer than an older child&#x27;s and adults hair this worked great for him.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product because it gets my hair clean and conditions it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy going on, smells good and leaves my hair soft an clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally thick and are very full so when it gets nappy I still get to enjoy the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>There are protein rich products and protein free products  ...  </li>
            <li>Just bought this and love the large tub size!</li>
            <li>Leaves it clean and feeling light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and 100% get the hair clean and conditioned all at once.</li>
            <li>This co-wash does not leave your hair smooth but it cleanses the scalp thoroughly and the scalp feels clean and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and free of buildup.  </li>
            <li>The smell was mild but nice and so far, I love it, plus...</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell but doesn&#x27;t detangle particularly well; my $.79 bottle of VO5 Strawberries and Cream Conditioner outperforms this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my hair feels soft and healthy but easily style able .</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, has ridiculous (in a GOOD way!)</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and not too strong, it applies nicely, rinses out well, and leaves my hair really easy to dry &amp; style.  </li>
            <li>Especially important where I live because the desert air really dries out the skin.  </li>
            <li>Now, I already have a favorite co-wash (Shi-Naturals Conditioner Wash), however, I wanted to try something new, so I will not run out of my precious Shi-Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Great deal for the money since I&#x27;m sure I could have used less.</li>
            <li>I Am makes a number of wonderful products that are worth the slightly hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li>I am super happy to have finally found something that suits my need.</li>
            <li>But, what I like best is that it didnt dry out my hair, which is very delicate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently started using this product and my hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased WEN in an attempt to help with my hair problem.  </li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, smooth and full of body.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s re-ordered, so I guess that&#x27;s a success!</li>
            <li>I have literally never been so excited about a hair product.</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>This product has been a staple since I first started growing my hair 2 years ago, it&#x27;s even better now with Amazon Prime&#x27;s subscription service</li>
            <li>and I have it ready to go! :-)  </li>
            <li>For NOW just keep aware of where it is and set the lid on top if you are showering to keep water out.  </li>
            <li>Excited to see what continued use will do considering I&#x27;ve used it once</li>
            <li>It is significantly cheaper than the price in beauty stores, and it is worth it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff very cleansing and doesn&#x27;t streak my hair of moisture at all!</li>
            <li>Buy it it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was excited about ordering this.  </li>
            <li>It is so totally worth the money!  </li>
            <li>LOL!!tally worth the money!  </li>
            <li>For some people that seemed to notice that it leaves their hair greasy, when you first start to co-wash, your hair tends to produce more oil.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair pretty shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It does not lather up too much and it rinses out easily!</li>
            <li>so wanted something I could use to feel clean without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li>I no longer have a closet full of hair care products that ended up not working - nor am I slave to the blow dryer or hot iron :)</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean after using this product...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting that clean feeling from a &amp;#34;no suds&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped, just clean.</li>
            <li>As an aside: I used this product before getting my hair done and my stylist even mentioned how clean my hair was.</li>
            <li>(Castor) Seed Oil¹, Phytosterols¹, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract¹, Quaternium-18, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Methylisothiazolinone.ng that clean feeling from a &amp;#34;no suds&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped, just clean.</li>
            <li>As an aside: I used this product before getting my hair done and my stylist even mentioned how clean my hair was.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off using a regular moisturizing conditioner (you know the drugstore kind) which is what I had been doing for years.    </li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li>and I like to get my scalp really clean.</li>
            <li>But it does feel clean after i use it</li>
            <li>but I like the squeaky clean feeling which this doesn&#x27;t provide.  </li>
            <li>so well conditioned and clean.  </li>
            <li>but it just didn&#x27;t work for me; it just doesn&#x27;t clean as well as shampoo and leaves buildup.  </li>
            <li>my hair was clean but still felt moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I could see my curls look squeaky clean?</li>
            <li>Some of the sulfate frees don&#x27;t clean well or take alot to  work.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would clean my hair like a shampoo</li>
            <li>Just use it to clean the scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s STILL clean...</li>
            <li>conditioner could actually clean my hair without leaving it greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li>As I Am Coconut CoWash adds moisture to my hair but still gets it squeaky clean (and</li>
            <li>So my hubby transferred this product into the thoroughly clean pump dispenser bottle.  </li>
            <li>It really does help bringing the natural wave to my hair, which I think looks great.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair clean and smelling like coconut.</li>
            <li>and I will have to do more co-washes to my natural hair. :)</li>
            <li>I use this in alternation with pantene shampoo-conditioner combo to keep my scalp clean.</li>
            <li>This product gets my hair clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>My hair and scalp felt amazingly clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>I let it sit until the end of my shower, rinse thoroughly and when my hair is dry it looks great and clean.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, and isn&#x27;t trying.</li>
            <li>I considered making my own cowash but after pricing out the ingredients it is the same cost as Asiam Coconut Cowash, so I will keep buying it here :)</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t make my hair managable or clean.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair feels clean and moisturized with bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>I sometimes even clean my body with it for the moisture it provides.</li>
            <li>While this co-wash does get your scalp clean.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your hair feeling clean but not stripped of all moisture</li>
            <li>Hair feels moisturized and clean, with movement and shine.  </li>
            <li>the more I use it the better my hair looks, less fuzz, more shine, better manageability, nicer curls.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing conditioner is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>(Example, Kinky Curly&#x27;s Come Clean</li>
            <li>I rated this product 5 stars because my hair feels clean and moisturized after applying it.</li>
            <li>It leaves her hair very soft and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>My natural curls have never looked better!</li>
            <li>Upon hearing the reviews on YouTube about this product and being that I have other products in this line I was over joyed at having another option for a Co wash and it performed beautifully.</li>
            <li>My hair was full of volume and clean for all day.</li>
            <li>This one does not do anything special for me.  </li>
            <li>My hair just drinks it right up!  </li>
            <li>This makes more coils in my hair than the other conditioner I used as my cowash (and I was pretty happy with that conditioner).</li>
            <li>Just fabulously moisturizing and leaves my hair feeling so fresh, clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>The product has a light coconut fragrance that is fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>I just washed my hair with this stuff and was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has this amazing coconut smell to it, and it leaves your hair feeling so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This is far out the best cleanser for my hair, and will continue to use it as long as it stays on the market.</li>
            <li>I use a different shampoo to keep the highlights bright in my hair, and then use this as a conditioner for 5 minutes and rinse it out.</li>
            <li>My elasticity is normal after 3+ years of good gentle care and conditioning and growing out the damaged bits.</li>
            <li>Okay I have never used Wen, but I really don&#x27;t think that I need to after using this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found for my thick hip length hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>It is something that is true to its ad.</li>
            <li>and I have used this product and it leaves my hair super clean.</li>
            <li>It only costs $4 for a 32 oz bottle and it is twice as good as this product on my curly</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Despite all of this I used the entire thing of it just to give it a fair chance</li>
            <li>For the rest of my hair,  especially the ends, I&#x27;m not convinced this product does a good job conditioning.</li>
            <li>I have gotten tons of compliments about how full and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li>this product really works for my hair, i love the smell.</li>
            <li>Nice for natural hair</li>
            <li>So while I can&#x27;t speak to how this product would work on natural hair, I would use this with a weave at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I think they are both good choices, but come time to repurchase, I will only buy Eden!</li>
            <li>It keeps my kids hair nice and soft and it easier to comb</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s smells really yummy. :)</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff initially because I wanted a one step wash routine.</li>
            <li>However, to be fair I have only used it 3 times.</li>
            <li>make sure to use a VERY generous amount.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair both curly and straight, and it does wonders for adding moisture and makes my hair much more healthier.</li>
            <li>This made my hair soft and smell really nice.</li>
            <li>I also let it sit for about 15 minutes with a cap on to make sure it really got conditioned.</li>
            <li>I can see the difference in my hair texture thickening and being super clean.</li>
            <li>I passed on it because I had never heard of it, even though it was full of rave reviews...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>I use it on my daughters waist length thick hair and it stayed beautiful for 3 days!  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Really nice, my hair was soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>only this product and my hair was fairly oily when I got in the shower.  </li>
            <li>As I am cowash not only cleanses my hair good, it works with my budget.  </li>
            <li>A full palmful for my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li>I think it works okay, but I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li>not bad.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not everyone may like it.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad co wash.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, that&#x27;s not bad for 16 oz.</li>
            <li>This one is not bad.</li>
            <li>I love it when you find something that works right the first time.</li>
            <li>It helped keep my hair strong and soft love it.</li>
            <li>My hair responded very well to this product, My Hair was very Clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>Nothing great, other than the coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers who found this a great product.</li>
            <li>but the overly sweet smell, and high price tag was killing me, plus my hair didn&#x27;t look any better.</li>
            <li>a shampoo, my hair felt fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>, It quickly went in the trash.</li>
            <li>This co-wash is the best on the market for african american hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it makes my curly hair soft, shiney and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Two months ago I started using co-wash conditioner, and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a never ending search for mostly protein free products for my 4c natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Ships quickly and is as advertised.</li>
            <li>Adequate product for the price.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I was able to comb my hair out IN THE SHOWER which I’ve NEVER been able to do.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s better to pay extra money for a better product like Wen.</li>
            <li>Even a traditional shampoo bottle with a twist off top would protect it from mold better.</li>
            <li>I chose this because of the suggestions in &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; and agree that the cowash helps tremendously with caring for my curly s&#x27;waves.</li>
            <li>a whole lot of fruity yumminess andfresh clean hair with a slip!  </li>
            <li>ACTUALLY GETS CLEAN AND CONDITIONED AND SOFT AND EASY TO COMB!!!</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, is mild enough for daily use and makes detangling SO easy and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Luckily, i was able to purchase it on sale at Walgreens for $6.99 (the product is normally $7.99) and after a month of using this cleansing conditioner, I am officially hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have type 3a curls, and I need to use some leave-in conditioner after using this cowash (which sort of negates the point, but it&#x27;s still better than using shampoo all the time), but other than that it&#x27;s an effective cleansing agent.</li>
            <li>I thought cowashes were a gimmick (why not just use cheap conditioner to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft  since using it, and super easy to detangle!</li>
            <li>My porosity used to be high-high, and now I think it&#x27;s more normal.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and clean and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>These people must have super dry hair as I don&#x27;t understand how in the world they say it&#x27;s any good?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, my hair being natural dry and wavy, type 2b/2c, it has responded wonderfully to at home, weekly, hot oil treatments; and so since I&#x27;m adding all these oils to my hair, I wanted a cleansing shampoo</li>
            <li>My 7 yr old has very fine, wavy flyaway hair and it has done wonders for hers.</li>
            <li>I think I found my new favorite cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this i live by it</li>
            <li>but my hair just love new</li>
            <li>and you really need to scrub around your scalp very good to insure the cream wash breaks down all the dirt and oil before rinsing.</li>
            <li>so my hair can get very straw like straw easily...</li>
            <li>It really softens my 4c hair and makes it supple and easy to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>so easy makes managing my hair during the wash process so much easier i have been using this for months</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and it doesn&#x27;t linger much.</li>
            <li>I can dry it and in the summer it still looks good.  </li>
            <li>It really is a good product for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels so good after using this--not dry and itchy like with shampoos.</li>
            <li>2 stars only because it was good that first time, and might continue to work for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very soft or healthy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>Smells yummy, leaves hair feeling very soft and for all the naturals that don&#x27;t really have the time or energy to create every single thing in the kitchen( lol ), this product is a blessing!</li>
            <li>Definitely has a prominent place in my product stash!</li>
            <li>First, the scent is heavenly (but it doesn&#x27;t linger too much) and it really detangled my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>So I thought to use this as a regular conditioner &amp; I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>will definitely recommend :)!</li>
            <li>I use it after deep conditioning &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li>keep my hair very moisture!!</li>
            <li>I had NO idea her hair could curl as much as it does!!  </li>
            <li>I love how it leaves me hair so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>This product is great to use when you don&#x27;t actually want to do a full wash on your natural hair.</li>
            <li>I received the product and used it the same night, love it!</li>
            <li>He laughed and said, &amp;#34;you sound like a black girl, my girl, my ma and sisters always be b#*ching about washing their hair.</li>
            <li>3c/4a hair, low porosity.&lt;br /&gt;This has easily become my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>It cleans hair so well with no residues and most important it does not dry out hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair does not feel dry or gross at all, it just feels absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know who thought anyone would find it easy or the slightest bit enjoyable to fumble around with a smooth 16 oz jar in the shower when that jar contains a slippery substance that you are attempting to manipulate through your hair (sometimes with your eyes closed).</li>
            <li>I love co-washing my fine naturally blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>As other glowing reviews already mentioned, this cowash has a pleasant scent, cleanses and conditions.  </li>
            <li>alone, with no conditioner or leave-in after, my hair felt smooth, light, and very clean once dry.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser - nice light coconut scent; not overwhelming and your hair doesn&#x27;t stay greasy afterwards like some cleanser does.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived very fast and just like if you had gone to the store to purchase it.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, cleans hair without drying and also conditions at the same time.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s proven -  protein free for real and moisturizing after rinse out.</li>
            <li>My hair detangles in a snap and looks great after it&#x27;s blow dried</li>
            <li>It was ok, kind of made my hair stringy or course and heavy.</li>
            <li>I realize the range of AA hair is HUGE and this probably doesn&#x27;t help too much as a discription.</li>
            <li>I can easily comb my hair in the shower and it leaves it feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I got this from a beauty supply store and really wanted to love it, but I didn&#x27;t feel it conditioned my hair very well.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair manageable and so soft.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard YouTubers say to purchase a cheaper moisturizing conditioner from brands such as Creme of Nature and Garnier Fructis when co-washing; however, I liked the packaging and the ingredients, so I went for it.  </li>
            <li>I am going through a transition to natural hair and my hair looks beatiful and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you work out frequently and want to keep your hair clean, but not stripped and dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, regardless.</li>
            <li>I was using shea moisture products for a while (which I really liked) but they stopped selling them in my local store.</li>
            <li>I guess this product isn&#x27;t really for ethnic hair, it really drys my hair out, but it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>I have tried thousands of dollars worth of products.  </li>
            <li>It makes wash day an exciting event for me.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>But if I had to chose just one, Eden wins.</li>
            <li>I love that is also all natural and nourishing for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough on its own.</li>
            <li>simply because the kind of luck</li>
            <li>Sometimes natural hair just needs different types of treatment and I&#x27;m so happy I tried this as an option.</li>
            <li>My natural hair felt ok.</li>
            <li>love the way it makes my natural hair feel</li>
            <li>This product works well when I want to let my hair go wild, which is most days.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Leaves my curly hair soft and healthy looking .</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always good and wet when I clip it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt good the whole time, never oily or heavy or conversely &amp;#34;straw-like&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve read reports of while reading so many cleansing conditioner reviews.  </li>
            <li>I do have to cowash more frequently (every 2-3 days)</li>
            <li>Good packaging from the seller delivery was fast would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>and I still get my monies worth.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cowash so far.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair so soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li>I kept it in for about 15 minutes and then made sure to wash it out completely.</li>
            <li>I have waist length hair and was able to stretch it just as far as a set of bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It helps to maintain my healthy natural hair.</li>
            <li>most newly natural folks, I became a product junkie.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but now that I&#x27;ve used it I can say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This cowash worked very nicely, it left my hair so soft, and I have to say that I liked it much better than wen.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and I think my curls love this stuff because they are so bouncy afterwards</li>
            <li>but I am not too thrilled with the actual product for my hair.</li>
            <li>It was beautiful and past my shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>It smells incredible, it is of high quality from what I can tell, but it did not clean my hair to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>I use this once a week to really give my hair a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li>It came quick and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I learnt pretty quickly that shampoos, including sulfate-free ones, were a no-no for my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing,is light on my fine hair, makes it super soft, moisturized and really brings out my curls after a wash.</li>
            <li>My scalp feels clean but not stripped and my ends are soft and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li>it made my hair like super soft and easy to detangle... and I have 4b 4c hair..</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t get excited to shower with baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lost the receipt, so this one is going right in the trash.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s right for Caucasians.</li>
            <li>So I clarify about once a month with baking soda and water and then immediately right after I do a clarifying wash with baking soda</li>
            <li>it is the right price at sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>but I am going to invest in this brand for that right now.</li>
            <li>started to use it right after my coloring.</li>
            <li>Right now I am using this along with Loreal evercreme cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>The price is defiantly right as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m caucasian and didn&#x27;t know if this would be right for me, but it seems it is right for almost anyone.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think this is the right co-wash product for me.</li>
            <li>the comp just ran right through.</li>
            <li>The water runs right through to detangle without even the need of comb in the shower.</li>
            <li>Right amount of cleanser and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have a stockpile of it right now, because it seems anytime I find something I like, it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li>The coconut cowash made my hair feel very clean, it very easily removed style buildup and my hair felt so soft after like i had just deep conditioned but no residue or buildup!  </li>
            <li>This morning my hair is very moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>I have found this product unusual because I am so use to soapy suds to clean.  </li>
            <li>Once it all washed out my hair was so clean and had so much volume.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter who had such chemically damaged hair that she couldn&#x27;t even get a nice curl from a hot roller or curling iron.</li>
            <li>After the first month, I was done with my Honest shampoo and now only using the As I Am.</li>
            <li>but my hair really feels clean without the excess lather.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and LIGHT (anybody who has ever had build-up or a co-wash that didn&#x27;t get you quite clean enough will appreciate this) and OH-so-soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to comb and feels very soft.</li>
            <li>I tried this because my daughter has a little curl to her hair (and this makes her curls look AMAZING!)  </li>
            <li>I may continue to use it because the ingredients may be more gentle than regular shampoos, but calling it a cowash doesn&#x27;t really seem appropriate based on the results I had.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m pregnant again...and not only is the vinegar smell a bit overwhelming right now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this Coconut Cowash for awhile since I had read the great reviews here on Amazon and also on the Naturally Curly forums, but was worried that it would be too heavy for my fine, 2C waves.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to get a brush or comb thru my hair without alot of conditioner after washing or even getting wet, even trying to run my fingers thru would pull out a hand full of hair using a reg conditioner,I could run my fingers thru this without taking any hair with it!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like shampoo.</li>
            <li>ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is geared more towards women with more typically African-American curls.</li>
            <li>Great smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out natural hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even use this between  normal washings with my sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a co wash product and it cleansed my hair after having 1 week worth of product buildup and ecostyler gel.</li>
            <li>But in general, AA hair needs more moisture than Middle-Eastern hair, and would match with this product better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>** dreadlocks, nice scent, and since it can replace shampoo and conditioner, it saves $$$ in the long run.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly, shoulder length dark course hair with a fair amount of silver.  </li>
            <li>Coconut Cleansing Conditioner leaves my hair soft, sweet smelling, and clean.</li>
            <li>Love the price, wish it detangled a little better</li>
            <li>My first use of this in place of shampoo, followed by Aussie strong 3 minute miracle, my hair has NOT felt so soft and manageable in a loooong time!</li>
            <li>I have huge, huge, massive hair that has gone from frizz ball to a shiny mane.  </li>
            <li>Super gentle, conditioning and gets all the grit out.</li>
            <li>my hair is really soft easy to comb.</li>
            <li>Regardless of ethnicity, if you have dry, unruly hair, give this an honest try.  </li>
            <li>She has used this a couple of times now and her hair will now form nice soft looking curls and her naturally wavy hair is no longer frizzy and parched looking.</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick consistency which I love for my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It is more expensive than others, but it gives great conditioning and slippage with shower comb outs.  </li>
            <li>after using it parts of my scalp would slightly burn it wasnt a good feelingat all.</li>
            <li>The consistency is smooth and creamy and it made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>If you use light, natural oils and leave-ins...Prepare to have your hair stripped!</li>
            <li>It cleanses my hair well and leaves it feeling smooth and nicely conditioned, not like some shampoo/conditioner sets that seem to leave my hair stiff and feeling fry.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clunk nor flake and it is very gentle to my 3b-3c type hair.</li>
            <li>almost a little too clean which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>I am a lifelong user from here on out -- I almost want to purchase 50 jars just to make sure I have years and years worth of product in case they ever go out of business!</li>
            <li>I can use just these two products for super simple and fast styling, or I can add a touch of my homemade pomade if I want to make it look a bit more textured.</li>
            <li>with thick hair, I go through this fairly quickly but overall, awesome.</li>
            <li>The main scent is coconut, but there is also a hint of citrus, and something sweet?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m caucasion but I have long wavy hair that is very easily tangled</li>
            <li>Made my hair a little too greesy, but I can see it being good for hair</li>
            <li>and I just couldn&#x27;t handle my super dry, static hair anymore.</li>
            <li>my hair is super curly and dry and with this i am able to detangle my hair</li>
            <li>No frizzy, puffy ends and hardly any fly aways.</li>
            <li>No frizzy, puffy ends and hardly any fly aways.</li>
            <li>will  buy some  more  in the  future</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to cut my hair because after bleaching my hair, the ends were feeling pretty rugged.</li>
            <li>I do wind up putting extra conditioner on my ends after most of the time.</li>
            <li>First time purchasing this product</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is with the packaging -- a pump bottle would be so much better than this tub.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I will continue to give it the benefit of doubt as it is my first experience with this type of hair wash.  </li>
            <li>My hair is extremely soft, moist and obedient now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t clarify first...</li>
            <li>Once I placed this product on my hair, my hair instantly became more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely be buying this again!</li>
            <li>After rinsing the curls are very defined!</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Cowash product and I definately like it better than the 1st I tried.</li>
            <li>I definitely like it better than the Dove oil care conditioner I had been using.</li>
            <li>This works really well!</li>
            <li>And for the first time in memory, I was able to run my fingers all the way back through my hair, like those girls do in the movies!  </li>
            <li>:/.... will be ordering more for myself and my mom :) ...</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different types of products.</li>
            <li>I have tried most of the cowash products out there, and this is definitely a winner.</li>
            <li>i add more cocunut oil to it for extra shine.</li>
            <li>This was my first product specifically made for cowashing</li>
            <li>If you are a person who likes her hair better the second or even third day after shampooing, you will like this product for sure.  </li>
            <li>I currently have TWO backups under my sink, so I can be sure not to run out.</li>
            <li>First I sprayed my hair with water and then added a silver amount to my 2 1/2 inch hair.</li>
            <li>When I first used this co wash in my hair, I had to get used to the coconut smell, because I&#x27;m not fond of coconuts.</li>
            <li>This magic potion instantly untangled my hair as I was combing through it.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d try it first.</li>
            <li>This transformed my hair into exactly what I needed it to be.  </li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair a couple times the first time to remove all the product buildup(shampoos,conditioners, treatment, mousse, hairspray ,root lifters, and my hair is foil colored.</li>
            <li>I gave it away after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I have asian hair that has been processed so many times.</li>
            <li>i ask hubby to pick up my favorite deep conditioner</li>
            <li>this was my first time using it.</li>
            <li>First time it was just \\&quot;ok\\</li>
            <li>I love this although I wash my hair with normal shampoo every now and then to refresh my hair because my hair is naturally oily.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more of the</li>
            <li>When I first bought it I had a lot of reservations because I&#x27;d heard this was either you &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I will not be repurchasing it don&#x27;t really find it worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay.</li>
            <li>Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use</li>
            <li>Although, I use this product to stretch my shampoo days more so than as my sole hair cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is the first as I am product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Possibly a bit more defined, moisturized curls but nothing to justify the cost.  </li>
            <li>I got my first hair cut at Deva Chan and used their pricey products for a while</li>
            <li>I was really interested in quitting shampoo cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I have insanely thick hair so its great when I can get a comb through it</li>
            <li>Once I stop using silicone based leave-in conditioners, I think I will be able to use this product as my only hair wash.</li>
            <li>, the only reason I am not giving it a five star is that I want to try it several more times, however, I must say, that I was really pleased with how it felt on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I saw the reviews on here and purchased this product- used it this morning for the first time</li>
            <li>Even when I used more it still didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; the next day.</li>
            <li>I went back to reg shampoo, but I had better results from diluting it with water and using a squeezy bottle.</li>
            <li>I have a combination of textures and mostly use this in the summer months only.</li>
            <li>I have never had to consistently use a hair cleansing product twice with every washing session.</li>
            <li>For the first 3 days, my hair felt sealed  and moisturized.</li>
            <li>seems like alot, especially when I can just use a conditioner that is in a more functional container.</li>
            <li>So when my first tub of this cowash was done, I decided to try the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus cowash.</li>
            <li>I love the product and use it as my only \\&quot;shampoo/conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Then I rinse it out, but be warned: if you don&#x27;t fully rinse it, your hair will be very oily!</li>
            <li>I have used up my first jar</li>
            <li>It smells great and definitely cleans your hair, but as far as repairing it, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>and it does not take much!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is, when I wash it out my shower is so slippery</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this goop smells fabulous and leaves my skin and hair soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight, color-treated hair that I prefer to shampoo only once a week,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products because I&#x27;m new to the natural lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Great product, I use it weekly to cowash my hair, because I do the CGM (curly girl method) which includes no shampoo, because it tends to dry out our hair, especially African-American hair.</li>
            <li>However, my scalp never felt clean enough just using the co-wash to clean and felt itchy after 3.5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I guess, tho WEN has more healthy ingredients, the basic formula idea is the same, and (unlike the original WEN that I&#x27;ve finally purchased), this and the infomercial WEN list water and cetyl and cetearyl alcohols in the first four ingredients!  </li>
            <li>The cream smells really nice but other than that, I just do not like the way my scalp and hair feel after using it.  </li>
            <li>friendly leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My favourite thing about this product is how CLEAN but soft my hair feels after.</li>
            <li>I needed to use another conditioner afterwards, but my hair felt clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I woke up with clean, soft and springy coils.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft, conditioned *and* clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and really soft.</li>
            <li>my scalp is squeaky clean and my hair is not dried out.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, clean and manageable.</li>
            <li>it rinses soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, my hair got really clean and felt so soft and</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and clean for a week, even though I put leave in conditioner in it ever day.</li>
            <li>It leaves my scalp clean and the hair so soft and the breakage has lessened.</li>
            <li>I have locs, so it is more difficult to clean my scalp, but traditional shampoos do a great job, and this cowash didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that my hair does not feel super clean.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far, but I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Love this product it made my hair so soft to the touch and also did not tangle my natural 4c hair.  </li>
            <li>You can actually co-wash with any good conditoner and  get the same results.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and very fine and straight...</li>
            <li>Anyway, it actually got my hair clean and untangled in one shot!</li>
            <li>My hair was SUPER shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>New to this transitioning from relaxer to natural has led me in to becoming a product junkie.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product receives any positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have no idea where all these positive reviews are coming from.</li>
            <li>I have been using As I Am for 4 weeks now and even on 6 days without shampooing, my hair feels clean, not flat or greasy and smells fresh too.</li>
            <li>Honestly, as soon as I tried this product I was ready to chunk all of my other shampoos, conditioners, styling gels, etc.</li>
            <li>I used this, followed up with my favorite leave-in conditioner, moisturized and stretched my hair and then went to bed.</li>
            <li>has pretty much saved my hair.</li>
            <li>Well first of all it took so much of the product to cover my head.</li>
            <li>I love it and as long as I can get it at Sally&#x27;s, I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I use Wen, and wanted to use it on my daughter but its so expensive that I wanted to find a more economical way.</li>
            <li>the plus side, I love how clean the product is and how few toxic additives it has.</li>
            <li>This really made my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I am of Caucasian decent and have light brown, naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and not dry!</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to not having a lather when shampooing, but I really like how this leaves my hair and scalp feeling -- nice and clean, but not dried out; I seem to be having less breakage than before.  </li>
            <li>at about one third of the price as well as being available to purchase locally, I decided to at least try this alost two years ago and was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more dry than mine.</li>
            <li>My hair is in between a coil and a deep wave and tends to tangle easily.  </li>
            <li>Massaged into the scalp it noticeably loosens any dandruff flaking and has a very slight cooling/tingling sensation that is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this and will most likely use normal shampoo once a month from now on.</li>
            <li>Our hair is super shiny and soft and my curls are not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Most shampoos and even conditioners completely dry out my scalp and give me flakey skin.</li>
            <li>really love the smell, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry and brittle after using it.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make it super soft like advertised.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li>I do not recommend anyone use this product more then once a week because it may dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is I wish it would have more of a fragrant smell since it is a cowash product but other than that it was Great!</li>
            <li>I have tried others (L&#x27;Oreal, Ren Pure, Herbal Essence, etc) and like the results.</li>
            <li>Their hair seem to really respond positively to it as well.  </li>
            <li>So I may not have read the part about this product being created for African American ladies when I was looking for a no poo cleansing conditioner that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because I might not have tried it.</li>
            <li>But for my 3b curl, moderate moisture level, thick texture, and normal scalp it was excellent!</li>
            <li>Other washes I&#x27;ve tried leave a heavy residue, but this product works great and washes clean.</li>
            <li>I am a 60+ year old male with very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>It looked fine the next day as well.</li>
            <li>My hair felt dry afterwards really in need of a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I love that it does not dry out my hair like shampoo, and it keeps my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I used enough to mound on my palm, rubbed it quickly into my hair, and rinsed it right out.  </li>
            <li>I do have pretty long hair and even though it&#x27;s fine textured, I have alot of it</li>
            <li>(thyroid condition) hair that likes some protein (not too too much) and has fine and medium strands mixed.</li>
            <li>As an adult, my hair has been kind of coarse, kind of wavy, and when short and in humidity, curly, but not good-curly but bad-curly, dry, haystack, and sometimes (when I want it wavy or curly) straight, but not good-straight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing a long term transition from relaxed to natural and this makes my hair moisturized and very easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;my\\&quot; hair with plenty of slip, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped which is good because it prevents extra drying for hair that is already very dry.</li>
            <li>I have 4a-4b textured hair so finding a good product that helps me manage my hair is hard to find.</li>
            <li>: No matter what you put in your hair, it can be thee very best in the world, if I don&#x27;t get it stuck in my head that I have to trim my dead ends off every few weeks or so in order to see improvement in my hair texture and growth</li>
            <li>But over all it was easy to detangle my hair and it kept it clean without the harsh sulfates.  </li>
            <li>This product cleans my hair very well without drying it out, but it doesn&#x27;t really help me much with detangling.</li>
            <li>I use this to cowash my transitioning hair, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in using regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it didnt do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>Strips my hair too much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much slip</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>experience with the product was promising.</li>
            <li>Really marketing people??</li>
            <li>Really marketing people??</li>
            <li>so I really though I would like this product, but for some reason it seems to make my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li>I used about 3 mini scoops with 2 fingers (my hair comes up to the top part of my boobs) and distributed that into my roots/scalp and used a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really wanting to purchase</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m spoiled by another &#x27;co-wash&#x27; that makes my hair wavier, so that may be why I didn&#x27;t like this as much.  </li>
            <li>I really like what it did to my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of co-washes out there, but nothing really hits the spot for my 3B curls like this.</li>
            <li>Makes my curls much easier to manage and style</li>
            <li>I have very coarse/kinky hair</li>
            <li>and this moisturizes it very well without leaving it too greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and highlighted.</li>
            <li>still use a conditioner after using this, but may not even need to since it really does cleanse and moisturize so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>I have straight caucasian hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>For me not so much, I refuse to buy this product again.</li>
            <li>the As I Am gel, which I also highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair isnt as frizzy and I dont have to wash it as much.</li>
            <li>It smells really good,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this co-wash!</li>
            <li>Hair does feel much softer and smoother and looks healthier</li>
            <li>I use it weekly as well as the cleanser and intense conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This thing stripped my hair so much it felt like seaweed</li>
            <li>I had to use soo much of my joico conditioner...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got coily 3c curls that really need moisture</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thicker than Eden&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Smooths on well, very thick&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>and I really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really cleans your hair and leaves</li>
            <li>arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with it being in a jar either</li>
            <li>It left my hair silky smooth and cleansed my scalp without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li>It has never had that much shine or volume without a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have 4a/b hair with blond highlights and for me this turned out to be too drying and it wasn&#x27;t smooth and slippery enough for detangling.</li>
            <li>So much moisture in my hair now.  </li>
            <li>I really like this for washing my hair when used in conjunction with my leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>As I Am cowash is a gentle way of cleansing your hair.  </li>
            <li>It gently cleanses my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>much cheaper than walmart</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>Gentle</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product - it is affordable, obtainable (got it at RiteAid),</li>
            <li>Also, does not smell much like coconut.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>but you have to get the whole head</li>
            <li>I took the plunge and purchased this product and much to everyone&#x27;s surprise</li>
            <li>and I also use the leave-in conditioner, which you don&#x27;t need much of...mostly just on the ends.  </li>
            <li>Pass on this one and go straight for the stuff with the three-letter name that rhymes with &amp;#34;Pen.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Really would.</li>
            <li>I really like to Co-Wash my hair using this product.</li>
            <li>is that it&#x27;s very soupy.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair very well, leaves no residue, and detangles.</li>
            <li>(They really should put this product in a dispenser pump bottle).</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Detangling was an absolute breeze.</li>
            <li>It really is medicine for your hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely lovvvvvve this Co wash</li>
            <li>This is going straight from the shower to the bin.</li>
            <li>For real.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair feel very moisturized</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my scalp, but hair doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Really like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This co-wash is an absolute keeper.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely refuse to spend so much money on a product that I would probably burn through in a week because I believe, according to the directions on WEN, I would have had to use 20+ pumps each time I washed my hair.</li>
            <li>but I like the tub because I can get to the very bottom instead of having to take a pump off and bang the bottle to get the remainder of the product out.</li>
            <li>but I like the tub because I can get to the very bottom instead of having to take a pump off and bang the bottle to get the remainder of the product out.</li>
            <li>Then once I massaged it all over it didn&#x27;t really detangle my hair well.</li>
            <li>and my hair was very tangled.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>, then rince really well.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for three weeks now, my hair really like.  </li>
            <li>I hope this is real -</li>
            <li>I shook my head as much as I could to remove any excess water in the shower</li>
            <li>I leave the cowash in my hair almost the whole time I&#x27;m in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I really did not need to wash it yet</li>
            <li>Did I use too much?  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t require much</li>
            <li>AS I Am products has really made a difference in the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>I bought a gentle anti-dandruff shampoo although I don&#x27;t have dandruff, and massaged it on my scalp and rinsed.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and can be used as a cowash or a conditioner.</li>
            <li>lasted about a month but her thin dammaged hair looked great</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>, i have a whole lot of hair, and i used this jar twice..</li>
            <li>My hair was tangle-free and very manageable.</li>
            <li>If I catch it on sale, I buy as much as I can.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but now it is much easier to manage and when I straighten it it&#x27;s shiny</li>
            <li>Was much easier to detangle.  </li>
            <li>made my hair very course and tangled.</li>
            <li>There are a ton of sulfate free shampoos that would have given me the same results.  </li>
            <li>I Am\\&quot; products as well for much cheaper than what I saw on here.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I heard so much about it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using the curly girl method this product is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not made to clarify just a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5, because I do not like it that much as a co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My joico is the absolute bestl</li>
            <li>It doesnt give me much slip.</li>
            <li>this really didn&#x27;t come close to hitting the mark.  </li>
            <li>but just really didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s available locally, Amazon sells it at a lower price.  </li>
            <li>The whole family loves it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use the whole thing with one wash.</li>
            <li>I tried everything after the salon fried my hair and this has really helped repair my hair.</li>
            <li>I have caucasian hair, baby fine, stick straight and usually pretty dry.</li>
            <li>Of course this was much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I found it to leave my hair much heavier though.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I didn&#x27;t think that this stuff would work in my hair, but I was wrong, so far its the best product that I have tried out of a store.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite cowash but everyone&#x27;s hair is different!!</li>
            <li>I have short hair and love how it makes my hair bouncy and supper soft.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more products in the near future from As I Am.</li>
            <li>I have a good brush and was using an expensive shampoo and conditioner that were both sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Smell is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Good grief this stuff smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells good, not too thick or greasy, and after using it, I immediately noticed my hair felt lighter and softer.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>My hair smellled grea and was so soft!!!</li>
            <li>Ok, first of all, I&#x27;m a a 3a white-girl, and I did get some odd looks from the cashier at Sally&#x27;s when purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t have a problem with Wen in the first place, I&#x27;m just a hair product hoarder and wanted to try something new).</li>
            <li>I watched some youtube videos to get some clear instructions regarding co-washing because I had heard that if you didn’t do it right your hair ended up being greasy.</li>
            <li>The price is right and the ingredients seem to be natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to comb out after washing with the product, but once my hair is dry, I&#x27;d say I still have potential for frizzies, but I use another product to smooth out the frizzies.</li>
            <li>I have long curly caucasian hair that tangles easily and gets matted.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a wide-toothed comb easily through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is long, straight, and fine</li>
            <li>But there are other cowashes I like better.</li>
            <li>Took a while for my hair to be ok with washing it every other day, and now I try to was it once</li>
            <li>I checked the ingredient list and verified my suspicions that it contained silicones (if you are familiar with the curly girl method this is a big no no).</li>
            <li>I rather found other products that work much better.  </li>
            <li>Feels and smells great, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>i also dont know if it is better than other co washes i use.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers here, I am im</li>
            <li>In the ORIGINAL WEN there are no alcohols starting out with water</li>
            <li>I had to load my hair with other conditioners just to be able to run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>and I also just dont trust most other companies ingredients.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest they switch to a squeeze bottle or pump with a large nozzle, instead.</li>
            <li>so the scent is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thick and creamy, so it&#x27;s easy to work into the hair to finger comb and untangle, and avoids waste.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a jar so no waste!</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, straight and limp and very oily.  </li>
            <li>I have baby fine dry wavy white girl hair and this is THE only conditioning cleanser that makes my hair feel wonderful, lush and moisturized without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I left this stuff on my hair for about 5-10 minutes and afterwards my hair was SO clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>Zig zags, curls, spirals, straight, fine yet dry, moiture-resistant and</li>
            <li>My hair before using this: long wavy and fine, dreads when I sleep and throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use enough of it, I don&#x27;t get that clean feeling</li>
            <li>product turned out to be exactly what I was looking for, it leaves my hair feeling clean and bouncy, it removes the access products I use to style and maintain my hair without leaving it dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It simply did not leave my hair clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not natural so maybe its better for natural girls?</li>
            <li>I felt clean hair-wise and not utterly stripped like some poos can feel.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running low for a nice long while.  </li>
            <li>Bought it tonight at a local drug store for half the price of what I found here (thanks to the tip of another reviewer) and, while Coconut Cowash did the job, it didn&#x27;t make my colored/damaged/caucasian hair feel good.  </li>
            <li>I love using this when I am going to style my hair down because it makes it very non-frizzy.</li>
            <li>chose this product not only for the hype, but also because it has three surfactants...2 cationic and 1 non-ionic surfactants which are not great cleaners (they won&#x27;t be able to dissolve large oil/grease particles) since their primary functions are &amp;#34;conditioners&amp;#34;, but they clean.</li>
            <li>Right now, I only use hot water to cleanse my hair.</li>
            <li>The texture isn&#x27;t thick and a little really goes along way, and the smell is just wonderful!</li>
            <li>I had been using a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner combo, and my hair was still very unmanageable and dry.</li>
            <li>Left my hair clean with a decent scent.</li>
            <li>Only thing is, depending on how much hair you have the jar can run out quick.</li>
            <li>Like WEN I kept my hair wet till it was completely worked in, clipped it up on top of my head and left it in while I bathed, then rinsed again very thoroughly till my hair felt clean...</li>
            <li>After about a month of using it, I can definitely see a more shiny hair and my hair tips are not dry, so I don&#x27;t have to smother my hair in a ton of oil every day.</li>
            <li>Very tight-cork screw type curls on the bottom half, and loser curls on the top.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s as AMAZING as people make it seem, but if you have wavy, curly or coily hair, you will notice a difference in not using shampoo period, regardless of if you use this product or another conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I am not completely shampoo free - I have to shampoo about once a week (with a suflate-free), and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am an African American woman with natural hair that ranges from 3b to 4a and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It takes about 45 minutes to dry it and because it is so fine</li>
            <li>I have consistently used 2 containers so far</li>
            <li>it normally just looks really frizzy with no defined curl pattern.</li>
            <li>It is not bad enough to return so I will finish it.  </li>
            <li>Once I had washed the product completely off, I was expecting to find my hair dry and brittle but was very pleasantly surprised to find my hair was very soft and it smelled really nice.</li>
            <li>As i am co wash is not my first experience with a cleansing conditioner: for several months I was a fan of the Hair One Argan oil cleansing conditioner which was great but left me with a little bit of product build up.</li>
            <li>I have a mix of fine and coarse hair along with extremely sensitive skin and almost every shampoo causes my scalp to itch and have dandruff.  </li>
            <li>product may work for thicker hair, however I do not recommend it for naturally curly fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>makes my wave more of a defined curl without frizzy ends and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I have full highlights, fine Caucasian hair that has been straightened with keratin and is past BS length.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve found my new hair care solution!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use this product as a leave in my hair look fluffy in a healthy and full of volume on top of my thick head of hair .Why</li>
            <li>When I first big chopped, my hair was super, super dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on my second jar for a few reasons: my curls are super soft and bouncy after using it, it makes my hair shinier and healthier looking than the competition and my curls dry beautifully.</li>
            <li>and when it was completely dry I could tell a HUGE difference in the way it looked.</li>
            <li>and when it was completely dry I could tell a HUGE difference in the way it looked.</li>
            <li>jar packaging allows for easy spilling and when used In  the shower ; the water can sometimes get in the product even when placed fairly distant from the running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fantastic to use a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry brittle hair.  </li>
            <li>And I agree that a pump bottle would be more practical and less prone to mishaps.  </li>
            <li>Less is more</li>
            <li>this is the first product in my entire life that I have used that did exactly what I needed, it conditioned my hair and allowed me to easily comb my wet hair without ripping any out</li>
            <li>I figured the jar of the coconut co wash would barely last a few weeks but surprisingly after a month I still have more than half of the product</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is on the cheaper end of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, and goes for more or less $10 wherever you get it.</li>
            <li>ok, however if you tend to have an oily scalp, you&#x27;ll likely need to use this product daily.</li>
            <li>I quickly realized that with curly hair, you just have to find a product that works for you because no one product works the same for everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mainly a coconut like smell to it.</li>
            <li>When first starting to cowash I was upset because my hair was greasy the first rinse.</li>
            <li>I actually like this better than Wen even if it were the same price.  </li>
            <li>Next I tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s and while better they are also double the price!</li>
            <li>My hair feels greasy the next day after using even when I made sure to rinse properly after application.</li>
            <li>(the container is too big for a shower caddy) while you put the cowash in your hair, and then put the top back on it so water does not splash in it .</li>
            <li>and I only had to apply a little more than a palm full of the cleanser.</li>
            <li>and she was able to go 2-3 days between washes without looking like a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product, the only shampoo I use to help restore super dry brittle hair.. it really brings your hair back to life!</li>
            <li>Plus it gives my hair a tad more length since the curls are moisturized and not so tight.  </li>
            <li>Then I did some research and found this product highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone who is considering transitioning out of shampoo, with curly hair, or both.</li>
            <li>Eden is now a staple of mine and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this co-washing product for any hair type.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for any type of hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend viewing the WEN product training video before use, because this is the technique I use when \\&quot;washing\\&quot; my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Lastly, my hair was left feeling and looking very clean.</li>
            <li>I am a white woman with very fine, curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li>hair seemed fine wet</li>
            <li>Honestly, I chose this product over some other cleansing conditioners in the same price range because of the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>I have to use a little more than I thought to detangle my hair, but it does work.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WoW!!</li>
            <li>Left my haif feelig clean and soft.</li>
            <li>While it cleans well, but it caused my hair to break and was not as easy to comb out as other cleansing conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li>It also removed all other product build up and washed out easy.</li>
            <li>I wanted chemical free, or very limited chemical products, so I came across this one day on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I smoothed it on my natural hair, relaxed hair, and scalp, rubbing gently.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick at all which is what I like my conditioners to be since I have coily hair</li>
            <li>lol we&#x27;re never happy with our hair!</li>
            <li>and I then washed some of it of and my hair was clean and bouncy; it didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its gentle and hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>and this really helps keep the area clear.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>This product really minimizes frizz &amp; keeps her curls bouncy &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>This co-wash leaves the hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair naturally</li>
            <li>It really feels like it is repairing my hair, and letting my natural curls feel</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair perfectly clean but not at all dry.  </li>
            <li>It was very moisturizing and never dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will have to use it a few more times to adjust to it.</li>
            <li>♦ Left my hair feeling like product over load, I &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; my hair with this co-wash after a weeks worth of product build-up.</li>
            <li>Or many products can be too heavy and make it greasy...</li>
            <li>was long lasting :)...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different co-washes now on my wavy, somewhat course hair and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>After rinsing, I normally re-apply a bit as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will most def by their products for that problem, they have a few to choose from, cant wait,</li>
            <li>I am on the fence with this product as I think it dried my hair out more than offering the moistue of a cowash that I was looking for for my 4b/4c</li>
            <li>I kind of look like a greasy, drowned cat after I use it, no matter how long I wash it out for.</li>
            <li>but after using only this in the shower and the Loreal EverCreme leave-in spray I found out I can get natural full bodied waves when air drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I treat it like a normal shampoo</li>
            <li>I have type 4a naturally curly hair and expected more as far as detangling.  </li>
            <li>I found this product dried my hair out even more</li>
            <li>Normally I would just stick to one line</li>
            <li>The fragrance was nice and it was thick.  </li>
            <li>This product is good, but not great.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long but getting damaged at the ends, so I wanted something that was less drying and more gentle on it.</li>
            <li>This pot lasts me a month and a half, keeps my hair silky and clean!</li>
            <li>It is expensive on Amazon, but I live on an island with no stores, so just happy</li>
            <li>When I opened container product was missing seal that most NEW hair products have, in order to keep product in the container and fresh.(When</li>
            <li>I only left the co-wash on for five minutes and it washed out so easily.</li>
            <li>It left my hair super soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that this product makes my hair bigger and frizzier, like my hair is stripped and in need of a strong deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d have to wait for new hair to grow in for my head to look normal again.</li>
            <li>Wonderful price (DAILY FIX is pricey and Jessicurl&#x27;s got more expensive recently, both more expensive than this product.)</li>
            <li>Wonderful price (DAILY FIX is pricey and Jessicurl&#x27;s got more expensive recently, both more expensive than this product.)</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that I have to use a very generous amount in order to clean my scalp and still have enough to work it through all of my hair to condition the ends.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to slam it, because it could very well work for anybody with different hair, but if you&#x27;re biracial or white ethnic, it&#x27;s most likely going to be too</li>
            <li>She finally tried it last night and all she could do was rave about how good her hair felt, how she was able to actually finger comb through one particular tough tangle and</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean, but not completely stripped of all the natural oils.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends to split at the ends and gets dried out if I shampoo too much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy to get water in the jar which in turns waters down the product.</li>
            <li>My new go to.</li>
            <li>&amp; I live in South Florida-</li>
            <li>Plus I live in the desert</li>
            <li>The scent is not my style but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger, so I can live with it.</li>
            <li>(I live in drought-stricken LA).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s officially my new hair cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is my new staple.</li>
            <li>but this is something new I have tried weekly</li>
            <li>and I live in Florida, so</li>
            <li>my new must have.</li>
            <li>Nothing new</li>
            <li>think I have found my new co wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is my new product line.</li>
            <li>After using this co-wash, her hair is easy to comb out and has less frizz.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked shiny, felt really clean, had body, and looked almost partially straightened.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked shiny, felt really clean, had body, and looked almost partially straightened.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I did with similar products, and my hair has really improved in terms of brittleness, dryness, etc since using this.  </li>
            <li>My daughter suggested I use cowash to clean my natural hair, which is colored, dry and breaking.</li>
            <li>But, seriously -- my hair feels so nice.  </li>
            <li>It also rinses off easily, which is a big plus because it speeds up my shower time (when you have a 3 year old yelling for mommy outside the bathroom door, time is of the essence!)</li>
            <li>Works well and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>Those with sensitive skin, beware that coconut oil is highly comedogenic (pore blocking).  </li>
            <li>Co-wash leaves my hair feeling soft and moist and I would highly recommend it for all types of hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes my 4C hair feel very soft and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
            <li>It cleanses all the gel that I use in my hair and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>The one thing I can say about this product is that it did make my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels lighter but not stripped, very soft.</li>
            <li>This products makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Made my hair very soft</li>
            <li>As soon as I apply this to my hair it becomes very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It removes the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; and leaves your hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>and it had my hair very soft manageable lots and lots of slip detangling was a breeze for me</li>
            <li>and it felt very soft with no frizz which is a miracle for my hair and the humidity here in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Also it left my hair very, very shiny.  </li>
            <li>When I applied the product to my hair, it made it feel moist and very soft.</li>
            <li>then Aloe Vera gel, Glycerin, then jump right in to the natural extracts starting with chamomile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting used to as far as the process of washing your hair, because it obviously doesn&#x27;t lather, but its amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have long blonde, baby-fine hair that breaks easily at the ends.</li>
            <li>It left my hair clean, soft and manageable, not like some shampoos that leave your hair clean but harsh that you need a conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I had to do a month of hot oil treatments 2x a week to get the moisture back in my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I can remember that I had actual CURLS in my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li>As a past WEN user, I have to say I equally love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>but maybe that&#x27;s because I did a hot oil treatment prior to applying the coconut cowash.</li>
            <li>I normally have when air drying my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>A bottle with a pump or small spout would be much better to dispense this while washing your hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves it because it doesn&#x27;t take the coloring out of her hair as quickly as a similar, much more expensive and better known product.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and already purchased a second of</li>
            <li>so I am constantly using different detanglers and deep conditioners trying to make my hair more manageable and easier to comb out when i get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>After the first use i definitely could feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for permed heads but, for this natural head of coils and curls, this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li>I work recommend this product to NATURAL HEADS HEAD!</li>
            <li>I also am sensitive to chemical heavy products and wanted something more natural.  </li>
            <li>Epic stuff!</li>
            <li>It leaves it cleansed, soft and MOISTURIZED!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past, but like so many others, I couldn&#x27;t afford to stay with it.</li>
            <li>This was my first cowash specific purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Great, natural product!</li>
            <li>Such a difference from that first usage.</li>
            <li>I first bought this off a sale rack at the local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li>The hairdresser told me about this product a year ago, and I have used only this since the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li>I love this item so much, I already order a second jar since I have to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li>I do not appreciate purchasing items solicited as NEW, when product was received with self-printed label marked NEW.</li>
            <li>My hair had been breaking off at the ends and super dry ever since I decided to go natural a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white with long, fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>(I used enough to make my hair feel like I could run my fingers through it - and remember, I have a LOT of long fine hair -</li>
            <li>The product is light and does not weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine and lately thinning hair.</li>
            <li>The very first use and my hair was as dry as straw!</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, my hair stayed clean between washings.</li>
            <li>It is extremely moisturizing without being greasy and still gets my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and her hair is thick and medium grade.</li>
            <li>smells yummy, like tropical fruit and coconut, without being cloyingly sweet, and the scent lingers just a little without much</li>
            <li>I use it in my 6-yr olds long naturally curly hair and her hair is always super soft and tropically smelling when you get close to her, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I never cowashed before until I became natural and let me tell you, cowashing is my new thing.</li>
            <li>I have curly, tangly hair, and buy a new brand of shampoo/conditioner every time i finish my old bottles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to being natural (this month marks a year) and it&#x27;s been a struggle trying to find products that work well with my hair.</li>
            <li>Not that her hair is less important, but she&#x27;s 3 and</li>
            <li>It does work to clean hair (mine gets particularly oily) but it left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Smells far too strong and left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I used about a palm and a half for my whole head (natural kinky 3c/4a hair, just past shoulders) and I loved it.</li>
            <li>sectioned two tiny sections and used each product on their own small section.</li>
            <li>After rinsing it out with cold water my hair felt nice and full and bouncy.</li>
            <li>she used it last night for the first time and her hair is so soft and silky looking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is normally a product for ethnic hair, but it works wonders on my straight, \\&quot;white girl\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>Smells nice , a little goes a long ways and it makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have naturally frizzy hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I scooped out the product and made sure I got it on my entire scalp and worked it all the way down to my ends.</li>
            <li>As I Am is a really good styling tool, it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out or make it hard or brittle.</li>
            <li>The WEN from the infomercials, I&#x27;ve only just recently learned that that isn&#x27;t the original formula and not nearly as good, but the REAL WEN isn&#x27;t a Prime item and is a little more expensive unless you buy the huge 32 oz bottles, and I was out and broke, so I read all sorts of reviews till my eyes crossed and decided to risk this to see if anyone had come up with a good conditioning cleanser without the WEN prices!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only downside to this product is, predictably, it takes quite a bit to be able to get clean, especially on long hair.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;llbe transferring it to an old WEN bottle!)be transferring it to an old WEN bottle!)</li>
            <li>If you have natural hair and you use natural products on your hair you know about the build up!</li>
            <li>And I have true African American hair that is natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like products that have an overpowering sweet or any other flavor of smell.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry damaged hair , I tried daily cowashing with this big difference in shedding and manageability of my thick hair!</li>
            <li>I then brushed the product through the hair with a wide tooth comb, (which was easy to to do) and I placed my hair up with a clip</li>
            <li>and since I leave it in a good while in a bath it drops down my neck in front and back and found that my skin on my neck and decolette had some pink splotches on them,</li>
            <li>It is actually trying to curl again (versus looking more wavy like it has been lately), is less frizzy, and feels really soft.</li>
            <li>to my hair, first, I&#x27;m white with long very fine thick straight silky hair.  </li>
            <li>but I am a little perplexed with their packaging choice.</li>
            <li>Then on top of that it only requires a little bit to be applied.</li>
            <li>it matters, my hair is mostly 3C with a little 4A mixed in.  </li>
            <li>It was hard for me to figure out whether or not this would be appropriate for me</li>
            <li>I must say that if your hair is easily weighed down or it is not dry this might not be an option for you.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft with extremely defined curls.</li>
            <li>-in-all it was a huge waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>Even though it isn&#x27;t a shampoo with no suds, I still feel like my scalp is moisturized and clear of product build-up.  </li>
            <li>Used this several times so far and really like it.</li>
            <li>My hairstylist was skeptical and she has told me my hair hasn&#x27;t been in such great shape as it is now.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the havoc this item had done, even when rinsed out completely and my all time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been 100% natural with a TWA for six months now.  </li>
            <li>My hair is moisturized and so soft that I do not need to use conditioner.</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair feels soft to the touch and responds well to the products that I use afterward.</li>
            <li>Dickey informs curly girls not to use foaming/sudsing shampoos as they are very drying and potentially damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft and no need for using shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am a white woman with straight hair.</li>
            <li>I am a natural girl with 3B hair texture.</li>
            <li>and I can really feel the difference between the co-wash and regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft, silky, and manageable.</li>
            <li>I put mine in an old conditioner bottle for shower use and find that it is a lot easier to handle that way.</li>
            <li>I ended up using this on my son&#x27;s hair whose now 8m old.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s ingredients aren&#x27;t as natural as As I Am....</li>
            <li>Also, I prefer to deep condition rather than cowash; that infuses my hair with so much moisture.</li>
            <li>I have dense, natural afro-textured curly/kinky hair (4b/4c).</li>
            <li>contains mostly natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I regret this decision being as though i have been Natural for 7 years</li>
            <li>, i would recommend it to people who might night have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I can go 4 days without washing my hair and it does not get greasy any faster than with my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>Keeps my natural curls soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I used the co-wash for my virgin hair extensions and my natural hair both are so silky soft.</li>
            <li>I when I straighten my hair both my extensions and natural hair were so soft</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>The cowash cleans your hair and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day as well.</li>
            <li>So far I do like it.  </li>
            <li>her hair is soft, but not appreciably softer than using a lot of OTC conditioners and / or a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 3c/4a coily natural who has up until now abused my hair with sulfates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned my lesson after trial and error and learned about this product from another natural friend.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s naturally curly.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>When I washed it out afterwards, my hair felt so soft</li>
            <li>I used this product because I am a product junkie for natural hair.</li>
            <li>two washes and my hair is completely transformed.</li>
            <li>it makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This cleans without a lot of suds and my hair remains soft.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been going natural for about 2 years</li>
            <li>IT has a well-balanced texture and leaves my hair soft and well-moisturized.</li>
            <li>At the time I was transitioning from relaxed hair (I am now fully natural again).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleans natural hair well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleans natural hair</li>
            <li>After using it this afternoon my hair has done a complete 180.</li>
            <li>My husband kept playing with it as it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li>This will leave your hair soft as silk.</li>
            <li>I am a 4b-4c natural with shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>My hair after cowashing with this was so moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>it helps keep my nappy hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>If you have naturally oily hair, that has to be washed often, then this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from relaxed hair to natural and I am a year already</li>
            <li>So soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft curls.</li>
            <li>I got this from Sally&#x27;s I&#x27;m newly natural with 3C-4B hair</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I also love coconut and never liked the scent of the almond mint WEN</li>
            <li>WEN because of all the natural ingredients...</li>
            <li>MATURE</li>
            <li>I think I speak for our entire family when I say we highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It has always had a natural tendency to tangle and mat.  </li>
            <li>It made it really soft and detangled-because its a conditioner, and thats what conditioners do.</li>
            <li>and I was very presently surprised when I used</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is a P.C. version of the old Prell shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have asian straight hair</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and managable</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Hispanic with curly hair &amp; my curls are bouncy &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I have 4a/4b type natural hair</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>Neither brand has all natural ingredients either.</li>
            <li>I really think I have finally found my holy grail hair product line!</li>
            <li>natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Since I have started using this, my hair has been so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair completely natural since September 2012.</li>
            <li>The product made my natural hair feel brittle and it doesn&#x27;t have a slip.</li>
            <li>but let&#x27;s see if it works with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural , so this is a product that I use on myself.</li>
            <li>I am a 3c/4a natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of products for my natural hair</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and alcohol</li>
            <li>Two days in, my hair is soft to the touch and it feels well nourished.</li>
            <li>never did a cowash on my natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and is not tangled after the wash.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, natural is best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really surprised me -</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this cleanses and tames frizz.</li>
            <li>The underneath is natural.</li>
            <li>My hair has natural wave.</li>
            <li>No harsh smells.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my 7 yr old and my 13 month old.</li>
            <li>Later when styling my hair I had to add so much product to make my hair look presentable.</li>
            <li>When I use this along with the  hydration elation, my hair feels so soft, moisturized, and manageable.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Just wow.  </li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m the frizzy-haired step sister.</li>
            <li>Received when expected...great product for natural hair.</li>
            <li>They do work well to moisturize curly and wavy hair and to make it soft.</li>
            <li>When I use this my hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>my hair has been so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is bleached/highlighted and naturally wavy/curly and tends to look frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair silky soft and cleaned without stripping.</li>
            <li>Also on my granddaughters natural hair</li>
            <li>, my naturally curly, fuzzy hair has never been shiny.</li>
            <li>I use just as much as Wen and the same method.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my soft curls.</li>
            <li>soft touchable curls..</li>
            <li>but my hair never felt this soft or moisturized after using Tresemme (I would have frizz and dryness).</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft when done.</li>
            <li>I use this, and their leave-in-conditioner, nearly every day on my &amp;#34;multicultural hair&amp;#34; - shoulder length curly 2a/b.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft when rinsed.</li>
            <li>I also have psoriasis on my scalp, so I use a natural dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li>you have naturally oily hair, I recommend this as a CONDITIONER rather than a co-wash.</li>
            <li>and I found that my hair wasn&#x27;t really soft or detangled after using it.</li>
            <li>This product completely destroyed my  hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>I went natural almost a year now</li>
            <li>It is soft and curly again.  </li>
            <li>So I have been wearing my hair natural for a while</li>
            <li>and I am still learning all of the in and outs of about caring for AA natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use it on my natural  hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on a natural curls journey since 2009 (after years of blow-drying that damaged my hair).</li>
            <li>I have medium thickness, 4a type of natural hair</li>
            <li>I finally picked it up locally a few weeks ago, and I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I Am leave-in conditioner and my hair was left much more manageable even after it dried.</li>
            <li>(what some would call 4a, but I hate the hair typing system) and I find those conditioners work best for it.</li>
            <li>No complaints, not sure if I will buy again... have to try it a few more times, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Does not have the detangling power of Wen, BUT I love that the formula is not as thick as Wen.  </li>
            <li>hair is normal to a bit oily, but after using a certain shampoo, my hair became extremely dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>My hair looks shiny and frizz free without looking oily or stiff.</li>
            <li>My hair was left completely stripped, and I had to use my new Giovanni 2Chic moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (Which worked wonders!)</li>
            <li>I have a short layered bob but my hair is super frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair actually feeling clean, unlike other &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; that leave behind their own residue instead of getting rid of existing residue.  </li>
            <li>This works really well on my naturally curly grey hair.  </li>
            <li>(Which has been everyday since buying it, because I have either classes, work or church to go to and like my hair to be clean).  </li>
            <li>But my main issue with this produce is every time I use it my scalp is left itching.</li>
            <li>I just would like it more if it were in a squeeze bottle due to its EXTREMELY runny nature.</li>
            <li>It smelled fairly decent but it didn&#x27;t moisturize as deeply as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and have very dry, frizzy &amp; unruly very wavy hair.... and lots of it!  </li>
            <li>so, either I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to something in the almond mint WEN, or WEN in general (God forbid!)  </li>
            <li>Oh, another major plus: natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Once I washed the product out, I dried with a special hair towel for curls that is not ruff on the hair.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t think I needed to do my usual deep condition after washing with this because my hair was soooooo soft; not like &amp;#34;eww there is a product sitting on top of my hair&amp;#34; soft, but a &amp;#34;cuticles are laid, honey&amp;#34; soft.</li>
            <li>No other styling products needed!</li>
            <li>Since using this cowash instead of shampoo, my hair is so much softer and doesn&#x27;t go frizzy if I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>and it held the water in alot longer and was moiturized and super soft once it dried, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, long, and super dry from going from black to platinum ash blonde and this co wash along with phytos 7 leave in cond.</li>
            <li>My hair dried with no frizz and into super soft waves.</li>
            <li>After hearing mostly great reviews and a few negative reviews from 3c hair naturals I decided to give it a try since it was only $6.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a long time for something that really works.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with long, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair yesterday and saw no negative effects from prior use of this co-wash.</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily hair, so it has taken me a while to read and actually decide to try co-washing.</li>
            <li>few weeks later I saw a jar of this in a drugstore, and it was actually cheaper ($8)</li>
            <li>But just fyi, natural doesn&#x27;t always mean gentle, during my first wash with the new WEN</li>
            <li>The first brand left my hair dry, so I was pleasantly surprised to find &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; did not.  </li>
            <li>The product should be in a shampoo bottle so it can be easily used in the shower, It&#x27;s hard to scoop the product out, figure out where you are going to place it in the shower</li>
            <li>, I sort of want to feel a bit pampered in the shower (especially after the new baby comes).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and just recently stopped when I tried the new</li>
            <li>My scalp gets dry, flaky&amp;itchy so much</li>
            <li>As I rinsed my hair out and was ready to dry, I could hear my hair squeek when I ran my fingers through it,</li>
            <li>But by the end of the week my hair was dry again, and no matter how much leave in conditioner I applied, it kept breaking off.</li>
            <li>I found it really did that well and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like a dry cloth, still had moisture in it.</li>
            <li>so I have to give it a few more tries.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip it of its natural oils which is key since I&#x27;m going natural.</li>
            <li>is a very conditioning cleanser, however I find it difficult to use, there isn&#x27;t the same slip with regular conditioners that make it easy to use the wide tooth comb in the shower, with this, it doesn&#x27;t quite go through as easily.  </li>
            <li>in the future, this may very well replace my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>, very moisturizing.we follow up with our regular conditioner, leave in, and essential oils.</li>
            <li>and I do not have thick or hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>The AS I AM was easy to apply, a little goes a long way, and you get quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li>It left my hair very soft</li>
            <li>slip and moisturizes like no other.  </li>
            <li>and there is simply no other that can moisturize like Wen.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every other day by first sectioning my hair in 4 parts.  </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think that a product other than shampoo could cleanse my scalp and leave it moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair has major oily problems</li>
            <li>The only problem for me is that it is a little too rich to use all the time.  </li>
            <li>No other products.</li>
            <li>No other conditioner has ever done this.  </li>
            <li>It definately made my hair soft and silky, but two days after co-washing it, it felt kind of dirty which doesn&#x27;t normally happen when I wash using shampoo.</li>
            <li>The only other product I used in addition a day later from my wash was black castor oil on my scalp (another amazing product).</li>
            <li>I am not sure if maybe it&#x27;s cause my hair is too dry and maybe needs more treatment for me to thoroughly judge</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly noticed an overall improvement in my hair (which has been really dry lately)</li>
            <li>The rinse off is clean and soft, Not slick and heavy as I expected.</li>
            <li>I wet my hair, place a large scoop on my head and work it in, then comb it through, let it sit for a while 5-10 minutes and wash out.  </li>
            <li>But if I use a lighter shampoo every so often in between, this keeps my hair soft but not flat, shiny but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but definatly worth it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is by no means healthy in one shower, but seriously, it looks totally different!</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a few washes, but it does clean which I was concerned about.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit more effort than the average conditioner, but this isn&#x27;t average, anyway!  </li>
            <li>It highly irritated my scalp, causing scalp sores and open wounds, so now I have to discontinue it, throw the rest away, and purchase selsun blue.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d pamper my nose at least if not my hair, and I personally DO enjoy the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had read a review in the NY Times about co-shampoos in general and thought maybe I would like them.  </li>
            <li>Like many, I have spent a small fortune trying a myriad of products for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t provide as much slip as I expected</li>
            <li>I have used it twice this week and have only put virgin coconut oil in my hair with it and my 3c curly coils are soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it on pork tenderloin....</li>
            <li>This cowash not only cleans my hair but leaves it soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for me in terms of in-shower detangling, but that&#x27;s not really something I do anyway</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this again one of my staple products since I became natural.</li>
            <li>so my hair gets really curly when wet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times so far.  </li>
            <li>I also could instantly feel my natural curls after drying.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my teen daughter who has natural wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>BUT I DID NOT want one that was going to strip my hair completely because my hair is fragile and</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft while it was in my hair and after rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely cleanses my hair and makes it feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I have really soft 4c hair and find that conditioning alone actually weakens my hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely did not have any detangling properties as far as my hair was concerned.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair that I color red.</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and naturally wavy/loose curl.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the dimethicone gone from my hair, its soft and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li>However, this product did not like my natural blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Co Wash leaves my hair soft and manageable, i use it almost daily.</li>
            <li>I am a 4c newly natural female.</li>
            <li>I followed up with my regular leave in conditioner and my hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Left my hair detangled, soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I massaged it into scalp &amp; hair...left it in while I completed my shower, then rinsed, rinsed, rinsed.</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling soft and looking great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used once so far but think it will be a part of my haircare regiment.</li>
            <li>like I just left the hair shop, I normally use biosilk to give my hair a shine, but after using the coconut co-wash no need to add anything extra to my hair.</li>
            <li>But the packaging couldn&#x27;t be more frustrating.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this relatively thick coconut cowash in my hair.</li>
            <li>so I ended up having to wash it all the time which put more stress on my poor hair.</li>
            <li>It is creamy and smooth, but not too thick.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but not sure I will buy it again, well maybe if it goes on sale</li>
            <li>I use hairspray on very rare occasions and hardly use leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great slip, no heavy residue and my tangles (which are horrible) slide right out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it will work for others with considerably curlier hair, but my hair is just naturally wavy, not even necessarily curly, and fine but very thick.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for dry, curly/kinky hair and for any person who wants to keep their routine simple.</li>
            <li>Because of this, I ran through my first container within about a month and a half.</li>
            <li>I have oily hair with dry ends from heat and color damage, wavy/frizzy texture normally.  </li>
            <li>I mean I may give it a little bit of a trim, but this product is way better for my hair!</li>
            <li>I prefer to just use small amounts of shampoo to wash my hair because it actually feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and this conditioner does not cause excess oils like other conditioners do.</li>
            <li>You really cant beat the price compaired to wenn and other shampoo/ Conditioner out there.</li>
            <li>it was a hot mess, so I had to cut it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clean our common.</li>
            <li>Stripped my hair of it&#x27;s natural moisture and left it dry and brittle and did nothing as far as detangling.</li>
            <li>Since I have soft textured hair, it easily goes flat if I do not wash it regularly,  Unlike other shampoos that I have used in the past that dries my hair out completely,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently made the decision to go natural and since then, I&#x27;ve been trying a plethora of different products to see what my hair likes and doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I am a African American with 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li>No flaking and my african american hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>When I looked online for them they were far more expensive than what I used to pay for them</li>
            <li>I use an apple cider vinegar rinse to be sure there isn&#x27;t any residue left behind.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and it leaves it feeling clean without</li>
            <li>It is definitely a product to try for natural super thick hair.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it because traditional shampoos do dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>Although this cowash did take me through the transition to no-poo for my hair, a scalp condition that I worked hard to eliminate has returned in full since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>This is of course not helped by the fact that I live in Arizona where the air itself is dry and frizzy!  </li>
            <li>I am going natural for the third time , I am African American, but anyways I have been using this product for a month</li>
            <li>I tried this product on my hair and I am transitioning to natural, this left my hair totally stripped and coarse on my relaxed ends.</li>
            <li>As long as they don&#x27;t change the formula or all natural ingredients I am a customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the cowash for the first time a few days ago.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency a bit more, it smells better, and when my small section dried, it was moisturized without product, whereas As I Am was kind of drier, but nothing horrible.</li>
            <li>it to a friend to try who has straighter hair and it weighed her hair down too much.  </li>
            <li>I bent over in the shower because it was easier to really massage the product all over my scalp with my hair hanging down.</li>
            <li>When I ran out the first time, I decided to use up some product I had, so I mixed a little shampoo and alot of conditioner in my hand and cleaned my hair with that.  </li>
            <li>Blegh made my hair super greasy and was hard to get it all out.</li>
            <li>I do suggest putting on a high self in the shower or being extra careful.  </li>
            <li>Not sure co-washing is right for me.</li>
            <li>No more searching for the right cleanser/conditioner product.</li>
            <li>That conditioner make my hair soft and not so dry.</li>
            <li>Hi, I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman, 58 years old, and I&#x27;ve had problems with dry, frizzy hair all my life.  </li>
            <li>I tried this because I have naturally curly, dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x60;m a black girl and my  curls are very aggresive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going natural, but my hair gets really dry.  </li>
            <li>I thought i had straight hair with a slight wave</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally with no product in it</li>
            <li>After seeing this product on a few drug store shelves and reading positive reviews i decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Very thick and wavy, but fine.  </li>
            <li>I cowashed everyday as a new natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Caucasian, blonde with straight hair that had a slight wave.</li>
            <li>I rated a 4 instead of a 5 because it was only used once, however I do recommend for those with tight coils that want their curl pattern to really show.</li>
            <li>My hair for some reason will go from soft to very dry and course.  </li>
            <li>My Natural hair has always been very dry and brittle no matter what shampoo I used.</li>
            <li>I used the whole tub because I&#x27;m definitely not rich, but I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I will say, I was trying to use as little as possible but found you really need to use plenty</li>

            <li> this stuff is insanely amazing!</li>
            <li> I keep my hair tied up most of the time, but still, that&#x27;s impressive.  </li>
            <li> I used so many products and conditioners as co-washes, but I have to say that this product is the BEST co-wash I have used for my 4a type hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look for a product to be perfect, but I do look for it to work.:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my hair!</li>
            <li> The best it did for me was make my hair nice for one day, and made it smell nice.</li>
            <li> The way it smells is pleasant ...</li>
            <li> ♦ Has a pleasant scent</li>

            <li> I am ridiculously happy with this product, and am so glad I decided to try it!</li>
            <li> Not bad for a cowash one of the best cowashes on the market for now the smell is very nice and not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have 3c fine hair and this works so well for me, not to mention the delicious smell.</li>
            <li> This co-wash is great, I use it about every four days, and my hair looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using the leave in conditioner and styling gel too, those also smell amazing and work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> This probably the best all-in-one hair cleanser I&#x27;ve tried, but I get better results when I use Aubrey&#x27;s Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> As good as all the reviews say</li>
            <li> My hair looks gorgeous after I use it.  </li>
            <li> Cowash did a good job of cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good cowash to cleanse my 3B hair.</li>
            <li> The cowash smells good and feels good applying.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aloe in it.  </li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> I leave this conditioner in overnight and it works really good on my hair.</li>
            <li> It a good product, and it coats the hair well, but its a conditiner, they have a creamy shampoo too.</li>
            <li> The good</li>
            <li> I like the product, it smells good.</li>
            <li> Co-washing seemed like a good idea at the time when I bought this.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even work good.</li>
            <li> but both are good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This co-wash smells good and washes/conditions</li>
            <li> and I feel I&#x27;ve given it a good test drive.</li>
            <li> wonderful!!!!!I read good reviews about as I am coconut cowash.grrreat stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go...</li>
            <li> Anyway, I tried it and immediately loved it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good for dryness</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes my hair feel really good.</li>
            <li> Cowash to be a particularly good one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cowash for over a month now, and despite the good reviews here, I did not have a good experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice (not a must but a great bonus).</li>
            <li> As others said, my hair sometimes appears greasy a couple of days after using it, but then I use the As I Am shampoo and the leave in conditioner, and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li> This is really good</li>
            <li> it smells really good</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel so good.</li>
            <li> This co-wash leaves my hair feeling and smelling good.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a good amount when washing hair.</li>
            <li> I will say that I did notice that it DID NOT STRIP my color which is good.  </li>
            <li> Good for the hair.</li>
            <li> use this in my daughters hair and it works really good for them</li>
            <li> Loved this cowash.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and the consistency.  </li>
            <li> Loved it</li>
            <li> Sooooo good.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> SOOO HOOKED, SMELLS GOOD, DETANGLES, CLEANS WELL, CONDITIONS.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> and it smells good.</li>
            <li> So, to be fair, I can’t compare this product to WEN as I’ve never used it.</li>
            <li> The cowash smells good.  </li>
            <li> It smalls so so good.</li>
            <li> Works as good as Wen but 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend however using a good leave in conditioner and moisturizer after using this product.</li>
            <li> I had been using Hair One cleansing conditioner and loved the way it made my hair feel but it wouldn&#x27;t get out my hair product (hairspray, texture wax, etc)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cowash for some time now and stumbled upon this one.</li>
            <li> it smells so good</li>
            <li> I stated in the title, I found it cheaper elsewhere (which is surprising from Amazon).</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen and loved it....</li>
            <li> I section my hair into 4 sections and wash each with a good sided dollop of the stuff, then I spaltter a bit of water on without rinsing and let it sit for 5 min then rinse.</li>
            <li> it almost does too good of a job.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> if you have a lot of product buildup in your hair, otherwise, one pass is good.</li>
            <li> Did not look good.</li>
            <li> but the reviews which I rely on with amazon were so good,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had people tell me it smells good after I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> and it smell so good.</li>
            <li> A good conditioner and cleanser</li>
            <li> I am switching over from Wen to this product for good.</li>
            <li> I just tried this after seeing some good reviews.</li>
            <li> It smells so good.</li>
            <li> It is a good value cowash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried three, including his, and have loved, loved, loved them all.  </li>
            <li> For best results, follow the instuctions and massage into hair as if its a shampoo to leave your hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s vegan too--no animal products, and it smells great! :)</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!</li>

            <li> I liked the smell and consistency.  </li>
            <li> Cleanses well without drying out your hair &amp; it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I think the product is good for the most part.  </li>
            <li> The slip was excellent; I didn&#x27;t even really need a comb, just my fingers.</li>
            <li> Conditions well, smells nice.</li>
            <li> I use this product and although it is nice my hair cannot handle the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I read many good reviews about this product but in my case it was a fiasco.</li>
            <li> My type of hair is kind of curly kind of kinky</li>
            <li> Honestly, I had no clue whether or not it would work, but it did.</li>
            <li> It probably is great for many people, and we&#x27;ve enjoyed using it, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and has a creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and really cleans my hair well without drying it out or causing it to feel too stripped.</li>
            <li> It helped me detangle my hair so nicely with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> After reading so many good reviews I was convinced and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing and has a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> i can honestly say i like it...</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know how effective it was.</li>
            <li> Its detangling properties are effective.  </li>
            <li> But to each his own.</li>
            <li> and I liked the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many reviews on this product all good</li>
            <li> It has a lot of slip and it detangles my hair so nicely.</li>
            <li> Good, sure, but not what my hair needs.</li>
            <li> It smells great, nice and light smell.</li>
            <li> The coconut scent is so nice and inviting when waking up in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The product has a nice scent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen and I wasn&#x27;t totally thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It is not cost effective for the amount that you have to distribute through out your hair and once the product is distributed it did not detangle my hair or give this curl definition that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I used one or twice a week with my Honest Company shampoo/bath wash.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not as slippery as Wen...</li>
            <li> I also liked that it did not strip my hair even after using twice.</li>
            <li> It leaves it healthy, no frizz, and removes split ends for good.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative -- it was on sale for $6.99</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this product As I am Cowash is the Absolute BEST.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> This was a nice conditioner, but didn&#x27;t work well as a cowash for me.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, and leaves</li>
            <li> It reminds me of pina coladas beachside which is really nice.  </li>
            <li> it works: Nicely.</li>
            <li> This product has a very good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; which means my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and feels very smooth, yet clean when rinsed out.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  </li>
            <li> It smells good and feels good and leaves my hair feeling conditioned and clean.</li>
            <li> My hair is clean, smells great and is manageable after use.</li>
            <li> I am also very impressed with the price on this particular product as compared to others.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me, my hair gets clean and my scalp feels nourished.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this cowash and it&#x27;s all true!</li>
            <li> After using a full container did not see any great results.  </li>
            <li> And in a good way.. the smell is lovely, not too perfume-y but also not too one note, but what i enjoyed about this product was how nice it felt on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list alone is impressive, but the real wow factor came in the use of the product.</li>
            <li> This is my new best find!</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with hair care products for about 4 to five years now and I am loving these items as well as Shea Moisture which is another line I own and just love.</li>
            <li> My hair is very easy to style.</li>
            <li> Made it very easy to detangle and no buildup either.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it one more chance before passing it on, and I am so glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> My curls are shiny and defined (well, except I kept putting my hands in &#x27;em, so they probably could have looked even better if I had more self-control!)  </li>
            <li> This lovely CoWash is SILICONE FREE!!</li>
            <li> The best hair product for my co wash leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feels soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best cowash products Ive ever used!</li>
            <li> Best results for natural hair wearers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful on natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> They are both excellent natural alternatives</li>
            <li> It is quick and easy, leaves my hair easy to manage and looking the best that it can.  </li>
            <li> This stuff make it shiny, soft and smells great!!</li>
            <li> I can detangled my hair and wash it perfect for my transition to natural</li>
            <li> The smell is great like fresh coconuts.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST PRODUCT I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> One of the best products that I have purchased since going natural.</li>
            <li> Out of them all As I Am&#x27;s Co Wash is by far the best to cleanse and condition the hair.</li>
            <li> A natural girl&#x27;s best friend!</li>

            <li> It gentle, smell great and has a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> Leaves you hair clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li> I was able to very easily run this product through my hair after fully saturating my hair with water.</li>
            <li> This cleans better, I don&#x27;t feel the hair oily and washes very easily.  </li>
            <li> This product is the first product I&#x27;ve found which leaves my hair and scalp looking and feeling great after a wash.</li>
            <li> I had heard really good things about this product and now having tried it for myself I can say they are all true.</li>
            <li> It provides a good clean without stripping the hair of precious moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on my daughter who has fine, curly hair and it made her curls lovely!</li>
            <li> Loved it and help to hydrate my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> but it also has a nice strong coconut smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Jamaican with fine relaxed hair this product was amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great solution for when you need to clean your hair but don&#x27;t want to go through the full washing process.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t like to wash it more than twice a week.</li>
            <li> the magic is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> and all I can say is I LOVE this.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more products from</li>
            <li> I love Wen co- wash</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is such a perfect product.  </li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed his presentation and now follow his routine to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> All the while, they&#x27;re both FANTASTIC conditioners, softeners, and reduce combing forces!</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s an awesome product with a simple ingredient list and it</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s an awesome product with a simple ingredient list and it</li>
            <li> I love the feel and consistency.</li>
            <li> It is beyond me how this product got so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li> Just FYI :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now, and I am in love.</li>
            <li> But I am ok with that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> ; had great reviews and was comparable (but much cheaper)</li>
            <li> I was extremely pleased with the results and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li> It also wasn&#x27;t a great detangler and it didn&#x27;t really soften my hair either.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> As I Am CoWash is more of a CoWash product than a conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I think she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Something I have never been able to do without tangles.</li>
            <li> I was able to detangle with my fingers instead of using a comb.</li>
            <li> And I love the smell.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> love this stuff and would not be without it</li>
            <li> I tried it and love it.  </li>
            <li> However, I do notice that after a month or so it starts to get more and more greasy between washes.</li>
            <li> , co-washing isn&#x27;t ok to do often.</li>
            <li> It was just okay to me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging could be better.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that Amazon carries these type products</li>
            <li> so I have to use more of this than the recommendations suggest.</li>
            <li> I think As I Am is might be slightly better than Renpure for my hair type</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s manageable, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome results in just a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Use it more than shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> and its so cheap!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen&#x27;s Cowash and I like this product better.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> and I love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this cowash.</li>
            <li> I am trying to go more days in between washing.</li>
            <li> So I added some more joico</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> It cleans the hair better than shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> The smell is great since I love coconut so much.</li>
            <li> I truly love this.</li>
            <li> but I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> But please be sure to use a dentangling condintioner with this Co-Wash.</li>
            <li> I happen to love co-wash products, and have found As I Am</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love using this cowash--I just avoid my scalp</li>
            <li> and i bought this product out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Most of it ends up in the tub than on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I am in love plus</li>
            <li> and I know I will love it</li>
            <li> I would hope that they would ship this in a better way.</li>
            <li> So yes, I would recommend, and I love it.</li>
            <li> (lathers a bit  the more you use and work into hair)&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I chopped my hair twice in hopes it would grow healthy, but nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thinking that he wouldn&#x27;t understand (he is a man) and probably better to fib a reason but honesty paid here.</li>
            <li> Light bulb moment!  </li>
            <li> My waves are more defined and even have a bit of bounce.</li>
            <li> but it better then</li>
            <li> You can never be too sure these days.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is close to 4 stars because my hair is noticeably better, but I find myself dreading washing my hair with this because of the lack of ease and the slippery tub.</li>
            <li> This cowash conditioner smells lovely and works well as a cowash.</li>
            <li> It smells okay.</li>
            <li> Upon more research, you have to rinse quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Make sure you thoroughly rinse.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite cleaning cowwash.</li>
            <li> I ended up switching to Pantene&#x27;s Cleansing conditioner which gave much better detangling slip and menthol for my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the price, the smell, the way my hair looks after.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It has helped with static fly-always this winter season.</li>
            <li> so glad i tried it</li>
            <li> Love the product by cant afford the cost.</li>
            <li> I found As I Am online and love the price.</li>
            <li> This product is OK</li>
            <li> I have received better results co washing with V05 Moisture Milks.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my hair was super clean but also felt moisturized, it was great.</li>
            <li> I love that</li>
            <li> This is better in price, amount needed, and effect.</li>
            <li> I will try once more with a shower cap and heat and update my review with the results.</li>
            <li> It has more of a &#x27;no smell&#x27; to me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and seems to work for many different hair types.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love how the cowash smooths my hair with out streaking it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I used the WEN instructions when I used this and made sure my hair was drenched when I started working this in.  </li>
            <li> I used an argon oil hair mask in lieu of a detangler, but I&#x27;m sure that using just a bit of this as a leave in conditioner like I&#x27;ve always done with WEN would work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to learning how to get the most from my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> I like this better.</li>
            <li> My hair got softer and has more volume I love it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your hair feeling a lot more manageable.</li>
            <li> I love Coconut</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> cowash has made me love my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks healthy again.</li>
            <li> As I Am Coconut CoWash :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure part of that is because of shampoos.</li>
            <li> I guess you just use alot and make sure you cover every portion, and it takes the place of what lathering does.</li>
            <li> try this you will love it!!!1</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m being more selective with the products I put on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yay!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It works better than shampoo followed by conditioner.  </li>
            <li> But got better result from cheaper conditioners.</li>
            <li> It was okay</li>
            <li> , my hair got 50% better, but still frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It became shiny and bouncy, even better than before!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommend this, but before buying try getting the sample to make sure It works for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> yes I would say I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Along with many, I wanted to use Wen.</li>
            <li> Okay but needs conditioner after for sure.</li>
            <li> This product really does a good job for my kind of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t been better.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> And I love the fact that it has organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair, smooth and shiny with nice curls.  </li>
            <li> I love it when I put this in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell &amp; it feels so creamy.</li>
            <li> I believe you will LOVE it too.</li>
            <li> vs. when I was shampooing, but the results are much better.</li>
            <li> I used this three to four times and just found it to be just okay.</li>
            <li> I was able to give this to a friend of my daughter who has dreadlocks and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> :)  Would recommend co-washing, and using this co-wash to every curly head.</li>
            <li> A lot of ladies complain about the container, so I purchase a plastic container with a pump top and put all 16 ounces in it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the scent too.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different cleansing conditioners, but this is the most creamy and has excellent slip.</li>
            <li> Elation (the deep condition) is also a great product!</li>
            <li> This product makes me want to stop shampooing, I love it.</li>
            <li> When I tried to add more conditioner, it would get that greasy feeling the day after I washed my hair</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Packaging could be better.  </li>
            <li> A bottle would definitely be a better option with a pop up top.</li>
            <li> Even better is walgreens sells it for about 7 bucks.</li>
            <li> I love cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer  and smoother after using it and a my curly cream works better.</li>
            <li> number of pumps, comb it through hair, leave on for so many minutes--that I just gave up.</li>
            <li> The top layer is blond</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love As I Am.  </li>
            <li> I use the leave in as well as the curly jelly and love them all.</li>
            <li> I have found my wavey hair has become more curly</li>
            <li> so not every one is going to be able to use this product.</li>
            <li> so well my stylist asked what I&#x27;ve been using :) You can&#x27;t find a better price than on Amazon.</li>
            <li> However, this product is just okay</li>
            <li> There was no seal when i opened the top so there was conditioner all around the top, sort of oozing</li>
            <li> and it seems ok</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It was ok</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this cowash and will continue to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I went through that routine for about a month, hoping that eventually it would get better.</li>
            <li> and it was two times too many.  </li>
            <li> If you do, I am glad it worked for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m REALLY pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I can let my hair air-dry after using this without looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ALOT cheaper than WEN and works better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for more moisture for my 3b curls, but this didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> After a couple more months I realized I&#x27;d lost about 1/3 of my volume</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll probably pass this product along to one of my AA friends whom it might be better suited for.</li>
            <li> a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I would have better results if I would use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love use</li>
            <li> I want more order this</li>
            <li> I love the texture of my hair after towel drying.  </li>
            <li> Aside from this concern, I love the product.</li>
            <li> It works ok with my curls.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m satisfied with it for the price.</li>
            <li> The product is great, and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Like many before me, I like Wen, but I do not like the price.  </li>
            <li> Waaaaaaay better than when I co-wash with Vo5 conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m in the minority there -- as most people love it.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but it was ok but</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> a pump would have been so much more convenient.</li>
            <li> I love this and hope they never discontinue it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner when i use it</li>
            <li> I like the smell because I love coconuts</li>
            <li> I love this conditioning cleanser.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> I had to use more of it than I did the</li>
            <li> I got my product on time and was able to track it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the moisture it leaves on the hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite, but I am just not a coconut fan.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it was in a pump but overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get product build up from the coconut co wash and it spreads throughout my hair better than hair one.</li>
            <li> I product is okay.  </li>
            <li> My hair was more manageable after washing.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I am able to shampoo my wavy/curly shoulder length hair just once a week now.</li>
            <li> I have tried many cleansing conditioners, and this is my favorite alongside Wen products.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I never was satisfied with how my hair looked or felt.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this did anything more for my hair than using a cheapie conditioner to cowash.</li>
            <li> Love this line</li>
            <li> Better than shampoo.</li>
            <li> If you wash, rinse, repeat a section twice or more, it feels more \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a 16 ounce jar</li>
            <li> Smells nice, goes on hair smoothly, hair feels softer.</li>
            <li> I think that some of the ingredients strip your hair more than the product description suggests.</li>
            <li> So even though it is meant to be used by itself, I like it better than any conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love the price!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love this product.  </li>
            <li> leaves my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> This is an ok cowash cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have to use a conditioner with more slip afterwards.</li>
            <li> On hair that is more course it does not do well.</li>
            <li> Joico is a better choice for a detangler.</li>
            <li> I used up that bottle, and knew I had to buy more.  </li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product on my scalp</li>
            <li> but it was comparable to Wen, maybe even better as the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; in Wen has been known to burn my eyes and cause my scalp to itch.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have had many of their product&#x27;s before throwing them away.  </li>
            <li> So much better than WEN.  </li>
            <li> and this product does a much better job.</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> Hair Rules was okay</li>
            <li> so I maybe had to use more than somebody else)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my color stays a lot better with this also, so if you color your hair, this is a way to keep it, and it doesn&#x27;t strip the color out.</li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this coconut cowash cleansing conditioner, for me it works better than the wen.</li>
            <li> Glad you have it in stock.</li>
            <li> This is cleansing more than conditioning.</li>
            <li> My curls enjoyed the combo.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li> I will use this 1st when I co-wash and then follow with Organix Argan Oil conditioner for more moisture and to detangle.  </li>
            <li> I wish this had better smell.</li>
            <li> (this has been a very successful use of this product :).I will not likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> wonderful cleansing cowash leaves you hair soft and clean helps remove build ups and hair products.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair feel soft and clean, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t strip any of the colour from my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But after drying, my hair &amp; scalp are clean, soft, shiny, and perfectly manageable.  </li>
            <li> The product smells okay and has a nice consistency, but doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells and my hair is very clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more of this!!!</li>
            <li> Just got this and used it and so far so good!</li>
            <li> This one had great feedback and was a decent price so of course I had to try it.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this conditioner is great for 4a,4b,4c hair textures in particular.</li>
            <li> Lol, but overall, this is the best co wash so far</li>
            <li> It still works pretty well and smells good.</li>
            <li> and I am noticing that my hair is becoming softer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> All the good reviews are real!</li>
            <li> Its kind of coconut-y, and sweet.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the ingredients are great and it left a nice slip to it.</li>
            <li> and her hair was soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li> Co-wash is a product that is perfect for if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a bottle from Sally&#x27;s to make it much more easy for application.</li>
            <li> Super nice product for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is super conditioning.</li>
            <li> My hair is more easily untangled and shinier when it dries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter weight than conditioners I&#x27;ve used to detangle before, which seems like it helps the comb and brush to glide through more easily.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Cleansing Conditioner is better for my hair, and I&#x27;ll keep this until my order for L.C.C. comes in (thankfully, Amazon makes it easy to find things I can&#x27;t find in the stores) and for backup when I run out.  </li>
            <li> - it would also be excellent for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer and easy to manage and I would encourage anyone looking to eliminate dryness and wanted to promote their healthy hair to try this product.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and really leaves the hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Incredible products I am a female of Caucasian but absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> Great for natural and synthetic hair!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even need to finger detangler after using it because my hair is so slippery and clean that the knots just detangler themselves!</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp are clean and moisturized!</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of cleaning the scrap and left my hair really clean.</li>
            <li> the conditioner is made my hair silky smooth and an adorable sent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance and ease of use makes this a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I would have to say I even like this product better than my shea products and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> i love it, makes my hair so smooth</li>
            <li> Please consider buying this product it is a great staple for your natural hair care collection.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this product works great.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing wash for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> A great product, it leaves your hair soft but you still sit with loads of tangles.</li>
            <li> leaves your hair soft and manageable and smells great.</li>
            <li> Makes my natural hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> , she loved it so much I gave her the container.  </li>
            <li> it smells so good and my hair really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> I hope not, since I&#x27;ve loved my hair since using it, but I have a very itchy scalp, and my skin seems to be reacting as well.  </li>
            <li> Also, I gave a friend with straight hair a container of this, and both she and her husband loved it immediately.</li>
            <li> It smells good but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it is cleaning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I loved this product so much that I had to write a review on Amazon even though I ended up purchasing at Sally&#x27;s because of time constraints.</li>
            <li> So I say this all the good reviews  are correct in saying it is a fine product because certain texture it works well.</li>
            <li> this stuff kind of runs right out of your hand...</li>
            <li> Although the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, my hair tends to tangle more after using it than I&#x27;d like requiring me to use significant amounts of leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> or if I&#x27;m doing the gym 2 days in a row) but the best thing is still  to wash every other day.</li>
            <li> so excited :)</li>
            <li> definitely a keeper and a good price !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other non-sudsing cleansers and found this one to be the best and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other co-washes but this is the best.  </li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this co-wash!  </li>
            <li> Overall great product and I will buy more from Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s an easy fix at home.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit scared about using the cowash because I wasn&#x27;t sure about how it would get my hair clean.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair easy to manage</li>
            <li> The smell is delightful and it really seems to do the job for cleansing my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about how clean it gets your hair though.</li>
            <li> My braid pony tail is easily 18+ inches in length.</li>
            <li> It spread through my hair easily and rinsed out easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rinses out easily and detangles quite well.</li>
            <li> and now my conditioner is sitting in my shower for easy access.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair can stay clean all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to distribute through your hair.</li>
            <li> but you can still detangle your hair but not as easily.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed is that I have to use quite a bit of the cowash to feel like I&#x27;m drenching my hair with it, so I&#x27;ll be going through it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It smelled ok and did make my hair feel clean which I was worried about.</li>
            <li> easy to use and rinse out.</li>
            <li> but I found a way to get it to work better for me and make my scalp clean.  </li>
            <li> it made my hair easy to detangle..</li>
            <li> Luckily, most of it stayed in the container, but then the shower floor was slippery from the spilled cowash, so I had to clean the shower floor.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, i like the way my hair looks so clean and moisturized, and it detangles easily..</li>
            <li> My hair is  looser in pattern and the part of my head that consist a cotton texture is looser and easy to detange with my fingers. .</li>
            <li> I have type 4 hair and it gets tangled easily and needs products with a lot of slip for detangling.</li>
            <li> Did not style easily or well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with or without shampoo.</li>
            <li> -- soooo easy to style.  </li>
            <li> It massages into the scalp easily and I could even detangle with it.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.  </li>
            <li> It does not have a strong smell for you ladies and gentlemen that don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> and my hairdresser strongly discouraged me from using it.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon, I have been using this cowash and I can say that it is very gentle and effective for my two kinds of hair.  </li>
            <li> my first use of this product, my hair felt AMAZING...</li>
            <li> It does not have the sweet mint scent that I love from Wen, but it cleanses and conditions my hair just as well.</li>
            <li> I used it a second time and my hair got so beautiful</li>
            <li> My wonderful stylist recommended this product and other sulfate free brands.</li>
            <li> I only used it once and the product made my daughter&#x27;s curls stand out beautifully.  </li>
            <li> With this cowash you may not need to condition afterwards because it leaves your hair pretty nice, but with my hair I need a conditioner and a leave in.  </li>
            <li> Great results, hair are very soft and clean, no need to apply conditioner because hair become very smooth and silky right away.</li>
            <li> If you use a lot of butters and get buildup, this product may be fine for you.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fine and the consistency too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has  a light, almost gel-like texture, and distributes into hair easily.</li>
            <li> I have fine then hair</li>
            <li> We all have fine hair that&#x27;s prone to dryness, breakage, yet oily scalp.</li>
            <li> For some background: I have fine, pin-straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first real cowash I&#x27;ve tried, and it works great.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but I have a LOT of it, and it is wavy.</li>
            <li> I guess that would be fine</li>
            <li> This  coconut cowash is fine.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Detangling is super breezy too!</li>
            <li> I would advise mostly using it on the roots unless you use quite a lot of product on the lengths of your hair, since otherwise you will probably find yourself going through this jar fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly though!</li>
            <li> This has quickly become 1 of my favorite go to products.  </li>
            <li> I love how the mild scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It is the best cowash and detangling product, but generally the most pleasing product that I&#x27;ve used as far as giving me the results that I want without any complaints.</li>
            <li> The curl/coils were still tight and looking great when I arrived to work!</li>
            <li> , my hair was strong and growing beautifully &amp; now it is dry and brittle and breaking off.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair moist and is not heavy, great for keeping hair clean between salon visits, smells good and hair was clean without stripping natural oils</li>
            <li> HUGE plus.  </li>
            <li> and I had huge flakes of dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair was very greasy at first, but after about two weeks my hair looked amazing!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the product and that my hair is free from buildup after I wash.  </li>
            <li> I have ethnic hair and this cowash is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sulfate Free</li>
            <li> But as soon as I smooth this cowash in, I can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth</li>
            <li> You need to use a clarifying shampoo free of those ingredients THEN use this...  </li>
            <li> /&gt;♦ Light texture&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this 16 ounce size will last me about 10 washes, which is great.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;This is worth more than 5 stars 👍🏽</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and the price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> I use a sulfate free wash and comb my hair out in the shower, I then rinse and apply AS I AM and comb it through; I allow this product to sit in my hair for a while, as I shave my legs, and then rinse it out.</li>
            <li> My hair is light weight, silky, and frizz/ flyaway free.</li>
            <li> enjoy yinz</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the product 3 stars for the smell only, it smells great.</li>
            <li> how it makes her hair style is not yet important.</li>
            <li> My hair has never before been shiny, smooth and manageable as it is now that I&#x27;m using As I Am.</li>
            <li> She had been looking into sulfate free shampoos and decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> That way my hair doesn&#x27;t get stripped but my scalp still feels flake free and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it about 4 days a week and the rest I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner (dermorganics).</li>
            <li> The smell is also really nice, very tropical.</li>
            <li> the heat from the hair dryer makes me look like I stuck my finger in a light switch.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes it so easy to brush and comb the tangles out, and also helps to clean product buildup out of my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> w/ a water bottle that is filled w/ conditioner &amp; tea tree oil &amp; generously apply the co wash cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product works excellent for those of us that want fresh/clean hair everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> My hair is light colored and almost to my waist.</li>
            <li> The product works very well but after careful research, I found it for way cheaper than this, its okay, I&#x27;ll just research before buying, but the products is Great!</li>
            <li> This product has a light coconut scent that stays in your hair even after you rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I found that my hair liked Curl Junkie (very moisturizing) and Spiral Solutions (boutique brand) and Jessicurl (also boutique).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the hunt for \\&quot;on</li>
            <li> is sulfate free, but</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought this at Sally&#x27;s because I heard so many good reviews</li>
            <li> smells really good and it leaves my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with straight hair and this product works awesome for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and hydrated, But i have to use quite a bit of the product to work it on my scalp, it does have a nice smell, like most AS I AM products.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely, delicate coconut fragrance that is not overpowering at all, detangles my hair wonderfully, and cleanses my hair along with moisturizing it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 15yrs now and this is by far one of the best products that I have used.</li>
            <li> Simply put: the absolute best!!!</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s good slip, so it spreads easily, and my hair comes out looking clean (but not a stiff, squeaky clean) and voluminous.</li>
            <li> Shed hairs slide right on out:)</li>
            <li> When used with a good shampoo, my hair feels soft, smooth, weightless, and clean.</li>
            <li> The cleansing part didn&#x27;t really work for my hair though,OH POO!!!</li>
            <li> It smells good and my hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Since infant hair is much finer than an older child&#x27;s and adults hair this worked great for him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product because it gets my hair clean and conditions it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy going on, smells good and leaves my hair soft an clean.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally thick and are very full so when it gets nappy I still get to enjoy the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> There are protein rich products and protein free products  ...  </li>
            <li> Just bought this and love the large tub size!</li>
            <li> Leaves it clean and feeling light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and 100% get the hair clean and conditioned all at once.</li>
            <li> This co-wash does not leave your hair smooth but it cleanses the scalp thoroughly and the scalp feels clean and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and free of buildup.  </li>
            <li> The smell was mild but nice and so far, I love it, plus...</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell but doesn&#x27;t detangle particularly well; my $.79 bottle of VO5 Strawberries and Cream Conditioner outperforms this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my hair feels soft and healthy but easily style able .</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, has ridiculous (in a GOOD way!)</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely and not too strong, it applies nicely, rinses out well, and leaves my hair really easy to dry &amp; style.  </li>
            <li> Especially important where I live because the desert air really dries out the skin.  </li>
            <li> Now, I already have a favorite co-wash (Shi-Naturals Conditioner Wash), however, I wanted to try something new, so I will not run out of my precious Shi-Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Great deal for the money since I&#x27;m sure I could have used less.</li>
            <li> I Am makes a number of wonderful products that are worth the slightly hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li> I am super happy to have finally found something that suits my need.</li>
            <li> But, what I like best is that it didnt dry out my hair, which is very delicate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product and my hair feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased WEN in an attempt to help with my hair problem.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, smooth and full of body.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s re-ordered, so I guess that&#x27;s a success!</li>
            <li> I have literally never been so excited about a hair product.</li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> This product has been a staple since I first started growing my hair 2 years ago, it&#x27;s even better now with Amazon Prime&#x27;s subscription service</li>
            <li> and I have it ready to go! :-)  </li>
            <li> For NOW just keep aware of where it is and set the lid on top if you are showering to keep water out.  </li>
            <li> Excited to see what continued use will do considering I&#x27;ve used it once</li>
            <li> It is significantly cheaper than the price in beauty stores, and it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff very cleansing and doesn&#x27;t streak my hair of moisture at all!</li>
            <li> Buy it it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was excited about ordering this.  </li>
            <li> It is so totally worth the money!  </li>
            <li> LOL!!tally worth the money!  </li>
            <li> For some people that seemed to notice that it leaves their hair greasy, when you first start to co-wash, your hair tends to produce more oil.  </li>
            <li> It did make my hair pretty shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It does not lather up too much and it rinses out easily!</li>
            <li> so wanted something I could use to feel clean without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> I no longer have a closet full of hair care products that ended up not working - nor am I slave to the blow dryer or hot iron :)</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean after using this product...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting that clean feeling from a &amp;#34;no suds&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped, just clean.</li>
            <li> As an aside: I used this product before getting my hair done and my stylist even mentioned how clean my hair was.</li>
            <li> (Castor) Seed Oil¹, Phytosterols¹, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract¹, Quaternium-18, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Methylisothiazolinone.ng that clean feeling from a &amp;#34;no suds&amp;#34; shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped, just clean.</li>
            <li> As an aside: I used this product before getting my hair done and my stylist even mentioned how clean my hair was.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be better off using a regular moisturizing conditioner (you know the drugstore kind) which is what I had been doing for years.    </li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li> and I like to get my scalp really clean.</li>
            <li> But it does feel clean after i use it</li>
            <li> but I like the squeaky clean feeling which this doesn&#x27;t provide.  </li>
            <li> so well conditioned and clean.  </li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t work for me; it just doesn&#x27;t clean as well as shampoo and leaves buildup.  </li>
            <li> my hair was clean but still felt moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I could see my curls look squeaky clean?</li>
            <li> Some of the sulfate frees don&#x27;t clean well or take alot to  work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would clean my hair like a shampoo</li>
            <li> Just use it to clean the scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s STILL clean...</li>
            <li> conditioner could actually clean my hair without leaving it greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> As I Am Coconut CoWash adds moisture to my hair but still gets it squeaky clean (and</li>
            <li> So my hubby transferred this product into the thoroughly clean pump dispenser bottle.  </li>
            <li> It really does help bringing the natural wave to my hair, which I think looks great.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair clean and smelling like coconut.</li>
            <li> and I will have to do more co-washes to my natural hair. :)</li>
            <li> I use this in alternation with pantene shampoo-conditioner combo to keep my scalp clean.</li>
            <li> This product gets my hair clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp felt amazingly clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> I let it sit until the end of my shower, rinse thoroughly and when my hair is dry it looks great and clean.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, and isn&#x27;t trying.</li>
            <li> I considered making my own cowash but after pricing out the ingredients it is the same cost as Asiam Coconut Cowash, so I will keep buying it here :)</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t make my hair managable or clean.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair feels clean and moisturized with bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I sometimes even clean my body with it for the moisture it provides.</li>
            <li> While this co-wash does get your scalp clean.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your hair feeling clean but not stripped of all moisture</li>
            <li> Hair feels moisturized and clean, with movement and shine.  </li>
            <li> the more I use it the better my hair looks, less fuzz, more shine, better manageability, nicer curls.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> (Example, Kinky Curly&#x27;s Come Clean</li>
            <li> I rated this product 5 stars because my hair feels clean and moisturized after applying it.</li>
            <li> It leaves her hair very soft and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> My natural curls have never looked better!</li>
            <li> Upon hearing the reviews on YouTube about this product and being that I have other products in this line I was over joyed at having another option for a Co wash and it performed beautifully.</li>
            <li> My hair was full of volume and clean for all day.</li>
            <li> This one does not do anything special for me.  </li>
            <li> My hair just drinks it right up!  </li>
            <li> This makes more coils in my hair than the other conditioner I used as my cowash (and I was pretty happy with that conditioner).</li>
            <li> Just fabulously moisturizing and leaves my hair feeling so fresh, clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> The product has a light coconut fragrance that is fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> I just washed my hair with this stuff and was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has this amazing coconut smell to it, and it leaves your hair feeling so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This is far out the best cleanser for my hair, and will continue to use it as long as it stays on the market.</li>
            <li> I use a different shampoo to keep the highlights bright in my hair, and then use this as a conditioner for 5 minutes and rinse it out.</li>
            <li> My elasticity is normal after 3+ years of good gentle care and conditioning and growing out the damaged bits.</li>
            <li> Okay I have never used Wen, but I really don&#x27;t think that I need to after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my thick hip length hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt super clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> It is something that is true to its ad.</li>
            <li> and I have used this product and it leaves my hair super clean.</li>
            <li> It only costs $4 for a 32 oz bottle and it is twice as good as this product on my curly</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Despite all of this I used the entire thing of it just to give it a fair chance</li>
            <li> For the rest of my hair,  especially the ends, I&#x27;m not convinced this product does a good job conditioning.</li>
            <li> I have gotten tons of compliments about how full and shiny my hair looks.</li>
            <li> this product really works for my hair, i love the smell.</li>
            <li> Nice for natural hair</li>
            <li> So while I can&#x27;t speak to how this product would work on natural hair, I would use this with a weave at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I think they are both good choices, but come time to repurchase, I will only buy Eden!</li>
            <li> It keeps my kids hair nice and soft and it easier to comb</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s smells really yummy. :)</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff initially because I wanted a one step wash routine.</li>
            <li> However, to be fair I have only used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> make sure to use a VERY generous amount.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair both curly and straight, and it does wonders for adding moisture and makes my hair much more healthier.</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and smell really nice.</li>
            <li> I also let it sit for about 15 minutes with a cap on to make sure it really got conditioned.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my hair texture thickening and being super clean.</li>
            <li> I passed on it because I had never heard of it, even though it was full of rave reviews...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughters waist length thick hair and it stayed beautiful for 3 days!  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Really nice, my hair was soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> only this product and my hair was fairly oily when I got in the shower.  </li>
            <li> As I am cowash not only cleanses my hair good, it works with my budget.  </li>
            <li> A full palmful for my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li> I think it works okay, but I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> not bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not everyone may like it.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad co wash.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, that&#x27;s not bad for 16 oz.</li>
            <li> This one is not bad.</li>
            <li> I love it when you find something that works right the first time.</li>
            <li> It helped keep my hair strong and soft love it.</li>
            <li> My hair responded very well to this product, My Hair was very Clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Nothing great, other than the coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who found this a great product.</li>
            <li> but the overly sweet smell, and high price tag was killing me, plus my hair didn&#x27;t look any better.</li>
            <li> a shampoo, my hair felt fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> , It quickly went in the trash.</li>
            <li> This co-wash is the best on the market for african american hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my curly hair soft, shiney and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Two months ago I started using co-wash conditioner, and it has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a never ending search for mostly protein free products for my 4c natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Ships quickly and is as advertised.</li>
            <li> Adequate product for the price.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I was able to comb my hair out IN THE SHOWER which I’ve NEVER been able to do.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s better to pay extra money for a better product like Wen.</li>
            <li> Even a traditional shampoo bottle with a twist off top would protect it from mold better.</li>
            <li> I chose this because of the suggestions in &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; and agree that the cowash helps tremendously with caring for my curly s&#x27;waves.</li>
            <li> a whole lot of fruity yumminess andfresh clean hair with a slip!  </li>
            <li> ACTUALLY GETS CLEAN AND CONDITIONED AND SOFT AND EASY TO COMB!!!</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, is mild enough for daily use and makes detangling SO easy and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Luckily, i was able to purchase it on sale at Walgreens for $6.99 (the product is normally $7.99) and after a month of using this cleansing conditioner, I am officially hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have type 3a curls, and I need to use some leave-in conditioner after using this cowash (which sort of negates the point, but it&#x27;s still better than using shampoo all the time), but other than that it&#x27;s an effective cleansing agent.</li>
            <li> I thought cowashes were a gimmick (why not just use cheap conditioner to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft  since using it, and super easy to detangle!</li>
            <li> My porosity used to be high-high, and now I think it&#x27;s more normal.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and clean and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> These people must have super dry hair as I don&#x27;t understand how in the world they say it&#x27;s any good?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, my hair being natural dry and wavy, type 2b/2c, it has responded wonderfully to at home, weekly, hot oil treatments; and so since I&#x27;m adding all these oils to my hair, I wanted a cleansing shampoo</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old has very fine, wavy flyaway hair and it has done wonders for hers.</li>
            <li> I think I found my new favorite cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this i live by it</li>
            <li> but my hair just love new</li>
            <li> and you really need to scrub around your scalp very good to insure the cream wash breaks down all the dirt and oil before rinsing.</li>
            <li> so my hair can get very straw like straw easily...</li>
            <li> It really softens my 4c hair and makes it supple and easy to manipulate.  </li>
            <li> so easy makes managing my hair during the wash process so much easier i have been using this for months</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and it doesn&#x27;t linger much.</li>
            <li> I can dry it and in the summer it still looks good.  </li>
            <li> It really is a good product for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels so good after using this--not dry and itchy like with shampoos.</li>
            <li> 2 stars only because it was good that first time, and might continue to work for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very soft or healthy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, leaves hair feeling very soft and for all the naturals that don&#x27;t really have the time or energy to create every single thing in the kitchen( lol ), this product is a blessing!</li>
            <li> Definitely has a prominent place in my product stash!</li>
            <li> First, the scent is heavenly (but it doesn&#x27;t linger too much) and it really detangled my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> So I thought to use this as a regular conditioner &amp; I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> will definitely recommend :)!</li>
            <li> I use it after deep conditioning &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> keep my hair very moisture!!</li>
            <li> I had NO idea her hair could curl as much as it does!!  </li>
            <li> I love how it leaves me hair so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> This product is great to use when you don&#x27;t actually want to do a full wash on your natural hair.</li>
            <li> I received the product and used it the same night, love it!</li>
            <li> He laughed and said, &amp;#34;you sound like a black girl, my girl, my ma and sisters always be b#*ching about washing their hair.</li>
            <li> 3c/4a hair, low porosity.&lt;br /&gt;This has easily become my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> It cleans hair so well with no residues and most important it does not dry out hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not feel dry or gross at all, it just feels absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who thought anyone would find it easy or the slightest bit enjoyable to fumble around with a smooth 16 oz jar in the shower when that jar contains a slippery substance that you are attempting to manipulate through your hair (sometimes with your eyes closed).</li>
            <li> I love co-washing my fine naturally blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> As other glowing reviews already mentioned, this cowash has a pleasant scent, cleanses and conditions.  </li>
            <li> alone, with no conditioner or leave-in after, my hair felt smooth, light, and very clean once dry.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser - nice light coconut scent; not overwhelming and your hair doesn&#x27;t stay greasy afterwards like some cleanser does.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived very fast and just like if you had gone to the store to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, cleans hair without drying and also conditions at the same time.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s proven -  protein free for real and moisturizing after rinse out.</li>
            <li> My hair detangles in a snap and looks great after it&#x27;s blow dried</li>
            <li> It was ok, kind of made my hair stringy or course and heavy.</li>
            <li> I realize the range of AA hair is HUGE and this probably doesn&#x27;t help too much as a discription.</li>
            <li> I can easily comb my hair in the shower and it leaves it feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I got this from a beauty supply store and really wanted to love it, but I didn&#x27;t feel it conditioned my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair manageable and so soft.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard YouTubers say to purchase a cheaper moisturizing conditioner from brands such as Creme of Nature and Garnier Fructis when co-washing; however, I liked the packaging and the ingredients, so I went for it.  </li>
            <li> I am going through a transition to natural hair and my hair looks beatiful and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you work out frequently and want to keep your hair clean, but not stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, regardless.</li>
            <li> I was using shea moisture products for a while (which I really liked) but they stopped selling them in my local store.</li>
            <li> I guess this product isn&#x27;t really for ethnic hair, it really drys my hair out, but it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> I have tried thousands of dollars worth of products.  </li>
            <li> It makes wash day an exciting event for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> But if I had to chose just one, Eden wins.</li>
            <li> I love that is also all natural and nourishing for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough on its own.</li>
            <li> simply because the kind of luck</li>
            <li> Sometimes natural hair just needs different types of treatment and I&#x27;m so happy I tried this as an option.</li>
            <li> My natural hair felt ok.</li>
            <li> love the way it makes my natural hair feel</li>
            <li> This product works well when I want to let my hair go wild, which is most days.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Leaves my curly hair soft and healthy looking .</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always good and wet when I clip it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt good the whole time, never oily or heavy or conversely &amp;#34;straw-like&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve read reports of while reading so many cleansing conditioner reviews.  </li>
            <li> I do have to cowash more frequently (every 2-3 days)</li>
            <li> Good packaging from the seller delivery was fast would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> and I still get my monies worth.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cowash so far.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair so soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li> I kept it in for about 15 minutes and then made sure to wash it out completely.</li>
            <li> I have waist length hair and was able to stretch it just as far as a set of bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It helps to maintain my healthy natural hair.</li>
            <li> most newly natural folks, I became a product junkie.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but now that I&#x27;ve used it I can say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This cowash worked very nicely, it left my hair so soft, and I have to say that I liked it much better than wen.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and I think my curls love this stuff because they are so bouncy afterwards</li>
            <li> but I am not too thrilled with the actual product for my hair.</li>
            <li> It was beautiful and past my shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> It smells incredible, it is of high quality from what I can tell, but it did not clean my hair to my satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> I use this once a week to really give my hair a nice deep clean.</li>
            <li> It came quick and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I learnt pretty quickly that shampoos, including sulfate-free ones, were a no-no for my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing,is light on my fine hair, makes it super soft, moisturized and really brings out my curls after a wash.</li>
            <li> My scalp feels clean but not stripped and my ends are soft and the smell is fantastic.</li>
            <li> it made my hair like super soft and easy to detangle... and I have 4b 4c hair..</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t get excited to shower with baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lost the receipt, so this one is going right in the trash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s right for Caucasians.</li>
            <li> So I clarify about once a month with baking soda and water and then immediately right after I do a clarifying wash with baking soda</li>
            <li> it is the right price at sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> but I am going to invest in this brand for that right now.</li>
            <li> started to use it right after my coloring.</li>
            <li> Right now I am using this along with Loreal evercreme cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> The price is defiantly right as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caucasian and didn&#x27;t know if this would be right for me, but it seems it is right for almost anyone.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think this is the right co-wash product for me.</li>
            <li> the comp just ran right through.</li>
            <li> The water runs right through to detangle without even the need of comb in the shower.</li>
            <li> Right amount of cleanser and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have a stockpile of it right now, because it seems anytime I find something I like, it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> The coconut cowash made my hair feel very clean, it very easily removed style buildup and my hair felt so soft after like i had just deep conditioned but no residue or buildup!  </li>
            <li> This morning my hair is very moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> I have found this product unusual because I am so use to soapy suds to clean.  </li>
            <li> Once it all washed out my hair was so clean and had so much volume.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who had such chemically damaged hair that she couldn&#x27;t even get a nice curl from a hot roller or curling iron.</li>
            <li> After the first month, I was done with my Honest shampoo and now only using the As I Am.</li>
            <li> but my hair really feels clean without the excess lather.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and LIGHT (anybody who has ever had build-up or a co-wash that didn&#x27;t get you quite clean enough will appreciate this) and OH-so-soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to comb and feels very soft.</li>
            <li> I tried this because my daughter has a little curl to her hair (and this makes her curls look AMAZING!)  </li>
            <li> I may continue to use it because the ingredients may be more gentle than regular shampoos, but calling it a cowash doesn&#x27;t really seem appropriate based on the results I had.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m pregnant again...and not only is the vinegar smell a bit overwhelming right now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this Coconut Cowash for awhile since I had read the great reviews here on Amazon and also on the Naturally Curly forums, but was worried that it would be too heavy for my fine, 2C waves.  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to get a brush or comb thru my hair without alot of conditioner after washing or even getting wet, even trying to run my fingers thru would pull out a hand full of hair using a reg conditioner,I could run my fingers thru this without taking any hair with it!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like shampoo.</li>
            <li> ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is geared more towards women with more typically African-American curls.</li>
            <li> Great smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out natural hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even use this between  normal washings with my sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a co wash product and it cleansed my hair after having 1 week worth of product buildup and ecostyler gel.</li>
            <li> But in general, AA hair needs more moisture than Middle-Eastern hair, and would match with this product better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ** dreadlocks, nice scent, and since it can replace shampoo and conditioner, it saves $$$ in the long run.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, shoulder length dark course hair with a fair amount of silver.  </li>
            <li> Coconut Cleansing Conditioner leaves my hair soft, sweet smelling, and clean.</li>
            <li> Love the price, wish it detangled a little better</li>
            <li> My first use of this in place of shampoo, followed by Aussie strong 3 minute miracle, my hair has NOT felt so soft and manageable in a loooong time!</li>
            <li> I have huge, huge, massive hair that has gone from frizz ball to a shiny mane.  </li>
            <li> Super gentle, conditioning and gets all the grit out.</li>
            <li> my hair is really soft easy to comb.</li>
            <li> Regardless of ethnicity, if you have dry, unruly hair, give this an honest try.  </li>
            <li> She has used this a couple of times now and her hair will now form nice soft looking curls and her naturally wavy hair is no longer frizzy and parched looking.</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick consistency which I love for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than others, but it gives great conditioning and slippage with shower comb outs.  </li>
            <li> after using it parts of my scalp would slightly burn it wasnt a good feelingat all.</li>
            <li> The consistency is smooth and creamy and it made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> If you use light, natural oils and leave-ins...Prepare to have your hair stripped!</li>
            <li> It cleanses my hair well and leaves it feeling smooth and nicely conditioned, not like some shampoo/conditioner sets that seem to leave my hair stiff and feeling fry.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clunk nor flake and it is very gentle to my 3b-3c type hair.</li>
            <li> almost a little too clean which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user from here on out -- I almost want to purchase 50 jars just to make sure I have years and years worth of product in case they ever go out of business!</li>
            <li> I can use just these two products for super simple and fast styling, or I can add a touch of my homemade pomade if I want to make it look a bit more textured.</li>
            <li> with thick hair, I go through this fairly quickly but overall, awesome.</li>
            <li> The main scent is coconut, but there is also a hint of citrus, and something sweet?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caucasion but I have long wavy hair that is very easily tangled</li>
            <li> Made my hair a little too greesy, but I can see it being good for hair</li>
            <li> and I just couldn&#x27;t handle my super dry, static hair anymore.</li>
            <li> my hair is super curly and dry and with this i am able to detangle my hair</li>
            <li> No frizzy, puffy ends and hardly any fly aways.</li>
            <li> No frizzy, puffy ends and hardly any fly aways.</li>
            <li> will  buy some  more  in the  future</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to cut my hair because after bleaching my hair, the ends were feeling pretty rugged.</li>
            <li> I do wind up putting extra conditioner on my ends after most of the time.</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this product</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is with the packaging -- a pump bottle would be so much better than this tub.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I will continue to give it the benefit of doubt as it is my first experience with this type of hair wash.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely soft, moist and obedient now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t clarify first...</li>
            <li> Once I placed this product on my hair, my hair instantly became more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> After rinsing the curls are very defined!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Cowash product and I definately like it better than the 1st I tried.</li>
            <li> I definitely like it better than the Dove oil care conditioner I had been using.</li>
            <li> This works really well!</li>
            <li> And for the first time in memory, I was able to run my fingers all the way back through my hair, like those girls do in the movies!  </li>
            <li> :/.... will be ordering more for myself and my mom :) ...</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different types of products.</li>
            <li> I have tried most of the cowash products out there, and this is definitely a winner.</li>
            <li> i add more cocunut oil to it for extra shine.</li>
            <li> This was my first product specifically made for cowashing</li>
            <li> If you are a person who likes her hair better the second or even third day after shampooing, you will like this product for sure.  </li>
            <li> I currently have TWO backups under my sink, so I can be sure not to run out.</li>
            <li> First I sprayed my hair with water and then added a silver amount to my 2 1/2 inch hair.</li>
            <li> When I first used this co wash in my hair, I had to get used to the coconut smell, because I&#x27;m not fond of coconuts.</li>
            <li> This magic potion instantly untangled my hair as I was combing through it.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try it first.</li>
            <li> This transformed my hair into exactly what I needed it to be.  </li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair a couple times the first time to remove all the product buildup(shampoos,conditioners, treatment, mousse, hairspray ,root lifters, and my hair is foil colored.</li>
            <li> I gave it away after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have asian hair that has been processed so many times.</li>
            <li> i ask hubby to pick up my favorite deep conditioner</li>
            <li> this was my first time using it.</li>
            <li> First time it was just \\&quot;ok\\</li>
            <li> I love this although I wash my hair with normal shampoo every now and then to refresh my hair because my hair is naturally oily.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more of the</li>
            <li> When I first bought it I had a lot of reservations because I&#x27;d heard this was either you &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I will not be repurchasing it don&#x27;t really find it worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay.</li>
            <li> Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use</li>
            <li> Although, I use this product to stretch my shampoo days more so than as my sole hair cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is the first as I am product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Possibly a bit more defined, moisturized curls but nothing to justify the cost.  </li>
            <li> I got my first hair cut at Deva Chan and used their pricey products for a while</li>
            <li> I was really interested in quitting shampoo cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I have insanely thick hair so its great when I can get a comb through it</li>
            <li> Once I stop using silicone based leave-in conditioners, I think I will be able to use this product as my only hair wash.</li>
            <li> , the only reason I am not giving it a five star is that I want to try it several more times, however, I must say, that I was really pleased with how it felt on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews on here and purchased this product- used it this morning for the first time</li>
            <li> Even when I used more it still didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; the next day.</li>
            <li> I went back to reg shampoo, but I had better results from diluting it with water and using a squeezy bottle.</li>
            <li> I have a combination of textures and mostly use this in the summer months only.</li>
            <li> I have never had to consistently use a hair cleansing product twice with every washing session.</li>
            <li> For the first 3 days, my hair felt sealed  and moisturized.</li>
            <li> seems like alot, especially when I can just use a conditioner that is in a more functional container.</li>
            <li> So when my first tub of this cowash was done, I decided to try the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus cowash.</li>
            <li> I love the product and use it as my only \\&quot;shampoo/conditioner\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Then I rinse it out, but be warned: if you don&#x27;t fully rinse it, your hair will be very oily!</li>
            <li> I have used up my first jar</li>
            <li> It smells great and definitely cleans your hair, but as far as repairing it, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> and it does not take much!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love is, when I wash it out my shower is so slippery</li>
            <li> Anyhow, this goop smells fabulous and leaves my skin and hair soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, straight, color-treated hair that I prefer to shampoo only once a week,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products because I&#x27;m new to the natural lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it weekly to cowash my hair, because I do the CGM (curly girl method) which includes no shampoo, because it tends to dry out our hair, especially African-American hair.</li>
            <li> However, my scalp never felt clean enough just using the co-wash to clean and felt itchy after 3.5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I guess, tho WEN has more healthy ingredients, the basic formula idea is the same, and (unlike the original WEN that I&#x27;ve finally purchased), this and the infomercial WEN list water and cetyl and cetearyl alcohols in the first four ingredients!  </li>
            <li> The cream smells really nice but other than that, I just do not like the way my scalp and hair feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> friendly leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My favourite thing about this product is how CLEAN but soft my hair feels after.</li>
            <li> I needed to use another conditioner afterwards, but my hair felt clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I woke up with clean, soft and springy coils.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft, conditioned *and* clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean and really soft.</li>
            <li> my scalp is squeaky clean and my hair is not dried out.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, clean and manageable.</li>
            <li> it rinses soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my hair got really clean and felt so soft and</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and clean for a week, even though I put leave in conditioner in it ever day.</li>
            <li> It leaves my scalp clean and the hair so soft and the breakage has lessened.</li>
            <li> I have locs, so it is more difficult to clean my scalp, but traditional shampoos do a great job, and this cowash didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that my hair does not feel super clean.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far, but I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Love this product it made my hair so soft to the touch and also did not tangle my natural 4c hair.  </li>
            <li> You can actually co-wash with any good conditoner and  get the same results.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and very fine and straight...</li>
            <li> Anyway, it actually got my hair clean and untangled in one shot!</li>
            <li> My hair was SUPER shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> New to this transitioning from relaxer to natural has led me in to becoming a product junkie.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product receives any positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have no idea where all these positive reviews are coming from.</li>
            <li> I have been using As I Am for 4 weeks now and even on 6 days without shampooing, my hair feels clean, not flat or greasy and smells fresh too.</li>
            <li> Honestly, as soon as I tried this product I was ready to chunk all of my other shampoos, conditioners, styling gels, etc.</li>
            <li> I used this, followed up with my favorite leave-in conditioner, moisturized and stretched my hair and then went to bed.</li>
            <li> has pretty much saved my hair.</li>
            <li> Well first of all it took so much of the product to cover my head.</li>
            <li> I love it and as long as I can get it at Sally&#x27;s, I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I use Wen, and wanted to use it on my daughter but its so expensive that I wanted to find a more economical way.</li>
            <li> the plus side, I love how clean the product is and how few toxic additives it has.</li>
            <li> This really made my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I am of Caucasian decent and have light brown, naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and not dry!</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to not having a lather when shampooing, but I really like how this leaves my hair and scalp feeling -- nice and clean, but not dried out; I seem to be having less breakage than before.  </li>
            <li> at about one third of the price as well as being available to purchase locally, I decided to at least try this alost two years ago and was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s more dry than mine.</li>
            <li> My hair is in between a coil and a deep wave and tends to tangle easily.  </li>
            <li> Massaged into the scalp it noticeably loosens any dandruff flaking and has a very slight cooling/tingling sensation that is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and will most likely use normal shampoo once a month from now on.</li>
            <li> Our hair is super shiny and soft and my curls are not frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Most shampoos and even conditioners completely dry out my scalp and give me flakey skin.</li>
            <li> really love the smell, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry and brittle after using it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make it super soft like advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I have extremely dry hair</li>
            <li> I do not recommend anyone use this product more then once a week because it may dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is I wish it would have more of a fragrant smell since it is a cowash product but other than that it was Great!</li>
            <li> I have tried others (L&#x27;Oreal, Ren Pure, Herbal Essence, etc) and like the results.</li>
            <li> Their hair seem to really respond positively to it as well.  </li>
            <li> So I may not have read the part about this product being created for African American ladies when I was looking for a no poo cleansing conditioner that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because I might not have tried it.</li>
            <li> But for my 3b curl, moderate moisture level, thick texture, and normal scalp it was excellent!</li>
            <li> Other washes I&#x27;ve tried leave a heavy residue, but this product works great and washes clean.</li>
            <li> I am a 60+ year old male with very fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> It looked fine the next day as well.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dry afterwards really in need of a good deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I love that it does not dry out my hair like shampoo, and it keeps my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I used enough to mound on my palm, rubbed it quickly into my hair, and rinsed it right out.  </li>
            <li> I do have pretty long hair and even though it&#x27;s fine textured, I have alot of it</li>
            <li> (thyroid condition) hair that likes some protein (not too too much) and has fine and medium strands mixed.</li>
            <li> As an adult, my hair has been kind of coarse, kind of wavy, and when short and in humidity, curly, but not good-curly but bad-curly, dry, haystack, and sometimes (when I want it wavy or curly) straight, but not good-straight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing a long term transition from relaxed to natural and this makes my hair moisturized and very easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;my\\&quot; hair with plenty of slip, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped which is good because it prevents extra drying for hair that is already very dry.</li>
            <li> I have 4a-4b textured hair so finding a good product that helps me manage my hair is hard to find.</li>
            <li> : No matter what you put in your hair, it can be thee very best in the world, if I don&#x27;t get it stuck in my head that I have to trim my dead ends off every few weeks or so in order to see improvement in my hair texture and growth</li>
            <li> But over all it was easy to detangle my hair and it kept it clean without the harsh sulfates.  </li>
            <li> This product cleans my hair very well without drying it out, but it doesn&#x27;t really help me much with detangling.</li>
            <li> I use this to cowash my transitioning hair, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in using regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it didnt do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> Strips my hair too much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much slip</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> experience with the product was promising.</li>
            <li> Really marketing people??</li>
            <li> Really marketing people??</li>
            <li> so I really though I would like this product, but for some reason it seems to make my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> I used about 3 mini scoops with 2 fingers (my hair comes up to the top part of my boobs) and distributed that into my roots/scalp and used a wide tooth comb.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really wanting to purchase</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m spoiled by another &#x27;co-wash&#x27; that makes my hair wavier, so that may be why I didn&#x27;t like this as much.  </li>
            <li> I really like what it did to my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a lot of co-washes out there, but nothing really hits the spot for my 3B curls like this.</li>
            <li> Makes my curls much easier to manage and style</li>
            <li> I have very coarse/kinky hair</li>
            <li> and this moisturizes it very well without leaving it too greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and highlighted.</li>
            <li> still use a conditioner after using this, but may not even need to since it really does cleanse and moisturize so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> I have straight caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> For me not so much, I refuse to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> the As I Am gel, which I also highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair isnt as frizzy and I dont have to wash it as much.</li>
            <li> It smells really good,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this co-wash!</li>
            <li> Hair does feel much softer and smoother and looks healthier</li>
            <li> I use it weekly as well as the cleanser and intense conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This thing stripped my hair so much it felt like seaweed</li>
            <li> I had to use soo much of my joico conditioner...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got coily 3c curls that really need moisture</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thicker than Eden&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Smooths on well, very thick&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> and I really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really cleans your hair and leaves</li>
            <li> arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> and it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with it being in a jar either</li>
            <li> It left my hair silky smooth and cleansed my scalp without stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> It has never had that much shine or volume without a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/b hair with blond highlights and for me this turned out to be too drying and it wasn&#x27;t smooth and slippery enough for detangling.</li>
            <li> So much moisture in my hair now.  </li>
            <li> I really like this for washing my hair when used in conjunction with my leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> As I Am cowash is a gentle way of cleansing your hair.  </li>
            <li> It gently cleanses my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> much cheaper than walmart</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> Gentle</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product - it is affordable, obtainable (got it at RiteAid),</li>
            <li> Also, does not smell much like coconut.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> but you have to get the whole head</li>
            <li> I took the plunge and purchased this product and much to everyone&#x27;s surprise</li>
            <li> and I also use the leave-in conditioner, which you don&#x27;t need much of...mostly just on the ends.  </li>
            <li> Pass on this one and go straight for the stuff with the three-letter name that rhymes with &amp;#34;Pen.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Really would.</li>
            <li> I really like to Co-Wash my hair using this product.</li>
            <li> is that it&#x27;s very soupy.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair very well, leaves no residue, and detangles.</li>
            <li> (They really should put this product in a dispenser pump bottle).</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Detangling was an absolute breeze.</li>
            <li> It really is medicine for your hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely lovvvvvve this Co wash</li>
            <li> This is going straight from the shower to the bin.</li>
            <li> For real.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair feel very moisturized</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my scalp, but hair doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Really like the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This co-wash is an absolute keeper.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely refuse to spend so much money on a product that I would probably burn through in a week because I believe, according to the directions on WEN, I would have had to use 20+ pumps each time I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> but I like the tub because I can get to the very bottom instead of having to take a pump off and bang the bottle to get the remainder of the product out.</li>
            <li> but I like the tub because I can get to the very bottom instead of having to take a pump off and bang the bottle to get the remainder of the product out.</li>
            <li> Then once I massaged it all over it didn&#x27;t really detangle my hair well.</li>
            <li> and my hair was very tangled.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> , then rince really well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now, my hair really like.  </li>
            <li> I hope this is real -</li>
            <li> I shook my head as much as I could to remove any excess water in the shower</li>
            <li> I leave the cowash in my hair almost the whole time I&#x27;m in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I really did not need to wash it yet</li>
            <li> Did I use too much?  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t require much</li>
            <li> AS I Am products has really made a difference in the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought a gentle anti-dandruff shampoo although I don&#x27;t have dandruff, and massaged it on my scalp and rinsed.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating and can be used as a cowash or a conditioner.</li>
            <li> lasted about a month but her thin dammaged hair looked great</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> , i have a whole lot of hair, and i used this jar twice..</li>
            <li> My hair was tangle-free and very manageable.</li>
            <li> If I catch it on sale, I buy as much as I can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now it is much easier to manage and when I straighten it it&#x27;s shiny</li>
            <li> Was much easier to detangle.  </li>
            <li> made my hair very course and tangled.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of sulfate free shampoos that would have given me the same results.  </li>
            <li> I Am\\&quot; products as well for much cheaper than what I saw on here.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I heard so much about it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using the curly girl method this product is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made to clarify just a gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5, because I do not like it that much as a co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My joico is the absolute bestl</li>
            <li> It doesnt give me much slip.</li>
            <li> this really didn&#x27;t come close to hitting the mark.  </li>
            <li> but just really didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s available locally, Amazon sells it at a lower price.  </li>
            <li> The whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use the whole thing with one wash.</li>
            <li> I tried everything after the salon fried my hair and this has really helped repair my hair.</li>
            <li> I have caucasian hair, baby fine, stick straight and usually pretty dry.</li>
            <li> Of course this was much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I found it to leave my hair much heavier though.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I didn&#x27;t think that this stuff would work in my hair, but I was wrong, so far its the best product that I have tried out of a store.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cowash but everyone&#x27;s hair is different!!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and love how it makes my hair bouncy and supper soft.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more products in the near future from As I Am.</li>
            <li> I have a good brush and was using an expensive shampoo and conditioner that were both sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Smell is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Good grief this stuff smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells good, not too thick or greasy, and after using it, I immediately noticed my hair felt lighter and softer.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> My hair smellled grea and was so soft!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all, I&#x27;m a a 3a white-girl, and I did get some odd looks from the cashier at Sally&#x27;s when purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have a problem with Wen in the first place, I&#x27;m just a hair product hoarder and wanted to try something new).</li>
            <li> I watched some youtube videos to get some clear instructions regarding co-washing because I had heard that if you didn’t do it right your hair ended up being greasy.</li>
            <li> The price is right and the ingredients seem to be natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to comb out after washing with the product, but once my hair is dry, I&#x27;d say I still have potential for frizzies, but I use another product to smooth out the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have long curly caucasian hair that tangles easily and gets matted.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a wide-toothed comb easily through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long, straight, and fine</li>
            <li> But there are other cowashes I like better.</li>
            <li> Took a while for my hair to be ok with washing it every other day, and now I try to was it once</li>
            <li> I checked the ingredient list and verified my suspicions that it contained silicones (if you are familiar with the curly girl method this is a big no no).</li>
            <li> I rather found other products that work much better.  </li>
            <li> Feels and smells great, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i also dont know if it is better than other co washes i use.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers here, I am im</li>
            <li> In the ORIGINAL WEN there are no alcohols starting out with water</li>
            <li> I had to load my hair with other conditioners just to be able to run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> and I also just dont trust most other companies ingredients.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest they switch to a squeeze bottle or pump with a large nozzle, instead.</li>
            <li> so the scent is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thick and creamy, so it&#x27;s easy to work into the hair to finger comb and untangle, and avoids waste.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a jar so no waste!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, straight and limp and very oily.  </li>
            <li> I have baby fine dry wavy white girl hair and this is THE only conditioning cleanser that makes my hair feel wonderful, lush and moisturized without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I left this stuff on my hair for about 5-10 minutes and afterwards my hair was SO clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> Zig zags, curls, spirals, straight, fine yet dry, moiture-resistant and</li>
            <li> My hair before using this: long wavy and fine, dreads when I sleep and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use enough of it, I don&#x27;t get that clean feeling</li>
            <li> product turned out to be exactly what I was looking for, it leaves my hair feeling clean and bouncy, it removes the access products I use to style and maintain my hair without leaving it dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It simply did not leave my hair clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not natural so maybe its better for natural girls?</li>
            <li> I felt clean hair-wise and not utterly stripped like some poos can feel.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running low for a nice long while.  </li>
            <li> Bought it tonight at a local drug store for half the price of what I found here (thanks to the tip of another reviewer) and, while Coconut Cowash did the job, it didn&#x27;t make my colored/damaged/caucasian hair feel good.  </li>
            <li> I love using this when I am going to style my hair down because it makes it very non-frizzy.</li>
            <li> chose this product not only for the hype, but also because it has three surfactants...2 cationic and 1 non-ionic surfactants which are not great cleaners (they won&#x27;t be able to dissolve large oil/grease particles) since their primary functions are &amp;#34;conditioners&amp;#34;, but they clean.</li>
            <li> Right now, I only use hot water to cleanse my hair.</li>
            <li> The texture isn&#x27;t thick and a little really goes along way, and the smell is just wonderful!</li>
            <li> I had been using a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner combo, and my hair was still very unmanageable and dry.</li>
            <li> Left my hair clean with a decent scent.</li>
            <li> Only thing is, depending on how much hair you have the jar can run out quick.</li>
            <li> Like WEN I kept my hair wet till it was completely worked in, clipped it up on top of my head and left it in while I bathed, then rinsed again very thoroughly till my hair felt clean...</li>
            <li> After about a month of using it, I can definitely see a more shiny hair and my hair tips are not dry, so I don&#x27;t have to smother my hair in a ton of oil every day.</li>
            <li> Very tight-cork screw type curls on the bottom half, and loser curls on the top.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s as AMAZING as people make it seem, but if you have wavy, curly or coily hair, you will notice a difference in not using shampoo period, regardless of if you use this product or another conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I am not completely shampoo free - I have to shampoo about once a week (with a suflate-free), and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am an African American woman with natural hair that ranges from 3b to 4a and this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It takes about 45 minutes to dry it and because it is so fine</li>
            <li> I have consistently used 2 containers so far</li>
            <li> it normally just looks really frizzy with no defined curl pattern.</li>
            <li> It is not bad enough to return so I will finish it.  </li>
            <li> Once I had washed the product completely off, I was expecting to find my hair dry and brittle but was very pleasantly surprised to find my hair was very soft and it smelled really nice.</li>
            <li> As i am co wash is not my first experience with a cleansing conditioner: for several months I was a fan of the Hair One Argan oil cleansing conditioner which was great but left me with a little bit of product build up.</li>
            <li> I have a mix of fine and coarse hair along with extremely sensitive skin and almost every shampoo causes my scalp to itch and have dandruff.  </li>
            <li> product may work for thicker hair, however I do not recommend it for naturally curly fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> makes my wave more of a defined curl without frizzy ends and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I have full highlights, fine Caucasian hair that has been straightened with keratin and is past BS length.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve found my new hair care solution!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use this product as a leave in my hair look fluffy in a healthy and full of volume on top of my thick head of hair .Why</li>
            <li> When I first big chopped, my hair was super, super dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on my second jar for a few reasons: my curls are super soft and bouncy after using it, it makes my hair shinier and healthier looking than the competition and my curls dry beautifully.</li>
            <li> and when it was completely dry I could tell a HUGE difference in the way it looked.</li>
            <li> and when it was completely dry I could tell a HUGE difference in the way it looked.</li>
            <li> jar packaging allows for easy spilling and when used In  the shower ; the water can sometimes get in the product even when placed fairly distant from the running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fantastic to use a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> And I agree that a pump bottle would be more practical and less prone to mishaps.  </li>
            <li> Less is more</li>
            <li> this is the first product in my entire life that I have used that did exactly what I needed, it conditioned my hair and allowed me to easily comb my wet hair without ripping any out</li>
            <li> I figured the jar of the coconut co wash would barely last a few weeks but surprisingly after a month I still have more than half of the product</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is on the cheaper end of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, and goes for more or less $10 wherever you get it.</li>
            <li> ok, however if you tend to have an oily scalp, you&#x27;ll likely need to use this product daily.</li>
            <li> I quickly realized that with curly hair, you just have to find a product that works for you because no one product works the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mainly a coconut like smell to it.</li>
            <li> When first starting to cowash I was upset because my hair was greasy the first rinse.</li>
            <li> I actually like this better than Wen even if it were the same price.  </li>
            <li> Next I tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s and while better they are also double the price!</li>
            <li> My hair feels greasy the next day after using even when I made sure to rinse properly after application.</li>
            <li> (the container is too big for a shower caddy) while you put the cowash in your hair, and then put the top back on it so water does not splash in it .</li>
            <li> and I only had to apply a little more than a palm full of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> and she was able to go 2-3 days between washes without looking like a greasy mess.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product, the only shampoo I use to help restore super dry brittle hair.. it really brings your hair back to life!</li>
            <li> Plus it gives my hair a tad more length since the curls are moisturized and not so tight.  </li>
            <li> Then I did some research and found this product highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone who is considering transitioning out of shampoo, with curly hair, or both.</li>
            <li> Eden is now a staple of mine and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this co-washing product for any hair type.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend viewing the WEN product training video before use, because this is the technique I use when \\&quot;washing\\&quot; my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Lastly, my hair was left feeling and looking very clean.</li>
            <li> I am a white woman with very fine, curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> hair seemed fine wet</li>
            <li> Honestly, I chose this product over some other cleansing conditioners in the same price range because of the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> I have to use a little more than I thought to detangle my hair, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!  </li>
            <li> All I can say is WoW!!</li>
            <li> Left my haif feelig clean and soft.</li>
            <li> While it cleans well, but it caused my hair to break and was not as easy to comb out as other cleansing conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li> It also removed all other product build up and washed out easy.</li>
            <li> I wanted chemical free, or very limited chemical products, so I came across this one day on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I smoothed it on my natural hair, relaxed hair, and scalp, rubbing gently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick at all which is what I like my conditioners to be since I have coily hair</li>
            <li> lol we&#x27;re never happy with our hair!</li>
            <li> and I then washed some of it of and my hair was clean and bouncy; it didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its gentle and hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> and this really helps keep the area clear.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> This product really minimizes frizz &amp; keeps her curls bouncy &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> This co-wash leaves the hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair naturally</li>
            <li> It really feels like it is repairing my hair, and letting my natural curls feel</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair perfectly clean but not at all dry.  </li>
            <li> It was very moisturizing and never dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to use it a few more times to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> ♦ Left my hair feeling like product over load, I &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; my hair with this co-wash after a weeks worth of product build-up.</li>
            <li> Or many products can be too heavy and make it greasy...</li>
            <li> was long lasting :)...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different co-washes now on my wavy, somewhat course hair and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, I normally re-apply a bit as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will most def by their products for that problem, they have a few to choose from, cant wait,</li>
            <li> I am on the fence with this product as I think it dried my hair out more than offering the moistue of a cowash that I was looking for for my 4b/4c</li>
            <li> I kind of look like a greasy, drowned cat after I use it, no matter how long I wash it out for.</li>
            <li> but after using only this in the shower and the Loreal EverCreme leave-in spray I found out I can get natural full bodied waves when air drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I treat it like a normal shampoo</li>
            <li> I have type 4a naturally curly hair and expected more as far as detangling.  </li>
            <li> I found this product dried my hair out even more</li>
            <li> Normally I would just stick to one line</li>
            <li> The fragrance was nice and it was thick.  </li>
            <li> This product is good, but not great.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long but getting damaged at the ends, so I wanted something that was less drying and more gentle on it.</li>
            <li> This pot lasts me a month and a half, keeps my hair silky and clean!</li>
            <li> It is expensive on Amazon, but I live on an island with no stores, so just happy</li>
            <li> When I opened container product was missing seal that most NEW hair products have, in order to keep product in the container and fresh.(When</li>
            <li> I only left the co-wash on for five minutes and it washed out so easily.</li>
            <li> It left my hair super soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that this product makes my hair bigger and frizzier, like my hair is stripped and in need of a strong deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d have to wait for new hair to grow in for my head to look normal again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful price (DAILY FIX is pricey and Jessicurl&#x27;s got more expensive recently, both more expensive than this product.)</li>
            <li> Wonderful price (DAILY FIX is pricey and Jessicurl&#x27;s got more expensive recently, both more expensive than this product.)</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that I have to use a very generous amount in order to clean my scalp and still have enough to work it through all of my hair to condition the ends.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to slam it, because it could very well work for anybody with different hair, but if you&#x27;re biracial or white ethnic, it&#x27;s most likely going to be too</li>
            <li> She finally tried it last night and all she could do was rave about how good her hair felt, how she was able to actually finger comb through one particular tough tangle and</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean, but not completely stripped of all the natural oils.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and tends to split at the ends and gets dried out if I shampoo too much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy to get water in the jar which in turns waters down the product.</li>
            <li> My new go to.</li>
            <li> &amp; I live in South Florida-</li>
            <li> Plus I live in the desert</li>
            <li> The scent is not my style but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger, so I can live with it.</li>
            <li> (I live in drought-stricken LA).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s officially my new hair cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is my new staple.</li>
            <li> but this is something new I have tried weekly</li>
            <li> and I live in Florida, so</li>
            <li> my new must have.</li>
            <li> Nothing new</li>
            <li> think I have found my new co wash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is my new product line.</li>
            <li> After using this co-wash, her hair is easy to comb out and has less frizz.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked shiny, felt really clean, had body, and looked almost partially straightened.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked shiny, felt really clean, had body, and looked almost partially straightened.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I did with similar products, and my hair has really improved in terms of brittleness, dryness, etc since using this.  </li>
            <li> My daughter suggested I use cowash to clean my natural hair, which is colored, dry and breaking.</li>
            <li> But, seriously -- my hair feels so nice.  </li>
            <li> It also rinses off easily, which is a big plus because it speeds up my shower time (when you have a 3 year old yelling for mommy outside the bathroom door, time is of the essence!)</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> Those with sensitive skin, beware that coconut oil is highly comedogenic (pore blocking).  </li>
            <li> Co-wash leaves my hair feeling soft and moist and I would highly recommend it for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes my 4C hair feel very soft and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
            <li> It cleanses all the gel that I use in my hair and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> The one thing I can say about this product is that it did make my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels lighter but not stripped, very soft.</li>
            <li> This products makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very soft</li>
            <li> As soon as I apply this to my hair it becomes very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It removes the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; and leaves your hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> and it had my hair very soft manageable lots and lots of slip detangling was a breeze for me</li>
            <li> and it felt very soft with no frizz which is a miracle for my hair and the humidity here in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Also it left my hair very, very shiny.  </li>
            <li> When I applied the product to my hair, it made it feel moist and very soft.</li>
            <li> then Aloe Vera gel, Glycerin, then jump right in to the natural extracts starting with chamomile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to as far as the process of washing your hair, because it obviously doesn&#x27;t lather, but its amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have long blonde, baby-fine hair that breaks easily at the ends.</li>
            <li> It left my hair clean, soft and manageable, not like some shampoos that leave your hair clean but harsh that you need a conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I had to do a month of hot oil treatments 2x a week to get the moisture back in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I can remember that I had actual CURLS in my hair after a shower.</li>
            <li> As a past WEN user, I have to say I equally love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> but maybe that&#x27;s because I did a hot oil treatment prior to applying the coconut cowash.</li>
            <li> I normally have when air drying my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> A bottle with a pump or small spout would be much better to dispense this while washing your hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it because it doesn&#x27;t take the coloring out of her hair as quickly as a similar, much more expensive and better known product.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and already purchased a second of</li>
            <li> so I am constantly using different detanglers and deep conditioners trying to make my hair more manageable and easier to comb out when i get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> After the first use i definitely could feel a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for permed heads but, for this natural head of coils and curls, this stuff works wonders!</li>
            <li> I work recommend this product to NATURAL HEADS HEAD!</li>
            <li> I also am sensitive to chemical heavy products and wanted something more natural.  </li>
            <li> Epic stuff!</li>
            <li> It leaves it cleansed, soft and MOISTURIZED!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past, but like so many others, I couldn&#x27;t afford to stay with it.</li>
            <li> This was my first cowash specific purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Great, natural product!</li>
            <li> Such a difference from that first usage.</li>
            <li> I first bought this off a sale rack at the local beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> The hairdresser told me about this product a year ago, and I have used only this since the first time I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I love this item so much, I already order a second jar since I have to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I do not appreciate purchasing items solicited as NEW, when product was received with self-printed label marked NEW.</li>
            <li> My hair had been breaking off at the ends and super dry ever since I decided to go natural a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with long, fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> (I used enough to make my hair feel like I could run my fingers through it - and remember, I have a LOT of long fine hair -</li>
            <li> The product is light and does not weigh your hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine and lately thinning hair.</li>
            <li> The very first use and my hair was as dry as straw!</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, my hair stayed clean between washings.</li>
            <li> It is extremely moisturizing without being greasy and still gets my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and her hair is thick and medium grade.</li>
            <li> smells yummy, like tropical fruit and coconut, without being cloyingly sweet, and the scent lingers just a little without much</li>
            <li> I use it in my 6-yr olds long naturally curly hair and her hair is always super soft and tropically smelling when you get close to her, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I never cowashed before until I became natural and let me tell you, cowashing is my new thing.</li>
            <li> I have curly, tangly hair, and buy a new brand of shampoo/conditioner every time i finish my old bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to being natural (this month marks a year) and it&#x27;s been a struggle trying to find products that work well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Not that her hair is less important, but she&#x27;s 3 and</li>
            <li> It does work to clean hair (mine gets particularly oily) but it left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Smells far too strong and left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I used about a palm and a half for my whole head (natural kinky 3c/4a hair, just past shoulders) and I loved it.</li>
            <li> sectioned two tiny sections and used each product on their own small section.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it out with cold water my hair felt nice and full and bouncy.</li>
            <li> she used it last night for the first time and her hair is so soft and silky looking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is normally a product for ethnic hair, but it works wonders on my straight, \\&quot;white girl\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice , a little goes a long ways and it makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy hair and a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I scooped out the product and made sure I got it on my entire scalp and worked it all the way down to my ends.</li>
            <li> As I Am is a really good styling tool, it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out or make it hard or brittle.</li>
            <li> The WEN from the infomercials, I&#x27;ve only just recently learned that that isn&#x27;t the original formula and not nearly as good, but the REAL WEN isn&#x27;t a Prime item and is a little more expensive unless you buy the huge 32 oz bottles, and I was out and broke, so I read all sorts of reviews till my eyes crossed and decided to risk this to see if anyone had come up with a good conditioning cleanser without the WEN prices!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only downside to this product is, predictably, it takes quite a bit to be able to get clean, especially on long hair.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;llbe transferring it to an old WEN bottle!)be transferring it to an old WEN bottle!)</li>
            <li> If you have natural hair and you use natural products on your hair you know about the build up!</li>
            <li> And I have true African American hair that is natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like products that have an overpowering sweet or any other flavor of smell.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry damaged hair , I tried daily cowashing with this big difference in shedding and manageability of my thick hair!</li>
            <li> I then brushed the product through the hair with a wide tooth comb, (which was easy to to do) and I placed my hair up with a clip</li>
            <li> and since I leave it in a good while in a bath it drops down my neck in front and back and found that my skin on my neck and decolette had some pink splotches on them,</li>
            <li> It is actually trying to curl again (versus looking more wavy like it has been lately), is less frizzy, and feels really soft.</li>
            <li> to my hair, first, I&#x27;m white with long very fine thick straight silky hair.  </li>
            <li> but I am a little perplexed with their packaging choice.</li>
            <li> Then on top of that it only requires a little bit to be applied.</li>
            <li> it matters, my hair is mostly 3C with a little 4A mixed in.  </li>
            <li> It was hard for me to figure out whether or not this would be appropriate for me</li>
            <li> I must say that if your hair is easily weighed down or it is not dry this might not be an option for you.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft with extremely defined curls.</li>
            <li> -in-all it was a huge waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Even though it isn&#x27;t a shampoo with no suds, I still feel like my scalp is moisturized and clear of product build-up.  </li>
            <li> Used this several times so far and really like it.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist was skeptical and she has told me my hair hasn&#x27;t been in such great shape as it is now.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the havoc this item had done, even when rinsed out completely and my all time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been 100% natural with a TWA for six months now.  </li>
            <li> My hair is moisturized and so soft that I do not need to use conditioner.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels soft to the touch and responds well to the products that I use afterward.</li>
            <li> Dickey informs curly girls not to use foaming/sudsing shampoos as they are very drying and potentially damaging to the hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so soft and no need for using shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am a white woman with straight hair.</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl with 3B hair texture.</li>
            <li> and I can really feel the difference between the co-wash and regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft, silky, and manageable.</li>
            <li> I put mine in an old conditioner bottle for shower use and find that it is a lot easier to handle that way.</li>
            <li> I ended up using this on my son&#x27;s hair whose now 8m old.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s ingredients aren&#x27;t as natural as As I Am....</li>
            <li> Also, I prefer to deep condition rather than cowash; that infuses my hair with so much moisture.</li>
            <li> I have dense, natural afro-textured curly/kinky hair (4b/4c).</li>
            <li> contains mostly natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I regret this decision being as though i have been Natural for 7 years</li>
            <li> , i would recommend it to people who might night have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I can go 4 days without washing my hair and it does not get greasy any faster than with my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> Keeps my natural curls soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I used the co-wash for my virgin hair extensions and my natural hair both are so silky soft.</li>
            <li> I when I straighten my hair both my extensions and natural hair were so soft</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> The cowash cleans your hair and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day as well.</li>
            <li> So far I do like it.  </li>
            <li> her hair is soft, but not appreciably softer than using a lot of OTC conditioners and / or a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 3c/4a coily natural who has up until now abused my hair with sulfates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned my lesson after trial and error and learned about this product from another natural friend.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s naturally curly.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> When I washed it out afterwards, my hair felt so soft</li>
            <li> I used this product because I am a product junkie for natural hair.</li>
            <li> two washes and my hair is completely transformed.</li>
            <li> it makes it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This cleans without a lot of suds and my hair remains soft.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been going natural for about 2 years</li>
            <li> IT has a well-balanced texture and leaves my hair soft and well-moisturized.</li>
            <li> At the time I was transitioning from relaxed hair (I am now fully natural again).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleans natural hair well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleans natural hair</li>
            <li> After using it this afternoon my hair has done a complete 180.</li>
            <li> My husband kept playing with it as it&#x27;s so soft.</li>
            <li> This will leave your hair soft as silk.</li>
            <li> I am a 4b-4c natural with shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> My hair after cowashing with this was so moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> it helps keep my nappy hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> If you have naturally oily hair, that has to be washed often, then this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed hair to natural and I am a year already</li>
            <li> So soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft curls.</li>
            <li> I got this from Sally&#x27;s I&#x27;m newly natural with 3C-4B hair</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> and I also love coconut and never liked the scent of the almond mint WEN</li>
            <li> WEN because of all the natural ingredients...</li>
            <li> MATURE</li>
            <li> I think I speak for our entire family when I say we highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It has always had a natural tendency to tangle and mat.  </li>
            <li> It made it really soft and detangled-because its a conditioner, and thats what conditioners do.</li>
            <li> and I was very presently surprised when I used</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is a P.C. version of the old Prell shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have asian straight hair</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and managable</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Hispanic with curly hair &amp; my curls are bouncy &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b type natural hair</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li> Neither brand has all natural ingredients either.</li>
            <li> I really think I have finally found my holy grail hair product line!</li>
            <li> natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Since I have started using this, my hair has been so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair completely natural since September 2012.</li>
            <li> The product made my natural hair feel brittle and it doesn&#x27;t have a slip.</li>
            <li> but let&#x27;s see if it works with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural , so this is a product that I use on myself.</li>
            <li> I am a 3c/4a natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products for my natural hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and alcohol</li>
            <li> Two days in, my hair is soft to the touch and it feels well nourished.</li>
            <li> never did a cowash on my natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and is not tangled after the wash.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, natural is best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really surprised me -</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this cleanses and tames frizz.</li>
            <li> The underneath is natural.</li>
            <li> My hair has natural wave.</li>
            <li> No harsh smells.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my 7 yr old and my 13 month old.</li>
            <li> Later when styling my hair I had to add so much product to make my hair look presentable.</li>
            <li> When I use this along with the  hydration elation, my hair feels so soft, moisturized, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Just wow.  </li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m the frizzy-haired step sister.</li>
            <li> Received when expected...great product for natural hair.</li>
            <li> They do work well to moisturize curly and wavy hair and to make it soft.</li>
            <li> When I use this my hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> my hair has been so soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is bleached/highlighted and naturally wavy/curly and tends to look frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair silky soft and cleaned without stripping.</li>
            <li> Also on my granddaughters natural hair</li>
            <li> , my naturally curly, fuzzy hair has never been shiny.</li>
            <li> I use just as much as Wen and the same method.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my soft curls.</li>
            <li> soft touchable curls..</li>
            <li> but my hair never felt this soft or moisturized after using Tresemme (I would have frizz and dryness).</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft when done.</li>
            <li> I use this, and their leave-in-conditioner, nearly every day on my &amp;#34;multicultural hair&amp;#34; - shoulder length curly 2a/b.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft when rinsed.</li>
            <li> I also have psoriasis on my scalp, so I use a natural dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li> you have naturally oily hair, I recommend this as a CONDITIONER rather than a co-wash.</li>
            <li> and I found that my hair wasn&#x27;t really soft or detangled after using it.</li>
            <li> This product completely destroyed my  hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> I went natural almost a year now</li>
            <li> It is soft and curly again.  </li>
            <li> So I have been wearing my hair natural for a while</li>
            <li> and I am still learning all of the in and outs of about caring for AA natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my natural  hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a natural curls journey since 2009 (after years of blow-drying that damaged my hair).</li>
            <li> I have medium thickness, 4a type of natural hair</li>
            <li> I finally picked it up locally a few weeks ago, and I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I Am leave-in conditioner and my hair was left much more manageable even after it dried.</li>
            <li> (what some would call 4a, but I hate the hair typing system) and I find those conditioners work best for it.</li>
            <li> No complaints, not sure if I will buy again... have to try it a few more times, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Does not have the detangling power of Wen, BUT I love that the formula is not as thick as Wen.  </li>
            <li> hair is normal to a bit oily, but after using a certain shampoo, my hair became extremely dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> My hair looks shiny and frizz free without looking oily or stiff.</li>
            <li> My hair was left completely stripped, and I had to use my new Giovanni 2Chic moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (Which worked wonders!)</li>
            <li> I have a short layered bob but my hair is super frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair actually feeling clean, unlike other &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; that leave behind their own residue instead of getting rid of existing residue.  </li>
            <li> This works really well on my naturally curly grey hair.  </li>
            <li> (Which has been everyday since buying it, because I have either classes, work or church to go to and like my hair to be clean).  </li>
            <li> But my main issue with this produce is every time I use it my scalp is left itching.</li>
            <li> I just would like it more if it were in a squeeze bottle due to its EXTREMELY runny nature.</li>
            <li> It smelled fairly decent but it didn&#x27;t moisturize as deeply as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and have very dry, frizzy &amp; unruly very wavy hair.... and lots of it!  </li>
            <li> so, either I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to something in the almond mint WEN, or WEN in general (God forbid!)  </li>
            <li> Oh, another major plus: natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Once I washed the product out, I dried with a special hair towel for curls that is not ruff on the hair.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t think I needed to do my usual deep condition after washing with this because my hair was soooooo soft; not like &amp;#34;eww there is a product sitting on top of my hair&amp;#34; soft, but a &amp;#34;cuticles are laid, honey&amp;#34; soft.</li>
            <li> No other styling products needed!</li>
            <li> Since using this cowash instead of shampoo, my hair is so much softer and doesn&#x27;t go frizzy if I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> and it held the water in alot longer and was moiturized and super soft once it dried, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, long, and super dry from going from black to platinum ash blonde and this co wash along with phytos 7 leave in cond.</li>
            <li> My hair dried with no frizz and into super soft waves.</li>
            <li> After hearing mostly great reviews and a few negative reviews from 3c hair naturals I decided to give it a try since it was only $6.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a long time for something that really works.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with long, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair yesterday and saw no negative effects from prior use of this co-wash.</li>
            <li> I have normal to oily hair, so it has taken me a while to read and actually decide to try co-washing.</li>
            <li> few weeks later I saw a jar of this in a drugstore, and it was actually cheaper ($8)</li>
            <li> But just fyi, natural doesn&#x27;t always mean gentle, during my first wash with the new WEN</li>
            <li> The first brand left my hair dry, so I was pleasantly surprised to find &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; did not.  </li>
            <li> The product should be in a shampoo bottle so it can be easily used in the shower, It&#x27;s hard to scoop the product out, figure out where you are going to place it in the shower</li>
            <li> , I sort of want to feel a bit pampered in the shower (especially after the new baby comes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and just recently stopped when I tried the new</li>
            <li> My scalp gets dry, flaky&amp;itchy so much</li>
            <li> As I rinsed my hair out and was ready to dry, I could hear my hair squeek when I ran my fingers through it,</li>
            <li> But by the end of the week my hair was dry again, and no matter how much leave in conditioner I applied, it kept breaking off.</li>
            <li> I found it really did that well and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like a dry cloth, still had moisture in it.</li>
            <li> so I have to give it a few more tries.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip it of its natural oils which is key since I&#x27;m going natural.</li>
            <li> is a very conditioning cleanser, however I find it difficult to use, there isn&#x27;t the same slip with regular conditioners that make it easy to use the wide tooth comb in the shower, with this, it doesn&#x27;t quite go through as easily.  </li>
            <li> in the future, this may very well replace my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> , very moisturizing.we follow up with our regular conditioner, leave in, and essential oils.</li>
            <li> and I do not have thick or hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> The AS I AM was easy to apply, a little goes a long way, and you get quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair very soft</li>
            <li> slip and moisturizes like no other.  </li>
            <li> and there is simply no other that can moisturize like Wen.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day by first sectioning my hair in 4 parts.  </li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think that a product other than shampoo could cleanse my scalp and leave it moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hair has major oily problems</li>
            <li> The only problem for me is that it is a little too rich to use all the time.  </li>
            <li> No other products.</li>
            <li> No other conditioner has ever done this.  </li>
            <li> It definately made my hair soft and silky, but two days after co-washing it, it felt kind of dirty which doesn&#x27;t normally happen when I wash using shampoo.</li>
            <li> The only other product I used in addition a day later from my wash was black castor oil on my scalp (another amazing product).</li>
            <li> I am not sure if maybe it&#x27;s cause my hair is too dry and maybe needs more treatment for me to thoroughly judge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly noticed an overall improvement in my hair (which has been really dry lately)</li>
            <li> The rinse off is clean and soft, Not slick and heavy as I expected.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair, place a large scoop on my head and work it in, then comb it through, let it sit for a while 5-10 minutes and wash out.  </li>
            <li> But if I use a lighter shampoo every so often in between, this keeps my hair soft but not flat, shiny but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but definatly worth it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is by no means healthy in one shower, but seriously, it looks totally different!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few washes, but it does clean which I was concerned about.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit more effort than the average conditioner, but this isn&#x27;t average, anyway!  </li>
            <li> It highly irritated my scalp, causing scalp sores and open wounds, so now I have to discontinue it, throw the rest away, and purchase selsun blue.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d pamper my nose at least if not my hair, and I personally DO enjoy the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read a review in the NY Times about co-shampoos in general and thought maybe I would like them.  </li>
            <li> Like many, I have spent a small fortune trying a myriad of products for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t provide as much slip as I expected</li>
            <li> I have used it twice this week and have only put virgin coconut oil in my hair with it and my 3c curly coils are soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it on pork tenderloin....</li>
            <li> This cowash not only cleans my hair but leaves it soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for me in terms of in-shower detangling, but that&#x27;s not really something I do anyway</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this again one of my staple products since I became natural.</li>
            <li> so my hair gets really curly when wet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times so far.  </li>
            <li> I also could instantly feel my natural curls after drying.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter who has natural wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT I DID NOT want one that was going to strip my hair completely because my hair is fragile and</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft while it was in my hair and after rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely cleanses my hair and makes it feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I have really soft 4c hair and find that conditioning alone actually weakens my hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely did not have any detangling properties as far as my hair was concerned.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that I color red.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and naturally wavy/loose curl.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the dimethicone gone from my hair, its soft and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li> However, this product did not like my natural blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Co Wash leaves my hair soft and manageable, i use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I am a 4c newly natural female.</li>
            <li> I followed up with my regular leave in conditioner and my hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Left my hair detangled, soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I massaged it into scalp &amp; hair...left it in while I completed my shower, then rinsed, rinsed, rinsed.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling soft and looking great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used once so far but think it will be a part of my haircare regiment.</li>
            <li> like I just left the hair shop, I normally use biosilk to give my hair a shine, but after using the coconut co-wash no need to add anything extra to my hair.</li>
            <li> But the packaging couldn&#x27;t be more frustrating.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this relatively thick coconut cowash in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I ended up having to wash it all the time which put more stress on my poor hair.</li>
            <li> It is creamy and smooth, but not too thick.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but not sure I will buy it again, well maybe if it goes on sale</li>
            <li> I use hairspray on very rare occasions and hardly use leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great slip, no heavy residue and my tangles (which are horrible) slide right out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it will work for others with considerably curlier hair, but my hair is just naturally wavy, not even necessarily curly, and fine but very thick.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for dry, curly/kinky hair and for any person who wants to keep their routine simple.</li>
            <li> Because of this, I ran through my first container within about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair with dry ends from heat and color damage, wavy/frizzy texture normally.  </li>
            <li> I mean I may give it a little bit of a trim, but this product is way better for my hair!</li>
            <li> I prefer to just use small amounts of shampoo to wash my hair because it actually feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and this conditioner does not cause excess oils like other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> You really cant beat the price compaired to wenn and other shampoo/ Conditioner out there.</li>
            <li> it was a hot mess, so I had to cut it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clean our common.</li>
            <li> Stripped my hair of it&#x27;s natural moisture and left it dry and brittle and did nothing as far as detangling.</li>
            <li> Since I have soft textured hair, it easily goes flat if I do not wash it regularly,  Unlike other shampoos that I have used in the past that dries my hair out completely,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently made the decision to go natural and since then, I&#x27;ve been trying a plethora of different products to see what my hair likes and doesn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I am a African American with 4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> No flaking and my african american hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> When I looked online for them they were far more expensive than what I used to pay for them</li>
            <li> I use an apple cider vinegar rinse to be sure there isn&#x27;t any residue left behind.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and it leaves it feeling clean without</li>
            <li> It is definitely a product to try for natural super thick hair.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it because traditional shampoos do dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Although this cowash did take me through the transition to no-poo for my hair, a scalp condition that I worked hard to eliminate has returned in full since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> This is of course not helped by the fact that I live in Arizona where the air itself is dry and frizzy!  </li>
            <li> I am going natural for the third time , I am African American, but anyways I have been using this product for a month</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my hair and I am transitioning to natural, this left my hair totally stripped and coarse on my relaxed ends.</li>
            <li> As long as they don&#x27;t change the formula or all natural ingredients I am a customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the cowash for the first time a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency a bit more, it smells better, and when my small section dried, it was moisturized without product, whereas As I Am was kind of drier, but nothing horrible.</li>
            <li> it to a friend to try who has straighter hair and it weighed her hair down too much.  </li>
            <li> I bent over in the shower because it was easier to really massage the product all over my scalp with my hair hanging down.</li>
            <li> When I ran out the first time, I decided to use up some product I had, so I mixed a little shampoo and alot of conditioner in my hand and cleaned my hair with that.  </li>
            <li> Blegh made my hair super greasy and was hard to get it all out.</li>
            <li> I do suggest putting on a high self in the shower or being extra careful.  </li>
            <li> Not sure co-washing is right for me.</li>
            <li> No more searching for the right cleanser/conditioner product.</li>
            <li> That conditioner make my hair soft and not so dry.</li>
            <li> Hi, I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman, 58 years old, and I&#x27;ve had problems with dry, frizzy hair all my life.  </li>
            <li> I tried this because I have naturally curly, dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x60;m a black girl and my  curls are very aggresive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going natural, but my hair gets really dry.  </li>
            <li> I thought i had straight hair with a slight wave</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally with no product in it</li>
            <li> After seeing this product on a few drug store shelves and reading positive reviews i decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Very thick and wavy, but fine.  </li>
            <li> I cowashed everyday as a new natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian, blonde with straight hair that had a slight wave.</li>
            <li> I rated a 4 instead of a 5 because it was only used once, however I do recommend for those with tight coils that want their curl pattern to really show.</li>
            <li> My hair for some reason will go from soft to very dry and course.  </li>
            <li> My Natural hair has always been very dry and brittle no matter what shampoo I used.</li>
            <li> I used the whole tub because I&#x27;m definitely not rich, but I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I will say, I was trying to use as little as possible but found you really need to use plenty</li>
            <li> Usually I would need to add a little of my detangling shampoo to my co wash, but this product make it easy for me to detangle my hair with no problem</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry and my scalp itches like no other.</li>
            <li> I mean I was really skeptical reading all of the great reviews; I am a 4b/4c/4z texture hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is MUCH softer, shinier and less frizz!</li>
            <li> fine, thin, wavy, tends to be more on the dry/brittle side at the ends and scalp gets oily but gets dry as well (weird).</li>
            <li> As an amateur cosmetic chemist I certainly understood this and set out to find a &amp;#34;ready-made&amp;#34; product to test and possibly reproduce in the &amp;#34;lab&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it does not suds up that much.</li>
            <li> I am amazed how long a jar lasts since I usually need a giant hand full of other products since my hair is so porous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cowashing for years and wanted to try a new less pricey cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> and so my first application was kinda heavy and harder to get in or out</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and this product does pretty well in taming it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair that goes frizzy if I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> This product cleaned my hair, and left it soft; not weighed down.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick and creamy, very much like a reconstructing conditioner.</li>
            <li> When it was dry, I rubbed a bit of the double butter daily moisturizer in my palms and scrunched my hair.</li>
            <li> My dry as straw hair is finally starting to feel hydrated again after using this and following the CG Method.</li>
            <li> It also really messed up my usual curl pattern &amp; made my hair lose quite a bit of its curliness.</li>
            <li> am not sure this is the real thing as anyone can put anything in this jar.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I leave it in long enough</li>
            <li> and I can tell that it is going to last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> long story short</li>
            <li> Long and short, it&#x27;s been a WEEK since I washed my hair</li>
            <li> I have sworn off flat irons, blow dryers</li>
            <li> so this product didnt last me long at all.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair that is pretty thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> I went down to my local Sally&#x27;s, really doubting they would have this gem all the way out here in Hawaii, but turns out Sally&#x27;s inventory rocks way out here as well, and it even cost less than online.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reviews from other african american women, but it fell short of the praise.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of this and it&#x27;ll last a long time!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Black with natural 4a/b curls.</li>
            <li> After that I was left nurturing dry, brittle curls for the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> This stuff cleans well enough, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and make it brittle..</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with curly or wavy hair that is dry and/or coarse.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is excessively dry and coarse this is not the CoWash for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I quit using dry shampoo between cowashes, and I no longer need to shampoo out the extra product.</li>
            <li> This is a shampoo that will strip your hair bone dry, which you may need once in a blue.  </li>
            <li> As I Am to achieve the same degree of cleansing and it made my hair dry.</li>
            <li> also ther isnt a pay off for that feeling my curls werent defined and it left my hair tangled and dry.</li>
            <li> As you wean off shampooing completely, it will produce less oil and will not get greasy anymore.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to offer the moisture I have been missing the last 2 years I have been natural.</li>
            <li> I barely have to use any other styling product to keep my hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels fluffy, shiny and soft (I have 4b hair type)!</li>
            <li> I tried to go no-shampoo back in Feb/March earlier this year, but I just couldn&#x27;t get over the nastiness of my hair, so I just started using less abrasive shampoos, and now I&#x27;ve only been washing my hair every 2-3 days (still need dry shampoo on the 3rd day</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to others with dry frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> First of all - it took less than half the time to dry!  </li>
            <li> In the middle of the week, I try to do a moisturizing deep condition due to the change in weather (it&#x27;s getting colder) and</li>
            <li> I have gone back to other brands when I run out of this but have always regretted it and gone back to this immediately.</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit in the daytime if the weather is very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, chemically damaged hair and its a short cut pixie.</li>
            <li> I am an all natural with 4a/b and a little c hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the coconut oil or the high level of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to determine how much to use each time and you have to scoop it with your hand..</li>
            <li> I got my first Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner a little over a week ago and have been using it everyday that I&#x27;ve washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells horrible (coming from a lover of the smell of coconut products) and mine came with a hard film over the top kind of like paper.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s taking a really long time to go away.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as I can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> I will buy it as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> It is far too messy trying to scoop it in your hand to apply in the shower.</li>
            <li> it stretched out.  </li>
            <li> and I will never use shampoo again as long as this product is on the shelves.</li>
            <li> it was packaged well and arrived earlier that expected.</li>
            <li> I am no natural hair guru</li>
            <li> I happened to stumble upon this on clearance at Target and bought it.</li>
            <li> One container can go a long way.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft, without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Since my my hair is thick, long and porous, saving a step really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hair is very thin and fine and our daughter&#x27;s hair is processed beyond belief.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is the jar is awkward in the shower and the label flakes off, but I can live with that because of the fabulous product inside!</li>
            <li> I mean I don&#x27;t see how that thing is gentle at all.</li>
            <li> I didnt touch my hair much with my fingers; you know what I mean pulling and stuff, and I scrunched it up with my hands.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have several other less expensive products that work better as cowash conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for a product to help tame my curly/frizzy hair and this product makes my hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back of the cowash is that it makes my curls really really tight.  </li>
            <li> All of this is exaggerated by the fact that I live in the hot, humid south and color treat due to plenty of grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in the process of nursing back to health, my naturally wavy, thin dry locks after having done a few years of keratin bone straight, treatments.  </li>
            <li> Cowashes do not properly clean hair, it will only cause product build up as there is no agents in a cowash that removes various oils and dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> I use the product daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> After blotting with the towel, I use some of the same brand leave-in conditioner for a little extra body.  </li>
            <li> The other conditioner, a Loreal sulfate-free conditioner for curly hair, was a total difference.</li>
            <li> A few days later I am at Target looking for a hair miracle when I stumble on the product section aimed at African women.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t mind that minor factor, buy it, it does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> Once I left the other version on for two DAYS...</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with As I Am cowash and I WILL use it for as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> I was drawn to this product due to the simple instructions.</li>
            <li> I will definitely give the other</li>
            <li> It goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I have very long, A3 curly hair.</li>
            <li> Still very strange that it basically feels like conditioner but acts as shampoo.</li>
            <li> It detangles, cleanses and doesn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my dry hair retain</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  dry out hair or strip my haircolor.  </li>
            <li> My hair is normally dry</li>
            <li> the As I Am leave in conditioner in and then scrunched in flaxseed gel, and allowed my hair to air dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry and damaged biracial hair with a thyroid issue, so basically it&#x27;s just a MESS.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has no slip what so ever made my hair feel dry and stripped.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry from styling products and hair color.</li>
            <li> My hair is constantly dry</li>
            <li> I have medium curly hair on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> Then I twist it and let it sit for an hour or over night, rinse it &amp; then unravel the twists after it dry</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> A pro that I did not expect is that it even made me hair easier to straighten while blowing it dry.</li>
            <li> hair is curly/wavy, prone to being dry.</li>
            <li> My scalp is also dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave our hair dry</li>
            <li> I finished up my hair routine and waited till it was dry</li>
            <li> This product defines my dry, coarse,twa,4a/b hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is not too dry, but the ends tend to be on the dry side.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair was dry and brittle she used this</li>
            <li> and I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> My hair is by nature quite dry</li>
            <li> My hair is colored and can be a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is really dry leave this product alone.</li>
            <li> Hair was quite dry and somewhat tangled after washing.</li>
            <li> dry (oh, and how about damaged from coloring)</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this to me after she experienced a really horrible bleaching experience for her very coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dry and waxy....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s runny enough to reach my scalp, but heavy enough to add weight to my curls and form a pattern.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair I have, I am mixed, white and puerto rican, and the hair is all sorts of crazy curly with a serious case of multi-personality disorder.  </li>
            <li> I figure all that time I spent before was spent on drying the detergent that was in my hair - not on drying my actual hair.  </li>
            <li> I always complained that products for natural hair left my scalp feeling dry and my hair brittle, not this one!  </li>
            <li> I recommend it if you tend to have normal to dry, medium to thick hair.</li>
            <li> ♦ If your hair texture isn&#x27;t dry or frizzy this can be extremely heavy due to the amount of natural oils listed as ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am a white girl with dark auburn, curly and unruly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I had this reaction, but just a warning to others if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my curls softer than usually, I think my natural hair texture is between 4b and 4c.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I just stumbled upon this by barely noticing a few raving comments about it at another site.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have your own holy grail of wash/condition, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> It cleanses thoroughly, and leaves my hair softer and silikier than I thought possible, without weighing it down or leaving a residue like waxier co-washes like WEN, etc.  </li>
            <li> It left her hair silky but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Next, I pull it down the length of my strands (my hair is in four sections, by the way).  </li>
            <li> But, if I my hair was weighed down again, I would definitely use it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, double processed dry, dry, dry, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a definite long way.</li>
            <li> The types of cowashes I&#x27;ve used in the past have either left my hair greasy, or way too dry and gross feeling.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a couple of these products after seeing the infomercials on an expensive name brand,as this is very much the same.</li>
            <li> I also bought the double butter cream which you only need a very little.</li>
            <li> Just keep at it, use dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Now that my hair is fully dry, I can tell you this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I rinse my hair thoroughly (do not towel dry!) and apply the cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> As I was applying it my hair started feeling rough and dry.</li>
            <li> I used about half a handful on my hip-length hair and it was barely enough.</li>
            <li> Slight buildup occasionally, and</li>
            <li> I purchased mine at the local store because it was 40-50% less;  </li>
            <li> Came half open and leaking.</li>
            <li> Wen seems to make my hair less frizzy but it is also has been humid recently.</li>
            <li> daily moisturizer daily for the past 3.5 weeks.</li>
            <li> (I wash 3x/week) and there is still half a container left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, less moisturizing than DAILY FIX, will need rinse out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, less moisturizing than DAILY FIX, will need rinse out.</li>
            <li> and i will not switch it was recommended to me because i was not pleased with other shampoo or conditioners and i didnt want anything to dry out my hair now it doesnt lather up like a shampoo that didnt bother my hair felt so soft afterwards</li>
            <li> ♦ If your hair texture is naturally dry, or dry due to damage this can help revive and hydrate the hair</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and allergy for chemical.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, very dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> just left a bit of a mess.</li>
            <li> Now on my third tub, I either wash every night or every other night, depending on if my hair is up all day or down all day.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a fashion statment when you have little white clumps in your wash and go.</li>
            <li> used this &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34;, but by me not being natural and hadn&#x27;t had the proper shampoo in a week, I  had to wash it out,otherwise my hair would have been a icky mess.</li>
            <li> I air dry my hair over night, so in the morning I do not put any other conditioning product in my hair so as the day goes on my curls</li>
            <li> I have thick salt and pepper African American hair that is on the very dry side</li>
            <li> the label peels off, so when I am handling the product with wet hands, I have small pieces from the label on my hands... not cool, but i&#x27;ll live, I suppose.</li>
            <li> I also find that the price on amazon is typically twice what you would pay at Sally&#x27;s or any other local beauty supply</li>
            <li> I definitely did not feel there was enough conditioner for  my hair and had a hard time detangling my curly hair after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely not be purchasing any other products from seller BeautyOnline!!</li>
            <li> I used this produce for a few weeks and experienced a terrible break out on my face, chest and back.  </li>
            <li> if your hair is extremely dirty or has excess build up from products, I&#x27;d recommend a sulfate free shampoo vs using a cowash unless you don&#x27;t mind using A LOT of this product (which I don&#x27;t recommend).</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it cow ashes just like it says and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I also had used it on my 7 yr old and she complained about the burning she felt.</li>
            <li> I have unprocessed waist length</li>
            <li> I was trying all types of shampoos and conditioners but once my hair dried it seemed as if I could not get any moisture back in.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It is not very moisturizing however so I do still condition my hair after washing with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair actually has quite a bit of bounce to it after drying and styling with just my blow dryer and a round brush.</li>
            <li> My hair was clean (not squeaky so it didn&#x27;t completely dry it out - which I hate), soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> If I had tried it a few weeks ago it would have snarled in the back, ripped, and my hand would have come out with fifty hairs on it.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the price, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> No matter how much I firmly massaged the product into my scalp, I was left with build up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was really worried that this would just make that issue worse, but</li>
            <li> I use a wide tooth shower comb to massage through my hair, although I could use my fingers.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian with 3A curls that are dyed purple and pink.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no issues with dandruff after using this</li>
            <li> the shower, I wet my hair, divided my hair into four sections</li>
            <li> Some products does wonders while wet</li>
            <li> I have been curious about WEN products</li>
            <li> My curls were not very defined, maybe I messed up the process by adding another conditioner.</li>
            <li> I scoop some out with my fingertips, then smoosh it onto my (already wet) scalp and scrub with the pads of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> hair was so porous that it dried out almost instantly after I moisturized it.</li>
            <li> So, (after deep conditioning) I applied a &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; made of dimethicone and heavy silicones.</li>
            <li> Then I used the co-wash and put the leave in conditioner on my wet hair and let it air-dry.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several co-washes and found that some were too heavy for my hair while others made my hair so silky</li>
            <li> I use a wide comb to comb it through while the product is still on.</li>
            <li> I let the cleanser in my hair for about 10 minutes idetangled with a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a couple of weeks now, and I started using it everyday, shampooing once a week or so.</li>
            <li> , it is wavy, fluffy, and blonde.</li>
            <li> Even though I washed out all traces of it, it left my hair limp.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a solid week everyday</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium-length 4a-4b natural hair, Nd let me tell you...</li>
            <li> I have mid back length, thick 3B</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it only lasted about 4 weeks because I have thick curly hair and lots of it.  </li>
            <li> For reference: I&#x27;m a Jewish white girl with ethnic (Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean) 2B/C curls and moderately thick hair with well balanced oil.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy curly hair that is thick and course.</li>
            <li> My hair is actually soft AND thick AND wavy/curly AND shiny AND not frizzy</li>
            <li> I am white with VERY thin pin straight hair that is damaged from highlights.</li>
            <li> and it took me so long to comb through the tangled frizzy mess that I get when I shampoo, explaining I wash twice a week for this reason.  </li>
            <li> Cowashing is normally advertised for curly girls, but it works just as well for my thick, wavy, and course hair!</li>
            <li> Within a few hours my hair did feel a little dry, though, so those with dehydrated hair would probably benefit from some extra moisture after using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair in a ponytail or braid for months because it looked so unhealthy, and even as it looks now, I am willing to start wearing it down again!</li>
            <li> Like, seriously, you won&#x27;t believe how soft.  </li>
            <li> The second and third times I used this it was NOT good.</li>
            <li> but it is a little easier to swallow the price if you buy this locally for about half the cost that it is here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way for me because I wash in 6 sections.</li>
            <li> and I also have Lupus so my hair has a hard time in general.</li>
            <li> I got this product just because some people complained about how dry their hair was left.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t tight or dry, and they don&#x27;t shrink.</li>
            <li> I use this for 90% of my washes and the other 10% I use a clarifying shampoo just like they recommend.  </li>
            <li> I have only seen a few shedded hairs too!</li>
            <li> I would prefer (and try) to wash every other day, but  after using As I Am, I feel my scalp needs to be cleaned by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> That could be due to my using Kinky Curly and my hair not being combed for a week.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use this rather than and other weekly shampoo.</li>
            <li> Back to my usual routine.</li>
            <li> oil to this to soothe one of my daughters itchy scalp, due to eczema</li>
            <li> the As I Am leave-in and curling jelly, but have used it with other products as well.</li>
            <li> And I believe that it&#x27;s all in the application, in keeping the hair WET!  </li>
            <li> a deep conditioning gone crazy and my hair was SOOO soft when I finally rinsed it out</li>
            <li> and it minimizes breakage compared to all other brands I&#x27;ve tried, both shampoo and cowash.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> No more shampoo, I do a lot of sports so daily washing a must.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t think of any Cons, other than the price tag on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Tried it to replace the expensive WEN product &amp; it works very well for me!</li>
            <li> My shampoo and condition every other day wasn&#x27;t helping and no amount of leave-in product was helping with frizz.</li>
            <li> I used it once every other week</li>
            <li> I use every other day, without washing in between.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Perhaps others will have more luck with it, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. :(</li>
            <li> The first time was kinda weird because you have to scoop it out and figure out how to get it on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other products.</li>
            <li> So I have started trying some of the other &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; in hopes of finding something comparable but not as pricey.  </li>
            <li> and I didnt apply any other products to my hair.</li>
            <li> Using this and the other</li>
            <li> the record, I usually use DevaCurl low poo and Dc products, Carol&#x27;s Daughter Milk co-wash and milk products, and Jessie&#x27;s Curl, so if those also work well for you, stay away from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and now I shampoo my hair every other month.  </li>
            <li> I always use a small amount daily as an hair moisture.</li>
            <li> All my other products have since gone in the trash.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely manageable after application.</li>
            <li> I got the 16 oz jar for $6.50 at Walgreens and saw some of the other \\&quot;As</li>
            <li> I wanted to use shampoo every other week and this as a fill in for the shampoo the weeks between, because this wouldn&#x27;t strip my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter on the other hand it does nothing for her hair.</li>
            <li> I will be trying the other products in this brand.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any product or other conditioner</li>
            <li> i would usually have to blow dry it instead of letting it air dry</li>
            <li> if I had four hands, I would give this product four thumbs down, I am certainly not a fan of any product that does not play well with others...</li>
            <li> However I  active and get sweaty</li>
            <li> I have had really dry hair and trouble getting my curls to come in and keeping my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> Then I came on here and checked out the reviews and after reading quite a few on quite a few different brands bought this one.  </li>
            <li> Usually my hair is a big fuzzy mess.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like to use shampoos to often because they&#x27;re too harsh; leaving my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 4 stars is because it is hard to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HARD to find products that you can use when you have human hair weaves.</li>
            <li> Shampoo makes my hair greasy at the roots and very dry everywhere else (not to mention it fades the crap out of my dye), while other cowashes seem to address the dry issue but make my hair feel less clean.</li>
            <li> well past my shoulders that is very thick and very curly.</li>
            <li> I have typical thick asian hair and it did not work as well as the other said.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish it wasn&#x27;t in a jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of products for curly hair lately, but this one is head and shoulders above the others.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cowash didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t realize how dirty it was since I rarely shampooed.)</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is the packaging..</li>
            <li> My only complaint is sometimes I wish it came in a bottle not a jar.</li>
            <li> Finally I just put it in two strand twists and said the hell with it because it was drying into a frizzy afro with no kind of curl or definition</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that is of average thickness.</li>
            <li> That is my only negative and the reason for a four star review.</li>
            <li> I have thin blond hair and this completely took care of the problem I was having with frizz and split ends.</li>
            <li> The round tub was awkard to scoop product from with wet</li>
            <li> Love the smell but hate how you have to scoop it out the jar.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it or hate it, just meh about it.  </li>
            <li> Love the product, hate the tub..</li>
            <li> I have found this product to soften my thick coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair with damaged ends ( I am transitioning)</li>
            <li> Her hair is coarse, thick, and slightly curly.</li>
            <li> Not frizzy matted down locks.</li>
            <li> To me it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down or oily.</li>
            <li> Now she can use this on Lola and the itching has calmed down.</li>
            <li> I narrowed it down between this and Shea Moisture, and since this one was on sale at Walgreens</li>
            <li> Moisturizing with out weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I would see it rinse down the drain!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cut down on the frizz</li>
            <li> stuff weighs my hair down a lot.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh them down.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> I separate her hair in small sections (dry hair) &amp; comb through the knots, spray the section</li>
            <li> I will be switching myself---hoping it comes in other scents because even though I like the coconut smell, I&#x27;d like something a little less summery in the fall and winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little weird washing your hair with a product that looks and feels like conditioner, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> I do take a little extra time working it through my hair and scalp to insure I &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my thick head of hair well.  </li>
            <li> Because of this, I don&#x27;t like using conditioners that contain sulfates or silicone, as they weigh down my hair and mess with the texture.</li>
            <li> will say though that I bought mine at Walgreens for about $5.00 less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and haven&#x27;t even gone through half yet.</li>
            <li> I keep this co-wash hidden from my girls bc</li>
            <li> I just realized that shampoo shouldn&#x27;t be used much on black peoples/ 4abc hair textures.</li>
            <li> packaging also makes the product less hygienic.(but</li>
            <li> My hair is softer &amp; shinier, but my curls are definitely less defined.</li>
            <li> I also like that I use less water because I don&#x27;t have to rinse and rinse the shampoo, then rinse and rinse the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> noticed with this product I have less breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that one jar lasts me about a month and a half when used every four days.</li>
            <li> I feel like it leaves less residue.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Typically, this time of year in Arizona, I have an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am not the target or typical user for this product as it is typically used for people with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I also read the reviews on Amazon, but bought it off ebay for half the price.</li>
            <li> This made dispensing the producteasier and I used less of it and it didn&#x27;t spill.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black girl with hair</li>
            <li> Along came cowashing and my hair is noticeably softer, smoother, and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My wash and detangle takes less than a 1/2 hour now, versus the 1</li>
            <li> , I have found that doing a prepoo with a mixture I put together to include 2 ounces of Kinky Kurly leave in conditioner, with 6 ounces of water, 2 ounces of almond oil, 14 drops of lavendar and rosemary and 5 drops of peppermint oils that I put into my hair....not all 8 ounces....and cover with a plastic cap for half hour then cowash with Pantene cowash and my hair</li>
            <li> I typically co-wash about twice a week.</li>
            <li> Less breakage.</li>
            <li> Less split ends.</li>
            <li> She immediately found her hair softer, cleaner, and less frizzy than ever before.</li>
            <li> I have medium length brown hair with a slight wave and oily scalp.</li>
            <li> Walmart, target, walgreens will have it on sale at half price.</li>
            <li> I like this co-washer a lot---it cuts my hair shower time in half.</li>
            <li> This stuff is less than $10</li>
            <li> Less body and less shine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly curly or kinky hair, but its damaged from excessive heat tool usage and is frizzy, dull and just been feeling BLAH lately.</li>
            <li> I have grey and course hair that is flyaway and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling a little weighed down.  </li>
            <li> three days in, my hair was an oily mess</li>
            <li> The flakey mess that I was upon waking up in the morning after using this product is not cool.</li>
            <li> It has taken long to find something for my thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> will it work on my tightly coiled hair, tho?!&amp;#34;  The answer is yes.</li>
            <li> I apply it to dry hair the day before I wash my hair or wear it on my hair for at least a couple of hours as a co-wash or pre-poo.</li>
            <li> I wish the product came in a bottle instead of a jar for easier, less messy application.  </li>
            <li> I did have a few strands of hair in my fingers after I ran them through, but it may just have been the clarifying aspect ridding me of weighed down dead hair.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting it to be a little thicker.</li>
            <li> and it helped a little.</li>
            <li> I also use on my little girl&#x27;s hair and their hair loves it.  </li>
            <li> or I look a little greasy after.</li>
            <li> but i tend to like my cowashes to be a little thicker in substance...</li>
            <li> I massaged it again a little bit, combed through it with my fingers</li>
            <li> and I was a bit of a product junkie a little while ago.</li>
            <li> I was using wen for over a year,  but who couldn&#x27;t stand to save a little money.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a year now.  </li>
            <li> I admit it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too watery for my preference.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a little &amp; we&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and usually have trouble with lots of shrinkage but this still left my hair hydrated.</li>
            <li> I just cowashed, put a band on to catch any dripping water, did a little preping and went to work.  </li>
            <li> As a little girl my mother washed my hair weekly</li>
            <li> It smells a little chemical-ish</li>
            <li> My hair is bad damaged and this really took that straw dry</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to find companies that actually do what they say.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair and one jar will usually last me about a month, which for me is four washes.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to open with wet hands and introduces water into the product, which shortens the life of the cowash drastically because it promotes mold growth (especially for this, because it doesn&#x27;t use hard preservatives).</li>
            <li> Even as accustomed to bad hair as I am, I did not want to leave the house for days until the natural oils came back.  </li>
            <li> I used to wash it everyday, but wanted to not do that.</li>
            <li> And also, it might take a while to get used to if you used to use abrasive shampoos and washed everyday.</li>
            <li> It took my hair awhile to adjust to a)non-abrasives and b) not being washed everyday.</li>
            <li> Way too heavy for my hair, I HAD to shampoo after.</li>
            <li> After I washed it I thought it may leave my hair greasy looking after I blow dried it</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Dried out my scalp.</li>
            <li> Truly a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have harsh detergents</li>
            <li> bought this based upon the rave reviews on Amazon, Sally Beauty and a few blogs.  </li>
            <li> I have thin and greasy blond hair that always snarled in the back and at the ends</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago on a whim</li>
            <li> Both times, this product caused the hair to mat and dried it out.</li>
            <li> Any trip to the hairdresser leaves me scratching for a few days.</li>
            <li> After doing that a few times, my hair started to look a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> I think it dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> It even gets rid of the gunk I put in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Been using it everyday and have recommended to coworkers and family.</li>
            <li> had read that a few ladies had dropped the container in the shower, spilling and wasting the product.  </li>
            <li> Made my normally soft hair frizzy and weird.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It tends to get messy in the shower.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair to the point that it felt like straw.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product a few times and I am not a fan.</li>
            <li> and it seems to coat the hair making it sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months.</li>
            <li> This was delivered a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> I also moisturize my hair everyday and apply a leave-in.</li>
            <li> using for a few weeks, my hair began to shed heavily.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, it was in the middle of winter.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> It completely dried out my hair, it felt my straw.</li>
            <li> , it took a few washes for my hair to adjust to it</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something that would give me moisture and not leave my hair heavy.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using it on my daughters hair after having heavy build up of product.  </li>
            <li> And some folks find the Jessicurl cleansing condish too harsh, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate throwing away money, but this is the absolute last time I buy this</li>
            <li> So what I did was, we had a empty, thick plastic bottle and it has a heavy duty pump dispenser.  </li>
            <li> This product dries my natural hair out, and makes finger detangling my 4a natural hair nearly impossible!    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t washed it in 2 days and isn&#x27;t greasy, when usually it looks a mess.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t, plain conditioner does the trick.</li>
            <li> The smell is not strong even for someone like me who gets headaches with perfumes etc.</li>
            <li> I dont like the smell it was not strong</li>
            <li> Tried this in my quest to finally tame my daughters curls.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny, while cutting down on my hair wash time.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that my hair would feel heavy and coated, but didn&#x27;t have that problem!</li>
            <li> I usually put a little argan or Moroccan oil  in afterwards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has officially replaced the Abba Color Protect Shampoo that I&#x27;ve been using the past few years.  </li>
            <li> I found it easier to apply than WEN, but it&#x27;s a bit less thick</li>
            <li> The dry &#x27;halo&#x27; of hair has decreased.</li>
            <li> I have thick, slightly wavy (2a) hair that is prone to frizz and &amp;#34;poof.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> To me it is the typical coconut/chemical infused smell that is quite common in hair care products.</li>
            <li> I have a month-old 4b/c TWA (teeny weenie afro) that soaks in moisture, and this co-wash took what little moisture I had OUT!</li>
            <li> This cowash is thick and creamy, provides a lot of slip and allows me to finger detangle my tightly curly/coily hair without any issues.</li>
            <li> I was recently a little late for work because of my hair.</li>
            <li> It has very little slip.  </li>
            <li> consistency is thick, creamy and a little bit runny.</li>
            <li> I noticed very little color on my comb.</li>
            <li> It was super dry, breaking, split-ends, awful!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have extremely dry hair and hate constant washing of my hair due to excess oil.  </li>
            <li> Both products are a few dollars less expensive at other online retailers with brick-and-mortar locations.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually in</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wash my hair with shampoo from mid-shaft to the ends</li>
            <li> I usually put conditioner in and comb it through my hair.</li>
            <li> like I usually do, that was working for me anyway.  </li>
            <li> I got this for $3 at Walgreens last week and was skeptical (but who cares for $3).</li>
            <li> leaver your hair feeling like an oil slick</li>
            <li> I usually follow up with the leave in conditioner and the hair whip.</li>
            <li> my go to cowash for everyday or weekly build up!</li>
            <li> And for the price you just cannot go wrong - it will last me longer than Wen.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product, gave her a small container with 4 tablespoons of product and instructions on how to use it.  </li>
            <li> product did not leave a film on my hair like I thought it would like some conditioners I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I usually use u-part wigs to keep my hair protected.</li>
            <li> The most disgusting product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair wavy but was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t harsh.</li>
            <li> the As I Am and have been using Eden&#x27;s cowash exclusively for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> After having two surgeries in the past 4 years, my hair was shot.</li>
            <li> I swapped it out with my usual shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> After I diffused it, it looked a lot flatter than it usually does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use this with</li>
            <li> This works well as a detangler, we usually do a spray leave in but don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li> So I use it like shampoo and also condition per usual.</li>
            <li> This was too slick.</li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed and you won&#x27;t back to Wen or the regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> and usually it&#x27;s a headache</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> but my scalp would feel weird and gunky the next day.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure if i like it or not at this point.</li>
            <li> In the past I have thought that I found the rite products for my hair.</li>
            <li> I also sometimes apply a small amount as I style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird that you can feel the moisture and cleanse at the same time.</li>
            <li> I usually do a twist out</li>
            <li> It also left a weird residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> This lovely jar is helping me to recover from the awful experience I had with Wen.</li>
            <li> this wasn&#x27;t very hard since I&#x27;d applied it to very wet hair and kept adding water</li>
            <li> Ironically, I was slipping and sliding all over the tub with this, serious HAZARD!  </li>
            <li> I don’t usually review products because I have a hard time finding the time to do it.</li>
            <li> I have very bad dandruff, perhaps psoriasis and always had to use special shampoos/conditioners</li>
            <li> I have very dry thick hair which LOVES to frizz out to the point its unmanageable!!</li>
            <li> We did, however, wash her little cockapoo dog with it because that Lola gets dry, itchy skin but loves to run around in the woods and get dirty.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> I used this but felt it was hard to work it thru all of my hair since there is no lather.</li>
            <li> The smell is hard to describe.</li>
            <li> I have a texturizer in my hair and have to deal with hard water.</li>
            <li> Hard to manage a screw off lid with product in one hand while in shower.  </li>
            <li> Although I never discontinue the Cream of Nature shampoo, I tried so hard to stop shampooing.</li>
            <li> It makes it hard to manage.</li>
            <li> On the negative side, I really hate using large tubs of things in the shower.</li>
            <li> a huge disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> every 3 days at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is delicate</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s cleansing capabilities weren&#x27;t so great-at least for me.</li>
            <li> I am elated to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I must admit I have been extremely curious, but skeptical about how something that looks and feels like</li>
            <li> At least in my case.</li>
            <li> I know some people have complained about the lack of a pump on this</li>
            <li> I know some people have complained about the lack of a pump on this</li>
            <li> My issue with co-washing was that my left always ended up still feeling dirty and gunky.</li>
            <li> Lots of Youtube videos say to give CoWash at least a month before making a judgement.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t comb through my hair after cowashing with this conditioner which sucks.</li>
            <li> I say, if your hair is dirty enough requiring a repeat then wash it with shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly (4A) hair and have used a conditioner as (or instead of) a shampoo for years.</li>
            <li> My hair type is thick and wavy, with some frizz.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend if you&#x27;re tired of all the crap regular shampoos and conditioners leave in your hair!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as thick which I like - makes it easier to spread around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy for my hair, which is thin and curly.  </li>
            <li> I shared with a friend whose hair is thick and kinky</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair</li>
            <li> Too thick, it just keep my scalp increase the oily feel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick consistency and does seem to nourish my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair seems to like products that are thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> I mean literally -- I do not want a shampoo that won&#x27;t make my hair squeak after I&#x27;ve rinsed it out).</li>
            <li> no  more Cowashing for me!</li>
            <li> I am anxiously waiting for them to restock!</li>
            <li> I see my tiny randomly placed curls string to life !</li>
            <li> I usually use this in between shampoo washes!</li>
            <li> I was interested in doing the no-poo thing, tried it, hated it, and never gave it another thought.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY expensive, and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s the concept that works; not necessarily the brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, shortly after I tried this I had a family member get very ill and had to rush 8 hours away to see him with my mom.  </li>
            <li> Did not like packaging-having to deal with opening and closing a jar in the shower and was very difficult to get the last out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;(thick, curly/wavy hair)</li>
            <li> bought this &amp;#34;no suds shampoo&amp;#34; after learning some serious hair care tips from Anthony Dickey of Hair Rules.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> and I have to use half a bottle of expensive conditioner to get the knots out and replenish some moisture.</li>
            <li> my low porosity hair, it is almost impossible to retain moisture in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously used a co wash that I bought at a beauty supply store and it was so complicated to use--</li>
            <li> i do believe this product is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> im one of those people that will sit and read 100 comments/reviews on a product and if 7 people out of that 100 claim that it was no good for them</li>
            <li> Just that it&#x27;s kinda difficult with all the scooping because it does get messy.</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m just not a good candidate for this product.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it&#x27;s practically impossible to UNcurl my hair, but it can get stupendously frizzy and dry, and that didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> I read them and immediately went to my nearest dept. store to try this out, and I was left extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> My hair gets greasy in a second day :((</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the fact that it is in a jar :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dirty or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian but have very thick, frizzy, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Proofs and frizzes when I wash it, impossible to detangle when wet, dull and was seriously considering cutting it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate shampooing my hair because nit turns into one giant knot</li>
            <li> I tried this because I was tired of having greasy hair every day after washing it the day before.</li>
            <li> I got tired of having greasy hair day after washing my hair and thus having to wash it every day.  </li>
            <li> I even tried washing my hair with baking soda and apple cider vinegar (not a great idea as it messes with the hair&#x27;s pH balance).</li>
            <li> Seems to leave a lot of residue behind.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t use shampoos with lots of bubbles because it makes the frizz worse.</li>
            <li> figured out shampoos with sulfates were making my hair even worse than it was, not to mention made</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> My concerns were that it would leave behind a residue.</li>
            <li> Lately, for some reason, my hair has been so difficult to detangle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not God-awful, just not great, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I hate that I waited this long.</li>
            <li> Hair Rules&#x27; Cleansing Cream was too expensive (though I do plan on trying to dupe that product) for my blood</li>
            <li> I have thin hair but have lots of it!</li>
            <li> Sorry Amazon.com; but at the As I Am website, I can buy two of these jars for just about what you are charging for one jar ($8.00 each).  </li>
            <li> Sadly I can still see my relaxed hair just hanging there</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that does not leave my hair like a horrible hay stack.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.</li>
            <li> u will not be sorry</li>
            <li> but I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I used to buy an expensive non-sudsing cleansing conditioner from QVC.</li>
            <li> Ill keep using to find out.</li>
            <li> It was known about Prell - and should be known about this product - that if your hair is filthy and gooped up with gels, heavy oils like castor oil, or &#x27;coned to death with anti-frizz serums, it is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> It has been a nightmare my entire life and my very worst feature.  </li>
            <li> I combed it out, twisted it and clipped it up while I went on with my shower.</li>
            <li> Weird product, but</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was not impressed with the curl formation of my hair.</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That unfortunately brings up my biggest gripe about this product and that is the container.</li>
            <li> I am not at all sorry that I did, though</li>
            <li> but it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I started using WEN hair care, but it was so expensive (about $25-$30 a bottle).</li>
            <li> But compared to No Poo by Devachan which is what I usually use, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> It  is unable to detangle, manage or straighten out the hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Ill continue to use this because it&#x27;s made specifically for people who want to maintain moisture by not using shampoo-</li>
            <li> When I used the product, I was sad that I couldn&#x27;t comb through it to detangle.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive cowash before but that made my hair like straw.</li>
            <li> like 3b curly hair and my hair tends to get so dry or the curls will look awful when I do not use stuff that works for my hair</li>
            <li> My hair felt striped and dry after washing with this, as if I washed with the worst shampoo money could buy.  </li>
            <li> should mention I had tried both Hair One &amp; Lisa Rachael co washes and my&lt;br /&gt;hair felt dry and was terribly tangled.  </li>
            <li> I mean, I hate it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had a bad reaction to WEN.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law suffers from thinning hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that crazy about this co-wash.</li>
            <li> In the summer it frizzes like crazy and</li>
            <li> This cowash does not help remove the dandruff for me, leaving my hair still dirty.</li>
            <li> well, I am not too too crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> The bottle says don&#x27;t repeat unless your hair is really dirty, so I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I cold wash my hair</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Trust me when I say shampooing  was a very difficult habbit to break.</li>
            <li> so bad that at times it effects my scalp</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;m not risking it.</li>
            <li> Not that it made it feel bad.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say of this hair cleanser.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I decided to try co washing and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I gave this a try and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> than it was already disappointed because I was hoping to get rid of my frizz.</li>
            <li> i hate having to return things</li>
            <li> Plus I hate the slippery feel.</li>
            <li> I hate that!pletely.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Loreal cleansing conditioner and I hate the pump it comes in and the price..... and had considered ordering Wen products</li>
            <li> ( I hate a hat )</li>
            <li> /&gt;But what I hate about this product is the jar.  </li>
            <li> Doubtful I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I HATE to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> Plus I hated not having a pump or bottle-</li>
            <li> everything I hated about washing my hair changed.  </li>
            <li> Very, very bad hair.  </li>
            <li> My face and neck started breaking out very badly and somehow alongside the dandruff, I also had pimples on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the cowash everyone seem to like it</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off my hair squeaked but it was frizzy as ever and awful.</li>
            <li> But the worst was the breakout.  </li>
            <li> Still looking for a product comparable to Wen, without the horrible Wen customer service.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even dissolve in your hair or water there were all these flecks of it in the cowash it was awful.</li>
            <li> After i use this my scalp itches and burn and its a terrible feeling.</li>
            <li> I hate that!</li>
            <li> I am so disgusted.  </li>
            <li> Some insanely pricey.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells nice, moisturizes and cleans. As good as all the reviews say</li>
            <li> liked it but it didnt do much for my hair. the package also exploded before i could get it in my mailbox. Do not leave in heat</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It is expensive on Amazon, but I live on an island with no stores, so just happy I can order it.  It keeps my bleach blonde hair moisturized.  Never going back to shampoo.</li>
            <li> Strips my hair too much.</li>
            <li> excellent  cleansing  coditioner! i  bought  3  will  buy some  more  in the  future</li>
            <li> I have curly hair so don&#x27;t like to wash it more than twice a week. However I  active and get sweaty so wanted something I could use to feel clean without drying out my hair. This product does the trick! It smells good and feels good and leaves my hair feeling conditioned and clean.</li>
            <li> Putting this on I was overwhelmed by the smell of alcohol. As I was applying it my hair started feeling rough and dry. After rinsing it off my hair squeaked but it was frizzy as ever and awful. I had to do a month of hot oil treatments 2x a week to get the moisture back in my hair. What a nightmare. I thought I&#x27;d have to wait for new hair to grow in for my head to look normal again. There is a lot of alcohol in this product and it&#x27;s not the best for your hair. Especially if it&#x27;s curly. Stay away.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly (4A) hair and have used a conditioner as (or instead of) a shampoo for years. I like this cleansing wash because it cleans my hair without drying it. I am amazed how long a jar lasts since I usually need a giant hand full of other products since my hair is so porous. I like that my hair is conditioned without added volume or feeling coated. Plus it gives my hair a tad more length since the curls are moisturized and not so tight.  I alternate between this cleansing conditioner and the WEN Cleansing Conditioner (Fig) which is comparatively pricier but if I don&#x27;t alternate it&#x27;s like my hair gets burnt out on one product and the magic is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this routine has worked for about a year now. I no longer have a closet full of hair care products that ended up not working - nor am I slave to the blow dryer or hot iron :)</li>
            <li> Okay I have never used Wen, but I really don&#x27;t think that I need to after using this product. This product cleaned my hair, and left it soft; not weighed down. I thought I was going to have to cut my hair because after bleaching my hair, the ends were feeling pretty rugged. I mean I may give it a little bit of a trim, but this product is way better for my hair! Don&#x27;t bother with Wen. Try this stuff.</li>
            <li> I left this stuff on my hair for about 5-10 minutes and afterwards my hair was SO clean and shiny. And also my curls were so define. (I have 3b/3c curls)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It doesn&#x27;t have much slip</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner but I was expecting it to be a little thicker. It still works pretty well and smells good. I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have thick, medium-length 4a-4b natural hair, Nd let me tell you... As I Am outdid themselves when they made the Coconut Cowash!  It smells amazing, has ridiculous (in a GOOD way!) slip and moisturizes like no other.  It&#x27;s also a great foundation for any additional As I Am products that may be used after cowashing!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my thick hip length hair. I put in hair put plastic cap on n rap in a scarf,sleep with it in and wash hair in morning. It works wonders-my hair is soft,smooth,and shine. I will and have told everyone about this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I&#x27;ve been using cleansing conditioners for a couple of years now and thought I&#x27;d try a different brand. Very nice and I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> I got my product on time as promised.  I have used it twice and all I can say is I LOVE this.  My hair feels so clean and the smell is very pleasant.  I will be ordering more products from the As I Am line.  Staple for my co-washing.  I love it when you find something that works right the first time.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my hair incredibly bouncy and soft. I have unprocessed waist length 2 a/b hair with some sun damage on the ends. I love Wen co- wash but it doesn&#x27;t take the hardness out of the end of my hair and it is very expensive. Just bought this and love the large tub size! My scalp feels clean but not stripped and my ends are soft and the smell is fantastic. I do wind up putting extra conditioner on my ends after most of the time. Can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
            <li> I was reading about this Coconut cowash.. and I decided to try it.. it made my hair like super soft and easy to detangle... and I have 4b 4c hair..</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product from a retail store and figured to give it a try. I followed the instructions and once I felt the softness of my hair disappear I was floored. I couldn&#x27;t believe the havoc this item had done, even when rinsed out completely and my all time fave conditioner was applied, there was a stripped feeling in my hair... if I had four hands, I would give this product four thumbs down, I am certainly not a fan of any product that does not play well with others... the one star was for the name and sent of the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been 100% natural with a TWA for six months now.  I just started using this cowash about two months ago.  This stuff is amazing!  I can easily comb my hair in the shower and it leaves it feeling soft and clean.  I always complained that products for natural hair left my scalp feeling dry and my hair brittle, not this one!  Even though it isn&#x27;t a shampoo with no suds, I still feel like my scalp is moisturized and clear of product build-up.  My only complaint is that I wish it wasn&#x27;t in a jar.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and consistency.  But there are other cowashes I like better.</li>
            <li> This product does the job it&#x27;s designed to do, it cleanses my hair.  I like the smell of the product and that my hair is free from buildup after I wash.  I wish the product came in a bottle instead of a jar for easier, less messy application.  Although the product does what it&#x27;s supposed to, my hair tends to tangle more after using it than I&#x27;d like requiring me to use significant amounts of leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing,is light on my fine hair, makes it super soft, moisturized and really brings out my curls after a wash. Detangling is super breezy too! I would definitely recommend purchasing. If I were to type my hair I&#x27;d say a combo of 4a/b coils and curls.</li>
            <li> My hair for some reason will go from soft to very dry and course.  I was trying all types of shampoos and conditioners but once my hair dried it seemed as if I could not get any moisture back in. THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE USED!!! My hair is moisturized and so soft that I do not need to use conditioner. And I have true African American hair that is natural.</li>
            <li> great smell! i love it!</li>
            <li> First time purchasing this product and i used it only recently.  I love the conditioner is made my hair silky smooth and an adorable sent.</li>
            <li> The best hair product for my co wash leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Excema.I have flare ups so bad that at times it effects my scalp My scalp gets dry, flaky&amp;itchy so much so it makes my hair fall out.I&#x27;ve tried all types of treatments for hair recovery, nothing has brought back my hairs fullness, shine,not to mention my confidence.The moisture stays in your scalp! My sister-in-law suffers from thinning hair.I gave her a extra bottle of leave in conditioner and now her hair looks fuller too! A+ product!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Don&#x27;t even need to finger detangler after using it because my hair is so slippery and clean that the knots just detangler themselves! Smells nice , a little goes a long ways and it makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have type 3a curly hair.  I use this for 90% of my washes and the other 10% I use a clarifying shampoo just like they recommend.  It is such a perfect product.  It detangles, cleanses and doesn&#x27;t dry.  My hair looks gorgeous after I use it.  It&#x27;s also faster than using shampoo and conditioner.  Since my my hair is thick, long and porous, saving a step really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels soft to the touch and responds well to the products that I use afterward. The only issue I have is with the packaging -- a pump bottle would be so much better than this tub.  Definitely has a prominent place in my product stash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Black with natural 4a/b curls. When I wear my hair out it&#x27;s usually in wash n go&#x27;s or in an afro state. I conditioner wash my hair every 2-3 days and shampoo my hair once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this &amp;#34;no suds shampoo&amp;#34; after learning some serious hair care tips from Anthony Dickey of Hair Rules. I thoroughly enjoyed his presentation and now follow his routine to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;. Dickey informs curly girls not to use foaming/sudsing shampoos as they are very drying and potentially damaging to the hair. As an amateur cosmetic chemist I certainly understood this and set out to find a &amp;#34;ready-made&amp;#34; product to test and possibly reproduce in the &amp;#34;lab&amp;#34;. Hair Rules&#x27; Cleansing Cream was too expensive (though I do plan on trying to dupe that product) for my blood and I wanted something I could use immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this product not only for the hype, but also because it has three surfactants...2 cationic and 1 non-ionic surfactants which are not great cleaners (they won&#x27;t be able to dissolve large oil/grease particles) since their primary functions are &amp;#34;conditioners&amp;#34;, but they clean. The chlorides cetrimonium and stearalkonium both show antimicrobial activity, and cetrimonium has been shown to remove silicone. All the while, they&#x27;re both FANTASTIC conditioners, softeners, and reduce combing forces! Cetrimonium is a wonderful detangling agent and stearalkonium is a great antistatic agent. Peg-40 Castor oil--the non ionic surfactant--is a multi-purpose ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the product was promising. I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;raker&amp;#34;, meaning I just rake product through my hair and finger detangle as  I go. I was able to very easily run this product through my hair after fully saturating my hair with water. It&#x27;s runny enough to reach my scalp, but heavy enough to add weight to my curls and form a pattern. My hair felt clean after using this product...almost a little too clean which was a nice surprise. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that clean feeling from a &amp;#34;no suds&amp;#34; shampoo. My hair didn&#x27;t feel stripped, just clean. As an aside: I used this product before getting my hair done and my stylist even mentioned how clean my hair was. As I Am gets 4/5 stars from me. Only 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like packaging...A jar? Really marketing people?? All in all, it&#x27;s an awesome product with a simple ingredient list and it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be using this product as my weekly &amp;#34;no suds shampoo&amp;#34; and continue using Luseta Beauty&#x27;s Tea Tree and Argan Oil Conditioner as my every 2-3 day cowash (http://www.amazon.com/Luseta-Beauty-Argan-Conditioner-Ounce/dp/B00LJXQOT8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title).

            <li> Loved it and help to hydrate my hair tremendously.</li>
            <li> This product dries my natural hair out, and makes finger detangling my 4a natural hair nearly impossible!    You&#x27;d be better off using a regular moisturizing conditioner (you know the drugstore kind) which is what I had been doing for years.    If you use a lot of butters and get buildup, this product may be fine for you.  If you use light, natural oils and leave-ins...Prepare to have your hair stripped!</li>
            <li> I have ethnic hair and this cowash is fantastic. I love the feel and consistency. The coconut smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is beyond me how this product got so many rave reviews. I read them and immediately went to my nearest dept. store to try this out, and I was left extremely disappointed. I have a month-old 4b/c TWA (teeny weenie afro) that soaks in moisture, and this co-wash took what little moisture I had OUT! My hair was left completely stripped, and I had to use my new Giovanni 2Chic moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (Which worked wonders!) just to revive it. After that I was left nurturing dry, brittle curls for the rest of the week. I lost the receipt, so this one is going right in the trash. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;m not risking it.</li>
            <li> This is very nice. It smells good and my hair feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of coconut so I really though I would like this product, but for some reason it seems to make my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it weekly to cowash my hair, because I do the CGM (curly girl method) which includes no shampoo, because it tends to dry out our hair, especially African-American hair. The smell is great.</li>
            <li> Sucks. Didn&#x27;t make your hair study our agony. Doesn&#x27;t clean our common. Never buy again</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product!! It makes my hair smell amazing for days!! I use this once a week to really give my hair a nice deep clean. My hair feels fluffy, shiny and soft (I have 4b hair type)! I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Just got this and used it and so far so good! My hair felt super clean afterwards. I was a little worried that my hair would feel heavy and coated, but didn&#x27;t have that problem! Will provide updates if anything goes amiss or great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My virgin hair: fine, thin, wavy, tends to be more on the dry/brittle side at the ends and scalp gets oily but gets dry as well (weird). I used to wash it everyday, but wanted to not do that. I tried to go no-shampoo back in Feb/March earlier this year, but I just couldn&#x27;t get over the nastiness of my hair, so I just started using less abrasive shampoos, and now I&#x27;ve only been washing my hair every 2-3 days (still need dry shampoo on the 3rd day and/or it goes up). Took a while for my hair to be ok with washing it every other day, and now I try to was it once every 3 days at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cowash did a good job of cleaning my hair. It looked fine the next day as well. I used about 3 mini scoops with 2 fingers (my hair comes up to the top part of my boobs) and distributed that into my roots/scalp and used a wide tooth comb. I don&#x27;t usually wash my hair with shampoo from mid-shaft to the ends any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I read that some people were having issues of it feeling oily. You have to make sure that you rinse well! Get all the conditioner out of your head/hair! And also, it might take a while to get used to if you used to use abrasive shampoos and washed everyday. Just keep at it, use dry shampoo! It took my hair awhile to adjust to a)non-abrasives and b) not being washed everyday. And everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so just give yourself some time.</li>
            <li> I am a white girl with dark auburn, curly and unruly hair. I always have to put a ton of product in my hair after washing to keep frizzies at bay. Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried As I Am Cowash this morning and I was in shock. This is the first time that I can remember that I had actual CURLS in my hair after a shower. Seriously. Curls. Not frizzy matted down locks. No gels, no mousse and no sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely sold on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that I bought mine at Walgreens for about $5.00 less. Just FYI :)</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and this product is amazing. It leaves my hair feeling so soft and no need for using shampoo. It smells amazing too! I love using this when I am going to style my hair down because it makes it very non-frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks now, and I am in love. I was looking for a good cowash to cleanse my 3B hair. My favourite thing about this product is how CLEAN but soft my hair feels after. Lastly, if you like coconut, you&#x27;ll like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this item. I do not need to use detangler anymore. The only drawback is that my hair does not feel super clean. But I am ok with that. I use shampoo once a week, and the rest I only use this cowash. I have straight hair and i do not want to have curls, I do not see any curls after using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. The first time I used it I noticed a difference. My hair felt so smooth and silky. My new go to.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  I have been searching for a product to help tame my curly/frizzy hair and this product makes my hair so soft and manageable.  I originally purchased WEN in an attempt to help with my hair problem.  Unfortunately, I had a bad reaction to WEN.  I saw that &amp;#34;As I AM&amp;#34; had great reviews and was comparable (but much cheaper) so I figured I would give it a try. I was extremely pleased with the results and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the great reviews. I got this from a beauty supply store and really wanted to love it, but I didn&#x27;t feel it conditioned my hair very well. I usually put conditioner in and comb it through my hair. I couldn&#x27;t do that with this. I felt like I needed to put another conditioner in my hair after this one.  I&#x27;ll save my money and just co-wash with regular conditioner like I usually do, that was working for me anyway.  *additional star for the coconut smell</li>
            <li> Way too heavy for my hair, I HAD to shampoo after. My hair just felt greasy.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair actually feeling clean, unlike other &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; that leave behind their own residue instead of getting rid of existing residue.  I&#x27;m about to be on my second jar, and also got some for my mom for mother&#x27;s day. It&#x27;s NOT drying and smells AMAZING.  You can also use it daily, unlike regular shampoo, without any drying effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really wanting to purchase an As I Am hair product. FINALLY did! The cowash smells good and feels good applying. The cleansing part didn&#x27;t really work for my hair though,OH POO!!! It also wasn&#x27;t a great detangler and it didn&#x27;t really soften my hair either. But I still like it.</li>
            <li> I have type 3a curls, and I need to use some leave-in conditioner after using this cowash (which sort of negates the point, but it&#x27;s still better than using shampoo all the time), but other than that it&#x27;s an effective cleansing agent. You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of it. I&#x27;ve been using it for two months and haven&#x27;t even gone through half yet. It would get five stars if not for the need for additional conditioner, whether it&#x27;s regular conditioning after cowashing or using leave-in after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner. I have thin blond hair and this completely took care of the problem I was having with frizz and split ends.</li>
            <li> Love it! One of the best co wash I ever used! Makes my hair feels soft and smells great! Usually I would need to add a little of my detangling shampoo to my co wash, but this product make it easy for me to detangle my hair with no problem and I do not need to add anything to help with detangling my hair! Would definitely recommend as a co wash!</li>
            <li> I used this produce for a few weeks and experienced a terrible break out on my face, chest and back.  I stop using the product and the break out is clearing but it&#x27;s taking a really long time to go away.  I also had pimples on my scalp.  I also experienced shedding as well.  But the worst was the breakout.  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the coconut oil or the high level of alcohol.  Those with sensitive skin, beware that coconut oil is highly comedogenic (pore blocking).  Check this discussion board....  http://treato.com/Coconut+Oil,Comedo/?a&#x3D;s</li>
            <li> Cleanses well without drying out your hair &amp; it smells nice.</li>
            <li> The closest to Wen I have found and who doesn&#x27;t like coconut? Works great as a co wash for my caucasion, but frizzy and wavy hair.  My only wish? That it was in a pump instead of a jar.  Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> As I Am CoWash is more of a CoWash product than a conditioner. When I used it to condition my hair, it did not give me any slip, and I didn&#x27;t even attempt to detangle my hair with this product. It does have excellent ingredients in it. I will continue to use the product, but as a cowash, not as a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are: Aqueous (Water, Aqua Purificada, Purified) Extracts: Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) and Citrus Reticulata (Tangerine)¹, Cetyl Alcohol², Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol², PEG-40 Castor Oil, Stearlkonium chloride, Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil², Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil¹, Phytosterols¹, Serenoa Serrulata Fruit Extract¹, Quaternium-18, Potassium Sorbate, Fragrance/Parfum, Limonene, Methylisothiazolinone. Source: 1-Natural, 2-Coconut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is:&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin Free&lt;br /&gt;Paraben Free&lt;br /&gt;Protein Free&lt;br /&gt;Silicone Free&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate Free</li>
            <li> I do like conditioning cleansers for my hair.  I loved the scent of this and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have aloe in it.  I didn&#x27;t like how my hair behaved after using it.  I&#x27;m spoiled by another &#x27;co-wash&#x27; that makes my hair wavier, so that may be why I didn&#x27;t like this as much.  It is a quality product, though.  I gave it to a co-worker and I think she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I am a white woman with straight hair. It&#x27;s not frizzy or anything like that, but I like the idea of a cleansing conditioner (since seeing the infomercial for the way overpriced Wen products). I have tried others (L&#x27;Oreal, Ren Pure, Herbal Essence, etc) and like the results. I have to admit that I was a bit reluctant to try this one. I just didn&#x27;t know how it would work on my hair. Anyway, I&#x27;m so glad I tried it. I have only used it once so far, but I really liked it.My hair is shiny, smooth and full of body.To me it didn&#x27;t feel weighed down or oily. I really like what it did to my hair. I&#x27;m always searching and have an open mind for trying products that aren&#x27;t targeted to me. What the hell do marketing people know about hair anyway? lol. Oh yeah... I even like the smell.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best cowash products Ive ever used! I keep this co-wash hidden from my girls bc I love it so much</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m currently on my second jar for a few reasons: my curls are super soft and bouncy after using it, it makes my hair shinier and healthier looking than the competition and my curls dry beautifully. They aren&#x27;t tight or dry, and they don&#x27;t shrink. I barely have to use any other styling product to keep my hair glossy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of co-washes out there, but nothing really hits the spot for my 3B curls like this. Definitely worth the try!</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner!!! Wife won&#x27;t use nothing else. Best results for natural hair wearers.</li>
            <li> I am white with VERY thin pin straight hair that is damaged from highlights. I hate shampooing my hair because nit turns into one giant knot and I have to use half a bottle of expensive conditioner to get the knots out and replenish some moisture. So basically washing my hair takes forever. I got this for $3 at Walgreens last week and was skeptical (but who cares for $3). Anyway, it actually got my hair clean and untangled in one shot! I&#x27;m so excited! After I washed it I thought it may leave my hair greasy looking after I blow dried it but it didn&#x27;t. My hair was SUPER shiny and soft! Great product wish I bought all of them on sale.</li>
            <li> It does work to clean hair (mine gets particularly oily) but it left my hair feeling dry. My hair type is thick and wavy, with some frizz.</li>
            <li> Left my hair clean with a decent scent. Didn&#x27;t foam but that&#x27;s to be expected. Not sure co-washing is right for me.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money. leaver your hair feeling like an oil slick</li>
            <li> Dried out my scalp. I&#x27;ve had an itchy scalp for months since I was using this stuff. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s right for Caucasians. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I use the product daily or every other day. It takes a bit more effort than the average conditioner, but this isn&#x27;t average, anyway!  Smells delicious.  Makes my curls much easier to manage and style</li>
            <li> I was interested in doing the no-poo thing, tried it, hated it, and never gave it another thought.  Came across this cowash and it is absolutely amazing!  I love the way it makes my hair manageable and so soft.  It takes a little getting used to as far as the process of washing your hair, because it obviously doesn&#x27;t lather, but its amazing.  Totally recommend if you&#x27;re tired of all the crap regular shampoos and conditioners leave in your hair!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> The way it smells is pleasant ...it&#x27;s a great detangler. I like the fact that it cow ashes just like it says and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Co-wash is a product that is perfect for if you have dry hair. After one wash my hair was softer. Second time using it I could run a comb through it with no effort. Something I have never been able to do without tangles. Light fragrance and ease of use makes this a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> We use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It leaves her hair very soft and has a nice smell. After using this co-wash, her hair is easy to comb out and has less frizz.  I usually follow up with the leave in conditioner and the hair whip. As I Am products are great!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse/kinky hair and this moisturizes it very well without leaving it too greasy. Will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> this product does wonders for your hair and it smells great too</li>
            <li> my hair falls each time i use this stuff</li>
            <li> my go to cowash for everyday or weekly build up!</li>
            <li> As a past WEN user, I have to say I equally love this cleansing conditioner. It does not have the sweet mint scent that I love from Wen, but it cleanses and conditions my hair just as well. It&#x27;s not quite as thick which I like - makes it easier to spread around. And for the price you just cannot go wrong - it will last me longer than Wen. My hair is straight and highlighted. I usually put a little argan or Moroccan oil  in afterwards.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this item because Wen gets pricey!  It&#x27;s a bit heavy for my hair, which is thin and curly.  I shared with a friend whose hair is thick and kinky, she loved it so much I gave her the container.  She&#x27;s re-ordered, so I guess that&#x27;s a success!</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl with 3B hair texture. I used this for the first time today. It does an excellent job of cleaning the scrap and left my hair really clean. I didn&#x27;t provide as much slip as I expected but maybe that&#x27;s because I did a hot oil treatment prior to applying the coconut cowash. It did however remove all of the build up on my scrap. I was able to detangle with my fingers instead of using a comb. Overall great product and I will buy more from Sally&#x27;s Beauty supply. It&#x27;s only $8.00 their as well as at Walgreens. Amazon has it way overpriced.</li>
            <li> I leave this conditioner in overnight and it works really good on my hair. Hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> It a good product, and it coats the hair well, but its a conditiner, they have a creamy shampoo too. Which works wonders. So this is a product you def can use in between shampoos. It gentle, smell great and has a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> I think the product is good for the most part.  It smells incredible, it is of high quality from what I can tell, but it did not clean my hair to my satisfaction.  I will continue to give it the benefit of doubt as it is my first experience with this type of hair wash.  It is something that is true to its ad.</li>
            <li> I been a WEN users for over 5 years now and been looking and trying all kinds of cheaper versions. This one had great feedback and was a decent price so of course I had to try it. BIG NO! The very first use and my hair was as dry as straw! As I rinsed my hair out and was ready to dry, I could hear my hair squeek when I ran my fingers through it, eeewww. ! Like if I had washed it with Dawn dish soap. My fingers were getting caught in my hair even while washing it. And I&#x27;m a guy with very short hair, so I have no damage! No thank you, It quickly went in the trash. Thinking I would save money, I ended up losing money. I have thin hair but have lots of it! I know it&#x27;s hard to explain but my hair only likes Wen. I even use Wen as a &amp;#34;gel.&amp;#34; My sister got me into it and there is simply no other that can moisturize like Wen. They finally came out with a men&#x27;s Wen and it&#x27;s my go to now. These people must have super dry hair as I don&#x27;t understand how in the world they say it&#x27;s any good? Go ahead and wast your money. The people who don&#x27;t use th best don&#x27;t have the best hair either. I want the best and will pay for it.</li>
            <li> Made my hair a little too greesy, but I can see it being good for hair that&#x27;s more dry than mine.</li>
            <li> Good grief this stuff smells good. I don&#x27;t have curly hair, but I do have bleached over processed hair and I no longer shampoo my hair for those reasons.  This co-wash is great, I use it about every four days, and my hair looks amazing.  It is silky smooth and super shiny. It removes the styling products without stripping the hair of moisture. I&#x27;ve started using the leave in conditioner and styling gel too, those also smell amazing and work great. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this brand, love their products!</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis. So I use a coal tar shampoo followed with this cowash twice a week. The coal tar strips my hair and leaves it brittle. But as soon as I smooth this cowash in, I can tell the difference. It washes away that coal residue and softens and adds shine to my hair. And I love the smell. Great product!</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to when you&#x27;re used to shampoo.  I guess it works okay.  I will have to use it a few more times to adjust to it.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. I am African American and I can really feel the difference between the co-wash and regular shampoo. Co-wash leaves my hair feeling soft and moist and I would highly recommend it for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> wonderful cleansing cowash leaves you hair soft and clean helps remove build ups and hair products. also try conditioner as a follow-up.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for Caucasian hair too. And it&#x27;s cruelty free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this Coconut Cowash for awhile since I had read the great reviews here on Amazon and also on the Naturally Curly forums, but was worried that it would be too heavy for my fine, 2C waves.  I finally picked it up locally a few weeks ago, and I just love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has this amazing coconut smell to it, and it leaves your hair feeling so soft and moisturized.  I&#x27;ve honestly noticed an overall improvement in my hair (which has been really dry lately) since I started using this in place of my regular low-poo.  It&#x27;s helped my dry hair retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use a conditioner after using this, but may not even need to since it really does cleanse and moisturize so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also Curly-Girl-friendly if you don&#x27;t use silicones or sulfates in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has officially replaced the Abba Color Protect Shampoo that I&#x27;ve been using the past few years.  It leaves your hair soft, silky, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Since I have soft textured hair, it easily goes flat if I do not wash it regularly,  Unlike other shampoos that I have used in the past that dries my hair out completely, As I Am cowash is perfect.  I wash my hair every other day by first sectioning my hair in 4 parts.  Afterwards, I apply coconut oil followed by the As I Am cowash.  &#x27;Detangling&#x27; is a breeze.  My hair is extremely soft, moist and obedient now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommended As I Am cowash to my friends, sisters and mom.  Their hair seem to really respond positively to it as well.  My only gripe is with Amazon.  Sorry Amazon.com; but at the As I Am website, I can buy two of these jars for just about what you are charging for one jar ($8.00 each).  You are charging $14.99 per jar.  Really?  Therefore, I will start buying from them until you match your price with theirs.</li>
            <li> The good: I don&#x27;t think the smell is at all offensive but it&#x27;s not something I would rave about either, which to me is a plus. I don&#x27;t like products that have an overpowering sweet or any other flavor of smell. I was my hair about once a week and I like to get my scalp really clean. This does the job well and is also an excellent detangler. It is not very moisturizing however so I do still condition my hair after washing with this product. I have very thick curly hair and one jar will usually last me about a month, which for me is four washes. This is more expensive than my regular shampoo per wash but it is a little easier to swallow the price if you buy this locally for about half the cost that it is here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and would not be without it but I am a little perplexed with their packaging choice. The consistency of this product is about the same as pancake batter so scooping it out of a jar in the shower is a recipe for disaster. I put mine in an old conditioner bottle for shower use and find that it is a lot easier to handle that way. I also find that the price on amazon is typically twice what you would pay at Sally&#x27;s or any other local beauty supply so I would not recommend buying it here.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I was tired of having greasy hair every day after washing it the day before. I have straight caucasian hair. Not a lick of curl or frizz. I got tired of having greasy hair day after washing my hair and thus having to wash it every day.  I tried this because my daughter has a little curl to her hair (and this makes her curls look AMAZING!)  and she was able to go 2-3 days between washes without looking like a greasy mess.  I tried it and love it.  It makes my hair smooth and I can go 2-3 days between washing and NOT have my  hair looking greasy the day after I wash. HUGE plus.  However, I do notice that after a month or so it starts to get more and more greasy between washes. Almost, like there is build up..  So I clarify about once a month with baking soda and water and then immediately right after I do a clarifying wash with baking soda, I use this again and it works great.   I should mention... if you have been using a &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo with silcones and sulfates, it will leave your hair greasy after using this. You need to use a clarifying shampoo free of those ingredients THEN use this...  If you don&#x27;t clarify first... it will leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cleaning, gently but strong. I needed to use another conditioner afterwards, but my hair felt clean and soft.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and really leaves the hair smooth and silky. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I get loads of volume, shine and body. My hair actually has quite a bit of bounce to it after drying and styling with just my blow dryer and a round brush. I will continue to use this product as long as I can get my hands on it.</li>
            <li> This co-wash is the best on the market for african american hair.  My hair is in between a coil and a deep wave and tends to tangle easily.  Once I placed this product on my hair, my hair instantly became more manageable.  I will buy it as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser - nice light coconut scent; not overwhelming and your hair doesn&#x27;t stay greasy afterwards like some cleanser does.&lt;br /&gt;it arrived very fast and just like if you had gone to the store to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and I have used this product and it leaves my hair super clean. I haven&#x27;t washed it in 2 days and isn&#x27;t greasy, when usually it looks a mess. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continued use.</li>
            <li> Smells great I&#x27;ve used it a couple times and already can feel a difference in the texture.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this because of the price tag.  I&#x27;ve heard YouTubers say to purchase a cheaper moisturizing conditioner from brands such as Creme of Nature and Garnier Fructis when co-washing; however, I liked the packaging and the ingredients, so I went for it.  It moisturizes and detangles my 4c hair forgivingly.  This product is now part of my weekly routine.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Works well and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down. Leaves it clean and feeling light. Also takes away some of the frizz I normally have when air drying my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair well but it&#x27;s not a moisturizing as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at Sally&#x27;s because I heard so many good reviews and I have to agree with everyone.  This product makes my 4C hair feel very soft and doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.</li>
            <li> Truly a waste of my money. I bought this in store for 10 USD and tried it once I got home. End result, co-washing isn&#x27;t ok to do often. This left my hair feeling like it was on product over-load, my scalp didn&#x27;t feel refreshed at all. I wouldn&#x27;t even use this between  normal washings with my sulfate free shampoo. I ended up using this on my son&#x27;s hair whose now 8m old. Since infant hair is much finer than an older child&#x27;s and adults hair this worked great for him. For me not so much, I refuse to buy this product again. Cowashes do not properly clean hair, it will only cause product build up as there is no agents in a cowash that removes various oils and dirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;♦ Doesn&#x27;t have harsh detergents&lt;br /&gt;♦ Has a pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;♦ Light texture&lt;br /&gt;♦ Refreshes hair in between washes&lt;br /&gt;♦ If your hair texture is naturally dry, or dry due to damage this can help revive and hydrate the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;♦ Didn&#x27;t detangle my hair&lt;br /&gt;♦ Left my hair feeling like product over load, I &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; my hair with this co-wash after a weeks worth of product build-up. My scalp still had all sorts of various oils and build-up from my curl enhancers.&lt;br /&gt;♦ If your hair texture isn&#x27;t dry or frizzy this can be extremely heavy due to the amount of natural oils listed as ingredients.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and got this over the weekend. Yep...this is definitely a keeper. I used about a palm and a half for my whole head (natural kinky 3c/4a hair, just past shoulders) and I loved it. First, the scent is heavenly (but it doesn&#x27;t linger too much) and it really detangled my hair nicely. The slip was excellent; I didn&#x27;t even really need a comb, just my fingers. I left it in for about 10 minutes and then rinsed it all out. My hair was clean (not squeaky so it didn&#x27;t completely dry it out - which I hate), soft and shiny. I used a diffuser on medium heat for about 5 - 7 minutes, added coconut oil to the ends, detangled again briefly with a Denman Brush and braided for the night. I woke up to beautiful defined curls and no frizz. Will definitely buy this again. Great deal for the money since I&#x27;m sure I could have used less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cowashing for years and wanted to try a new less pricey cleansing conditioner.The smell is fine and the consistency too.It cleans well but I can&#x27;t get over the hair I&#x27;m losing in the shower with this product.I won&#x27;t buy again..just not for me.</li>
            <li> I have been on an 11 year search for something to maintain my child&#x27;s hair.  I have tried several product lines; Mixed Chicks, Carol&#x27;s Daughter and several others.  I even resorted to keratin treatments which reduced my child&#x27;s frustration but never solved the problem.  So I purchased this product, gave her a small container with 4 tablespoons of product and instructions on how to use it.  She finally tried it last night and all she could do was rave about how good her hair felt, how she was able to actually finger comb through one particular tough tangle and how great it smelled.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my younger daughter&#x27;s hair today and was amazed at the slip it provided, how moisturizing it was, as well as the shine and bounce it gave her curls.  Even though I am still relaxing, I will be giving this product line a try as well.</li>
            <li> not bad.  I ordered another jar</li>
            <li> I have mid back length, thick 3B hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based upon the rave reviews on Amazon, Sally Beauty and a few blogs.  It was just okay to me.  It has very little slip.  In fact, I have several other less expensive products that work better as cowash conditioners.  It has a nice smell but doesn&#x27;t detangle particularly well; my $.79 bottle of VO5 Strawberries and Cream Conditioner outperforms this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging could be better.  A bottle with a pump or small spout would be much better to dispense this while washing your hair in the shower.  The round tub was awkard to scoop product from with wet hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not repurchase. It is not bad enough to return so I will finish it.  I have been using the Tresemme Flawless Curls Conditioner as my co-wash staple.  It only costs $4 for a 32 oz bottle and it is twice as good as this product on my curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I have noticed that this product makes my hair bigger and frizzier, like my hair is stripped and in need of a strong deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it smells good. Its use is perfect for what I need. I am glad that Amazon carries these type products</li>
            <li> Meh.  Nothing great, other than the coconut scent.  I ended up putting this one in the trash as well.  Still looking for a product comparable to Wen, without the horrible Wen customer service.</li>
            <li> So I may not have read the part about this product being created for African American ladies when I was looking for a no poo cleansing conditioner that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because I might not have tried it. I&#x27;m Caucasian but have very thick, frizzy, wavy hair. I love this product because it is very moisturizing without being greasy. The coconut/citrusy smell is heavenly! I&#x27;ve even used it on my daughter who has fine, curly hair and it made her curls lovely! I bought it with the As I Am gel, which I also highly recommend! My hair looks shiny and frizz free without looking oily or stiff. I can use just these two products for super simple and fast styling, or I can add a touch of my homemade pomade if I want to make it look a bit more textured. I will absolutely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful on natural curly hair. It&#x27;s light and 100% get the hair clean and conditioned all at once. After rinsing the curls are very defined!</li>
            <li> My hair loves it. I have wavy/curly/fine hair &amp; I live in South Florida- which means it frizzes ALOT. This is my 2nd Cowash product and I definately like it better than the 1st I tried. My hair isnt as frizzy and I dont have to wash it as much. I do have pretty long hair and even though it&#x27;s fine textured, I have alot of it so I have to use more of this than the recommendations suggest. The smell is soothing and not overpowering at all. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually been using this as a regular conditioner. Co-washing seemed like a good idea at the time when I bought this. But I prefer to wash my hair, for reals. So I thought to use this as a regular conditioner &amp; I LOVE it! Conditions well, smells nice. I definitely like it better than the Dove oil care conditioner I had been using.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible (coming from a lover of the smell of coconut products) and mine came with a hard film over the top kind of like paper. I figured it would dissolve once I broke through it but it didn&#x27;t. It doesn&#x27;t even dissolve in your hair or water there were all these flecks of it in the cowash it was awful. Despite all of this I used the entire thing of it just to give it a fair chance and it doesn&#x27;t even work good. It made my hair feel dirty. (I must mention have ethnic hair so you all have an idea of the texture)</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I will ever use on my hair!  Cleans without stripping all the moisture and oils from my hair.  I really love this!</li>
            <li> This works really well! I have thin and greasy blond hair that always snarled in the back and at the ends and it is constantly shedding. This stuff cleans well enough, but doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair and make it brittle.. And the greasiness has all but disappeared! And for the first time in memory, I was able to run my fingers all the way back through my hair, like those girls do in the movies!  If I had tried it a few weeks ago it would have snarled in the back, ripped, and my hand would have come out with fifty hairs on it. I have only seen a few shedded hairs too! I have literally never been so excited about a hair product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cleansing conditioner. I bought this and the Renpure version at the same time to find an alternative to WEN. They are both excellent natural alternatives and I would recommend trying both/either depending on your hair type. My hair is long and very fine and straight... Plus I live in the desert so my hair can get very straw like straw easily... Or many products can be too heavy and make it greasy... I think As I Am is might be slightly better than Renpure for my hair type but both are good in my opinion. I&#x27;ve also tried HairOne and found it to have a lot of residue.... Plus it&#x27;s ingredients aren&#x27;t as natural as As I Am.... Worth a try!</li>
            <li> I ordered this too try on my semi-relaxed hair. It had done wonders, I have highlights and I find that this product is very gentle even when de tangling my hair in the shower, smells wonderful; I just hopped the aroma was long lasting :)... the only issue is the I need to use a generous amount to accomplish the cleansing and conditioning although, I have shoulder lengthy hair :/.... will be ordering more for myself and my mom :) ...will definitely recommend :)!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it&#x27;s such a pain to manage. I have tried so many different types of products. I even tried washing my hair with baking soda and apple cider vinegar (not a great idea as it messes with the hair&#x27;s pH balance). I had been using a sulfate free shampoo/conditioner combo, and my hair was still very unmanageable and dry. I found Pantene&#x27;s co-wash and gave that a shot. It gave my hair moisture, but after a few hours my hair got very itchy. I checked the ingredient list and verified my suspicions that it contained silicones (if you are familiar with the curly girl method this is a big no no). Then I did some research and found this product highly recommended. It came in on time and well packaged, and I tried it out immediately. Honestly, as soon as I tried this product I was ready to chunk all of my other shampoos, conditioners, styling gels, etc. in the garbage. My hair is getting the moisture it needs. It&#x27;s manageable, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Where can I start.... Just AMAZING !!!! I just realized that shampoo shouldn&#x27;t be used much on black peoples/ 4abc hair textures. People recommend cowashishng and since I am a 4b/c they recommended this for me. It&#x27;s amazing, my hair is softer than ever and it makes detangling a breeze. I am going through a transition to natural hair and my hair looks beatiful and healthy. Sadly I can still see my relaxed hair just hanging there so I will chop it off soon. Nevertheless, this conditioner is great for 4a,4b,4c hair textures in particular. You will probably see results in the 2nd or 3rd wash. Only thing is, depending on how much hair you have the jar can run out quick. My hair goes pass my shoulders so the jar lasted about two washes. Regardless it&#x27;s a great price 6$-8$ whenever you catch it. It&#x27;s worth it. I also recommend the leave in conditioner, it&#x27;s also helpful (the bottle can last 2 months or so depending on how you use it)&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this soon, it&#x27;s a life saver. Awesome results in just a short amount of time. My hair feels heathy and has an amazing shine to it now. I am also now very happy for wash day.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I don&#x27;t know what my hair felt like when I was a baby but I&#x27;m assuming it felt like this. I&#x27;m in love with this stuff. I have used it twice this week and have only put virgin coconut oil in my hair with it and my 3c curly coils are soft and shiny. I am definitely not going back to shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I have tried most of the cowash products out there, and this is definitely a winner. Great slip, no heavy residue and my tangles (which are horrible) slide right out. I have full highlights, fine Caucasian hair that has been straightened with keratin and is past BS length. The scent is not my style but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger, so I can live with it.</li>
            <li> This co-wash smells good and washes/conditions ok, however if you tend to have an oily scalp, you&#x27;ll likely need to use this product daily. I have medium to thick hair and I color my hair. I would prefer (and try) to wash every other day, but  after using As I Am, I feel my scalp needs to be cleaned by the end of the day. For the rest of my hair,  especially the ends, I&#x27;m not convinced this product does a good job conditioning. My hair is easy to comb out after washing with the product, but once my hair is dry, I&#x27;d say I still have potential for frizzies, but I use another product to smooth out the frizzies. I&#x27;ve been using As I Am for over 2 weeks and I feel I&#x27;ve given it a good test drive. I&#x27;m not inclined to make another purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the reviews from other african american women, but it fell short of the praise.  I will have to find someone to give this away.  I rather found other products that work much better.  Also, I prefer to deep condition rather than cowash; that infuses my hair with so much moisture.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it on pork tenderloin....I rub it on the day before....Cook it in my griller to 145 degrees....cut it with a fork and stays juicy!</li>
            <li> Great Great Great for my daughter hair.It smells wonderful!!!!!I read good reviews about as I am coconut cowash.grrreat stuff.I will be trying on my hair.</li>
            <li> smells really good and it leaves my hair really soft.  i add more cocunut oil to it for extra shine.</li>
            <li> This cowash not only cleans my hair but leaves it soft to the touch. I follow with my kimmaytube leave in and I&#x27;m good to go...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with straight hair and this product works awesome for me. I have gotten tons of compliments about how full and shiny my hair looks. It&#x27;s easy to comb and feels very soft. No buildup either. The only downside is the price, but I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday so it&#x27;s doable.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and allergy for chemical. That conditioner make my hair soft and not so dry.I like it very much</li>
            <li> I have dense, natural afro-textured curly/kinky hair (4b/4c). I thought cowashes were a gimmick (why not just use cheap conditioner to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34;). I was wrong. This product cleansed all of the build-up out and it allowed me to wash my hair in the shower with just one lather and no need for additional conditioning. I used this, followed up with my favorite leave-in conditioner, moisturized and stretched my hair and then went to bed. I woke up with clean, soft and springy coils. I think this 16 ounce size will last me about 10 washes, which is great. I recommend this for dry, curly/kinky hair and for any person who wants to keep their routine simple. This is a great product if you work out frequently and want to keep your hair clean, but not stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> Pros: *The scent is delicate&lt;br /&gt;*It contains mostly natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;*Truly maintains, adds and retains moisture as mentioned on label.&lt;br /&gt;*Sulfate, silicone, paraben free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:*The jar packaging allows for easy spilling and when used In  the shower ; the water can sometimes get in the product even when placed fairly distant from the running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The packaging also makes the product less hygienic.(but I suppose if one person alone is using the product it is not the biggest of deals. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s cleansing capabilities weren&#x27;t so great-at least for me.No matter how much I firmly massaged the product into my scalp, I was left with build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently trying to finish it up by mixing it with a sulfate shampoo (I pour both products into my hand and mix) I have so that I can get my hair cleaner but have some of the dryness reduced (this has been a very successful use of this product :).I will not likely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and definitely gets the job done. I have very fine, straight, color-treated hair that I prefer to shampoo only once a week, so using a cowash lets me stretch that even longer. This was my first product specifically made for cowashing and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;It smells yummy, like tropical fruit and coconut, without being cloyingly sweet, and the scent lingers just a little without much projection.&lt;br /&gt;It has  a light, almost gel-like texture, and distributes into hair easily. Massaged into the scalp it noticeably loosens any dandruff flaking and has a very slight cooling/tingling sensation that is very refreshing. It didn&#x27;t do much for me in terms of in-shower detangling, but that&#x27;s not really something I do anyway (just makes my hair spring up and break).&lt;br /&gt;Used alone, with no conditioner or leave-in after, my hair felt smooth, light, and very clean once dry. Within a few hours my hair did feel a little dry, though, so those with dehydrated hair would probably benefit from some extra moisture after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is, predictably, it takes quite a bit to be able to get clean, especially on long hair. I used about half a handful on my hip-length hair and it was barely enough. I would advise mostly using it on the roots unless you use quite a lot of product on the lengths of your hair, since otherwise you will probably find yourself going through this jar fairly quickly. It&#x27;s worth it, regardless.</li>
            <li> I was using shea moisture products for a while (which I really liked) but they stopped selling them in my local store. When I looked online for them they were far more expensive than what I used to pay for them so I decided to give this cowash a try. I had heard really good things about this product and now having tried it for myself I can say they are all true. I have like 3b curly hair and my hair tends to get so dry or the curls will look awful when I do not use stuff that works for my hair but this product definitely does. It leaves my hair super soft with extremely defined curls. I would have to say I even like this product better than my shea products and it smells fantastic. I literally could eat it with how it smells! You also do not need a lot of this product for it to go along way which is great as well! I would highly recommend this for anyone who is considering transitioning out of shampoo, with curly hair, or both.</li>
            <li> I have fine then hair and I have transitioned from perm to natural.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not leave a film on my hair like I thought it would like some conditioners I have used in the past. This was my first time trying a co wash product and it cleansed my hair after having 1 week worth of product buildup and ecostyler gel. Only complaint is I wish it would have more of a fragrant smell since it is a cowash product but other than that it was Great!</li>
            <li> I purchased, Curl clarity Shampoo, Coconut  Cowash, Leave-in Conditioner, twist Define cream, moisture milk and Double butter cream. I regret this decision being as though i have been Natural for 7 years, my hair was strong and growing beautifully &amp; now it is dry and brittle and breaking off.  I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t  dry out hair or strip my haircolor.  Use it more than shampoo. Love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I use this product and although it is nice my hair cannot handle the chemicals. After i use this my scalp itches and burn and its a terrible feeling. But it does feel clean after i use it, i would recommend it to people who might night have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, very dry curly hair. This has been the longest, coldest winter I&#x27;ve experienced since moving to this state and I just couldn&#x27;t handle my super dry, static hair anymore. I&#x27;ve used this co-wash 3 times now. I can go 4 days without washing my hair and it does not get greasy any faster than with my old shampoo. My hair is softer &amp; shinier, but my curls are definitely less defined. I dyed my hair yesterday and saw no negative effects from prior use of this co-wash. I will continue to use this and will most likely use normal shampoo once a month from now on. Very good product, worth every penny &amp; smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> this product really works for my hair, i love the smell. i bought this product for 8 dollars in the beauty supply so amazon has it over priced</li>
            <li> Leaves hair clean and soft. I love it. One product is faster to use on my kids and it smells yummy.</li>
            <li> i love it, makes my hair so smooth</li>
            <li> It smells really good,&lt;br /&gt; you don&#x27;t need to use shampoo with it&lt;br /&gt; it can make ur hair 2 inches longer in 24hr&lt;br /&gt;This is worth more than 5 stars 👍🏽</li>
            <li> As an adult, my hair has been kind of coarse, kind of wavy, and when short and in humidity, curly, but not good-curly but bad-curly, dry, haystack, and sometimes (when I want it wavy or curly) straight, but not good-straight.  Haystack-like.  Very, very bad hair.  Since using this non-sudsing (so, non-detergent) co-wash, I will not use anything else on my hair.  When I ran out the first time, I decided to use up some product I had, so I mixed a little shampoo and alot of conditioner in my hand and cleaned my hair with that.  Even as accustomed to bad hair as I am, I did not want to leave the house for days until the natural oils came back.  So I just ordered two tubs of this stuff so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running low for a nice long while.  This is the only product that does not leave my hair like a horrible hay stack.  If you are a person who likes her hair better the second or even third day after shampooing, you will like this product for sure.  I also like that I use less water because I don&#x27;t have to rinse and rinse the shampoo, then rinse and rinse the conditioner.  (I live in drought-stricken LA).  It is quick and easy, leaves my hair easy to manage and looking the best that it can.  After blotting with the towel, I use some of the same brand leave-in conditioner for a little extra body.  I am finished experimenting, and I hope to use this for the rest of my life.  Oh, another major plus: natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great! I have to use a little more than I thought to detangle my hair, but it does work.  My hair is so smooth and silky! Sometimes I just use this instead of shampoo.  There is a lot of this and it&#x27;ll last a long time!  I want to get a pump container since twisting this open is a pain.  The outside likes to chip off, so another reason I want to put it in a pump for my bathtub.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Keeps my natural curls soft and manageable. The leave in conditioner is great too. Best alternative to Wen.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE May 6, 2016. Price was $6.79, now it&#x27;s double?????!!! Why?</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 4 stars is because it is hard to use in the shower. A pump bottle would have gotten it 5 starts.</li>
            <li> I guess this product isn&#x27;t really for ethnic hair, it really drys my hair out, but it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> This product works well to give my hair the slip it needs in order to detangle it while I cleanse.  The scent is nice and the price is very affordable.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> what can i say?? this product is AMAZING, wish it came in a gallon, otherwise it softened my weave very nicely and smelled delicious!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! I have very dry thick hair which LOVES to frizz out to the point its unmanageable!! This product reduced the frizz by 80% . and its so cheap! It also smells great! I would definitely recommend to others with dry frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It cleanses all the gel that I use in my hair and leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product it makes my curly hair soft, shiney and tangle free. I have used Wen&#x27;s Cowash and I like this product better.</li>
            <li> OMGosh where I start this co-wash is amazing. The texture isn&#x27;t thick and a little really goes along way, and the smell is just wonderful! I used the co-wash for my virgin hair extensions and my natural hair both are so silky soft. I only left the co-wash on for five minutes and it washed out so easily. I when I straighten my hair both my extensions and natural hair were so soft like I just left the hair shop, I normally use biosilk to give my hair a shine, but after using the coconut co-wash no need to add anything extra to my hair. I highly recommend this co-wash!</li>
            <li> I have tried thousands of dollars worth of products.  I can say this is the best no poo or shampoo I have ever used.  I have huge, huge, massive hair that has gone from frizz ball to a shiny mane.  Thank you whoever invented this stuff.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry. I read many good reviews about this product but in my case it was a fiasco. It says you can detangle your hair but it didn&#x27;t. I had to use another conditioner for that. My type of hair is kind of curly kind of kinky so if it works on kinky hair I don&#x27;t understand what happened on mine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I just stumbled upon this by barely noticing a few raving comments about it at another site.  I went down to my local Sally&#x27;s, really doubting they would have this gem all the way out here in Hawaii, but turns out Sally&#x27;s inventory rocks way out here as well, and it even cost less than online.  Wow.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of hair I have, I am mixed, white and puerto rican, and the hair is all sorts of crazy curly with a serious case of multi-personality disorder.  Zig zags, curls, spirals, straight, fine yet dry, moiture-resistant and the list goes on.  Anyway, I tried it and immediately loved it. My mouth literally dropped when I used it in the shower.  My hair felt soft, conditioned *and* clean. How it does that is amazing.  Like many, I have spent a small fortune trying a myriad of products for my hair.  No more searching for the right cleanser/conditioner product. I am a lifelong user from here on out -- I almost want to purchase 50 jars just to make sure I have years and years worth of product in case they ever go out of business! LOL  I have never had anything so wonderful on my hair before, not any of the high-end salon stuff, nothing from Sephora -- NOTHING feels and works as well as this.  Unless you have your own holy grail of wash/condition, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seems to leave a lot of residue behind.  Hair does feel much softer and smoother and looks healthier but I like the squeaky clean feeling which this doesn&#x27;t provide.  Personally don&#x27;t care for the scent either.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, I will never use shampoo again.  just as it says it&#x27;s a cleansing and conditioning cowash.  I could feel my hair........so well conditioned and clean.  it&#x27;s really good for dryness&lt;br /&gt;I noticed with this product I have less breakage.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product, It smells heavenly and I am so happy I found it.  I use it weekly as well as the cleanser and intense conditioner.  Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b hair and I love this.  This makes more coils in my hair than the other conditioner I used as my cowash (and I was pretty happy with that conditioner). I can not say enough about it.  I feel like I died and went to heaven after using this. It makes wash day an exciting event for me. I currently have TWO backups under my sink, so I can be sure not to run out. And it smells delicious! AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I love this cowash. It leaves my hair clean and really soft. check out my blog for a detail review. [...]</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this product! I bought this product a few months ago on a whim &amp; I have used it every since! I use it after deep conditioning &amp; I love it! It has a lovely smell &amp; turns my hair into silk!</li>
            <li> I am trying to go more days in between washing. I have 2c/b wavy hair that&#x27;s color treated. Detangle??? What a joke. This thing stripped my hair so much it felt like seaweed and it became matted!! I had to use soo much of my joico conditioner... It didn&#x27;t even penetrate my hair. So then I used a deep treatment mask by shea moisture... Even after 5 minutes still seaweedy! So I added some more joico and it helped a little. After I got out of the shower I had to spray, and spray, and spray, and spray, and spray.... Leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly this would make a terrific clarifying shampoo... I mean I don&#x27;t see how that thing is gentle at all. Might as well throw some pert on your hair and leave that in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I can return this...</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. I only wish it came in a pump instead of a tub but that&#x27;s an easy fix at home.  I have thick, long, double processed dry, dry, dry, blonde hair. This stuff make it shiny, soft and smells great!! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair. It works great. I may need to purchasse another soon. Smells good and makes my hair feel really good. It cleans the hair better than shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this product three weeks ago. Honestly, I had no clue whether or not it would work, but it did. The cowash cleans your hair and leaves it soft. I love this and I use it all the time!!! Great BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I have long blonde, baby-fine hair that breaks easily at the ends. I use a tiny bit in the daytime if the weather is very dry. At night, it is a great balm to leave on.  It&#x27;s not necessary to make the hair too greasy with it.  I use just enough so that I don&#x27;t look like a grease-ball to my husband.  He said he doesn&#x27;t mind it, and the coconut smell is not offensive.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for rinsing out henna applications to hair. Super gentle, conditioning and gets all the grit out. I use it nearly every day as well. Slight buildup occasionally, and with thick hair, I go through this fairly quickly but overall, awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this product it made my hair so soft to the touch and also did not tangle my natural 4c hair.  I will definitely purchase this again one of my staple products since I became natural.</li>
            <li> I have used this only three times.  So far I do like it.  Cleans my hair ans scalp without drying,</li>
            <li> Nice for natural hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different co-washes now on my wavy, somewhat course hair and this is by far my favorite. The price is right and the ingredients seem to be natural. This product has a very good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; which means my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle and feels very smooth, yet clean when rinsed out. I use an apple cider vinegar rinse to be sure there isn&#x27;t any residue left behind. Other washes I&#x27;ve tried leave a heavy residue, but this product works great and washes clean. I&#x27;ve found that one jar lasts me about a month and a half when used every four days.</li>
            <li> This is really a great cowash.  The price is sooooooo disrespectful to your wallet though.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it but it just didn&#x27;t work for me; it just doesn&#x27;t clean as well as shampoo and leaves buildup.  I use it now as an in-between wash if I know I have to shower 2 days in a row (like after a festival or if I&#x27;m doing the gym 2 days in a row) but the best thing is still  to wash every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got coily 3c curls that really need moisture so I&#x27;ve gone the cowash route, and this product knocks it out of the park.  Just fabulously moisturizing and leaves my hair feeling so fresh, clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it to a friend to try who has straighter hair and it weighed her hair down too much.  We did, however, wash her little cockapoo dog with it because that Lola gets dry, itchy skin but loves to run around in the woods and get dirty.  Now she can use this on Lola and the itching has calmed down.</li>
            <li> I have long curly caucasian hair that tangles easily and gets matted. I use a sulfate free wash and comb my hair out in the shower, I then rinse and apply AS I AM and comb it through; I allow this product to sit in my hair for a while, as I shave my legs, and then rinse it out. This leaves my hair smelling and feeling great. I comb my hair out of the shower and apply CHI silk treatment. My hair is light weight, silky, and frizz/ flyaway free. This product is a must have.</li>
            <li> Tried this in my quest to finally tame my daughters curls.  It smells wonderfully her hair is soft, but not appreciably softer than using a lot of OTC conditioners and / or a leave in conditioner.  It probably is great for many people, and we&#x27;ve enjoyed using it, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 3c/4a coily natural who has up until now abused my hair with sulfates. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson after trial and error and learned about this product from another natural friend. I was a bit scared about using the cowash because I wasn&#x27;t sure about how it would get my hair clean. First I sprayed my hair with water and then added a silver amount to my 2 1/2 inch hair. The smell is great since I love coconut so much. I rinsed the product out and bam my hair was clean but still felt moisturizer. I added my water and vegetable glycerin, did my baggy method and went to sleep. This morning my hair is very moisturized and clean. Please consider buying this product it is a great staple for your natural hair care collection.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great, and a little goes a long way. After rinsing, I normally re-apply a bit as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do anything noticeable for my hair. I gave it away hoping someone else would benefit from it.  My hair is too finicky</li>
            <li> My hair is normally dry and it&#x27;s naturally curly. If I apply the conditioner and use it the way the Wen Cleansing Conditioner instructs, I get great results. My hair is shiny and soft. However, recently I had my medium brown hair highlighted blonde. After two washings with this product, my hair and hightlights are now strawberry blonde. Some asked if I colored my hair again. If you don&#x27;t highlight your hair or you&#x27;re not a blonde, it may work well for you.</li>
            <li> When I first used this co wash in my hair, I had to get used to the coconut smell, because I&#x27;m not fond of coconuts. When I washed it out afterwards, my hair felt so soft and I could see my curls look squeaky clean? Lol, but overall, this is the best co wash so far and I will always buy this product.</li>
            <li> I truly love this. I did my big chop July 6 2013 I&#x27;ve became a product junkie but I love this product. Also the way it cleanses my daughter hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t all that crazy about this co-wash. My hair always felt like I&#x27;d washed it with shampoo (i.e. stripped) after using it. I&#x27;ll use it up but won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I apply it to dry hair the day before I wash my hair or wear it on my hair for at least a couple of hours as a co-wash or pre-poo.( Dont forget a shower cap).  It really softens my 4c hair and makes it supple and easy to manipulate.  It smells wonderful and I recommend it to naturalistas.  Excellent product!!![[ASIN:B00641UCY8 As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner, 16 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I mean I was really skeptical reading all of the great reviews; I am a 4b/4c/4z texture hair. I usually use u-part wigs to keep my hair protected. In the middle of the week, I try to do a moisturizing deep condition due to the change in weather (it&#x27;s getting colder) and my low porosity hair, it is almost impossible to retain moisture in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I stumbled across this product. While reading these reviews, I thought &amp;#34;but will it work on my tightly coiled hair, tho?!&amp;#34;  The answer is yes. This is great. I actually don&#x27;t think I needed to do my usual deep condition after washing with this because my hair was soooooo soft; not like &amp;#34;eww there is a product sitting on top of my hair&amp;#34; soft, but a &amp;#34;cuticles are laid, honey&amp;#34; soft. I&#x27;m so thankful I cam across this product. I purchased mine at the local store because it was 40-50% less;  I also did like 3 washes with this ( I use a lot of oils for growth), and my hair was still not stripped. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse frizzy hair and I can&#x27;t use shampoos with lots of bubbles because it makes the frizz worse. Some of the sulfate frees don&#x27;t clean well or take alot to  work. This pot lasts me a month and a half, keeps my hair silky and clean!</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and this conditioner does not cause excess oils like other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> I am a 60+ year old male with very fine, straight hair. This product is excellent for cleaning and conditioning and seems to have reduced the amount of hair that ends of in my comb or  in my sink.  Should be great for children because it doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes. My wife loves it because it doesn&#x27;t take the coloring out of her hair as quickly as a similar, much more expensive and better known product.</li>
            <li> This product has been a staple since I first started growing my hair 2 years ago, it&#x27;s even better now with Amazon Prime&#x27;s subscription service so I never have to worry about running out.</li>
            <li> I used this product because I am a product junkie for natural hair. The one thing I can say about this product is that it did make my hair very soft. BUT I felt like it didn&#x27;t condition enough. I still lost a lot of hair during the combing out process. That could be due to my using Kinky Curly and my hair not being combed for a week. All in all. I do recommend it. But please be sure to use a dentangling condintioner with this Co-Wash. I have 4B hair so my hair gets really curly when wet. I believe if you use this along with a dentangling conditioner you will not be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the company should do to help make this product easier for usage is to manufacture the bottle that comes with a hand pump. It is far too messy trying to scoop it in your hand to apply in the shower. I had to buy a bottle from Sally&#x27;s to make it much more easy for application.</li>
            <li> I think you are either a co-wash person or not.  I happen to love co-wash products, and have found As I Am Cowash to be a particularly good one.  I don&#x27;t have to use as much as I did with similar products, and my hair has really improved in terms of brittleness, dryness, etc since using this.  Unlike other reviewers, my hair stayed clean between washings.</li>
            <li> I do not appreciate purchasing items solicited as NEW, when product was received with self-printed label marked NEW. When I opened container product was missing seal that most NEW hair products have, in order to keep product in the container and fresh.(When I took off lid liquid spoiled out) I will definitely not be purchasing any other products from seller BeautyOnline!!</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to not having a lather when shampooing, but I really like how this leaves my hair and scalp feeling -- nice and clean, but not dried out; I seem to be having less breakage than before.  Nice fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I decided to do a modified curly girl method and I wanted to just a cleanser not just conditioner for my cowashing.  I thought this did a great job on my hair.  I have been using it for about 3 weeks, once a week and I am noticing that my hair is becoming softer and more hydrated.  I also use on my little girl&#x27;s hair and their hair loves it.  I have what would be considered curly to coily hair.  I&#x27;m guessing if I had to put a hair type label on my hair I would say its 4 b or c.  I also tried the Hydration Elation and that is awesome too.  This will be a staple product for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. Myself, my daughters &amp;amp; my mom use it. We all have fine hair that&#x27;s prone to dryness, breakage, yet oily scalp. This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> a whole lot of fruity yumminess andfresh clean hair with a slip!  a staple in my beautu bag. enjoy yinz</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair is fine and tends to split at the ends and gets dried out if I shampoo too much. I love using this cowash--I just avoid my scalp or I look a little greasy after. Love that it&#x27;s vegan too--no animal products, and it smells great! :)</li>
            <li> This junk is like slathering oily mud on your hair.  The most disgusting product I have ever used.  I can&#x27;t believe this product receives any positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!!! I was introduced by it by my best friend who is in the making of owning her own hair business and I am so glad! I am steal dealing with moisture issues sooooo I will most def by their products for that problem, they have a few to choose from, cant wait, so excited :)&lt;br /&gt;Note: No matter what you put in your hair, it can be thee very best in the world, if I don&#x27;t get it stuck in my head that I have to trim my dead ends off every few weeks or so in order to see improvement in my hair texture and growth I am going to freak&#x27; n lose it, Trim dammit, trim LOL!</li>
            <li> this is amazing ! two washes and my hair is completely transformed. i would usually have to blow dry it instead of letting it air dry so it would be combable (type 4c) but after washing with this i condition and apply shea butter leave in conditioner and i am saying goodbye to the blow dryer. it makes it soft and manageable. definitely a keeper and a good price !</li>
            <li> I have found this product unusual because I am so use to soapy suds to clean.  This cleans without a lot of suds and my hair remains soft.  I&#x27;m liking it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been going natural for about 2 years and i bought this product out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay but i tend to like my cowashes to be a little thicker in substance... this stuff kind of runs right out of your hand...&lt;br /&gt;it shipped quickly though! and was in great condition when it was delivered</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS EVERYTHING!!.....I USE IT IN THE SHOWER TO WASH MY HAIR AND MY HAIR ACTUALLY GETS CLEAN AND CONDITIONED AND SOFT AND EASY TO COMB!!!</li>
            <li> This co-wash is awesome.  IT has a well-balanced texture and leaves my hair soft and well-moisturized. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have brought this twice and I have to say I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. Love the smell but hate how you have to scoop it out the jar. Most of it ends up in the tub than on my hair. But my main issue with this produce is every time I use it my scalp is left itching. I read some where else online about this product and they said the same thing.  I&#x27;m going to finish the jar I have now cause I hate throwing away money, but this is the absolute last time I buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving the product 3 stars for the smell only, it smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cowash for over a month now, and despite the good reviews here, I did not have a good experience with this product.  It highly irritated my scalp, causing scalp sores and open wounds, so now I have to discontinue it, throw the rest away, and purchase selsun blue.  I&#x27;m not sure why I had this reaction, but just a warning to others if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Moisterizes my hair without drying it out like shampoo. I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I use Wen, and wanted to use it on my daughter but its so expensive that I wanted to find a more economical way. Not that her hair is less important, but she&#x27;s 3 and how it makes her hair style is not yet important. Anyhow, this was perfect--great smell--works as good/better than Wen. I feel like it leaves less residue.&lt;br /&gt;When all the Wen I have in my closet is gone I will be switching myself---hoping it comes in other scents because even though I like the coconut smell, I&#x27;d like something a little less summery in the fall and winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it, would purchase again</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product</li>
            <li> Very good price.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times so far.  I alternate between this and regular shampoo.  I don&#x27;t notice anything particularly great about this co-wash.  I don&#x27;t love it or hate it, just meh about it.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again.  It smells nice and has a creamy texture.  I am going to continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells amazing, cleans hair without drying and also conditions at the same time. I am hooked..</li>
            <li> 3c/4a hair, low porosity.&lt;br /&gt;This has easily become my favorite conditioner. It smells fantastic, is mild enough for daily use and makes detangling SO easy and the price is great. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and plan to have this product become a permanent part of my routine.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels afterwards. Since I started using this ive gotten stuck on this cowash. I love it.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product and my hair feels amazing! I have thick hair wavy but was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t harsh. I found this and I am in love plus it is the right price at sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use it yet but my daughter said it great,she use it and I know I will love it</li>
            <li> Great product that cleans the hair. It smells nice (not a must but a great bonus). The only issue I have that leaves it 4 out of 5 stars is that it spilled during shipment. It did not leak enough for a return...just left a bit of a mess. I would hope that they would ship this in a better way.</li>
            <li> My hair responded very well to this product, My Hair was very Clean and shiny. Thank you As I Am,  I will pruchase again.</li>
            <li> Love the product, hate the tub.. This needs to be in a pump bottle or a squeeze tube,,</li>
            <li> I have very dry, chemically damaged hair and its a short cut pixie. My first use of this in place of shampoo, followed by Aussie strong 3 minute miracle, my hair has NOT felt so soft and manageable in a loooong time! So yes, I would recommend, and I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff melts my curls! I love it! Great for my African-American 4A hair!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice to cowash my human hair weave. The hair was great quality. Both times, this product caused the hair to mat and dried it out. I decided to use a different conditioner to test if this was a fluke. The other conditioner, a Loreal sulfate-free conditioner for curly hair, was a total difference. The hair was moist and did not mat at all. So while I can&#x27;t speak to how this product would work on natural hair, I would use this with a weave at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t decide between As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner &amp; Eden BodyWorks Coconut Shea Cleansing Cowash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both to compare. I gave away the As I Am and have been using Eden&#x27;s cowash exclusively for the past 4 months. Eden is now a staple of mine and I highly recommend it. At the time I was transitioning from relaxed hair (I am now fully natural again). Below is my initial review of both products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sectioned two tiny sections and used each product on their own small section. I smoothed it on my natural hair, relaxed hair, and scalp, rubbing gently. Then rinsed with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner - Sally Beauty $4.99 (coupon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thicker than Eden&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Smooths on well, very thick&lt;br /&gt;Some lather when rinsing&lt;br /&gt;Great slip!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans relaxed hair well&lt;br /&gt;Cleans natural hair well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eden BodyWorks Coconut Shea Cleansing Cowash - Sally Beauty $4.99 (coupon)&lt;br /&gt;Thinner consistency&lt;br /&gt;Smooths on well, med thickness&lt;br /&gt;Little to no lather that I could tell (lathers a bit  the more you use and work into hair)&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;Good slip!&lt;br /&gt;Cleans natural hair well&lt;br /&gt;Cleans relaxed hair ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, both products are very similar. But if I had to chose just one, Eden wins. I like the consistency a bit more, it smells better, and when my small section dried, it was moisturized without product, whereas As I Am was kind of drier, but nothing horrible. I think they are both good choices, but come time to repurchase, I will only buy Eden! (I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and already purchased a second of Eden).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side Note: A lot of people complain about the jar storage for the product. I don&#x27;t have a problem with this since I don&#x27;t prep and wash my hair under the actual shower. I like to section and wash hair in the mirror, rinse under the tub faucet, condition, and do things around my house while my hair conditions, then do the final rinse in the shower. So the jar storage doesn&#x27;t sit in my actual shower, but is stored under my sink where I actually like to do my hair. If I used it in the shower I would put some of it in a separate container for ease of use. I hope this review was helpful.e in the shower.

            <li> I can detangled my hair and wash it perfect for my transition to natural I love that it&#x27;s light weight and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product. it smells so good and my hair really enjoys it. I don&#x27;t think I leave it in long enough so I have to give it a few more tries.</li>
            <li> Too thick, it just keep my scalp increase the oily feel</li>
            <li> Hi, I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman, 58 years old, and I&#x27;ve had problems with dry, frizzy hair all my life.  Two months ago I started using co-wash conditioner, and it has helped tremendously. As others said, my hair sometimes appears greasy a couple of days after using it, but then I use the As I Am shampoo and the leave in conditioner, and I&#x27;m good to go.  It is fantastic to use a product that doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry brittle hair.  The only problem I have with this product is that I may have an allergy to it.  I hope not, since I&#x27;ve loved my hair since using it, but I have a very itchy scalp, and my skin seems to be reacting as well.  Typically, this time of year in Arizona, I have an itchy scalp.  Any trip to the hairdresser leaves me scratching for a few days. So I&#x27;m not giving up on As I Am.  Instead, I&#x27;m trying an olive oil/coconut oil/tea tree oil combo on my scalp, which will hopefully stop the itches!  My hair has never before been shiny, smooth and manageable as it is now that I&#x27;m using As I Am.</li>
            <li> I use this often and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Smells so good!!!!!  I will buy again when this one is done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this cowash and it&#x27;s all true! This cowash is thick and creamy, provides a lot of slip and allows me to finger detangle my tightly curly/coily hair without any issues. It smells wonderful and really cleans my hair well without drying it out or causing it to feel too stripped. Really great product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Incredible. My hair had been breaking off at the ends and super dry ever since I decided to go natural a couple of months ago. Not to mention, it was just Hell detangling. After using it this afternoon my hair has done a complete 180. This magic potion instantly untangled my hair as I was combing through it. I also could instantly feel my natural curls after drying. Will be a lifetime user.</li>
            <li> Here are the basics about me: I am in my mid-twenties, white, and have 3A and very low porosity hair. After having two surgeries in the past 4 years, my hair was shot. It was super dry, breaking, split-ends, awful! I chopped my hair twice in hopes it would grow healthy, but nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about going with the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; movement and using baking soda/vinegar. After doing that a few times, my hair started to look a lot healthier. However, I&#x27;m pregnant again...and not only is the vinegar smell a bit overwhelming right now, I sort of want to feel a bit pampered in the shower (especially after the new baby comes). Maybe that&#x27;s selfish, but showering is my only means of alone time most days and I really don&#x27;t get excited to shower with baking soda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho...I started doing tons of research to try to figure out how to bring my hair back. I quickly realized that with curly hair, you just have to find a product that works for you because no one product works the same for everyone. I narrowed it down between this and Shea Moisture, and since this one was on sale at Walgreens I figured I&#x27;d try it first. I am SO glad I did! After only one shower, my hair is completely different. I put it on, massaged it in, and then clipped it up while I washed up. I massaged it again a little bit, combed through it with my fingers (it definitely detangled my hair) and then rinsed it out. I put some of the As I Am leave in conditioner in and then scrunched in flaxseed gel, and allowed my hair to air dry. Now that my hair is fully dry, I can tell you this stuff works! My hair is by no means healthy in one shower, but seriously, it looks totally different! It is actually trying to curl again (versus looking more wavy like it has been lately), is less frizzy, and feels really soft. I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair in a ponytail or braid for months because it looked so unhealthy, and even as it looks now, I am willing to start wearing it down again! I am ridiculously happy with this product, and am so glad I decided to try it!</li>
            <li> I will be buying this over and over. I did not order this on amazon, the five stars is for the product. My hair before using this: long wavy and fine, dreads when I sleep and throughout the day. Proofs and frizzes when I wash it, impossible to detangle when wet, dull and was seriously considering cutting it off.&lt;br /&gt; I was recently a little late for work because of my hair. When I got to work I explained to my male African manager. Thinking that he wouldn&#x27;t understand (he is a man) and probably better to fib a reason but honesty paid here. I told him I washed my hair and it took me so long to comb through the tangled frizzy mess that I get when I shampoo, explaining I wash twice a week for this reason.  He laughed and said, &amp;#34;you sound like a black girl, my girl, my ma and sisters always be b#*ching about washing their hair. I am white girl. A few days later I am at Target looking for a hair miracle when I stumble on the product section aimed at African women. Light bulb moment!  I picked up this Coconut CoWash and it has saved my hair. My hair feels lighter but not stripped, very soft. It looks youthful and shiny, like it took ten years off my hair. My waves are more defined and even have a bit of bounce. I am elated to say the least.  This transformed my hair into exactly what I needed it to be.  I used a diffent brand of leave in conditioner after but I am going to invest in this brand for that right now. Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I have typical thick asian hair and it did not work as well as the other said. It does smell great though.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  it really cleans your hair and leaves it stretched out.  I sent some to my sister she loves it to.  arrived fast.  thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have naturally curly hair and this product works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple of these products after seeing the infomercials on an expensive name brand,as this is very much the same. I had to wash my hair a couple times the first time to remove all the product buildup(shampoos,conditioners, treatment, mousse, hairspray ,root lifters, and my hair is foil colored. I have never been able to get a brush or comb thru my hair without alot of conditioner after washing or even getting wet, even trying to run my fingers thru would pull out a hand full of hair using a reg conditioner,I could run my fingers thru this without taking any hair with it! My hair feels so soft and clean and smells fantastic! My husband kept playing with it as it&#x27;s so soft. I will never go back to sulfate shampoos.This will leave your hair soft as silk.</li>
            <li> Excellent ,amazing !!! Nothing else to say to add.</li>
            <li> I have 4C hair and it did absolutely nothing for me. I gave it away after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I could not use this product alone. It claims to moisturize but my hair is like hay, I had to order the leave in conditioner. It might just be my hair type though.</li>
            <li> Eh. I like it and it makes my hair easy to manage but I get that with regular cowashes. Was expecting more since I&#x27;ve heard great things...</li>
            <li> This is really good I didn&#x27;t think it would clean my hair like a shampoo but it better then a shampoo, my hair felt fresh and clean. Would I recommend it yes, every one should try it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a month ago at Target. I ran out and needed several stores were sold out so I ended up buying it here on Amazon. For some reason it just does not look the same and smells different. That got me to thinking that they just dumped something into the originators bottle for profit. You can never be too sure these days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. My hair gets greasy in a second day :((</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! At first, I didn&#x27;t think that a product other than shampoo could cleanse my scalp and leave it moisturized. Boy, was I wrong. I am a 4b-4c natural with shoulder length hair and I will never use shampoo again as long as this product is on the shelves. It helped me detangle my hair so nicely with ease. It smells wonderful! I don&#x27;t really have a problem with it being in a jar either and I can tell that it is going to last me for a long time. A little goes a long way for me because I wash in 6 sections. My hair after cowashing with this was so moisturized and soft. I have never seen a product do this with my hair and I was a bit of a product junkie a little while ago. This is going to be a staple for me forever!! I bought mine at Walgreens for $7.99, I should have gotten 2 just because...</li>
            <li> The smell is delightful and it really seems to do the job for cleansing my natural hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> I only heard of cowash recently, but after seeing Coconut Cowash on a 10-best list of products for curly hair, I checked the Amazon reviews and ordered it. Wow!!! I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of products for curly hair lately, but this one is head and shoulders above the others.  I was in a tearing hurry to get to work, but I just had to wash out the crispy-crunchy residue from the product I had tried a couple of days before.  I used enough to mound on my palm, rubbed it quickly into my hair, and rinsed it right out.  I skipped the conditioner and detangler but used kinky-curly curling custard and left for work with damp hair.  I was a bit worried because I didn&#x27;t like the result of the curling custard before.  My hair looked great and felt softer than it has in years and looked great throughout the hot, humid, sweaty day.  I have to admit that it&#x27;s practically impossible to UNcurl my hair, but it can get stupendously frizzy and dry, and that didn&#x27;t happen.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the results. I have 3b-3c hair.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. It does what it claims and my hair smells and feels great. It doesn&#x27;t strip it of its natural oils which is key since I&#x27;m going natural.</li>
            <li> This was absolutely amazing,  I am already looking forward to buying some more! It came quick and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I am going natural for the third time , I am African American, but anyways I have been using this product for a month and I love it. it helps keep my nappy hair soft and manageable it smells really good and I am just shock it the difference it has made on my hair. my hair is really soft easy to comb. so if you have 4 c hair. please try.</li>
            <li> I have dry and damaged biracial hair with a thyroid issue, so basically it&#x27;s just a MESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured out shampoos with sulfates were making my hair even worse than it was, not to mention made my so-so dandruff unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very conditioning cleanser, however I find it difficult to use, there isn&#x27;t the same slip with regular conditioners that make it easy to use the wide tooth comb in the shower, with this, it doesn&#x27;t quite go through as easily.  Ironically, I was slipping and sliding all over the tub with this, serious HAZARD!  I thought I was going to break my neck! Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is close to 4 stars because my hair is noticeably better, but I find myself dreading washing my hair with this because of the lack of ease and the slippery tub.</li>
            <li> I have type 2 wavy hair and I was a bit worried this co wash wouldn&#x27;t work for me. After reading so many good reviews I was convinced and decided to try it out. This product is amazing! It left my hair silky smooth and cleansed my scalp without stripping my hair. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> This cowash is awesome!! It keeps my kids hair nice and soft and it easier to comb</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair that goes frizzy if I let it dry naturally.  So, I have been blow drying and straightening it for years.  Since using this cowash instead of shampoo, my hair is so much softer and doesn&#x27;t go frizzy if I let it dry naturally.  I would recommend this to anyone with curly or wavy hair that is dry and/or coarse.  If you have naturally oily hair, that has to be washed often, then this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> This cowash conditioner smells lovely and works well as a cowash. I just would like it more if it were in a squeeze bottle due to its EXTREMELY runny nature. It&#x27;s not thick at all which is what I like my conditioners to be since I have coily hair (what some would call 4a, but I hate the hair typing system) and I find those conditioners work best for it. But if you don&#x27;t mind that minor factor, buy it, it does what it says it does!</li>
            <li> It smells okay. It&#x27;s mainly a coconut like smell to it. I am transitioning from relaxed hair to natural and I am a year already and it does wonders for both hair textures. I prefer to use this rather than and other weekly shampoo. A little goes a long way and it does not suds up that much. Just use it to clean the scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I have never used a co-wash before, but I think this product is amazing. my scalp is squeaky clean and my hair is not dried out. The smell is a bit odf a turn off, but it is tolerable.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS COWASH! This was my second cowash used and I stopped there. This stuff is amazing. When first starting to cowash I was upset because my hair was greasy the first rinse. Upon more research, you have to rinse quite a bit. Make sure you thoroughly rinse. Once it all washed out my hair was so clean and had so much volume. I have asian hair that has been processed so many times. It has never had that much shine or volume without a curling iron. I will definitely continue this brand. Plus, it&#x27;s smells really yummy. :)</li>
            <li> I really love how this product makes my hair feel! So soft and manageable. It smells heavenly and moisturizes beautifully. I love that is also all natural and nourishing for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD FOR COWASHING EVERY DAY IF NEEDED</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite cleaning cowwash. I haven&#x27;t found anything that compares for the price!</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff initially because I wanted a one step wash routine. I have 4a/b hair with blond highlights and for me this turned out to be too drying and it wasn&#x27;t smooth and slippery enough for detangling. My hair felt dry afterwards really in need of a good deep conditioner. It works great as a creamy cleanser but it&#x27;s not moisturizing enough on its own. I ended up switching to Pantene&#x27;s Cleansing conditioner which gave much better detangling slip and menthol for my scalp. Plus I hated not having a pump or bottle- the jar was a pain to use.</li>
            <li> As I Am is a really good styling tool, it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out or make it hard or brittle. Also it&#x27;s not heavy at all. Extremely soft curls.</li>
            <li> I will never use shampoo and conditioner separately again.  I believe Chaz Wen came up with this idea in L.A. with his &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; cowash.  It&#x27;s VERY expensive, and I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s the concept that works; not necessarily the brand.  I&#x27;ve tried three, including his, and have loved, loved, loved them all.  I have settled on this one.  I love the price, the smell, the way my hair looks after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so moisturizing and has a really nice scent.</li>
            <li> I used the cowash for the first time a few days ago. My hair dried with no frizz and into super soft waves. I didn&#x27;t have to use any styling products. I don&#x27;t know how it will work for others with considerably curlier hair, but my hair is just naturally wavy, not even necessarily curly, and fine but very thick. I think I&#x27;ve found my new hair care solution!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is a product I will use regularly.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing conditioner!  I was using wen for over a year,  but who couldn&#x27;t stand to save a little money.  So I thought I would try this so glad I did!  My hair finally feels like I always wanted.  So much moisture in my hair now.  Looks great smells great feels great.  I think I found my new favorite cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to soften my thick coarse hair.  It has helped with static fly-always this winter season.</li>
            <li> This helps me wash my hair with out the use of shampoo. Moisturizing with out weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Great product, and is working great for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this for washing my hair when used in conjunction with my leave in conditioner it makes my hair feel so good.</li>
            <li> i can honestly say i like it...im one of those people that will sit and read 100 comments/reviews on a product and if 7 people out of that 100 claim that it was no good for them i would not buy. simply because the kind of luck i have i will be included and make number 8. long story short i ask hubby to pick up my favorite deep conditioner and he mistook this container for the one i use...i hate having to return things so i though i would let my bff have it.im so glad i tried it a let me tell u i was pleasantly surprise. buy! buy! buy! u will not be sorry</li>
            <li> I was introduced to conditioning cleansers using WEN. Love the product by cant afford the cost. I found As I Am online and love the price. The product performs as well as Wen and smells great!</li>
            <li> This co-wash leaves my hair feeling and smelling good. I recommend using a good amount when washing hair. The affordable price makes this product a keeper.</li>
            <li> As I Am cowash is a gentle way of cleansing your hair.  My hair is thick and it leaves it feeling clean without that stripped feeling sulfate shampoos leave my hair feeling.  I recommend it if you tend to have normal to dry, medium to thick hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She was very satisfied with it and it smelled great. I didn&#x27;t use it myself so don&#x27;t know how effective it was.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but I am not impressed. I have received better results co washing with V05 Moisture Milks. However, to be fair I have only used it 3 times. Maybe it improves the condition of the hair over time.</li>
            <li> This is the best co-wash that I have used. Leaves you hair clean and smelling good.  I would reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> My Natural hair has always been very dry and brittle no matter what shampoo I used. I decided to try co washing and have not been disappointed. This is the best product for my hair as a replacement for shampoo. Sometimes natural hair just needs different types of treatment and I&#x27;m so happy I tried this as an option.</li>
            <li> its great product. this was my first time using it. it smells great and does a great job cleansing my hair. it was packaged well and arrived earlier that expected. i defiantly recommend both the seller and the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about cowashing and finally decided to give it a try with this product. It weirds me out how it doesn&#x27;t sud at all, but I can&#x27;t argue with the results. My hair is pretty long but getting damaged at the ends, so I wanted something that was less drying and more gentle on it. This stuff was great. My hair has major oily problems so I was really worried that this would just make that issue worse, but nope. I used a generous amount, scrubbed my scalp with my fingers for a couple of minutes, worked it through to the ends and rinsed. Afterwards my hair was super clean but also felt moisturized, it was great. I am using it three to four times week now. My only gripe is that I have to use a very generous amount in order to clean my scalp and still have enough to work it through all of my hair to condition the ends. Because of this, I ran through my first container within about a month and a half. If I don&#x27;t use enough of it, I don&#x27;t get that clean feeling and my ends feel brittle, so make sure to use a VERY generous amount.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my hair and I am transitioning to natural, this left my hair totally stripped and coarse on my relaxed ends. I had to use a deep conditioner to soften it up. My natural hair felt ok. Sooo I am thinking maybe it didn&#x27;t work because some of my hair is relaxed. So I will try it again when I do the bc and follow up.</li>
            <li> Great cowash. It gently cleanses my hair. I love that its in a jar. The price is awesome.</li>
            <li> i use this regularly.  love the way it makes my natural hair feel</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Its detangling properties are effective.  I use a wide tooth shower comb to massage through my hair, although I could use my fingers. I used to buy an expensive non-sudsing cleansing conditioner from QVC. This is better in price, amount needed, and effect.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have extremely dry hair and hate constant washing of my hair due to excess oil.  I decided to try this because of the theory of oil cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on my hair and massaged into my scalp as directed. I left it on for about 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell of the product but I don&#x27;t think it is suited for my type of hair. I am not sure if maybe it&#x27;s cause my hair is too dry and maybe needs more treatment for me to thoroughly judge or if maybe it isn&#x27;t recommened for latin type hair that has been colored.&lt;br /&gt;My hair seemed fine wet but once it was dry-it felt course and was frizzing. I will say that I did notice that it DID NOT STRIP my color which is good.  I will try once more with a shower cap and heat and update my review with the results. Here is hoping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way- I could not find this in any local stores or at Sally&#x27;s/</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Makes hair manageable and no frizz.</li>
            <li> Great for curly haired women who do not use shampoo. The smell is not strong even for someone like me who gets headaches with perfumes etc.</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate difference after only one use. Totally happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white with long, fine, wavy hair. This product works well when I want to let my hair go wild, which is most days.&lt;br /&gt;This makes my wave more of a defined curl without frizzy ends and it does not weigh it down. It&#x27;s a thick consistency and does seem to nourish my hair. I don&#x27;t smell coconut at all in this product. It has more of a faint chemical smell to me, so I use it with Renpure coconut wash to get the coconut smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t smell coconut at all when I use the product. It has more of a &#x27;no smell&#x27; to me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and seems to work for many different hair types. I am Caucasian with 3A curls that are dyed purple and pink. Shampoo makes my hair greasy at the roots and very dry everywhere else (not to mention it fades the crap out of my dye), while other cowashes seem to address the dry issue but make my hair feel less clean. I wash with this stuff once every 3 days or so and it makes my hair feel soft and clean, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t strip any of the colour from my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommended this to a friend with a huge afro (maybe a type 4a/b) and it seems to be working great for him.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Leaves my curly hair soft and healthy looking . Will be ordering more</li>
            <li> much cheaper than walmart and it is amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its a great cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;If your looking to retain moisture after using it , you wouldn&#x27;t get such cause it strip your hair from all the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommended it? Yes, to someone who isn&#x27;t looking to retain moisture after using it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cowash didn&#x27;t work very well for me. I swapped it out with my usual shampoo/conditioner and I could tell that my hair didn&#x27;t like it as I was washing it out. I really wanted to like this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it smells delicious &amp; has a nice texture, and it did clean my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it caused my hair to become frizzy &amp; lose a lot of its shine.. I think it dried my hair out. It also really messed up my usual curl pattern &amp; made my hair lose quite a bit of its curliness. For some reason, it also made my hair lose a lot of its volume. After I diffused it, it looked a lot flatter than it usually does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it all up, it made my hair lose its oomph!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well.. Back to my usual routine.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this! She had been looking into sulfate free shampoos and decided to try this. Her hair is coarse, thick, and slightly curly. Somedays, she couldn&#x27;t even get a brush through her hair. She tried this and all of her problem spots disappeared after one wash and she is hooked.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I wear my hair both curly and straight, and it does wonders for adding moisture and makes my hair much more healthier. I highly recommend this co-washing product for any hair type.</li>
            <li> Good for the hair. Gentle</li>
            <li> No complaints, not sure if I will buy again... have to try it a few more times, but not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I love it I love it I love it!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is great like fresh coconuts. This made my hair soft and smell really nice. Is it completely necessary to use i dont know i also dont know if it is better than other co washes i use. Ill keep using to find out.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh smell but that&#x27;s it. It has no slip what so ever made my hair feel dry and stripped. Now the Butter cream by As I am is wonderful! I was very disappointed in the cowash everyone seem to like it</li>
            <li> I got this from Sally&#x27;s I&#x27;m newly natural with 3C-4B hair and I have to say I didn&#x27;t think that this stuff would work in my hair, but I was wrong, so far its the best product that I have tried out of a store. My only con to this product is that you have to dip your hand into the jar so the shower water gets in the jar. So I just picked up a hair dye bottle and I funneled it into the bottle and I can squeeze it out .  Its great. It has an amazing smell. I&#x27;m pretty addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> There are protein rich products and protein free products  ...  I&#x27;m on a never ending search for mostly protein free products for my 4c natural hair.  This co-wash has now officially been added to my staple product stash.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  I have consistently used 2 containers so far and it&#x27;s proven -  protein free for real and moisturizing after rinse out. Even during rinse out, it detangles.  Shed hairs slide right on out:)</li>
            <li> You can go to the actual web site and get this product for $8.00.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in my daughters hair and it works really good for them I also added&lt;br /&gt;peppermint oil to this to soothe one of my daughters itchy scalp, due to eczema she Loooves it..</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing wash for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers here, I am im</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I recently stopped heat-styling my hair and starting wearing it curly.  I have some heat damage so I have been focusing on conditioning products that offer a lot of moisture.  I really like this product - it is affordable, obtainable (got it at RiteAid), smells great and does what it promises.  I tend to get a flaky scalp from build-up so I am not completely shampoo free - I have to shampoo about once a week (with a suflate-free), and I co-wash in between about 1-2 times a week.  I usually use this with the As I Am leave-in and curling jelly, but have used it with other products as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for kinky or curly hair. It cleans but keeps the hair from drying out. This product also smells great and is easy to apply.  It is a bit pricey but worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how the cowash smooths my hair with out streaking it. I Can&#x27;t wait to try the oyher products</li>
            <li> keep my hair very moisture!!</li>
            <li> I used this daily on my &amp;#34;natural hair&amp;#34; after swimming.  Helps to detangle as well as moisturize.  Keeps hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a WEN girl for years...The WEN from the infomercials, I&#x27;ve only just recently learned that that isn&#x27;t the original formula and not nearly as good, but the REAL WEN isn&#x27;t a Prime item and is a little more expensive unless you buy the huge 32 oz bottles, and I was out and broke, so I read all sorts of reviews till my eyes crossed and decided to risk this to see if anyone had come up with a good conditioning cleanser without the WEN prices!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this they have come close to the infomercial WEN I guess, tho WEN has more healthy ingredients, the basic formula idea is the same, and (unlike the original WEN that I&#x27;ve finally purchased), this and the infomercial WEN list water and cetyl and cetearyl alcohols in the first four ingredients!  In the ORIGINAL WEN there are no alcohols starting out with water then Aloe Vera gel, Glycerin, then jump right in to the natural extracts starting with chamomile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to my hair, first, I&#x27;m white with long very fine thick straight silky hair.  At the moment it&#x27;s all I like about my body...Tho I wish it would hold a curl...lol we&#x27;re never happy with our hair! :-D.  It was hard for me to figure out whether or not this would be appropriate for me cuz a lot of the reviewers reported their &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; of hair in some code letters and numbers of which I am ignorant!  So I went on descriptions as best as I could and I also love coconut and never liked the scent of the almond mint WEN I&#x27;d been using anyway, so I thought I&#x27;d pamper my nose at least if not my hair, and I personally DO enjoy the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I used the WEN instructions when I used this and made sure my hair was drenched when I started working this in.  I found it easier to apply than WEN, but it&#x27;s a bit less thick so it WOULD be easier.  Like WEN I kept my hair wet till it was completely worked in, clipped it up on top of my head and left it in while I bathed, then rinsed again very thoroughly till my hair felt clean...this wasn&#x27;t very hard since I&#x27;d applied it to very wet hair and kept adding water so it&#x27;s always good and wet when I clip it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt good the whole time, never oily or heavy or conversely &amp;#34;straw-like&amp;#34; as I&#x27;ve read reports of while reading so many cleansing conditioner reviews.  And I believe that it&#x27;s all in the application, in keeping the hair WET!  Then it isn&#x27;t such a big deal to rinse as thoroughly as is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, shortly after I tried this I had a family member get very ill and had to rush 8 hours away to see him with my mom.  Long and short, it&#x27;s been a WEEK since I washed my hair and it&#x27;s STILL clean...being summer I keep my hair tied up most of the time, but still, that&#x27;s impressive.  I used an argon oil hair mask in lieu of a detangler, but I&#x27;m sure that using just a bit of this as a leave in conditioner like I&#x27;ve always done with WEN would work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tho I&#x27;m looking forward to learning how to get the most from my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; WEN because of all the natural ingredients...But just fyi, natural doesn&#x27;t always mean gentle, during my first wash with the new WEN I found it even thicker than the tv formula and so my first application was kinda heavy and harder to get in or out and since I leave it in a good while in a bath it drops down my neck in front and back and found that my skin on my neck and decolette had some pink splotches on them, so, either I&#x27;ve developed an allergy to something in the almond mint WEN, or WEN in general (God forbid!)  Once I left the other version on for two DAYS...a deep conditioning gone crazy and my hair was SOOO soft when I finally rinsed it out that I AM a bit worried about the allergy thing....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m glad I know this works for me and I have it ready to go! :-)  And I agree that a pump bottle would be more practical and less prone to mishaps.  For NOW just keep aware of where it is and set the lid on top if you are showering to keep water out.  (I&#x27;llbe transferring it to an old WEN bottle!)be transferring it to an old WEN bottle!)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a possible alternative to WEN. I like this better. My hair is soft, clean and manageable. It&#x27;s officially my new hair cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great for ***MATURE*** dreadlocks, nice scent, and since it can replace shampoo and conditioner, it saves $$$ in the long run. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend use on dreads younger than 1 1/2 years because it might loosen/slow the locking process</li>
            <li> Came half open and leaking. Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Wow!!  I tried this because I have naturally curly, dry and damaged hair.  First time it was just \\&quot;ok\\&quot;  second time...  Hell no!!!  My hair looked like a frizz bomb!!  I&#x27;m embarrassed to say I cheated on my \\&quot;wen\\&quot;  only because of the price,  but never again.  Wen stared the Co washing and he definitely knows what he&#x27;s doing.  I am now and forever a wen girl  ❤</li>
            <li> I love this although I wash my hair with normal shampoo every now and then to refresh my hair because my hair is naturally oily. My hair got softer and has more volume I love it.</li>
            <li> For some background: I have fine, pin-straight hair. I am not the target or typical user for this product as it is typically used for people with curly hair. That being said, I love this stuff. I abuse my hair with dyes, bleach, and heat, but after washing with this instead of shampoo my hair has never felt healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked! It leaves my hair moisturized &amp; shinie with each use. This is one of the best cowashes I&#x27;ve used. I will never use shampoo again. It even gets rid of the gunk I put in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> A great product, it leaves your hair soft but you still sit with loads of tangles. This co-wash does not leave your hair smooth but it cleanses the scalp thoroughly and the scalp feels clean and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product does not ease the tangles I recommend it to anyone. My hair is relaxed and is bound to tangle.</li>
            <li> Loved this cowash. It also smells really good!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m a black girl and my  curls are very aggresive. This products makes my hair very soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> While it cleans well, but it caused my hair to break and was not as easy to comb out as other cleansing conditioners I have used. Also, does not smell much like coconut. Didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I give this a five rating because this is the best cowash I&#x27;ve ever used. The scent is not overpowering, it provides enough lather to feel like its getting the job done and it leaves your hair feeling a lot more manageable. NOTE: if your hair is extremely dirty or has excess build up from products, I&#x27;d recommend a sulfate free shampoo vs using a cowash unless you don&#x27;t mind using A LOT of this product (which I don&#x27;t recommend). By far my favorite cowash but everyone&#x27;s hair is different!!</li>
            <li> This cowash is a great product.  I loved the smell and the consistency.  The only thing is that it only lasted about 4 weeks because I have thick curly hair and lots of it.  Less is more but you have to get the whole head and that can take a lot.  But over all it was easy to detangle my hair and it kept it clean without the harsh sulfates.  Loved it</li>
            <li> So, we&#x27;ve probably all seen the infomercials for a similar product.  I must admit I have been extremely curious, but skeptical about how something that looks and feels like conditioner could actually clean my hair without leaving it greasy or oily.  I took the plunge and purchased this product and much to everyone&#x27;s surprise it works amazingly well.  It is a little weird washing your hair with a product that looks and feels like conditioner, but it really works.  I do take a little extra time working it through my hair and scalp to insure I &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my thick head of hair well.  My hair is curly, shoulder length dark course hair with a fair amount of silver.  My husband&#x27;s hair is very thin and fine and our daughter&#x27;s hair is processed beyond belief.  This product worked wonders on all of our hair and my daughter and I also use the leave-in conditioner, which you don&#x27;t need much of...mostly just on the ends.  Our hair is super shiny and soft and my curls are not frizzy at all. Our daughter&#x27;s hair looks and feels incredible.  I&#x27;ve never been this happy with any shampoo product.  I think I speak for our entire family when I say we highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have a mix of fine and coarse hair along with extremely sensitive skin and almost every shampoo causes my scalp to itch and have dandruff.  I have used Wen but found out about this after some research...at about one third of the price as well as being available to purchase locally, I decided to at least try this alost two years ago and was very happy with the results.  I actually like this better than Wen even if it were the same price.  It is extremely moisturizing without being greasy and still gets my hair clean.  Absolutely no issues with dandruff after using this and it minimizes breakage compared to all other brands I&#x27;ve tried, both shampoo and cowash.  I have gone back to other brands when I run out of this but have always regretted it and gone back to this immediately.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair type. May be great for someone with thicker and drier hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine color treated hair. I love Coconut so decided to give this a try instead of Hair One. I love it it makes my hair super soft. But the packaging couldn&#x27;t be more frustrating. Please ad a pump or put it in a bottle. I cut a hole in the lid and put the pump from my hair one in it!</li>
            <li> Sooooo good. We have think mixed girl hair and this works great. Smells great, too.</li>
            <li> Super nice product for curly hair. It leaves my hair soft and hydrated, But i have to use quite a bit of the product to work it on my scalp, it does have a nice smell, like most AS I AM products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  My natural curls have never looked better!</li>
            <li> Made my hair very soft but I don&#x27;t like co-wash.  I think it is so uncessary.</li>
            <li> I have no idea where all these positive reviews are coming from. None. Left hair tangled yet greasy. Pass on this one and go straight for the stuff with the three-letter name that rhymes with &amp;#34;Pen.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product was so amazing I had to write a review. I have shoulder length type 4a/4b hair and when I shampoo my hair it normally just looks really frizzy with no defined curl pattern. I washed my hair with As I Am cowash and I WILL use it for as long as they make it! My curl pattern was so defined and my hair looked perfect. I wish I could just wear my hair with the cowash in it! It also removed all other product build up and washed out easy. Perfect product, I recommend 100%.</li>
            <li> I love this cowash! I have short hair and love how it makes my hair bouncy and supper soft.  You really cant beat the price compaired to wenn and other shampoo/ Conditioner out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a year now.  It has changed my hair completely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian and have very dry, frizzy &amp; unruly very wavy hair.... and lots of it!  It has always had a natural tendency to tangle and mat.  All of this is exaggerated by the fact that I live in the hot, humid south and color treat due to plenty of grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cowash has made me love my hair.  The texture is forever changed!  It is not frizzy.  It is wavy and beautiful, now!  I will never go back to shampoo!  Regardless of ethnicity, if you have dry, unruly hair, give this an honest try.  Once you get used to the fact that it does not lather up, I think you will love your hair too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen daughter who has natural wavy/curly hair.  I had NO idea her hair could curl as much as it does!!  This works well as a detangler, we usually do a spray leave in but don&#x27;t have to.  Great!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hair was so dry from styling products and hair color. I have been searching for a long time for something that really works. My hair feels and looks healthy again. I didn&#x27;t know how I would feel about not using shampoo. I don&#x27;t even notice now. My hair feels clean and free of buildup.  Been using it everyday and have recommended to coworkers and family. I had to place another order because I can&#x27;t spare being without it a day while my coworkers sample it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this relatively thick coconut cowash in my hair. I&#x27;ve recently made the decision to go natural and since then, I&#x27;ve been trying a plethora of different products to see what my hair likes and doesn&#x27;t like. This product is very nice! It cleanses my hair well and leaves it feeling smooth and nicely conditioned, not like some shampoo/conditioner sets that seem to leave my hair stiff and feeling fry. Will definitely buy more of the As I Am Coconut CoWash :)</li>
            <li> If there was a fire in my shower, I would grab it.  Really would.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. When I first bought it I had a lot of reservations because I&#x27;d heard this was either you &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hate it&amp;#34;. I have 4 a hair and I am currently transitioning. As soon as I apply this to my hair it becomes very soft and manageable. It has great slip and I can detangle my hair without a lot of breakage. This has become a staple in my regimen</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my hair look healthy and shiny!!</li>
            <li> I used so many products and conditioners as co-washes, but I have to say that this product is the BEST co-wash I have used for my 4a type hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading reviews.  I&#x27;ve been researching different products to use while I&#x27;m deployed to Afghanistan. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a combination of the heat and this product but it has not been great for my scalp or hair.  My hair feels dry and my scalp itches like no other. The cream smells really nice but other than that, I just do not like the way my scalp and hair feel after using it.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I really like to Co-Wash my hair using this product. It does not lather up too much and it rinses out easily! The only con I can think of with this product is that it&#x27;s very soupy. Other than that I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of a CoWash before this one. And I didn&#x27;t know I needed one... until after I used this just once. I love this product. I have 3b curly hair and this product cleans all the product out of my hair without soaking up all the moisture. As I Am Coconut CoWash adds moisture to my hair but still gets it squeaky clean (and I mean literally -- I do not want a shampoo that won&#x27;t make my hair squeak after I&#x27;ve rinsed it out). But this product is not for everyone -- be warned! If your hair is excessively dry and coarse this is not the CoWash for you. It&#x27;ll leave your hair feeling as though you&#x27;d used regular shampoo. But for my 3b curl, moderate moisture level, thick texture, and normal scalp it was excellent! Give it a try and see if it&#x27;s for you.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about co-washing. I saw this online and saw all the reviews so I bought it. I&#x27;m not going natural, but my hair gets really dry.  I&#x27;m sure part of that is because of shampoos. I used this but felt it was hard to work it thru all of my hair since there is no lather. I guess you just use alot and make sure you cover every portion, and it takes the place of what lathering does. I also let it sit for about 15 minutes with a cap on to make sure it really got conditioned. I just don&#x27;t see where the cleaning comes in at. It made it really soft and detangled-because its a conditioner, and thats what conditioners do. I&#x27;m not so sure about how clean it gets your hair though. You can actually co-wash with any good conditoner and  get the same results. It definately made my hair soft and silky, but two days after co-washing it, it felt kind of dirty which doesn&#x27;t normally happen when I wash using shampoo. But to each his own. I&#x27;m definately going to use it again, but just as a deep conditioner. And it smells nice, and has some good oils in it. I also read the reviews on Amazon, but bought it off ebay for half the price.</li>
            <li> I love this i live by it my hair is super curly and dry and with this i am able to detangle my hair so easy makes managing my hair during the wash process so much easier i have been using this for months and i will not switch it was recommended to me because i was not pleased with other shampoo or conditioners and i didnt want anything to dry out my hair now it doesnt lather up like a shampoo that didnt bother my hair felt so soft afterwards try this you will love it!!!1</li>
            <li> Wish it were in a bottle instead of a jar</li>
            <li> Used this several times so far and really like it. It cleans my hair very well, leaves no residue, and detangles. I have very long, A3 curly hair. My braid pony tail is easily 18+ inches in length. For me, this did not suffice as a conditioner. So I use it like shampoo and also condition per usual. I would suggest anyone who is looking to go easier on their locks should give this product a go. As for me, I&#x27;m giving a go at no shampoo. So far so good. But if I ever go back; this is what I will be going back to!</li>
            <li> This is the first real cowash I&#x27;ve tried, and it works great. There&#x27;s good slip, so it spreads easily, and my hair comes out looking clean (but not a stiff, squeaky clean) and voluminous. My 2B curls are definitely looking a lot healthier since I&#x27;ve started using this in conjunction with the As I Am Leave-In Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t remove product buildup so well, and I have to shampoo every ~3 weeks to keep things from getting a bit gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I quit using dry shampoo between cowashes, and I no longer need to shampoo out the extra product. Bumped this up to 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is super conditioning.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of nursing back to health, my naturally wavy, thin dry locks after having done a few years of keratin bone straight, treatments.  I have sworn off flat irons, blow dryers and I&#x27;m being more selective with the products I put on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my hair being natural dry and wavy, type 2b/2c, it has responded wonderfully to at home, weekly, hot oil treatments; and so since I&#x27;m adding all these oils to my hair, I wanted a cleansing shampoo BUT I DID NOT want one that was going to strip my hair completely because my hair is fragile and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did some research online and I came across this one and I went to my local Target to pick it up and I was very presently surprised when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shower, I wet my hair, divided my hair into four sections and I applied this product to each section, massaging my scalp gingerly but thoroughly.  I then brushed the product through the hair with a wide tooth comb, (which was easy to to do) and I placed my hair up with a clip and I placed a shower cap on while I showered.  Once I had washed the product completely off, I was expecting to find my hair dry and brittle but was very pleasantly surprised to find my hair was very soft and it smelled really nice. I put on my conditioner and I then washed some of it of and my hair was clean and bouncy; it didn&#x27;t feel dry at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product turned out to be exactly what I was looking for, it leaves my hair feeling clean and bouncy, it removes the access products I use to style and maintain my hair without leaving it dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read that a few ladies had dropped the container in the shower, spilling and wasting the product.  (They really should put this product in a dispenser pump bottle). So what I did was, we had a empty, thick plastic bottle and it has a heavy duty pump dispenser.  So my hubby transferred this product into the thoroughly clean pump dispenser bottle.  This made dispensing the producteasier and I used less of it and it didn&#x27;t spill.  yay!!! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use this product once a month for now but in the future, this may very well replace my regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have naturally frizzy hair and a very sensitive scalp. Most shampoos and even conditioners completely dry out my scalp and give me flakey skin. This product is the first product I&#x27;ve found which leaves my hair and scalp looking and feeling great after a wash. All the good reviews are real! I&#x27;m definitely going to replace my tub with another when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel! It smells wonderful and gives the hair lots of slip.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for distressed hair.  It works better than shampoo followed by conditioner.  The only problem for me is that it is a little too rich to use all the time.  It leaves my hair feeling a little weighed down.  But if I use a lighter shampoo every so often in between, this keeps my hair soft but not flat, shiny but not greasy.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Smells good. But got better result from cheaper conditioners. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This one does not do anything special for me.  I will not be repurchasing it don&#x27;t really find it worth the money.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is a P.C. version of the old Prell shampoo.  It was known about Prell - and should be known about this product - that if your hair is filthy and gooped up with gels, heavy oils like castor oil, or &#x27;coned to death with anti-frizz serums, it is the product for you.  Just that time.  This is a shampoo that will strip your hair bone dry, which you may need once in a blue.  It is NOT a cowash, so please don&#x27;t use it on a regular basis if you want to keep hair on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I Am makes a number of wonderful products that are worth the slightly hefty price tag.  This, to me, is not one of them.</li>
            <li> It was okay but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I love this item so much, I already order a second jar since I have to wash my hair everyday. Its gentle and hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I never cowashed before until I became natural and let me tell you, cowashing is my new thing. And this product is great for that. The coconut aroma is intoxicating. I cowashed everyday as a new natural so this product didnt last me long at all. The consistency is smooth and creamy and it made my hair feel very soft. I would order this product over and over again.</li>
            <li> This Co wash is a wonderful! Product.. It&#x27;s creamy going on, smells good and leaves my hair soft an clean. I have thick salt and pepper African American hair that is on the very dry side and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel striped after washing with this.  I admit it&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but when it comes to taking care of these fragile and always want to tangle curls I&#x27;m willing to pay. Wish it came in a pump for easier use.</li>
            <li> I have asian straight hair and I bought this product by mistake, so I left it in my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is normal to a bit oily, but after using a certain shampoo, my hair became extremely dry and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;Even changing the shampoo wasn&#x27;t enough to repair the damage, so I decided to give a try on this As I Am Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, my hair got 50% better, but still frizzy. I used it a second time and my hair got so beautiful I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&lt;br /&gt;It became shiny and bouncy, even better than before!!!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend this product to repair hair damages, it&#x27;s a life saver!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It left my hair super soft, and moisturized. Detangling was an absolute breeze. I have thick coarse hair with damaged ends ( I am transitioning) so detangling is always the hardest part about washing my hair. But this stuff helped me so much.&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on my hair and scalp my hair softened immediately. It spread through my hair easily and rinsed out easily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is thick, creamy and a little bit runny. A little goes a definite long way. The smell is hard to describe. Its kind of coconut-y, and sweet. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not everyone may like it. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and it doesn&#x27;t linger much. It left my hair soft while it was in my hair and after rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product was perfect for my hair. It also cleansed my scalp, even though I have dandruff. Although, I use this product to stretch my shampoo days more so than as my sole hair cleanser. Sometimes I mix a bit of my dandruff shampoo with this in my problem areas. That way my hair doesn&#x27;t get stripped but my scalp still feels flake free and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this, but before buying try getting the sample to make sure It works for you.</li>
            <li> SOOO HOOKED, SMELLS GOOD, DETANGLES, CLEANS WELL, CONDITIONS. WILL BE USING THIS PRODUCT LINE FOREVER!</li>
            <li> I use this product in between washes with shampoo.  It is amazing and smells really good. My hair is soft and managable</li>
            <li> I am a white male with mid-shoulder length 3Bish type curly hair.  My hair is constantly dry and I decided to try this instead of regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the smell, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dry and brittle after using it.  I keep it back in a ponytail for work, and when i take it out I can still feel the moisture in my hair.  My wife decided to try it and noticed the same for her. The only knock I have is it seems to build up after time and I find that I still need to use shampoo about once every 12-14 days to get a thorough clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have noticed an improvement in the way my hair looks and feels which is all I&#x27;m asking out of this product, so I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I already used a cleansing conditioner shampoo before from another brand.  This cleans better, I don&#x27;t feel the hair oily and washes very easily.  My curls look shiny and bouncing.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but definatly worth it.  I used this along with the twisting cream and my hair looks and feels so moisterized! I get compliments on my hair 3 days after my twist out.  This is my new staple.</li>
            <li> Great! No more shampoo, I do a lot of sports so daily washing a must. I have medium length hair and this is working well.</li>
            <li> Definitely cleanses my hair and makes it feel soft.  Love the fragrancel!</li>
            <li> This is the first as I am product I have ever used. It works great!! One of my favorites!!</li>
            <li> I bought it at Wal-Mart for about $8. It&#x27;s great. Your hair will drink it in. I&#x27;m Hispanic with curly hair &amp; my curls are bouncy &amp; soft. The smell is beautifully coconutty. It really is medicine for your hair. Thank you to the makers of the product ❤️😘</li>
            <li> Smells great, does a great job cleaning my hair without that squeakiness! Rinses out easily and detangles quite well. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely lovvvvvve this Co wash I alternate between this and my shampoo when I wash my hair. It helped keep my hair strong and soft love it.</li>
            <li> After using a full container did not see any great results.  Possibly a bit more defined, moisturized curls but nothing to justify the cost.  Did not like packaging-having to deal with opening and closing a jar in the shower and was very difficult to get the last out of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;(thick, curly/wavy hair)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Smells great and work all sorts of wonders !</li>
            <li> yes I would say I LOVE this product. Definitely will order again! gives moisture and lots of body to your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and it actually does what it says it does and it smells wonderful. Definite yes!</li>
            <li> Buh-bye shampoo! I love this stuff! I read all the reviews before I tried this. Along with many, I wanted to use Wen. Not in my budget now or in any life time. I color my hair every 6 weeks and I would shampoo two times a week. All in the spirit of maintaining my color. Shampoo was stripping the color off. I would see it rinse down the drain!&lt;br /&gt;I started to use it right after my coloring. I used it for 6 weeks. Time to color again and washed after the three days. I noticed very little color on my comb. The rinse off is clean and soft, Not slick and heavy as I expected. My hair is very easy to style. The dry &#x27;halo&#x27; of hair has decreased. My color did last longer in those six weeks than before. What can I say? It&#x27;s terrific!</li>
            <li> Made my normally soft hair frizzy and weird. Okay but needs conditioner after for sure.</li>
            <li> I am a wen user and I have been looking for a substitute.  This is a possibility.  It left my hair very soft and I liked the smell.  Not too strong.  Wen seems to make my hair less frizzy but it is also has been humid recently.</li>
            <li> I got this product just because some people complained about how dry their hair was left. I have normal to oily hair, so it has taken me a while to read and actually decide to try co-washing. This product really does a good job for my kind of hair. My hair is fine, but I have a LOT of it, and it is wavy. It really does help bringing the natural wave to my hair, which I think looks great. After about a month of using it, I can definitely see a more shiny hair and my hair tips are not dry, so I don&#x27;t have to smother my hair in a ton of oil every day. I use it about 4 days a week and the rest I use a sulfate free shampoo and conditioner (dermorganics). I do this because I do oil treatments once or twice a week so I need an extra cleansing agent for when I do this treatments. My hair hasn&#x27;t been better. I get a TON of compliments all the time. I was hesitant on doing co-washing since I have an oily scalp, but I am sold.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair clean and smelling like coconut. Great ingredients and curly girl friendly leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I stop using shampoo because of the sodium laurel sulfate was stripping the moisture out of my hair causing breakage and brittleness. I start using the As I Am Coconut Co-Wash and have been using it for a month now, and I can see the difference in my hair texture thickening and being super clean. This is far out the best cleanser for my hair, and will continue to use it as long as it stays on the market. The smell is fantastic! And I love the fact that it has organic ingredients. I will stock up since summer will be approaching and I will have to do more co-washes to my natural hair. :)</li>
            <li> I have 4a/4b type natural hair and I can not say enough about this product. It made my hair feel so soft. Smells good. The only thing I dislike is that it comes in a jar and not a tube. I wash my hair in the shower and I don&#x27;t like dipping my hands in the jar bc it&#x27;s so easy to get water in the jar which in turns waters down the product. Simple fix: I could always buy a tube and transfer the contents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking this product!.  It makes my hair soft and managable.  My hair detangles in a snap and looks great after it&#x27;s blow dried and I will purchase this product again before I run out.</li>
            <li> This was too slick. Like it wasn&#x27;t even penetrating in my hair, but simply sliding over it. I did not enjoy it. I went back to Wen. (I didn&#x27;t have a problem with Wen in the first place, I&#x27;m just a hair product hoarder and wanted to try something new).</li>
            <li> I really really love this stuff. I got my first hair cut at Deva Chan and used their pricey products for a while but the overly sweet smell, and high price tag was killing me, plus my hair didn&#x27;t look any better. Next I tried Miss Jessie&#x27;s and while better they are also double the price! Neither brand has all natural ingredients either. I wanted chemical free, or very limited chemical products, so I came across this one day on Amazon. I passed on it because I had never heard of it, even though it was full of rave reviews...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks later I saw a jar of this in a drugstore, and it was actually cheaper ($8) so I decided to grab it to try. This stuff is amazing. My hair is so soft  since using it, and super easy to detangle! I really think I have finally found my holy grail hair product line! As long as they don&#x27;t change the formula or all natural ingredients I am a customer for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells HEAVENLY, like a trip to the tropics. The main scent is coconut, but there is also a hint of citrus, and something sweet? I can&#x27;t figure it out but it smells like summer, and reminds me of Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen lotion (my daily lotion) so the scent is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thick and creamy, so it&#x27;s easy to work into the hair to finger comb and untangle, and avoids waste.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a jar so no waste! Reusable as well!&lt;br /&gt;All natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of any Cons, other than the price tag on Amazon. Which has nothing to do with the product itself. Definitely give this a try, if you&#x27;re trying to go curly girl method or just want healthier and prettier curls!</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and feels like &#x27;butter&#x27; in my hair! I wish it was in a pump bottle, tho.  It tends to get messy in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have really soft 4c hair and find that conditioning alone actually weakens my hair. I cowashed with this product once and my hair has been breaking at the ends ever since. My hair does well with protein fortified products....no  more Cowashing for me!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product, the only shampoo I use to help restore super dry brittle hair.. it really brings your hair back to life!</li>
            <li> Tried it to replace the expensive WEN product &amp; it works very well for me! I bought this container for my sister try but have not yet given it to her. Smells wonderful! I&#x27;d give it a 4.5 if I could!</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my curly/kinky hair. It dried out my hair to the point that it felt like straw. I had to load my hair with other conditioners just to be able to run my fingers through it. Definitely did not have any detangling properties as far as my hair was concerned. This is going straight from the shower to the bin.</li>
            <li> I have thinner, wavy, frizzy hair. This product cleans my hair very well without drying it out, but it doesn&#x27;t really help me much with detangling. I have found that if I use the cowash with a conditioner that I get very good results. Since I have started using this, my hair has been so soft and shiny.  The smell is also really nice, very tropical.</li>
            <li> I am a white woman with very fine, curly, dry hair. It has been a nightmare my entire life and my very worst feature.  In the summer it frizzes like crazy and the heat from the hair dryer makes me look like I stuck my finger in a light switch.  No more.  This stuff makes my hair, smooth and shiny with nice curls.  I can dry it and in the summer it still looks good.  I cannot say enough about this product.  It has turned my worst feature into my best one.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome shampoo/conditioner all in one.  I have an eczema area on my scalp and this really helps keep the area clear.  It is an excellent moisturizing cleaner for my hair.</li>
            <li> Anyone with scalp conditions, beware!  Although this cowash did take me through the transition to no-poo for my hair, a scalp condition that I worked hard to eliminate has returned in full since I&#x27;ve been using it.  Still researching how to manage this with cowashing, but I definitely blame this product.</li>
            <li> I love it when I put this in my hair. It feels so wonderful. I love the smell &amp; it feels so creamy. I will definitely get this again. Right now I am using this along with Loreal evercreme cleansing conditioner. I switch up between the two. Anyway go &amp; buy it I believe you will LOVE it too.</li>
            <li> I have a texturizer in my hair and have to deal with hard water. I&#x27;ve used other non-sudsing cleansers and found this one to be the best and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. My hair is more easily untangled and shinier when it dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair completely natural since September 2012. This is THE BEST PRODUCT I&#x27;ve used so far. It is the best cowash and detangling product, but generally the most pleasing product that I&#x27;ve used as far as giving me the results that I want without any complaints. I&#x27;m a black girl with hair well past my shoulders that is very thick and very curly. As you might imagine, this makes for a detangling NIGHTMARE. It used to take me hours to work through my hair with conditioner. Now I do it in the shower. For real. This stuff makes it so easy to brush and comb the tangles out, and also helps to clean product buildup out of my hair. (I didn&#x27;t realize how dirty it was since I rarely shampooed.) It&#x27;s lighter weight than conditioners I&#x27;ve used to detangle before, which seems like it helps the comb and brush to glide through more easily. It also makes my hair feel very moisturized and it smells good. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m caucasion but I have long wavy hair that is very easily tangled so I am constantly using different detanglers and deep conditioners trying to make my hair more manageable and easier to comb out when i get out of the shower. this is the first product in my entire life that I have used that did exactly what I needed, it conditioned my hair and allowed me to easily comb my wet hair without ripping any out and it held the water in alot longer and was moiturized and super soft once it dried, not greasy at all. it also smells great I will probably be using this product forever!</li>
            <li> I just started cowashing about 2 months ago and love this product! I have thick, slightly wavy (2a) hair that is prone to frizz and &amp;#34;poof.&amp;#34; My shampoo and condition every other day wasn&#x27;t helping and no amount of leave-in product was helping with frizz. Along came cowashing and my hair is noticeably softer, smoother, and less frizzy. I do have to cowash more frequently (every 2-3 days) vs. when I was shampooing, but the results are much better. Cowashing is normally advertised for curly girls, but it works just as well for my thick, wavy, and course hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried this product a few times and I am not a fan. It doesn&#x27;t rinse out well and it seems to coat the hair making it sticky and heavy. Plus I hate the slippery feel.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad co wash. Still very strange that it basically feels like conditioner but acts as shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product made my natural hair feel brittle and it doesn&#x27;t have a slip. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and very moisturizing.  I have medium curly hair on the dry side.  I was really interested in quitting shampoo cleansers.  I will say, I was trying to use as little as possible but found you really need to use plenty and you really need to scrub around your scalp very good to insure the cream wash breaks down all the dirt and oil before rinsing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Leaves my hair very manageable and soft. I have insanely thick hair so its great when I can get a comb through it and this did just that.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my faves and something I always keep on hand.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year, and just recently stopped when I tried the new Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Manfura Oil line at Target.  This line as put my coconut cowash on the backburner for now, but I am still a fan of the line.  Their Leave In conditioner is a holy grail product for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing a long term transition from relaxed to natural and this makes my hair moisturized and very easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> I purchased after reading such glowing reviews of this product on yt and amazon. I used this three to four times and just found it to be just okay. It cleansed alright but I didn&#x27;t notice any vast improvement in my hair. It&#x27;s a little too watery for my preference. My hair seems to like products that are thick and creamy. I was able to give this to a friend of my daughter who has dreadlocks and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Good packaging from the seller delivery was fast would definitely purchase again. The product smells Devine I can&#x27;t wait to try! I&#x27;ve heard so many reviews on this product all good but let&#x27;s see if it works with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It worked in cleaning my hair. Although I have curly and somewhat kinky hair, so it didn&#x27;t do a miracle. But I like the ingredients and gentleness of this conditioner</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this line.  This co-wash does a very good job of getting rid of product residue and not stripping my hair of what it needs to stay moisturized. I have a mixture of 4a and  4b hair it rinses soft and clean.  I only use this product for co-washes.  You can get it at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply and target.  The price is defiantly right as well. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have curly, tangly hair, and buy a new brand of shampoo/conditioner every time i finish my old bottles. Never buy the same thing again, as nothing works... but this one, is \\&quot;THE ONE\\&quot;. It leaves my hair soft and shiny, while cutting down on my hair wash time. It does not dry out my scalp, but hair doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean. I use this in alternation with pantene shampoo-conditioner combo to keep my scalp clean. Once I stop using silicone based leave-in conditioners, I think I will be able to use this product as my only hair wash. :)  Would recommend co-washing, and using this co-wash to every curly head.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural , so this is a product that I use on myself. I am currently following the no poo method. This product gets my hair clean without drying it out. It does not have a strong smell for you ladies and gentlemen that don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> I recently started doing the Curly Girl or CG Method again and I saw where Mahogany Curls on You Tube was raving about this product. Now, I already have a favorite co-wash (Shi-Naturals Conditioner Wash), however, I wanted to try something new, so I will not run out of my precious Shi-Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the only reason I am not giving it a five star is that I want to try it several more times, however, I must say, that I was really pleased with how it felt on my hair and scalp. No need for a second wash.  A lot of ladies complain about the container, so I purchase a plastic container with a pump top and put all 16 ounces in it and now my conditioner is sitting in my shower for easy access.  I will come back in about a month to give an update. I purchased this from Sally&#x27;s for $7.99. I am a 3c/4a natural.</li>
            <li> One of the best products that I have purchased since going natural. This product helped with moisture control and manageability of my hair.</li>
            <li> Really like the way it makes my hair feel. I use it every morning. I just wish it was a larger size.</li>
            <li> Ships quickly and is as advertised.</li>
            <li> One of the best co-washes out there, period! It has a lot of slip and it detangles my hair so nicely. I use a bunch and I still get my monies worth. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products for my natural hair and I must say this is one of the BEST.. WELL BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. it smells great and helps cleanse &amp; condition my hair. it works great for my 4a/4b hair and gives great slip when i finger comb my hair.</li>
            <li> Great results, hair are very soft and clean, no need to apply conditioner because hair become very smooth and silky right away.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this product.  The second and fourth ingredients on the label are alcohol.  I have naturally curly hair and alcohol is a no-no.  The fragrance was nice and it was thick.  Adequate product for the price.</li>
            <li> New to this transitioning from relaxer to natural has led me in to becoming a product junkie. I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for products that would help maintain my hair since October 2012. Out of them all As I Am&#x27;s Co Wash is by far the best to cleanse and condition the hair. At least in my case. My concerns were that it would leave behind a residue. Not! My hair and scalp felt amazingly clean and manageable. I love the scent too. I used the coconut co-wash as instructed, followed up with As I Am leave-in conditioner and my hair was left much more manageable even after it dried. Some products does wonders while wet but once it dries the excitement is out the window so I waited to post my thoughts. Two days in, my hair is soft to the touch and it feels well nourished. The only other product I used in addition a day later from my wash was black castor oil on my scalp (another amazing product). I will be purchasing more products in the near future from As I Am.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my hair feel. I&#x27;ve tried many products because I&#x27;m new to the natural lifestyle. This co-wash is an absolute keeper.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this co-wash product!!! My daughter is mixed and has a ton of hair w/ two different textures. Very tight-cork screw type curls on the bottom half, and loser curls on the top. This product is amazing! I separate her hair in small sections (dry hair) &amp; comb through the knots, spray the section w/ a water bottle that is filled w/ conditioner &amp; tea tree oil &amp; generously apply the co wash cleansing conditioner. Then I twist it and let it sit for an hour or over night, rinse it &amp; then unravel the twists after it dry&#x27;s a little &amp; we&#x27;re done. It takes me 3 hours to do her hair, but I only do it once a week. This product really minimizes frizz &amp; keeps her curls bouncy &amp; soft. Definitely buying more of this!!!</li>
            <li> never did a cowash on my natural hair but glad I did and with this great conditioning product. as I am has really great products!</li>
            <li> Bought it tonight at a local drug store for half the price of what I found here (thanks to the tip of another reviewer) and, while Coconut Cowash did the job, it didn&#x27;t make my colored/damaged/caucasian hair feel good.  Not that it made it feel bad.  There was simply no silkiness to it.  Didn&#x27;t weigh it down and I appreciate that.  I ended up using Biosilk after the wash to add some softness.  L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Cleansing Conditioner is better for my hair, and I&#x27;ll keep this until my order for L.C.C. comes in (thankfully, Amazon makes it easy to find things I can&#x27;t find in the stores) and for backup when I run out.  Good, sure, but not what my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who had such chemically damaged hair that she couldn&#x27;t even get a nice curl from a hot roller or curling iron. She tried every hair mask and leave in conditioner we could find. She has used this a couple of times now and her hair will now form nice soft looking curls and her naturally wavy hair is no longer frizzy and parched looking. It really is a good product for dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I am super happy to have finally found something that suits my need. This is my favorite cowash so far. It works as if I oiled my hair and then did shampoo followed by a conditioner, and all i have to do for that is to wash my hair with this cowash. I am definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair moist and is not heavy, great for keeping hair clean between salon visits, smells good and hair was clean without stripping natural oils</li>
            <li> My daughter suggested I use cowash to clean my natural hair, which is colored, dry and breaking. I&#x27;ve only used this product once, and like the results.</li>
            <li> I love using this!  The smell is awesome and it cleans my hair as well as it conditions with just one use.  My hair feels soft and is not tangled after the wash.  I do alternate hair products, doing this seems to make my hair happier.  The Coconut Co-wash is one of my favorites to use.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different cleansing conditioners, but this is the most creamy and has excellent slip. My wash and detangle takes less than a 1/2 hour now, versus the 1+ hour nightmare I subjected my hair to before. And it smells delicious!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Hydration Elation (the deep condition) is also a great product!</li>
            <li> It smells great, nice and light smell. It has a nice thick consistency which I love for my hair. I used it yesterday and finger detangled my hair from sections in the shower, I only used about a nickels size on each section and then added another dime amount on my ends. After rinsing it out with cold water my hair felt nice and full and bouncy. I have thick curly hair and usually have trouble with lots of shrinkage but this still left my hair hydrated. Love this product and the ingredients are great and it left a nice slip to it.</li>
            <li> The cost is an investment the results are amazing. It leaves your hair cleansed not stripped ~ smells wonderful &amp; truly removes the product from your hair leaving your hair cleansed and moisturized.</li>
            <li> My hair gets dandruff, so I have to use products like head and shoulder. This cowash does not help remove the dandruff for me, leaving my hair still dirty.</li>
            <li> And in a good way.. the smell is lovely, not too perfume-y but also not too one note, but what i enjoyed about this product was how nice it felt on my hair and scalp. It was not only nourishing but it also cleansed my head and it&#x27;s very hard to find companies that actually do what they say. will definitely recommend this to anyone who likes cowashing or prefers the curly method of hair style.</li>
            <li> I have had really dry hair and trouble getting my curls to come in and keeping my hair moisturized. This keeps my hair moisturized and my curls are as curly as ever!</li>
            <li> This product makes me want to stop shampooing, I love it. I love how it smells and my hair is very clean after using it. I use this as a shampoo, then I put in Giovanni&#x27;s protein treatment, and then I use it again as a conditioner. I don&#x27;t use it as a deep conditioner though, no steam cap, just wash it out. I used it once every other week</li>
            <li> This product works excellent for those of us that want fresh/clean hair everyday. I know hair care experts suggest not washing the hair every day, however this product allows you to do so if desired. I follow up with &#x27;shea moistures&#x27; leave-in conditioner/smoothie and &#x27;taliah wajiid&#x27; curl sealer. This process truly defines my curls.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and easy to detangle. I love this product and the price is great for the amount.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair that tangles easily. This leaves my hair so soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li> I don’t usually review products because I have a hard time finding the time to do it. I believe I’ve reviewed one thing here on Amazon. The reason I decided to write a review for this product is because it’s changed my life! My hair is long, straight, and fine and I would say medium in thickness.  I color my hair (blond) and I also have Lupus so my hair has a hard time in general. Lately, for some reason, my hair has been so difficult to detangle. I have a good brush and was using an expensive shampoo and conditioner that were both sulfate free. When I tried to add more conditioner, it would get that greasy feeling the day after I washed my hair so I ended up having to wash it all the time which put more stress on my poor hair. I have been curious about WEN products but I absolutely refuse to spend so much money on a product that I would probably burn through in a week because I believe, according to the directions on WEN, I would have had to use 20+ pumps each time I washed my hair. So, to be fair, I can’t compare this product to WEN as I’ve never used it. Honestly, I chose this product over some other cleansing conditioners in the same price range because of the ingredients list. In my opinion, natural is best.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this product smells DIVINE. It lingers on your hair, too. Secondly, I was able to comb my hair out IN THE SHOWER which I’ve NEVER been able to do. Lastly, my hair was left feeling and looking very clean. I watched some youtube videos to get some clear instructions regarding co-washing because I had heard that if you didn’t do it right your hair ended up being greasy. I scooped out the product and made sure I got it on my entire scalp and worked it all the way down to my ends. I bent over in the shower because it was easier to really massage the product all over my scalp with my hair hanging down. I combed it out, twisted it and clipped it up while I went on with my shower. I kept it in for about 15 minutes and then made sure to wash it out completely. I let my hair air dry and when it was completely dry I could tell a HUGE difference in the way it looked. No frizzy, puffy ends and hardly any fly aways. My hair looked shiny, felt really clean, had body, and looked almost partially straightened.  I love this Co Wash. I will NEVER go back to regular shampoo and conditioner.  I know some people have complained about the lack of a pump on this but I like the tub because I can get to the very bottom instead of having to take a pump off and bang the bottle to get the remainder of the product out. I hate that!pletely. I let my hair air dry and when it was completely dry I could tell a HUGE difference in the way it looked. No frizzy, puffy ends and hardly any fly aways.

            <li> One of the best rivals to Wen that I have found.  I have grey and course hair that is flyaway and hard to manage.  This product totally cleans your hair without drying it out.  The coconut scent is so nice and inviting when waking up in the shower.  This product now has a permanent place in my home.  Can&#x27;t recommend enough.</li>
            <li> Love it! It really surprised me - I know there are a lot of great reviews, but you never know if they&#x27;re genuine...Smells good, not too thick or greasy, and after using it, I immediately noticed my hair felt lighter and softer.  No joke, I could FEEL that all the build up was gone and my hair felt healthier.  I use every other day, without washing in between.  I have oily hair with dry ends from heat and color damage, wavy/frizzy texture normally.  But not curly or kinky.  I&#x27;m caucasian and didn&#x27;t know if this would be right for me, but it seems it is right for almost anyone.  I will definitely keep using this instead of shampoo and conditioner from now on.</li>
            <li> I am on the fence with this product as I think it dried my hair out more than offering the moistue of a cowash that I was looking for for my 4b/4c hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the interim, I have found that doing a prepoo with a mixture I put together to include 2 ounces of Kinky Kurly leave in conditioner, with 6 ounces of water, 2 ounces of almond oil, 14 drops of lavendar and rosemary and 5 drops of peppermint oils that I put into my hair....not all 8 ounces....and cover with a plastic cap for half hour then cowash with Pantene cowash and my hair likes it. I am no natural hair guru but this is something new I have tried weekly and it seems to offer the moisture I have been missing the last 2 years I have been natural.</li>
            <li> I started my cowash ritual with As I Am Coconut. I was skeptical at first. I wasn&#x27;t sure if my hair can stay clean all day. This actually cleans and hydrates my hair. My hair was full of volume and clean for all day. With the use of Diamax by Nioxin, I felt my hair loss problem seems to cease a bit..  I was very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is the packaging.. It&#x27;s hard to determine how much to use each time and you have to scoop it with your hand.. maybe they can come up with a package in bottles or so..</li>
            <li> Smells great. Finally got into cowashing. Leaves hair smooth and not dry!</li>
            <li> Weird product, but I like it.  Packaging could be better.  Hard to manage a screw off lid with product in one hand while in shower.  A bottle would definitely be a better option with a pop up top.</li>
            <li> Smells far too strong and left my hair feeling dry. Also wasn&#x27;t very effective at cleansing my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels! I am anxiously waiting for them to restock! Thx! My hair feels like silk and is bouncin n behavin&#x27;! Lovin it!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I feel the need to here. I don&#x27;t have particularly curly or kinky hair, but its damaged from excessive heat tool usage and is frizzy, dull and just been feeling BLAH lately. I saw the reviews on here and purchased this product- used it this morning for the first time and I&#x27;m definitely impressed. My hair is MUCH softer, shinier and less frizz! Excited to see what continued use will do considering I&#x27;ve used it once and I&#x27;m already hooked.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and this product does pretty well in taming it. The product has a light coconut fragrance that is fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> This is THE best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my aging, over-processed Caucasian hair.  It cleanses thoroughly, and leaves my hair softer and silikier than I thought possible, without weighing it down or leaving a residue like waxier co-washes like WEN, etc.  Even my blow-outs are easier and hold their shape longer.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amaaazing! I think I&#x27;ve bought about 6 jars of this stuff and it never seems to disappoint. My hair is fine, long, and super dry from going from black to platinum ash blonde and this co wash along with phytos 7 leave in cond. has pretty much saved my hair. This stuff is so moisturizing but yet I don&#x27;t need any shampoo(normally I am oily within a day) I apply a generous amount on my scalp, run the excess through to my ends and massage it in for a min. I let it sit until the end of my shower, rinse thoroughly and when my hair is dry it looks great and clean. AND NO SILICONES... This has been a HOLY GRAIL product for me. Even better is walgreens sells it for about 7 bucks. Doesn&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this cleanses and tames frizz. I love cleansing conditioners. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my hair, and I immediately felt its softness. It is significantly cheaper than the price in beauty stores, and it is worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 9 months after trying a variety of products. I love the way it makes my hair feel. My hair is softer  and smoother after using it and a my curly cream works better. I typically co-wash about twice a week. I don&#x27;t feel this product dries out my hair. The product has a nice scent but not overpowering. My only complaint is sometimes I wish it came in a bottle not a jar.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few washes, but it does clean which I was concerned about.  It also feels very good on the hair and seems to detangle during use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this but it left a coating on my hair that felt waxy.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My issue with co-washing was that my left always ended up still feeling dirty and gunky. Not with this! My hair feels clean, and isn&#x27;t trying. Perfection!</li>
            <li> I was drawn to this product due to the simple instructions. I had previously used a co wash that I bought at a beauty supply store and it was so complicated to use--number of pumps, comb it through hair, leave on for so many minutes--that I just gave up. This product is so easy--just rub it in your palms and then through your hair until it feels saturated. I love how it leaves me hair so soft and manageable! A pro that I did not expect is that it even made me hair easier to straighten while blowing it dry. My scalp feels so good after using this--not dry and itchy like with shampoos. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am a white girl with waist length hair. My hair is color treated. The top layer is blond and I use Argan Oil hair color to achieve that. The underneath is natural. My hair has natural wave. I have used Wen and I wasn&#x27;t totally thrilled with it. I also had used it on my 7 yr old and she complained about the burning she felt. Which I could only attribute to the menthol in it. So I started looking for an alternative. I found As I Am Cococnut CoWash through a YouTube review. I bought it and I LOVE it. I wash my hair every 4 days. I have been using this product for a few months. My hair feels amazing. It&#x27;s cut down on the frizz and I live in Florida, so that&#x27;s saying a lot. It&#x27;s smoother, it&#x27;s hydrated. Less breakage. Less split ends. It&#x27;s amazing stuff. It&#x27;s so easy to distribute through your hair. Mich easier than Wen. No harsh smells. I also use it on my 7 yr old and my 13 month old. It makes my youngest daughter&#x27;s curls just spring up like coils. I love it. My 7 yr old has very fine, wavy flyaway hair and it has done wonders for hers. Try this!! You will not be disappointed and you won&#x27;t back to Wen or the regular shampoos. Also like I mentioned I have bleached hair and this is ALL I USE. No other products. You won&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I am trying the cowash idea.  This product is priced well and has a delicious Coconut smell.  I works well to cleanse my hair.</li>
            <li> Best cowash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> A natural girl&#x27;s best friend! I have been using this product for years.  It&#x27;s a great solution for when you need to clean your hair but don&#x27;t want to go through the full washing process.  It removes the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; and leaves your hair very soft.  I use it often since I work out a lot.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff very cleansing and doesn&#x27;t streak my hair of moisture at all! I have 4a-4b textured hair so finding a good product that helps me manage my hair is hard to find. Then on top of that it only requires a little bit to be applied.</li>
            <li> Still undecided. Lots of Youtube videos say to give CoWash at least a month before making a judgement. Gives the scalp some time to get used to it. My hair feels greasy the next day after using even when I made sure to rinse properly after application. Only been using it one week though.</li>
            <li> This has quickly become 1 of my favorite go to products.  You only need to use a little.  The cowash smells good.  I do suggest putting on a high self in the shower or being extra careful.  I dropped 1/2 the jar in the shower.  DEVASTATED!!!</li>
            <li> The As I Am Coconut Co-Wash is amazing !!! I purchased some today at my local walgreens just to see what the hype was about and it had my hair very soft manageable lots and lots of slip detangling was a breeze for me and usually it&#x27;s a headache this product is a staple for me !!!! (-:</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!. Please don&#x27;t change anything about it. The price is alright &amp; the ingredients are great!. Just that it&#x27;s kinda difficult with all the scooping because it does get messy. However its a great product. Definitely a stapled product for me. My hair loves this stuff!. Thank you AsIAm.</li>
            <li> I just washed my hair with this stuff and was super excited to try it. This is my first time trying the co-wash method and after reading all the excellent reviews wanted to give it a go. Well first of all it took so much of the product to cover my head. Then once I massaged it all over it didn&#x27;t really detangle my hair well. I used my comb to comb it through from root to end and my hair was very tangled. Maybe I didn&#x27;t do it right. Should I have left it on their longer and did like a deep condition treatment or something? I just treated it like I was regualarly washing my hair. So after I couldn&#x27;t bring my comb through my hair, I had to add an additional conditioner to detangle. Once I washed the product out, I dried with a special hair towel for curls that is not ruff on the hair. Then I put some jojoba oil and castor oil on while hair was still damp. Unfortunately I was not impressed with the curl formation of my hair. My curls were not very defined, maybe I messed up the process by adding another conditioner. Later when styling my hair I had to add so much product to make my hair look presentable. Finally I just put it in two strand twists and said the hell with it because it was drying into a frizzy afro with no kind of curl or definition whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think this is the right co-wash product for me. I&#x27;ve heard great things about how co-washing can keep your hair healthy so I will continue with the method, but will not buy this product again. It is not cost effective for the amount that you have to distribute through out your hair and once the product is distributed it did not detangle my hair or give this curl definition that I was looking for. I really wanted this product to work. Perhaps others will have more luck with it, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. :(</li>
            <li> very gentle and moisturizing. great alternative to shampoo for curly/coarse hair</li>
            <li> Love this product on my relaxed hair its amazing and I will use it for life.</li>
            <li> I love As I Am.  I use the leave in as well as the curly jelly and love them all.</li>
            <li> It smalls so so good. Thanks</li>
            <li> I like this product, detangles and cleans beautifully.</li>
            <li> Works well and holds the moisture in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Wife has fine-curly hair. She had happy results with her As I Am CoWash Conditioner. She had no problem transitioning from her regular shampoo &amp; conditioner routine. She immediately found her hair softer, cleaner, and less frizzy than ever before.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Wen, however I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on it and my hairdresser strongly discouraged me from using it. I watch a comparison video in YouTube and As I Am CoWash was one of the alternatives to Wen. I purchased it from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply with my Sally&#x27;s card for about $7 (also sold at Walmart and Walgreens). I used one or twice a week with my Honest Company shampoo/bath wash. The first time was kinda weird because you have to scoop it out and figure out how to get it on your scalp. Anyway, my hair got really clean and felt so soft and the comp just ran right through. I have medium length brown hair with a slight wave and oily scalp. After the first month, I was done with my Honest shampoo and now only using the As I Am. Now on my third tub, I either wash every night or every other night, depending on if my hair is up all day or down all day. I massage into my scalp, then comb though, then rince really well. I had conditioner to the &amp;#34;ponytail&amp;#34; part of my hair for about a min or two, then rince. I don&#x27;t use any other products. I use hairspray on very rare occasions and hardly use leave in conditioner. I have found my wavey hair has become more curly and it&#x27;s in great condition. My hairstylist was skeptical and she has told me my hair hasn&#x27;t been in such great shape as it is now. I&#x27;ve been going to her for 10 years. I also color treat my hair with One n&#x27; Only Argon Oil hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every one has different hair types and has sensitivity to some hair care items (I&#x27;m allergic to papaya and mango) so not every one is going to be able to use this product. I just wanted to share my input and how my hair feels when I use this product. I love it and as long as I can get it at Sally&#x27;s, I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this cowash! One of the best I have tried. Works as good as Wen but 1/3 of the price. I have naturally wavy hair that I color red. It preserves the color so well my stylist asked what I&#x27;ve been using :) You can&#x27;t find a better price than on Amazon. I considered making my own cowash but after pricing out the ingredients it is the same cost as Asiam Coconut Cowash, so I will keep buying it here :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something great! However, this product is just okay, it didn&#x27;t make my hair managable or clean.  I would not buy this product again, nor would I recommend this to another \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hair woman of color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now, my hair really like.  I would recommend this product to my best friend.</li>
            <li> This was delivered a bit messy.  There was no seal when i opened the top so there was conditioner all around the top, sort of oozing out.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure this is the real thing as anyone can put anything in this jar.  I hope this is real - I used it once and it seems ok but again, because there was no seal - it could have been any conditioner inside.  Not sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The As I Am line is working for me.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  It cleans hair so well with no residues and most important it does not dry out hair.  You must try it!</li>
            <li> It was ok but my scalp would feel weird and gunky the next day. Even when I used more it still didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; the next day. I went back to reg shampoo, but I had better results from diluting it with water and using a squeezy bottle.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing co-wash. After the first use i definitely could feel a difference in my hair. When I use this along with the  hydration elation, my hair feels so soft, moisturized, and manageable. I have to attribute it to the fact that I use the co-wash three times per week and the hydration elation every 2 weeks. I also moisturize my hair everyday and apply a leave-in.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff. I have a mix of 3c/4a/4b hair and this stuff made my curls uniformed and my waves moisturized. This is the only product that has given this type of definition. I hate that I waited this long. I will definitely give the other As I Am products a try.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Just wow.  I am a fan of Wen but not a fan of its price.  So I have started trying some of the other &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; in hopes of finding something comparable but not as pricey.  This one is the bomb!  I didn&#x27;t think so while it was actually on my hair in the shower, because it didn&#x27;t give my hair the &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; that Wen does.  But after drying, my hair &amp; scalp are clean, soft, shiny, and perfectly manageable.  No flyaways for my baby-fine locks!  This is my new best find!</li>
            <li> Adore adore adore! Amazing condition and slip added to my hair. I have a combination of textures and mostly use this in the summer months only. This jar will last you forever!</li>
            <li> If you have natural hair and you use natural products on your hair you know about the build up! I can&#x27;t speak for permed heads but, for this natural head of coils and curls, this stuff works wonders! I received my shipment 4/17/2013 and I cowashed the next morning and Hunty-chile! Let me tell you!! My hair is so curly and shiny. I shook my head as much as I could to remove any excess water in the shower and I didnt apply any other products to my hair. I just cowashed, put a band on to catch any dripping water, did a little preping and went to work.  I didnt touch my hair much with my fingers; you know what I mean pulling and stuff, and I scrunched it up with my hands.  The curl/coils were still tight and looking great when I arrived to work! I work recommend this product to NATURAL HEADS HEAD!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not as slippery as Wen...but you can still detangle your hair but not as easily. Sometimes it&#x27;s better to pay extra money for a better product like Wen.</li>
            <li> Very very good.  I use the Wen products but this works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I got my first Coconut Cowash Cleansing Conditioner a little over a week ago and have been using it everyday that I&#x27;ve washed my hair.  (Which has been everyday since buying it, because I have either classes, work or church to go to and like my hair to be clean).  The types of cowashes I&#x27;ve used in the past have either left my hair greasy, or way too dry and gross feeling.  I&#x27;m happy to say that I LOVE this cowash.  It has a lovely, delicate coconut fragrance that is not overpowering at all, detangles my hair wonderfully, and cleanses my hair along with moisturizing it.  My hair does not feel dry or gross at all, it just feels absolutely perfect.  One thing I noticed is that I have to use quite a bit of the cowash to feel like I&#x27;m drenching my hair with it, so I&#x27;ll be going through it very quickly.  My hair just drinks it right up!  It saves time in the shower with just one step instead of having to use a separate shampoo and conditioner.  I leave the cowash in my hair almost the whole time I&#x27;m in the shower.  I love that there is hair growth stimulators in it along with the already great ingredients.  I love this cowash and will continue to buy it.  I recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I am of Caucasian decent and have light brown, naturally curly/wavy hair and it works excellent for my hair type as well.</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Loreal cleansing conditioner and I hate the pump it comes in and the price..... and had considered ordering Wen products but they are  so pricey.  So I found this and tried it.  IT IS AWEOME.  I use it on my daughters waist length thick hair and it stayed beautiful for 3 days!  I really did not need to wash it yet but did it anyway ... she if 5 and the one wash also made washing the hair easier.  It left her hair silky but not weighed down.  Ordering 3 more in just a minute!</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting amazing results, according to the reviews. I was sadly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is curly/wavy, prone to being dry. My scalp is also dry and I do have issues with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon my first use of this product, my hair felt AMAZING...three days in, my hair was an oily mess and I had huge flakes of dandruff. I still continued to use it, up until about a week of use and I used shampoo. I went through that routine for about a month, hoping that eventually it would get better. It didn&#x27;t. I instead had to wash my hair every two or three days because of all the build-up on my scalp. My face and neck started breaking out very badly and somehow alongside the dandruff, I also had pimples on my scalp. Yes, I would wash my face/neck after using this product but it didn&#x27;t seem to matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all it was a huge waste of money for me. I used the whole tub because I&#x27;m definitely not rich, but I will never buy this product again. The best it did for me was make my hair nice for one day, and made it smell nice.</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews and got mixed opinions, so I decided to try it for myself.  Hey, everyone has different hair, so maybe my hair would like it? Not at all.  I washed with it twice and it was two times too many.  My hair felt striped and dry after washing with this, as if I washed with the worst shampoo money could buy.  Did I use too much?  Maybe.  However, at this time, cowashing with conditioner does the trick and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel striped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it smells wonderful and as the product claims, it doesn&#x27;t produce suds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it matters, my hair is mostly 3C with a little 4A mixed in.  My advice to you is to try it out on your hair and see if you like it.  If you do, I am glad it worked for you.  If it doesn&#x27;t, plain conditioner does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other co-washes but this is the best.  It doesn&#x27;t require much but my hair really feels clean without the excess lather. I use it on several different occasions and then use the clarity shampoo maybe once a month. Using this and the other AS I Am products has really made a difference in the look and feel of my hair. I&#x27;ve even received complements on how my hair looks from others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a curly weave and need to wash my hair without stripping the oils out of it. Coconut Cleansing Conditioner leaves my hair soft, sweet smelling, and clean. It&#x27;s HARD to find products that you can use when you have human hair weaves. I&#x27;m REALLY pleased with the product. My hairdresser is impressed too!</li>
            <li> This product is great to use when you don&#x27;t actually want to do a full wash on your natural hair. I would recommend however using a good leave in conditioner and moisturizer after using this product.</li>
            <li> I quit &amp;#34;pooing&amp;#34; about a year ago after a bleach job fried my hair. I can let my hair air-dry after using this without looking like I stuck my finger in a light socket! I will always use this. It&#x27;s ALOT cheaper than WEN and works better. Smell is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it received the BEST cowash award on naturallycurly.com. I was looking for more moisture for my 3b curls, but this didn&#x27;t deliver. I&#x27;m Cinderella looking for the perfect product but so far I&#x27;m the frizzy-haired step sister.</li>
            <li> it came within the same week I ordered it. and it smells and works great on my hair.I also bought the double butter cream which you only need a very little. and the leave in conditioner, and coco spray. Used together makes my hair look, feel and smell great! I will buy this product again!!!</li>
            <li> i do believe this product is a little expensive. i have only used it once so i&#x27;m not sure if i like it or not at this point.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of cowash I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is coarse and naturally wavy/loose curl.  The first brand left my hair dry, so I was pleasantly surprised to find &amp;#34;As I Am&amp;#34; did not.  My hair looked good, smelled good, and was easy to comb through wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for a few weeks, my hair began to shed heavily.  It seemed to be an overall thinning that wouldn&#x27;t stop.  After a couple more months I realized I&#x27;d lost about 1/3 of my volume and I stopped using it. I&#x27;m back to shampoo/conditioner. The hair loss stopped within a week or two of stopping the cowash.</li>
            <li> Received when expected...great product for natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product in my stash for months.  I&#x27;d used it a couple of times and wasn&#x27;t that impressed - it cleansed my scalp, but it did nothing to detangle or moisturize my hair.  I decided to give it one more chance before passing it on, and I am so glad that I did!  I didn&#x27;t follow the application instructions on the jar and I think that made all the difference.  I scoop some out with my fingertips, then smoosh it onto my (already wet) scalp and scrub with the pads of my fingers.  Next, I pull it down the length of my strands (my hair is in four sections, by the way).  I detangle as I go and then rinse.  My hair and scalp are clean and moisturized!</li>
            <li> It was ok, kind of made my hair stringy or course and heavy. Didn&#x27;t make it super soft like advertised. It smelled ok and did make my hair feel clean which I was worried about. It also lasted a while. I have waist length hair and was able to stretch it just as far as a set of bottles of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It is the 1st cowash that I felt actually cleansed my hair. I didn&#x27;t even have to use a conditioner afterwards... No leave-in or nothing! I didn&#x27;t get it from Amazon tho. Walmart, target, walgreens will have it on sale at half price.</li>
            <li> I wish this worked for me but it doesn&#x27;t. For reference: I&#x27;m a Jewish white girl with ethnic (Middle-Eastern/Mediterranean) 2B/C curls and moderately thick hair with well balanced oil. Very similar to Mila Kunis&#x27;s when she used to wear her hair curly ages ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is geared more towards women with more typically African-American curls. I realize the range of AA hair is HUGE and this probably doesn&#x27;t help too much as a discription. But in general, AA hair needs more moisture than Middle-Eastern hair, and would match with this product better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff weighs my hair down a lot. I kind of look like a greasy, drowned cat after I use it, no matter how long I wash it out for. I think I&#x27;ll probably pass this product along to one of my AA friends whom it might be better suited for. I don&#x27;t want to slam it, because it could very well work for anybody with different hair, but if you&#x27;re biracial or white ethnic, it&#x27;s most likely going to be too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I usually use DevaCurl low poo and Dc products, Carol&#x27;s Daughter Milk co-wash and milk products, and Jessie&#x27;s Curl, so if those also work well for you, stay away from this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I love how clean the product is and how few toxic additives it has. On the negative side, I really hate using large tubs of things in the shower. It&#x27;s awkward to open with wet hands and introduces water into the product, which shortens the life of the cowash drastically because it promotes mold growth (especially for this, because it doesn&#x27;t use hard preservatives). I would highly suggest they switch to a squeeze bottle or pump with a large nozzle, instead. Even a traditional shampoo bottle with a twist off top would protect it from mold better.</li>
            <li> this is a staple in mine and my daughters hair reg. It didn&#x27;t leave our hair dry, very moisturizing.we follow up with our regular conditioner, leave in, and essential oils. definite rec&#x27;mend</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have a short layered bob but my hair is super frizzy and dry. I also am sensitive to chemical heavy products and wanted something more natural.  I had been using Hair One cleansing conditioner and loved the way it made my hair feel but it wouldn&#x27;t get out my hair product (hairspray, texture wax, etc)  I just tried this today on a whim and it is AMAZING!!! The coconut cowash made my hair feel very clean, it very easily removed style buildup and my hair felt so soft after like i had just deep conditioned but no residue or buildup!  It smells very good and feels like it would be good for any hair type.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. A bit pricey but it is worth it!!!! Works great alone no need for shampoo. Does all the cleansing itself.</li>
            <li> Hair type: 4c (natural)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair density: thin-med.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair diameter: fine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing regiment: cleansing once per week (with the addition of a conditioner only wash 1-3 times a week)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not in love with this product. The consistency is thick and creamy, very much like a reconstructing conditioner. This consistency makes the product easier to apply. The fragrance is not overpowering. To me it is the typical coconut/chemical infused smell that is quite common in hair care products. I also liked that it did not strip my hair even after using twice. That however seemed to be a problem. I have never had to consistently use a hair cleansing product twice with every washing session. It simply did not leave my hair clean. Even after the second &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell. Perhaps I would have better results if I would use it every day. That unfortunately brings up my biggest gripe about this product and that is the container. I don&#x27;t know who thought anyone would find it easy or the slightest bit enjoyable to fumble around with a smooth 16 oz jar in the shower when that jar contains a slippery substance that you are attempting to manipulate through your hair (sometimes with your eyes closed). I&#x27;ll be switching to Shea Moisture co wash.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! Left my haif feelig clean and soft. I would recommend it to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love use cowash cleaning conditioner number is one ... I love smell so nice hair every weeks ....I want more order this</li>
            <li> I use the co-wash as my only shampoo option. It smells great. easy to use and rinse out. I love the texture of my hair after towel drying.  However, the packaging isn&#x27;t practical. the label peels off, so when I am handling the product with wet hands, I have small pieces from the label on my hands... not cool, but i&#x27;ll live, I suppose. Along with that, I wish the jar had a pump to make it easier in handling the product. While I have not dropped the container in the shower, I often fear it is bound to happen with the label peeling off and trying to screw on/off the lid. Aside from this concern, I love the product. I love how the mild scent is not overpowering. I enjoy that it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> This cowash is wonderful. I have 4b and c hair and it cleanses my hair perfectly, without drying it out. It helps to maintain my healthy natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not natural so maybe its better for natural girls?</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry damaged hair , I tried daily cowashing with this big difference in shedding and manageability of my thick hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> Last month, I ordered this conditioner as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was so porous that it dried out almost instantly after I moisturized it. To make matters worse, it was in the middle of winter. It was so cold that I had to wear multiple layers just to feel warm. So, (after deep conditioning) I applied a &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; made of dimethicone and heavy silicones. For the first 3 days, my hair felt sealed  and moisturized. But by the end of the week my hair was dry again, and no matter how much leave in conditioner I applied, it kept breaking off. So, I ordered As I Am, and it has worked wonders. Not only is the dimethicone gone from my hair, its soft and moisturized as well. But, what I like best is that it didnt dry out my hair, which is very delicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would definitely buy it As I Am Again again. Right now, I only use hot water to cleanse my hair. But, if I my hair was weighed down again, I would definitely use it. I recommend this to naturals prone to product build up.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very similar to Wen</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy curly hair that is thick and course. I love this product because I have extremely dry hair and it works so well with my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product together with the leave in conditioner and double butter daily moisturizer daily for the past 3.5 weeks. They do work well to moisturize curly and wavy hair and to make it soft. I think they also help your hair to grow faster.  However, my scalp never felt clean enough just using the co-wash to clean and felt itchy after 3.5 weeks.  I know this is probably not the recommended way to use the product but I found a way to get it to work better for me and make my scalp clean.  I bought a gentle anti-dandruff shampoo although I don&#x27;t have dandruff, and massaged it on my scalp and rinsed. Then I used the co-wash and put the leave in conditioner on my wet hair and let it air-dry.  When it was dry, I rubbed a bit of the double butter daily moisturizer in my palms and scrunched my hair. Now my hair feels clean and moisturized with bouncy curls.</li>
            <li> I use this every two days and Wen the others.  It works ok with my curls.  Does not weigh them down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for over a month and I love it. Leaves my hair clean and soft. I&#x27;m Caucasian, blonde with straight hair that had a slight wave. Smells terrific. Great price.</li>
            <li> Love the price, wish it detangled a little better but I&#x27;m satisfied with it for the price. Wish it was in a pump so it&#x27;d be easier to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and luxurious!</li>
            <li> I went to use this product and I could feel my hair drying out, while I was co-washing it.  I love co-washing my fine naturally blonde hair.  It leaves it healthy, no frizz, and removes split ends for good.  However, this product did not like my natural blonde hair.  I could feel the texture of my hair changing, while I was still washing it.  I finished up my hair routine and waited till it was dry and my hair was frizzy and felt damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may work for thicker hair, however I do not recommend it for naturally curly fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Order this product base on what I seen on Youtube, I tried and happy with the result it made my hair easy to detangle..</li>
            <li> The product is great, and I would highly recommend it! I have been using it for over a year now. It is very hydrating and can be used as a cowash or a conditioner. Cowashing definitely takes time to let your hair get used to it. My hair was very greasy at first, but after about two weeks my hair looked amazing! I have wavy hair that is of average thickness.</li>
            <li> Ok, first of all, I&#x27;m a a 3a white-girl, and I did get some odd looks from the cashier at Sally&#x27;s when purchasing this product.  I am not at all sorry that I did, though -- it&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Like many before me, I like Wen, but I do not like the price.  This is a nice alternative -- it was on sale for $6.99 and I had a 20% coupon -- so I actually paid about $5.60.  In my opinion, that&#x27;s not bad for 16 oz. of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my results:  GREAT.  My hair feels clean and LIGHT (anybody who has ever had build-up or a co-wash that didn&#x27;t get you quite clean enough will appreciate this) and OH-so-soft.  Like, seriously, you won&#x27;t believe how soft.  My curls are shiny and defined (well, except I kept putting my hands in &#x27;em, so they probably could have looked even better if I had more self-control!)  But, seriously -- my hair feels so nice.  Waaaaaaay better than when I co-wash with Vo5 conditioners.  I&#x27;d say the results I&#x27;ve gotten are comparable to Wen, maybe even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Con I can think of is -- well, I am not too too crazy about the smell.  I know I&#x27;m in the minority there -- as most people love it.  It&#x27;s not God-awful, just not great, in my opinion.  That will not stop me from re-purchasing, though -- as I think this stuff is awesome.  If you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;ll work well on caucasion hair, I vote &#x27;yes&#x27; -- it&#x27;s amazing for mine.</li>
            <li> In the past I have thought that I found the rite products for my hair. For example Cream of Nature. Although I never discontinue the Cream of Nature shampoo, I tried so hard to stop shampooing. Trust me when I say shampooing  was a very difficult habbit to break. As a little girl my mother washed my hair weekly and now I shampoo my hair every other month.  I thank my discovery and the making of this product  As I am. Nevertheless, this product As I am Cowash is the Absolute BEST. It doesn&#x27;t clunk nor flake and it is very gentle to my 3b-3c type hair. Buy it it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am a African American with 4c natural hair. I have been looking for some products to help my dry/fragile hair. So I decided to try this. It dried my hair out. So I gave it to my husband who a different grade of hair and he loves it. Works wonders for him.</li>
            <li> It smelled fairly decent but it didn&#x27;t moisturize as deeply as I&#x27;d like. I couldn&#x27;t comb through my hair after cowashing with this conditioner which sucks. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This product is versatile, examples: I used it as a cleanser, a conditioner and a leave in.  Best bang for your buck in my opinion. Has great slip, so detangling was a breeze. Smells yummy, leaves hair feeling very soft and for all the naturals that don&#x27;t really have the time or energy to create every single thing in the kitchen( lol ), this product is a blessing!</li>
            <li> my daughter used this every day! lasted about a month but her thin dammaged hair looked great, i need to oeder more!!! I have used WEN and now I have changed because the price is much better!!! and results even better!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for preserving hair color and keeping my hair hydrated without sacrificeing body and shine. I&#x27;ve colored my hair for 35 years + and have hair that is resistant to retaining applied hair color. My wonderful stylist recommended this product and other sulfate free brands. It does not replace staying out of the sun or using a hat ( I hate a hat ) but my hair feels soft and healthy but easily style able . I haven&#x27;t found it in any local retail stores but thank goodness for Amazon !! I highly recommend it for any type of hair. I have very fine and lately thinning hair. These products are hair savers , protect against heat styling and heat blow drying .  :)</li>
            <li> I usually co-wash, and this was my first time using this product. It completely dried out my hair, it felt my straw. I couldn&#x27;t even detangle it with the product in my hair. Tried it three times but will be throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> This works really well on my naturally curly grey hair.  When I use this my hair is soft, shiny and manageable.  I recently tried another conditioner made with shea butter and ended up with hair the texture of straw. I am back to stay with the coconut cowash!  Also, I gave a friend with straight hair a container of this, and both she and her husband loved it immediately.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It goes a long way too! I sometimes even clean my body with it for the moisture it provides. Great stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Co Wash leaves my hair soft and manageable, i use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> Not gonna work for my hair this kinky curly girl doesnt like this at all! The flakey mess that I was upon waking up in the morning after using this product is not cool. I dont like the smell it was not strong but if your gonna scent your product scent it dont tease me lol! Anywhoo I did like the twist cream so thats why I chose 2 stars but it was ok but that jelly dont do it trust it&#x27;s not a fashion statment when you have little white clumps in your wash and go.</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 stars because of the container. The product should be in a shampoo bottle so it can be easily used in the shower, It&#x27;s hard to scoop the product out, figure out where you are going to place it in the shower (the container is too big for a shower caddy) while you put the cowash in your hair, and then put the top back on it so water does not splash in it . One time I even dropped the container. Luckily, most of it stayed in the container, but then the shower floor was slippery from the spilled cowash, so I had to clean the shower floor. All this to wash my hair with this cowash seems like alot, especially when I can just use a conditioner that is in a more functional container.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  It is more expensive than others, but it gives great conditioning and slippage with shower comb outs.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i love this stuff, i like the way my hair looks so clean and moisturized, and it detangles easily.. i would buy this again, i just wished they made a bigger size, i have a whole lot of hair, and i used this jar twice..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cowash for some time now and stumbled upon this one. The ingredient list alone is impressive, but the real wow factor came in the use of the product. It has excellent slip and immediately I can feel the difference in my hair. I&#x27;ve been natural for almost 15yrs now and this is by far one of the best products that I have used.</li>
            <li> Simply put: the absolute best!!! I will never stop using this product. Even though it doesn&#x27;t lather up, you can definitely feel it through your hair unlike WEN products</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian woman with 2C type hair. My hair is light colored and almost to my waist. I will never go back to regular shampoo again. Co-washing is definitely the way to go for me. I have tried several co-washes and found that some were too heavy for my hair while others made my hair so silky the curl wouldn&#x27;t hold.  I love As I Am Cowash!  It is the perfect balance of moisturizing and cleansing without making me greasy.</li>
            <li> It smells good but it doesn&#x27;t really feel like it is cleaning my hair.  I prefer to just use small amounts of shampoo to wash my hair because it actually feels clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> So I did the big chop on 10/26/12.  Prior to that I had not had a relaxer since May 2012 believe you me it was a hot mess, so I had to cut it.  Well since I work out three-four times a week I have to wash my hair often. This stuff is perfect.  The product is light and does not weigh your hair down.  It smells like heaven in a jar. I treat it like shampoo:  I wet my hair, place a large scoop on my head and work it in, then comb it through, let it sit for a while 5-10 minutes and wash out.  The bottle says don&#x27;t repeat unless your hair is really dirty, so I don&#x27;t.  I say, if your hair is dirty enough requiring a repeat then wash it with shampoo.  I use the cowash three times a week and then wash my hair with shampoo once a week.  The only draw back of the cowash is that it makes my curls really really tight.  I air dry my hair over night, so in the morning I do not put any other conditioning product in my hair so as the day goes on my curls will loosen up.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the As I Am Coconut Cowash from Sally&#x27;s. After hearing mostly great reviews and a few negative reviews from 3c hair naturals I decided to give it a try since it was only $6. Oh My Gosh this stuff is insanely amazing! I have 3c fine hair and this works so well for me, not to mention the delicious smell. The only issue I have is the fact that it is in a jar :( a pump would have been so much more convenient.</li>
            <li> my new must have. my routine wash partner. leaves your hair soft and manageable and smells great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair very soft or healthy feeling at all. It feels like regular conditioner. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine dry wavy white girl hair and this is THE only conditioning cleanser that makes my hair feel wonderful, lush and moisturized without weighing it down. I love this and hope they never discontinue it. The only complaint is the jar is awkward in the shower and the label flakes off, but I can live with that because of the fabulous product inside!</li>
            <li> This product defines my dry, coarse,twa,4a/b hair. I love this conditioner when i use it I see my tiny randomly placed curls string to life ! My hair is  looser in pattern and the part of my head that consist a cotton texture is looser and easy to detange with my fingers. . I like the smell because I love coconuts and I added extra coconut oil to mine extra nourishment and added fragrance. Sometimes I use this product as a leave in my hair look fluffy in a healthy and full of volume on top of my thick head of hair .Why use shampoo when you can use as i am cowash?</li>
            <li> saw on the net favorable opinions so I wanted to test it and it works well with my hair texlaxed</li>
            <li> I love this conditioning cleanser.  I am caucasian, with color treated hair. My hair is not too dry, but the ends tend to be on the dry side. I&#x27;ve used this twice now and my daughter&#x27;s used it once.  my hair has been so soft and silky.  maybe not as voluminous as I&#x27;d like, but I use some volumizing mouse on my roots and that helps allot.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is bleached/highlighted and naturally wavy/curly and tends to look frizzy.  she used it last night for the first time and her hair is so soft and silky looking.  I like the smell - I know some people don&#x27;t, but I do!</li>
            <li> I am a 4c newly natural female. When I first big chopped, my hair was super, super dry. I learnt pretty quickly that shampoos, including sulfate-free ones, were a no-no for my hair. I decided to try this cowash as an alternative. So glad I did. It provides a good clean without stripping the hair of precious moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most newly natural folks, I became a product junkie. So when my first tub of this cowash was done, I decided to try the Shea Moisture Coconut and Hibiscus cowash. That was a mistake. I had to use more of it than I did the As I Am to achieve the same degree of cleansing and it made my hair dry. I couldn&#x27;t wait for it to be finished so I could return to my As I Am. Now that we have reunited I will never switch again.</li>
            <li> Very good product it smells so good I got my product on time and was able to track it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Great and it smells heavenly. My daughter&#x27;s hair was dry and brittle she used this and her hair was soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Jamaican with fine relaxed hair this product was amazing. My hair was tangle-free and very manageable. I co wash my hair twice a week. I always use a small amount daily as an hair moisture. Great product.</li>
            <li> I used WEN for years but it is so expensive. I tried this and it works great - no need to shampoo, just use this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great!  Leaves my hair soft and clean for a week, even though I put leave in conditioner in it ever day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I thought i had straight hair with a slight wave but after using only this in the shower and the Loreal EverCreme leave-in spray I found out I can get natural full bodied waves when air drying my hair. Epic stuff!</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, straight and limp and very oily.  I started using WEN hair care, but it was so expensive (about $25-$30 a bottle). I found this when searching for products that were comparable to WEN. I love the product and use it as my only \\&quot;shampoo/conditioner\\&quot;. All my other products have since gone in the trash. My hair is so much softer and more manageable. I highly recommend viewing the WEN product training video before use, because this is the technique I use when \\&quot;washing\\&quot; my hair. I start by getting lots of product at my roots, then work it throughout the hair. I use a wide comb to comb it through while the product is still on. I&#x27;ll often use a clip to pull it out of the way while I finish my shower. Then I rinse it out, but be warned: if you don&#x27;t fully rinse it, your hair will be very oily! Just know that if you use it the way I do (as your shampoo/conditioner) it will NOT lather&lt;br /&gt;As I stated in the title, I found it cheaper elsewhere (which is surprising from Amazon). I buy mine at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for $5-$8 a jar and don&#x27;t have to wait. If I catch it on sale, I buy as much as I can.&lt;br /&gt;This is normally a product for ethnic hair, but it works wonders on my straight, \\&quot;white girl\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the moisture it leaves on the hair.  This co-wash leaves the hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I like this co-washer a lot---it cuts my hair shower time in half. The smell is not my favorite, but I am just not a coconut fan.</li>
            <li> The product works very well but after careful research, I found it for way cheaper than this, its okay, I&#x27;ll just research before buying, but the products is Great!</li>
            <li> Upon hearing the reviews on YouTube about this product and being that I have other products in this line I was over joyed at having another option for a Co wash and it performed beautifully.</li>
            <li> When it comes to this cowashing conditioner it does the job! Now I can&#x27;t speak for everyone else but for me my hair LOVES this product!! It leaves it cleansed, soft and MOISTURIZED! I will forever keep this in my stash! I usually use this in between shampoo washes! 💜</li>
            <li> I returned this item.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  As other glowing reviews already mentioned, this cowash has a pleasant scent, cleanses and conditions.  Nothing new there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I hate about this product is the jar.  I use it in the shower and water gets into the jar and I have to pour out the water, while also pouring out some of the product at the same time.  I will be putting this into another container as another reviewer mentioned.  That is my only negative and the reason for a four star review.</li>
            <li> Made my hair silky soft and cleaned without stripping. Made it very easy to detangle and no buildup either. Just wish it was in a pump but overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes my natural hair look and feel great. Will continue to use this. Also on my granddaughters natural hair</li>
            <li> After seeing this product on a few drug store shelves and reading positive reviews i decided to give it a try. Luckily, i was able to purchase it on sale at Walgreens for $6.99 (the product is normally $7.99) and after a month of using this cleansing conditioner, I am officially hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The As i am co wash is not my first experience with a cleansing conditioner: for several months I was a fan of the Hair One Argan oil cleansing conditioner which was great but left me with a little bit of product build up. I don&#x27;t get product build up from the coconut co wash and it spreads throughout my hair better than hair one. I figured the jar of the coconut co wash would barely last a few weeks but surprisingly after a month I still have more than half of the product left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American woman with natural hair that ranges from 3b to 4a and this product is amazing. Once I have saturated my strands with the co wash my curls just pop. I leave it in for about 5 minutes, finger comb thru, then rinse out. I treat it like a normal shampoo and so i use a conditioner and leave in afterwards.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser, it took a few washes for my hair to adjust to it but now it is much easier to manage and when I straighten it it&#x27;s shiny, my naturally curly, fuzzy hair has never been shiny. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I product is okay.  My hair was more manageable after washing.  Was much easier to detangle.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I am able to shampoo my wavy/curly shoulder length hair just once a week now. I have been using As I Am for 4 weeks now and even on 6 days without shampooing, my hair feels clean, not flat or greasy and smells fresh too. For best results, follow the instuctions and massage into hair as if its a shampoo to leave your hair squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I have tried many cleansing conditioners, and this is my favorite alongside Wen products.  The smell is lovely and not too strong, it applies nicely, rinses out well, and leaves my hair really easy to dry &amp; style.  The only change I would recommend would be to put this in a bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who found this a great product. I have very bad dandruff, perhaps psoriasis and always had to use special shampoos/conditioners but I gave this a try and have not been disappointed. It leaves my scalp clean and the hair so soft and the breakage has lessened. I feel like I have something I can stick with.</li>
            <li> I happened to stumble upon this on clearance at Target and bought it. Now I&#x27;m on the hunt for more! It is such a moisturizing conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling dirty or weighed down. It helps control my frizz and it also helps to keep my curls in check. I must say that if your hair is easily weighed down or it is not dry this might not be an option for you.</li>
            <li> My fav for co washing.</li>
            <li> This product is marketed for curly african american hair. I am Caucasian with long, straight hair. Its the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. I tried Wen and loved it....only I got a whopping 6 washes out of one $30 bottle. This stuff is less than $10 and I&#x27;ve even seen it at walmart. I use just as much as Wen and the same method. One container can go a long way. I section my hair into 4 sections and wash each with a good sided dollop of the stuff, then I spaltter a bit of water on without rinsing and let it sit for 5 min then rinse. Then I repeat. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month (I wash 3x/week) and there is still half a container left. The smell btw is amazing. I can even still smell it 2-3 days after washing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. It&#x27;s a awesome product, it makes hair really wonderful. will order it again</li>
            <li> The product smells okay and has a nice consistency, but doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp. I don&#x27;t use it because it doesn&#x27;t do the job of a shampoo, and isn&#x27;t actually a conditioner. I had high hopes for it because traditional shampoos do dry out my hair. I have locs, so it is more difficult to clean my scalp, but traditional shampoos do a great job, and this cowash didn&#x27;t. I have been sticking with traditional shampoos and then follow with a traditional conditioner.</li>
            <li> While this co-wash does get your scalp clean. it almost does too good of a job. after using it parts of my scalp would slightly burn it wasnt a good feelingat all. also ther isnt a pay off for that feeling my curls werent defined and it left my hair tangled and dry. this product is way to stripping i have an entire jar left and plan to either give it away or throw it out i suggest you run while you still can</li>
            <li> All I can say is WoW!! I love the results of my hair!! I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of my soft curls. I washed my hair with the AS I AM Coconut CoWash Cleansing Conditioner and then I applied the AS I AM Leave in Conditioner and I let my hair air dry and bam!! soft touchable curls..no frizz and no dryness!! No other styling products needed! I was using Tresemme Shampoo and Conditioner..but my hair never felt this soft or moisturized after using Tresemme (I would have frizz and dryness). I never was satisfied with how my hair looked or felt.  I have finally found my products of choice within the AS I AM line.  I will be purchasing again and again!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel this did anything more for my hair than using a cheapie conditioner to cowash. My hair is by nature quite dry so maybe I&#x27;m just not a good candidate for this product.</li>
            <li> Smells SO SO GOOD!! I use it in my 6-yr olds long naturally curly hair and her hair is always super soft and tropically smelling when you get close to her, but not overpowering. Just ordered my second one</li>
            <li> I use this to cowash my transitioning hair, but I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in using regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is the solution to over washed and brittle hair. My hair is extremely manageable after application. The scent is refreshing!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Makes my curls softer than usually, I think my natural hair texture is between 4b and 4c. I feel softens after my hair air dryed too.</li>
            <li> I would recommend giving this product a try! I have used up my first jar and I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so luscious after I apply this. I use this product only when I am wearing my hair curly/natural. Never any tangles when use this. The water runs right through to detangle without even the need of comb in the shower. I use a lathering shampoo once a week, but for daily washing I use this product and a conditioner. I also sometimes apply a small amount as I style.</li>
            <li> I was excited about ordering this.  I was disappointed.  My hair is colored and can be a bit dry.  I definitely did not feel there was enough conditioner for  my hair and had a hard time detangling my curly hair after using this product.  Had to put conditioner on my hair after using this product. I gave it to a co-worker.</li>
            <li> My hair smellled grea and was so soft!!! Love this line</li>
            <li> This product is good, but not great. I&#x27;ve used Wen in the past, but like so many others, I couldn&#x27;t afford to stay with it. Tried this hoping it would deliver similar results. It smells great and definitely cleans your hair, but as far as repairing it, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as I would have hoped. The results weren&#x27;t all that different from a regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> IDK, I didn&#x27;t like it. made my hair very course and tangled.</li>
            <li> I started looking for this product when I seen a review of it on YouTube. I wanted to try something that would give me moisture and not leave my hair heavy. I received the product and used it the same night, love it! It is pricey, but now that I&#x27;ve used it I can say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I have type 4a naturally curly hair and expected more as far as detangling.  There is no way I could use this as a cowash without following up with a conditioner to detangle my hair afterwards.  I may continue to use it because the ingredients may be more gentle than regular shampoos, but calling it a cowash doesn&#x27;t really seem appropriate based on the results I had.  There are a ton of sulfate free shampoos that would have given me the same results.  This was my first cowash specific purchase.  Doubtful I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to being natural (this month marks a year) and it&#x27;s been a struggle trying to find products that work well with my hair. I do not discriminate, so I&#x27;ve tried products from Regis all the way to the Kinky Curly line. Some worked, and obviously others did not. However, I am happy to say that this is on the list of items that worked great. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, and I love that it does not dry out my hair like shampoo, and it keeps my hair nice and soft. I feel like it even defines my curls, and it smells great which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Cleanses and softens 4c hair. Better than shampoo. It&#x27;s weird that you can feel the moisture and cleanse at the same time. Keeps my hair soft when done. You should still detangle before applying if you have 4c hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not loosing my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> I have type 4 hair and it gets tangled easily and needs products with a lot of slip for detangling. This cowash has that and it leaves your hair feeling clean but not stripped of all moisture IF you wash a section of hair ONCE. If you wash, rinse, repeat a section twice or more, it feels more \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot;.  I guess that would be fine if you have a lot of product buildup in your hair, otherwise, one pass is good. I followed up with my regular leave in conditioner and my hair feels soft and moisturized. I prefer this cowash over regular shampoo but, I would NOT buy this on Amazon. I got the 16 oz jar for $6.50 at Walgreens and saw some of the other \\&quot;As I Am\\&quot; products as well for much cheaper than what I saw on here.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my daugthers hair which is coiled.  I only used it once and the product made my daughter&#x27;s curls stand out beautifully.  I&#x27;ve never seen it like this.  I rated a 4 instead of a 5 because it was only used once, however I do recommend for those with tight coils that want their curl pattern to really show.</li>
            <li> LOVE this shampoo.  It is not a sudsy shampoo, but is very healthy for your hair and scalp!!!</li>
            <li> This cowash worked very nicely, it left my hair so soft, and I have to say that I liked it much better than wen. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I found this product dried my hair out even more than it was already disappointed because I was hoping to get rid of my frizz. If your hair is really dry leave this product alone.</li>
            <li> I use this, and their leave-in-conditioner, nearly every day on my &amp;#34;multicultural hair&amp;#34; - shoulder length curly 2a/b. Both products are a few dollars less expensive at other online retailers with brick-and-mortar locations.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff already! Although I am not natural,I stretch my relaxers for at &amp;#34;least&amp;#34; 90 days (3 months) at a time. My hair is naturally thick and are very full so when it gets nappy I still get to enjoy the best of both worlds. I have been experimenting with hair care products for about 4 to five years now and I am loving these items as well as Shea Moisture which is another line I own and just love. Normally I would just stick to one line but my hair just love new stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I used this &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34;, but by me not being natural and hadn&#x27;t had the proper shampoo in a week, I  had to wash it out,otherwise my hair would have been a icky mess. But I can use this as a leave in and apply it to the ends of my hair when I am roller setting it. I love that it&#x27;s a 16 ounce jar and it does not take much! I also like the listed ingredients on the front!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, goes on hair smoothly, hair feels softer.</li>
            <li> I was at sally&#x27;s going to purchace hair one cleansing conditioners when I spotted this at the counter for only 5.99. So i thought well why not! I am an all natural with 4a/b and a little c hair.  I usually do a twist out so i have a lot of product build up and I only had to apply a little more than a palm full of the cleanser. My hair is medium length. I let the cleanser in my hair for about 10 minutes idetangled with a wide tooth comb and I&#x27;m happy to say myhair is very clean just after one wash. I do not recommend anyone use this product more then once a week because it may dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. I have been searching for something like this.  I have naturally curly hair, and I think my curls love this stuff because they are so bouncy afterwards and i dont even need to condition. Plus, it leaves your hair smelling great.</li>
            <li> my favorite co-wash but can get cheaper in the store!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I heard so much about it.  If you&#x27;re using the curly girl method this product is very helpful.  I made the mistake of using it on my daughters hair after having heavy build up of product.  It&#x27;s not made to clarify just a gentle cleanser.  All in all I would purchase it again but it needs a pump.</li>
            <li> This  coconut cowash is fine. It does the job of cleansing without the harshness of shampoo. But compared to No Poo by Devachan which is what I usually use, I&#x27;m disappointed. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel as soft when rinsed. I think that some of the ingredients strip your hair more than the product description suggests.</li>
            <li> Stripped my hair of it&#x27;s natural moisture and left it dry and brittle and did nothing as far as detangling. I had to use another co-wash the very next day. I have 3c/4a type hair. I love their leave in conditioner but unfortunately this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I have only used it for a couple of weeks now, and I started using it everyday, shampooing once a week or so. I have very oily hair naturally, it is wavy, fluffy, and blonde. Because of this, I don&#x27;t like using conditioners that contain sulfates or silicone, as they weigh down my hair and mess with the texture. I also have psoriasis on my scalp, so I use a natural dandruff shampoo that I love.&lt;br /&gt;Although this is a co-wash, I have now started using my shampoo with it daily, but only on my scalp. When I went without shampoo, my hair was just too oily. So even though it is meant to be used by itself, I like it better than any conditioner I have ever used. When used with a good shampoo, my hair feels soft, smooth, weightless, and clean. It really feels like it is repairing my hair, and letting my natural curls feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;If you have naturally oily hair, I recommend this as a CONDITIONER rather than a co-wash. But a great conditioner at that! Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than 5, because I do not like it that much as a co-wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, natural product!</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot of great reviews about this brand but I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I have relaxed hair and I found that my hair wasn&#x27;t really soft or detangled after using it. It also left a weird residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair but decided to give this a try, because I didn&#x27;t want to use shampoo every week. I wanted to use shampoo every other week and this as a fill in for the shampoo the weeks between, because this wouldn&#x27;t strip my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. It removed build-up, conditioner my hair, and doesn&#x27;t strip it like a regular shampoo. I will definitely keep using this</li>
            <li> The delivery was speedy but I am not too thrilled with the actual product for my hair. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different so I am not mad,,,,this had nothing to do with the seller.</li>
            <li> First time trial today, and was happy with the result!  I&#x27;ve used Wen for 7 months, and the product is great...but the price for it is not. I set out to find a substitute, and I think this is it!&lt;br /&gt; The AS I AM was easy to apply, a little goes a long way, and you get quite a bit of it. Left my hair detangled, soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I massaged it into scalp &amp; hair...left it in while I completed my shower, then rinsed, rinsed, rinsed. Hair feels moisturized and clean, with movement and shine.  Love the price!&lt;br /&gt;I think I have found my new co wash.&lt;br /&gt;I should mention I had tried both Hair One &amp; Lisa Rachael co washes and my&lt;br /&gt;hair felt dry and was terribly tangled.  This left my hair feeling soft and looking great.&lt;br /&gt; I did have a few strands of hair in my fingers after I ran them through, but it may just have been the clarifying aspect ridding me of weighed down dead hair. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE...HUGE BUMMER! The second and third times I used this it was NOT good. Hair was quite dry and somewhat tangled after washing. Did not style easily or well. Did not look good. Such a difference from that first usage. Hair has continued to fall  out in my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Am changing rating from 5 to 2 stars. 2 stars only because it was good that first time, and might continue to work for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a huge disappointment!!!</li>
            <li> Really nice, my hair was soft and manageable.  I have only used once so far but think it will be a part of my haircare regiment.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how big the jar is !</li>
            <li> love this product.  leaves my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> This product completely destroyed my  hair.  It was beautiful and past my shoulder blades.  Now its really short because I had to cut off all the breakage.  I am so disgusted.  I should have just left my hair alone but the reviews which I rely on with amazon were so good,  I dont know how, my hair felt like straw.  My joico is the absolute bestl</li>
            <li> This is an ok cowash cleanser. It doesnt give me much slip. It does but not enough that I can detamgle with ease. I have to use a conditioner with more slip afterwards. But it does keep my scalp cleansed and moisturized</li>
            <li> I was looking got something to replace my &amp;#34;famous celebrity cowash&amp;#34; products...this really didn&#x27;t come close to hitting the mark.  The scent is absolutely wonderful, and it does great on my skin...thus the two stars...but just really didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is not for everyone. My daughter and I have different textured hair. My hair is very fine and her hair is thick and medium grade. The As I am products dose wonders for my hair. My daughter on the other hand it does nothing for her hair. It makes it hard to manage. So I say this all the good reviews  are correct in saying it is a fine product because certain texture it works well. On hair that is more course it does not do well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because after opening the box I realized it had spilled a bit.</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great, works great, very economical. 👍</li>
            <li> Good detangler, but not the best.  Even though I washed out all traces of it, it left my hair limp.  Joico is a better choice for a detangler.</li>
            <li> I first bought this off a sale rack at the local beauty supply store.  I have curly hair, and that is what this product works well with - it would also be excellent for dry hair.  I used up that bottle, and knew I had to buy more.  It&#x27;s now the only cleansing product I use in that the more I use it the better my hair looks, less fuzz, more shine, better manageability, nicer curls.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> The hairdresser told me about this product a year ago, and I have used only this since the first time I tried it.  Although it&#x27;s available locally, Amazon sells it at a lower price.  It&#x27;s a great product because it gets my hair clean and conditions it at the same time.  I&#x27;ve even had people tell me it smells good after I&#x27;ve used it.  It keeps my hair soft, without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> Great for natural and synthetic hair! Nice smell. Makes hair soft.</li>
            <li> very good. i like how it detangles your hair and it smell so good. will recommend.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is great for dry hair. Easy to use with or without shampoo. The whole family loves it.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product on my scalp it is great. I cold wash my hair and I do like this will buy again</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this co-wash. No flaking and my african american hair feels soft and silky. Have used it for a solid week everyday and I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once but it was comparable to Wen, maybe even better as the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; in Wen has been known to burn my eyes and cause my scalp to itch. I let my hair dry naturally with no product in it and it felt very soft with no frizz which is a miracle for my hair and the humidity here in Hawaii. The smell was mild but nice and so far, I love it, plus...you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair nice and soft.  I went natural almost a year now and this is one of my go to product.  My hair is clean, smells great and is manageable after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and so light! Spreads well to so I don&#x27;t use the whole thing with one wash.</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled with the As I Am product&#x27;s.  I have had many of their product&#x27;s before throwing them away.  I have a very good grain of hair and this product does not work well at all on my hair.  It  is unable to detangle, manage or straighten out the hair at all.  This product is costly, but does not deliver despite it&#x27;s many great reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third container of this product. I tried everything after the salon fried my hair and this has really helped repair my hair. It is soft and curly again.  I use a different shampoo to keep the highlights bright in my hair, and then use this as a conditioner for 5 minutes and rinse it out. I will be trying the other products in this brand.</li>
            <li> Incredible products I am a female of Caucasian but absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> This was a nice conditioner, but didn&#x27;t work well as a cowash for me. It just didn&#x27;t feel like it had any cleansing power.</li>
            <li> A good conditioner and cleanser</li>
            <li> wonderful product, has done wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> So much better than WEN.  I have long blonde hair that is pretty thick and wavy.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love is, when I wash it out my shower is so slippery I have to use a detachable shower head to rinse the bottom of the shower so I don&#x27;t slip.  No other conditioner has ever done this.  Besides that, I use to use WEN, but it&#x27;s so overpriced and this product does a much better job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and cleans well too. I have nothing bad to say of this hair cleanser.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair is a big fuzzy mess. This really made my hair soft and clean. It smells a little chemical-ish but it also has a nice strong coconut smell. It smells great when it dries. My hair is bad damaged and this really took that straw dry feel out of my hair and I have only used it once. I didn&#x27;t use any product or other conditioner only this product and my hair was fairly oily when I got in the shower.  I would suggest a second conditioner or leave in if you have coarser hair. Hope my experience is helpful!  :) :)</li>
            <li> This is the best CoWash I&#x27;ve ever used.  Hair Rules was okay and Loreal&#x27;s version was way to chemically smelling for my tastes.  This leaves my hair perfectly clean but not at all dry.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Right amount of cleanser and conditioner.  Great smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out natural hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not have the detangling power of Wen, BUT I love that the formula is not as thick as Wen.  I also love that it&#x27;s all natural.  I am switching over from Wen to this product for good.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of hype surrounding this product at the moment.  Not sure it&#x27;s as AMAZING as people make it seem, but if you have wavy, curly or coily hair, you will notice a difference in not using shampoo period, regardless of if you use this product or another conditioner. That being said- Ill continue to use this because it&#x27;s made specifically for people who want to maintain moisture by not using shampoo- and I also just dont trust most other companies ingredients.</li>
            <li> I HATE to wash my hair.  I mean, I hate it.  I have a lot of very fine hair.  Very thick and wavy, but fine.  It takes about 45 minutes to dry it and because it is so fine and (did I mention) dry (oh, and how about damaged from coloring) it gets frizzy frizzy frizzy.  This is of course not helped by the fact that I live in Arizona where the air itself is dry and frizzy!  Anyways - all that has changed since I used this wonderful product.  I had read a review in the NY Times about co-shampoos in general and thought maybe I would like them.  Then I came on here and checked out the reviews and after reading quite a few on quite a few different brands bought this one.  Look!  Five stars!  After only ONE shampoo (co-shampoo?) everything I hated about washing my hair changed.  I could tell the minute I started drying it that there was a difference.  First of all - it took less than half the time to dry!  I figure all that time I spent before was spent on drying the detergent that was in my hair - not on drying my actual hair.  Second of all, this product actually enhanced my waves - making them luscious and almost even curly -- soooo easy to style.  Just shake and bake!  Also it left my hair very, very shiny.  And NO FRIZZ.  I was concerned that the softness that people mentioned in their reviews meant &amp;#34;lank&amp;#34; - but it doesn&#x27;t.  My hair is actually soft AND thick AND wavy/curly AND shiny AND not frizzy AND I LOVE IT!!!  Boy am I sold.  I am also very impressed with the price on this particular product as compared to others.  Yes.  It does have a coconut smell coming out of the jar - but I didn&#x27;t notice it once I put a towel around my head.  And yes, I did have to use about three &amp;#34;handfuls&amp;#34; of product - (I used enough to make my hair feel like I could run my fingers through it - and remember, I have a LOT of long fine hair - so I maybe had to use more than somebody else) and I thought I might need another jar every 3-4 washes - but I don&#x27;t care.  It is so totally worth the money!  This is definitely a keeper for me.  I am thrilled.  Lauren Bacall, here I come!  (Does anybody on Amazon even remember Lauren Bacall??!!!)  LOL!!tally worth the money!  This is definitely a keeper for me.  I am thrilled.  Lauren Bacall, here I come!  (Does anybody on Amazon even remember Lauren Bacall??!!!)  LOL!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I buy it from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for about 4 dollars cheaper than amazon. I have caucasian hair, baby fine, stick straight and usually pretty dry. A friend of mine recommended this to me after she experienced a really horrible bleaching experience for her very coarse, curly hair. I&#x27;ve noticed my color stays a lot better with this also, so if you color your hair, this is a way to keep it, and it doesn&#x27;t strip the color out.</li>
            <li> Dear Amazon, I have been using this cowash and I can say that it is very gentle and effective for my two kinds of hair.  It left my hair clean, soft and manageable, not like some shampoos that leave your hair clean but harsh that you need a conditioner afterwards.  With this cowash you may not need to condition afterwards because it leaves your hair pretty nice, but with my hair I need a conditioner and a leave in.  Yes I would recommend this coconut cowash cleansing conditioner, for me it works better than the wen. Glad you have it in stock.</li>
            <li> So I have been wearing my hair natural for a while and I am still learning all of the in and outs of about caring for AA natural hair. I saw this on  youtube, so I went out and got it.....so far so good. It smells nice, and leaves \\&quot;my\\&quot; hair with plenty of slip, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped which is good because it prevents extra drying for hair that is already very dry. I don&#x27;t look for a product to be perfect, but I do look for it to work.:)</li>
            <li> Blegh made my hair super greasy and was hard to get it all out. Would not recommend or buy again</li>
            <li> It smells  delicious  . I use it on my natural  hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cowashing my hair for almost 4 years now.  I started with wen products and moved on to try almost every co-wash product there is.  As I am cowash not only cleanses my hair good, it works with my budget.  It also rinses off easily, which is a big plus because it speeds up my shower time (when you have a 3 year old yelling for mommy outside the bathroom door, time is of the essence!) This product has a light coconut scent that stays in your hair even after you rinse off.  It reminds me of pina coladas beachside which is really nice.  For some people that seemed to notice that it leaves their hair greasy, when you first start to co-wash, your hair tends to produce more oil.  Mine did that in the beginning.  As you wean off shampooing completely, it will produce less oil and will not get greasy anymore.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a natural curls journey since 2009 (after years of blow-drying that damaged my hair). I&#x27;ve used some great and not so great products. Some insanely pricey. I found that my hair liked Curl Junkie (very moisturizing) and Spiral Solutions (boutique brand) and Jessicurl (also boutique).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always on the hunt for \\&quot;on the ground\\&quot; (ie, easier to obtain) products for my Curly Care. I just tried this after seeing some good reviews. For the record, the cleansing conditioners that I&#x27;ve been using are Curl Junkie&#x27;s DAILY FIX and Jessicurl&#x27;s citrus lavender cleanser. Both work well, and DAILY FIX is the Queen of cleansing conditioners in my book. You may not even need rinse out conditioner after, it&#x27;s so moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so this product. I likes the reviews I&#x27;d seen, but feared it would be coconut-stanky. I don&#x27;t like smelling like suntan oil. And some coconut scents are so cloying. This one is not bad. It&#x27;s tropical without being sickening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use a generous amount. A full palmful for my mid-back length hair. That&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m used to using a lot of DAILY FIX, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works: Nicely. I felt clean hair-wise and not utterly stripped like some poos can feel. (Example, Kinky Curly&#x27;s Come Clean is sulfate free, but dang if it doesn&#x27;t leave me strippy-squeaky. And some folks find the Jessicurl cleansing condish too harsh, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I needed rinse out condish afterwards. This is cleansing more than conditioning. I couldn&#x27;t get a wide-toothed comb easily through my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it works well in conjunction with the AS I AM leave-in condish. My curls enjoyed the combo. I have dry (thyroid condition) hair that likes some protein (not too too much) and has fine and medium strands mixed. My elasticity is normal after 3+ years of good gentle care and conditioning and growing out the damaged bits. My porosity used to be high-high, and now I think it&#x27;s more normal. My curls are type 3a and 3b mixed. That&#x27;s for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, less moisturizing than DAILY FIX, will need rinse out. Wonderful price (DAILY FIX is pricey and Jessicurl&#x27;s got more expensive recently, both more expensive than this product.) And you can buy it here with PRIME (yay, will remember that) or pick it up at Sally&#x27;s Beauty (where I got mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hair to you!d 3b mixed. That&#x27;s for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, less moisturizing than DAILY FIX, will need rinse out. Wonderful price (DAILY FIX is pricey and Jessicurl&#x27;s got more expensive recently, both more expensive than this product.) And you can buy it here with PRIME (yay, will remember that) or pick it up at Sally&#x27;s Beauty (where I got mine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy hair to you!</li>
            <li> I rated this product 5 stars because my hair feels clean and moisturized after applying it. My hair is softer and easy to manage and I would encourage anyone looking to eliminate dryness and wanted to promote their healthy hair to try this product.</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much that I had to write a review on Amazon even though I ended up purchasing at Sally&#x27;s because of time constraints. This product makes my hair so manageable and with a shower detangling comb, washing my hair is no longer a nightmare. I follow up with the As I am leave in conditioner which is also amazing. This is my new product line. It has taken long to find something for my thick, curly hair but this is definitely a winner. Thank you, As I am makers! Note: I use this product as recommended. I rinse my hair thoroughly (do not towel dry!) and apply the cleansing conditioner. I begin detangling with product in my hair and then rinse it out. I apply the leave in conditioner afterwards and then continue styling.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for me, my hair gets clean and my scalp feels nourished.  Especially important where I live because the desert air really dries out the skin.  Anyhow, this goop smells fabulous and leaves my skin and hair soft and hydrated.  I chose this because of the suggestions in &amp;#34;Curly Girl&amp;#34; and agree that the cowash helps tremendously with caring for my curly s&#x27;waves.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel dry and waxy.... Did not like this product</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product. It smells so good. When I applied the product to my hair, it made it feel moist and very soft. Exactly what I wanted. It is definitely a product to try for natural super thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a cowash one of the best cowashes on the market for now the smell is very nice and not over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:2-16-16 promotes hair growth definitely as well as healing the hair.</li>
            <li> This lovely jar is helping me to recover from the awful experience I had with Wen. This lovely CoWash is SILICONE FREE!! Unlike Wen that just coats your hair to hide the issues. My dry as straw hair is finally starting to feel hydrated again after using this and following the CG Method.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this co-wash!  I have a stockpile of it right now, because it seems anytime I find something I like, it gets discontinued. It is very affordable and it smells amazing.  It leaves my hair feeling clean, but not completely stripped of all the natural oils.</li>
            <li> Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve learned that co-washing is not enough for my hair (I need shampoo!) so I don&#x27;t do it anymore. But when I was co-washing, I went through several tubs of this product. It is creamy and smooth, but not too thick. It massages into the scalp easily and I could even detangle with it. It was very moisturizing and never dried out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is on the cheaper end of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, and goes for more or less $10 wherever you get it. I&#x27;m now seeing this product in Target, Rite-Aid, and CVS stores, so you don&#x27;t have to order online.</li>
            <li> When I used the product, I was sad that I couldn&#x27;t comb through it to detangle. I found it didn&#x27;t have enough slip for me and I do not have thick or hair that tangles easily.  But it is great for cleansing. I found it really did that well and didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling like a dry cloth, still had moisture in it. So that was wonderful. I will use this 1st when I co-wash and then follow with Organix Argan Oil conditioner for more moisture and to detangle.  Not a bad product, but not sure I will buy it again, well maybe if it goes on sale</li>
            <li> I think it works okay, but I really don&#x27;t care for the smell. If you aren&#x27;t fan of coconut smell on your hair, this isn&#x27;t for you. It did make my hair pretty shiny and healthy looking. I have used expensive cowash before but that made my hair like straw. This doesn&#x27;t. I wish this had better smell.</li>
            <li> Wanted something to replace Wen. This wasn&#x27;t it. Of course this was much cheaper.  It is a good value cowash.  Smells great.  I found it to leave my hair much heavier though.  Less body and less shine.  Still searching for a wen like experience.</li>
            <li> This cowash is excellent! I have medium thickness, 4a type of natural hair so I don&#x27;t like to use shampoos to often because they&#x27;re too harsh; leaving my hair very dry. This cowash acts like a shampoo but it&#x27;s so moisturizing like a conditioner. My hair looks shiny and defined after I rinse it out. I&#x27;ve definitely incorporated this as a staple!</li>
            <li> This probably the best all-in-one hair cleanser I&#x27;ve tried, but I get better results when I use Aubrey&#x27;s Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST co-wash shampoo, it smells incredible and it has done wonders for the shine and manageability to my hair.  It does not strip your color and it&#x27;s just great.  I&#x27;m loving my hair!</li>
