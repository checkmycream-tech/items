            <li> I was a little disappointed that it was not in a nice box instead of bubble container with tape over the top.</li>
            <li> Smells a little old and on the back of the tube it says &amp;#34;not for individual sale&amp;#34; so why is it being sold individually???</li>
            <li> I hurry out the door and need a little extra something.</li>
            <li> was disappointed as the container was only half filled with lotion.</li>
            <li> I see the ounces, but I was not aware it was so small and would come in 2 separate tubes.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t waste any like the spray perfume</li>
            <li> The lotion perfume is less expensive than the perfume, last longer</li>
            <li> Like I usually do will by again</li>
            <li> The Body lotion is old because small bad (rancid).</li>
            <li> less expensive then buying the perfume...</li>

            <li> &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34; body lotion&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed as the container was only half filled with lotion. I feel I was cheated on this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. We thought it would be bigger for $23. Full of lotion, smells good. But wasn&#x27;t to happy bout the price or shipping and handling.</li>
