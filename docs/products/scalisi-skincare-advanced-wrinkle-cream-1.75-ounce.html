    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Probably the best moisturizer I have tried.</li>
            <li>The time line suggested by Scalisi for best results with the cream, up to six months, is a lot longer than the deadline for a review of the cream.</li>
            <li>The best thing I can say about this cream is its moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizing night cream.</li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t eliminate wrinkles, it is a very good moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>This is a very good moisturizer that lessens the appearances of wrinkles or lines and also renders clarity to your complexion over time.  </li>
            <li>Once you figure out how to use it, it works great, until it breaks, which mine did about 1/3 of the way through the jar.</li>
            <li>(I was happy with Jergen&#x27;s, so this means Scalisi does great).</li>
            <li>My wife looks great, but she looked great before she used this cream as well.  </li>
            <li>for a moisturizer, this is great.  </li>
            <li>She feels great.</li>
            <li>in all, a very nice product.</li>
            <li>It glides on and feels really good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife gave this wrinkle cream a fair shot before giving up on it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizer, but pricey.  </li>
            <li>It went in so good that by the time</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s so beautiful that she doesn&#x27;t need it, but she tried it anyway.  :-)  </li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve not been using it for the eight weeks required in order to see a reduction in wrinkles, my skin is looking very good, smooth and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream is definitely a very good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love the moisturizing qualities as it makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>First, the dispenser is a wonderful addition to using this product!</li>
            <li>I wish I had done that, and if you try it, I&#x27;d love to read your results!</li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t say the price is amazing...</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and a nice cream for nighttime.</li>
            <li>I have tried many wrinkle creams over my 67 years, some good and some not.  </li>
            <li>This $72 wrinkle cream is quite nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Both are just as nice and ONE-TENTH the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to give this product a couple of months to see the best results, but my wife who has been using it for a couple of weeks says she really likes it and thinks she can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>In addition to being very easy on her skin, she also noted that it wasn&#x27;t loaded up with any kind of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to update as this product has more time to do its thing!</li>
            <li>but the product is pretty good!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, has a very mild fragrance, and feels good.  </li>
            <li>I have found myself looking forward to applying it each night, as each application leaves the skin feeling noticeably tighter and yet more supple.  </li>
            <li>many people look for a miracle cure that will just erase all wrinkles and impurities from their appearance.</li>
            <li>dispenser top is an interesting solution to the problem of jar tops that require the user to scoop some cream out with their finger tips and pumps that always leave a usable amount of the product in the container when the pump \\&quot;runs</li>
            <li>For that price, one might expect the results to be a bit more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be sure to update as this product has more time to do its thing!fine lines</li>
            <li>But, if price isn&#x27;t an issue the moisturizer is fabulous!</li>
            <li>For a wrinkle-reducer, however, I think there are probably better options out there.</li>
            <li>and she fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>She also LOVES that it&#x27;s healthy for her skin and the science backs up the claims.</li>
            <li>sure as I use the cream longer</li>
            <li>see from the products web site that they recommend using their companion moisturizer over the top of the cream if you are going to use it for daytime so that it will &#x27;seal in&#x27; the cream.</li>
            <li>see from the products web site that they recommend using their companion moisturizer over the top of the cream if you are going to use it for daytime so that it will &#x27;seal in&#x27; the cream.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream for a month now and have been pleased at how well it moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this Scalisi Advanced Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li>The cream feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The description proudly proclaims it is &amp;#34;paraben free&amp;#34;, but people who care about avoiding parabens generally want to avoid glycols as well.</li>
            <li>When you apply it, your skin immediately feels cool, smooth, and healthy.</li>
            <li>Anyway, on the plus side, this cream dispenses easily, and it&#x27;s light smooth and hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Too soon too say if the wrinkle reducing claims are accurate.</li>
            <li>The cream is not heavily scented, making it perfect for those who are also sensitive to scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scalisi Skin Care Advanced Wrinkle Cream promises a 45% reduction in wrinkles in eight weeks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But while it lasts, I expect to continue to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>I think I will see improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles as I continue to use Scalisi advanced wrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li>like the way it feels upon application, a light nourishment to my face.  </li>
            <li>The Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream is a quality skin care product.</li>
            <li>Formula includes primarily silicone (dimethicone), macademia, hazel and cucumber oils.</li>
            <li>What I dislike is the packaging - it seems cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you, Scalisi Skincare, for my complimentary Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream!</li>
            <li>It hydrates the skin, but is light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I must freely admit I didn&#x27;t use this cream -</li>
            <li>As you smooth it over your skin though you can feel the cream thinning out</li>
            <li>My wife did not notice any additional wrinkles as a result of using this cream, but she also did not notice any significant reduction.  </li>
            <li>Third, the product is a spectacular moisturizer!</li>
            <li>She reports that she cannot tell a significant improvement over her</li>
            <li>I wish my review were more positive, but I had a severe allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I will see more positive effects but after about 3 weeks I can already see that it is making a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been somewhat tardy in reviewing this product; however, I wanted to be as totally fair as possible and be sure my positive feelings were not altered by those feelings.  </li>
            <li>If I can get three months out of it, that would make the cost more reasonable.</li>
            <li>This is true of weight loss, aging, etc.</li>
            <li>we suddenly notice a reduction in wrinkles, I will immediately return here to report the good news.  </li>
            <li>These are not Scalisi patents, by the way, but I will leave you to do your own research as that is beyond the scope of this review, and I don&#x27;t want to nerd out completely on the ingredients.    </li>
            <li>Any and all dry skin or flakes vanish, so that whatever you apply will penetrate so much more effectively.  </li>
            <li>but I can see that the ends of them are softening out more and have hopes that they will look more filled in after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>After a month of using this product, I will say that it is very moisturizing, and I like it for that, but that&#x27;s a lot of money for a good moisturizer when I didn&#x27;t notice anything as far as relaxing the muscles on my face or reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Will keep using the product and report back with a review update further along in the six months that Scalisi suggests for getting the best results.</li>
            <li>Using a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; to dispense the product is a clever idea - and makes a lot more sense that sticking your fingers into it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately it is too early for me to tell if its claims of being able to &amp;#34;relax the appearance of muscle tightening and reduce the appearance of wrinkles&amp;#34; are accurate or not since Scalisi recommends using this product for up to 8 weeks to see results and as part of the Vine program I am required to write a review within 30 days.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It has a unique disk dispenser that covers the surface of the cream completely so that you don&#x27;t contaminate the product by touching it.</li>
            <li>My wife agreed to stand in as test subject, and reports that as an overnight moisturizer, this is great.  </li>
            <li>If you want to try the moisturizing benefits of squalene you can search for it on Amazon and find more natural options for $10.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money?</li>
            <li>It says it reduces wrinkles in eight weeks, but I am required to do this review now, so I will update it in a month if there is anything worth adding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cost, although it may be warranted, is certainly a far reach out of most people&#x27;s cosmetic budget.</li>
            <li>keep the product fresh and hygienic by eliminating the need to dip your fingers into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No, it did not transmogrify me into a crackless old man, but it sure tightened those wrinkles noticeably.  </li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>I tested it once, too, right under my eyes, and found that although I can feel that it is there, it is not at all irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usually something this price would have more deluxe packaging</li>
            <li>Though it can be dangerous to ones health to hand your spouse a jar of &amp;#34;Advanced Wrinkle Cream,&amp;#34; it helps that my young and lovely wife has always taken very good care of her skin and frankly, does not have many (if any) wrinkles to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream arrives in a jar that exudes the aura of a high quality cosmetic cream.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, this is a nice cream in a nice package, but too many ingredients I don&#x27;t care for, way overpriced, and definitely not effective enough to make me give up Botox.to</li>
            <li>cream comes in a unique pump-top container which dispenses one small dollop at a time, in the perfect amount for a single application.</li>
            <li>It does help with some of the fine lines that she has on her face, and her skin is clear</li>

            <li>With all the moisturizing and even the healthy glow this cream gives, wrinkles and fine lines do become less noticeable.</li>
            <li>dispenser is interesting, allowing just a small amount of the cream to come out of the jar at a time, so you can place it exactly where most needed.  </li>
            <li>Having reactive skin lately, was pleasantly surprised that after applying this Scalisi Advanced Wrinkle Cream experienced no tingling, irritation or redness whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t exactly cooperate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that this product is not advertised as a wrinkle remover, and indeed, so far it hasn&#x27;t performed any miracles on the crows&#x27; feet in the corners of my eyes.</li>

            <li>It goes on very light, without leaving residue, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed for a long time after application.  </li>
            <li>She had very little good to say about it.  </li>

            <li>I guess whether I recommend it comes down to whether it works better for you on wrinkle reduction than more affordable moisturizers, and like most reviewers, I&#x27;m just not sure.    </li>
            <li>while I&#x27;m not really sure how it is on wrinkles yet, I do know that I love the silky smooth feeling it gives my face.  </li>
            <li>The cream has had no effect on facial wrinkles that I can perceive, but does a good job moisturizing and lasts a long time.</li>

            <li>- I have paid more for other products that didn&#x27;t show me any positive changes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this now for two weeks and think it is very good--don&#x27;t see and drastic difference</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I&#x27;ve not seen any real changes (do you ever with these things?)</li>
            <li>being the trouper that she is, she willingly took on the task of using SCALISI SKINCARE ADVANCED WRINKLE CREAM in place of the lotion that she normally uses and did so faithfully for the next six months.</li>
            <li>As something she applied before going to bed, this is something I appreciated as well, since I would much prefer not to feel like I had dozed off in the perfume aisle of a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s not a heavy scent or one that is gross - kind of like the light scent of roses ( odd because that doesn&#x27;t appear to be</li>
            <li>As for the wrinkles, I don’t currently notice them being any less than what they were, but my skin seems to have a nice healthy glow since I’ve been regularly moisturizing with this product.</li>
            <li>On the surface this product touts many benefits, such as smoother skin, 45% less wrinkles in 8 weeks and Paraben free.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a minor reduction in the fine wrinkles beside my eyes and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the name has to do with the beautiful young character on Game of Thrones.</li>
            <li>That is to say, if I thought that a particular skin care product worked several times better than another, I&#x27;d be willing to pay several times the price.</li>
            <li>unique aspect of Scalisi Skincare cream is its container, which uses a pump dispenser (just open the top lid and push down)</li>
            <li>It is a night cream to wear when sleeping, but can also be used at times when you want a little more intense moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I liked the lighter feel of Scalisi better than either of the other products I usually use (they are more viscous), after several weeks I noticed zero difference between the skin on the left and right side of my face, especially around and under my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using for maybe a week and a half (during the day and as a night cream) noticed my complexion felt smoother and looked clearer and more even.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I used Jergen&#x27;s as a moisturizer, and I Scalisi seems to be doing a slightly better job of keeping my skin hydrated</li>
            <li>Hypothesis: the more expensive a product, the better it</li>
            <li>Eight weeks is a reasonable timeframe, given that mature skin cells turn over slower than a baby&#x27;s, but I have yet to see an explanation of the 45%.</li>
            <li>I re-did the problem areas a second time, that also was absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>My smile lines are still deep</li>
            <li>It has a smooth consistency and rubs into skin easily, without leaving behind a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Even though I like the product, I felt it only right to change my 4 star review to 3 stars, because it doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising.</li>
            <li>Personally, the most I&#x27;ve even spent on a moisturizer was $30.00, so one star off for pricing.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizer - not too heavy and it absorbs quickly enough that it can be applied just before makeup.</li>
            <li>product is a high quality, silky moisturizer that leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated without the greasiness of some moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Like most reviewers, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used a variety of skin care products for the past three months, and I love this one for silky-feeling and younger-looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I find out any additional info on whether this product is definitely able to do what it claims to do (or is definitely not able to do what it claims to do) then I will update this review accordingly.</li>
            <li>It is expensive, but I think it might last through a year...or more, which makes the cost much more bearable</li>
            <li>Those are the areas that concern me the most and because of the repetitive use of the muscles in those areas, the lines tend to get deeper with age.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is absorbed into the skin a lot fast than any other night creams I have used.</li>
            <li>Second, it smells ok (not bad not good) and it is greaseless.</li>
            <li>You can have your cake and eat it too with the convenience of a pump, very ingeniously designed and embedded in the top, and the ability to take the jaw wide top off and get that last little bit of expensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Second, the product has a slight scent, overall a light clean scent.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my facial skin is so super sensitive; that one or more ingredients in this jar have caused some serious out breaks after two weeks of nightly use.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin and wrinkles and nothing else is working, then it might be worth trying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again, given the abundance of far less costly options, but so far am happy with it as a winter moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I first started using Scalisi, I tried to make a direct comparison by using Scalisi on the left side of my face and hands and nothing on the others.  </li>
            <li>But in the first three weeks of trying it out every day the cream has been a pleasure to use, very soothing to the skin, with a scent that is perhaps innocuous but pleasant and unlikely to clash with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, unless there&#x27;s a huge difference in the next two weeks (not likely, halfway in) I will go back to Bath and Body Works Cherry Blossom cream</li>
            <li>Once I stopped using this product, I had to use Proactive reparative lotion to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>The claims that this product make, give me the impression that it&#x27;s trying to be an alternative to Botox, although it does not state that directly.</li>
            <li>Well, I pushed my next Botox appointment a month out and gave this product a try in the meantime in order to really give it a chance.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find it was not -- in fact, I use it both morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn’t feel greasy at all and absorbs into my skin well, making my face feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>course topical creams can&#x27;t really fix underlying conditions, that may be rooted in your DNA, your age and health issues, and of course everyone hopes that they might, a hope that springs eternal.</li>
            <li>maybe this works to keep ones hands soft, but ...</li>
            <li>The big question is whether it is worth the price but that will take using the rest of the cream and the total results before I can decided.</li>
            <li>For now, although it is somewhat expensive, if the price point is within your comfort zone it&#x27;s recommended to try with hopes for good things.</li>
            <li>If for no other reason, I am a new convert for this</li>
            <li>I love the way the product dispenses, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Usually about 2 hours later, before going to bed, I would smooth another layer on my whole face, once again covering the problem areas.</li>
            <li>For the time allotted, I used what I usually use, a combination of Olay Regenerist plus Roc wrinkle cream products on one side of my face (don&#x27;t laugh) and Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream on the other.</li>
            <li>After looking at the ingredients, the key ingredient in this cream is Squalene, which is derived from olives, high moisturizing and plumps up wrinkles to reduce their appearance.</li>
            <li>If your skin is dry, AWC moisturizes well without feeling heavy, and there is no nasty scent to give you a headache.</li>
            <li>The cream itself she describes as very thick and somewhat mealy, and while it eventually feels nice on the skin, the initial texture and thickness is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does seem to help with the wrinkles ever so slightly but will take daily use for quite awhile to see any significant difference.</li>
            <li>I am not too familiar with the Scalisi Brand of products; however, if the rest of their line compares half as favorable as this one, I will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream is thick and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but I only really notice it for the first few minutes that it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>but I only really notice it for the first few minutes that it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li>Personally, on my tight budget, I probably would not pay that much even for a moisturizer, despite the high quality of this one.</li>

            <li>The scent is not unpleasant, but it does have a very slight fragrance of household cleaner.</li>
            <li>So far, I have only used the product for less than half that time, so I will be sure to update when I have used it</li>
            <li>Non greasy, slightly thick, but soaks in and leaves your skin super soft!</li>
            <li>Next, if you are 20 years old, this cream is not for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality moisturizer that got me through a dry winter.</li>
            <li>me, I suffer from Diabetes Type II and as a consequence I have very dry skin on my face, my nose and eyes in particular.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the jar is long-lasting, and after two months I&#x27;ve barely used any of it; I&#x27;ve been applying it nightly, but a little bit is all you need.</li>
            <li>The very fine lines do seem a bit less noticeable, though it&#x27;s hard to tell whether that&#x27;s my imagination.</li>
            <li>After putting on the cream, I have noticed that the hydration and smoothness do help reduce the appearance--though not necessarily the existence--of lines in general.</li>

            <li>You need to press down on a disk that covers the top of the jar and product comes out a small hole on the middle.</li>
            <li>Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream promises to make wrinkles appear less noticeable by plumping up the areas making wrinkles look and feel less</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for some of the other chemical ingredients in this product, like butylene glycol.</li>
            <li>Push down on the base and it pushes up the amount of moisturizer you need (awesome).</li>
            <li>However, the effect is not nearly dramatic enough to claim a &amp;#34;45% reduction,&amp;#34; and there is little if any noticeable change over time.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that the cream was going to feel thick and uncomfortble because when you dip some out of the jar with your finger it does feel really rich and thick.</li>
            <li>For me  too much or too little comes out and on several occasions shot up in the air.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Probably the best moisturizer I have tried.</li>
            <li> The time line suggested by Scalisi for best results with the cream, up to six months, is a lot longer than the deadline for a review of the cream.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say about this cream is its moisturizing effect.  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizing night cream.</li>
            <li> Even if it doesn&#x27;t eliminate wrinkles, it is a very good moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer that lessens the appearances of wrinkles or lines and also renders clarity to your complexion over time.  </li>
            <li> Once you figure out how to use it, it works great, until it breaks, which mine did about 1/3 of the way through the jar.</li>
            <li> (I was happy with Jergen&#x27;s, so this means Scalisi does great).</li>
            <li> My wife looks great, but she looked great before she used this cream as well.  </li>
            <li> for a moisturizer, this is great.  </li>
            <li> She feels great.</li>
            <li> in all, a very nice product.</li>
            <li> It glides on and feels really good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My wife gave this wrinkle cream a fair shot before giving up on it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, but pricey.  </li>
            <li> It went in so good that by the time</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s so beautiful that she doesn&#x27;t need it, but she tried it anyway.  :-)  </li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve not been using it for the eight weeks required in order to see a reduction in wrinkles, my skin is looking very good, smooth and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream is definitely a very good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love the moisturizing qualities as it makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> First, the dispenser is a wonderful addition to using this product!</li>
            <li> I wish I had done that, and if you try it, I&#x27;d love to read your results!</li>
            <li> Now, I can&#x27;t say the price is amazing...</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and a nice cream for nighttime.</li>
            <li> I have tried many wrinkle creams over my 67 years, some good and some not.  </li>
            <li> This $72 wrinkle cream is quite nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Both are just as nice and ONE-TENTH the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to give this product a couple of months to see the best results, but my wife who has been using it for a couple of weeks says she really likes it and thinks she can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> In addition to being very easy on her skin, she also noted that it wasn&#x27;t loaded up with any kind of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to update as this product has more time to do its thing!</li>
            <li> but the product is pretty good!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, has a very mild fragrance, and feels good.  </li>
            <li> I have found myself looking forward to applying it each night, as each application leaves the skin feeling noticeably tighter and yet more supple.  </li>
            <li> many people look for a miracle cure that will just erase all wrinkles and impurities from their appearance.</li>
            <li> dispenser top is an interesting solution to the problem of jar tops that require the user to scoop some cream out with their finger tips and pumps that always leave a usable amount of the product in the container when the pump \\&quot;runs</li>
            <li> For that price, one might expect the results to be a bit more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be sure to update as this product has more time to do its thing!fine lines</li>
            <li> But, if price isn&#x27;t an issue the moisturizer is fabulous!</li>
            <li> For a wrinkle-reducer, however, I think there are probably better options out there.</li>
            <li> and she fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> She also LOVES that it&#x27;s healthy for her skin and the science backs up the claims.</li>
            <li> sure as I use the cream longer</li>
            <li> see from the products web site that they recommend using their companion moisturizer over the top of the cream if you are going to use it for daytime so that it will &#x27;seal in&#x27; the cream.</li>
            <li> see from the products web site that they recommend using their companion moisturizer over the top of the cream if you are going to use it for daytime so that it will &#x27;seal in&#x27; the cream.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream for a month now and have been pleased at how well it moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this Scalisi Advanced Wrinkle Cream.</li>
            <li> The cream feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The description proudly proclaims it is &amp;#34;paraben free&amp;#34;, but people who care about avoiding parabens generally want to avoid glycols as well.</li>
            <li> When you apply it, your skin immediately feels cool, smooth, and healthy.</li>
            <li> Anyway, on the plus side, this cream dispenses easily, and it&#x27;s light smooth and hydrating.  </li>
            <li> Too soon too say if the wrinkle reducing claims are accurate.</li>
            <li> The cream is not heavily scented, making it perfect for those who are also sensitive to scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scalisi Skin Care Advanced Wrinkle Cream promises a 45% reduction in wrinkles in eight weeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But while it lasts, I expect to continue to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> I think I will see improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles as I continue to use Scalisi advanced wrinkle cream.  </li>
            <li> like the way it feels upon application, a light nourishment to my face.  </li>
            <li> The Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream is a quality skin care product.</li>
            <li> Formula includes primarily silicone (dimethicone), macademia, hazel and cucumber oils.</li>
            <li> What I dislike is the packaging - it seems cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you, Scalisi Skincare, for my complimentary Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream!</li>
            <li> It hydrates the skin, but is light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I must freely admit I didn&#x27;t use this cream -</li>
            <li> As you smooth it over your skin though you can feel the cream thinning out</li>
            <li> My wife did not notice any additional wrinkles as a result of using this cream, but she also did not notice any significant reduction.  </li>
            <li> Third, the product is a spectacular moisturizer!</li>
            <li> She reports that she cannot tell a significant improvement over her</li>
            <li> I wish my review were more positive, but I had a severe allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I will see more positive effects but after about 3 weeks I can already see that it is making a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been somewhat tardy in reviewing this product; however, I wanted to be as totally fair as possible and be sure my positive feelings were not altered by those feelings.  </li>
            <li> If I can get three months out of it, that would make the cost more reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is true of weight loss, aging, etc.</li>
            <li> we suddenly notice a reduction in wrinkles, I will immediately return here to report the good news.  </li>
            <li> These are not Scalisi patents, by the way, but I will leave you to do your own research as that is beyond the scope of this review, and I don&#x27;t want to nerd out completely on the ingredients.    </li>
            <li> Any and all dry skin or flakes vanish, so that whatever you apply will penetrate so much more effectively.  </li>
            <li> but I can see that the ends of them are softening out more and have hopes that they will look more filled in after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> After a month of using this product, I will say that it is very moisturizing, and I like it for that, but that&#x27;s a lot of money for a good moisturizer when I didn&#x27;t notice anything as far as relaxing the muscles on my face or reducing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Will keep using the product and report back with a review update further along in the six months that Scalisi suggests for getting the best results.</li>
            <li> Using a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; to dispense the product is a clever idea - and makes a lot more sense that sticking your fingers into it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately it is too early for me to tell if its claims of being able to &amp;#34;relax the appearance of muscle tightening and reduce the appearance of wrinkles&amp;#34; are accurate or not since Scalisi recommends using this product for up to 8 weeks to see results and as part of the Vine program I am required to write a review within 30 days.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It has a unique disk dispenser that covers the surface of the cream completely so that you don&#x27;t contaminate the product by touching it.</li>
            <li> My wife agreed to stand in as test subject, and reports that as an overnight moisturizer, this is great.  </li>
            <li> If you want to try the moisturizing benefits of squalene you can search for it on Amazon and find more natural options for $10.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money?</li>
            <li> It says it reduces wrinkles in eight weeks, but I am required to do this review now, so I will update it in a month if there is anything worth adding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cost, although it may be warranted, is certainly a far reach out of most people&#x27;s cosmetic budget.</li>
            <li> keep the product fresh and hygienic by eliminating the need to dip your fingers into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No, it did not transmogrify me into a crackless old man, but it sure tightened those wrinkles noticeably.  </li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li> I tested it once, too, right under my eyes, and found that although I can feel that it is there, it is not at all irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually something this price would have more deluxe packaging</li>
            <li> Though it can be dangerous to ones health to hand your spouse a jar of &amp;#34;Advanced Wrinkle Cream,&amp;#34; it helps that my young and lovely wife has always taken very good care of her skin and frankly, does not have many (if any) wrinkles to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream arrives in a jar that exudes the aura of a high quality cosmetic cream.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, this is a nice cream in a nice package, but too many ingredients I don&#x27;t care for, way overpriced, and definitely not effective enough to make me give up Botox.to</li>
            <li> cream comes in a unique pump-top container which dispenses one small dollop at a time, in the perfect amount for a single application.</li>
            <li> It does help with some of the fine lines that she has on her face, and her skin is clear</li>
            <li> a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little spendy</li>
            <li> a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little spendy</li>
            <li> With all the moisturizing and even the healthy glow this cream gives, wrinkles and fine lines do become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> dispenser is interesting, allowing just a small amount of the cream to come out of the jar at a time, so you can place it exactly where most needed.  </li>
            <li> Having reactive skin lately, was pleasantly surprised that after applying this Scalisi Advanced Wrinkle Cream experienced no tingling, irritation or redness whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t exactly cooperate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that this product is not advertised as a wrinkle remover, and indeed, so far it hasn&#x27;t performed any miracles on the crows&#x27; feet in the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> really wanted to try this in the area&#x27;s around my mouth (smile lines) and the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin is almost back to normal, and I have gone back to using Arcona &#x27;Magic White Ice&#x27; Jumbo Hydrating Gel which has always given me great results.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light, without leaving residue, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed for a long time after application.  </li>
            <li> She had very little good to say about it.  </li>
            <li> and when I have the cream on my face those lines pretty much disappear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> those lines pretty much disappear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess whether I recommend it comes down to whether it works better for you on wrinkle reduction than more affordable moisturizers, and like most reviewers, I&#x27;m just not sure.    </li>
            <li> while I&#x27;m not really sure how it is on wrinkles yet, I do know that I love the silky smooth feeling it gives my face.  </li>
            <li> The cream has had no effect on facial wrinkles that I can perceive, but does a good job moisturizing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The cream is smooth and silky, with a light (slightly chemical) scent that would suit</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for two weeks and think it is very good--don&#x27;t see and drastic difference</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;ve not seen any real changes (do you ever with these things?)</li>
            <li> being the trouper that she is, she willingly took on the task of using SCALISI SKINCARE ADVANCED WRINKLE CREAM in place of the lotion that she normally uses and did so faithfully for the next six months.</li>
            <li> As something she applied before going to bed, this is something I appreciated as well, since I would much prefer not to feel like I had dozed off in the perfume aisle of a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> As for the wrinkles, I don’t currently notice them being any less than what they were, but my skin seems to have a nice healthy glow since I’ve been regularly moisturizing with this product.</li>
            <li> On the surface this product touts many benefits, such as smoother skin, 45% less wrinkles in 8 weeks and Paraben free.</li>
            <li> and I have seen a minor reduction in the fine wrinkles beside my eyes and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the name has to do with the beautiful young character on Game of Thrones.</li>
            <li> That is to say, if I thought that a particular skin care product worked several times better than another, I&#x27;d be willing to pay several times the price.</li>
            <li> unique aspect of Scalisi Skincare cream is its container, which uses a pump dispenser (just open the top lid and push down)</li>
            <li> It is a night cream to wear when sleeping, but can also be used at times when you want a little more intense moisture for your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I liked the lighter feel of Scalisi better than either of the other products I usually use (they are more viscous), after several weeks I noticed zero difference between the skin on the left and right side of my face, especially around and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using for maybe a week and a half (during the day and as a night cream) noticed my complexion felt smoother and looked clearer and more even.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used Jergen&#x27;s as a moisturizer, and I Scalisi seems to be doing a slightly better job of keeping my skin hydrated</li>
            <li> Hypothesis: the more expensive a product, the better it</li>
            <li> Eight weeks is a reasonable timeframe, given that mature skin cells turn over slower than a baby&#x27;s, but I have yet to see an explanation of the 45%.</li>
            <li> I re-did the problem areas a second time, that also was absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> My smile lines are still deep</li>
            <li> It has a smooth consistency and rubs into skin easily, without leaving behind a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Even though I like the product, I felt it only right to change my 4 star review to 3 stars, because it doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising.</li>
            <li> Personally, the most I&#x27;ve even spent on a moisturizer was $30.00, so one star off for pricing.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer - not too heavy and it absorbs quickly enough that it can be applied just before makeup.</li>
            <li> product is a high quality, silky moisturizer that leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated without the greasiness of some moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Like most reviewers, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a variety of skin care products for the past three months, and I love this one for silky-feeling and younger-looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I find out any additional info on whether this product is definitely able to do what it claims to do (or is definitely not able to do what it claims to do) then I will update this review accordingly.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but I think it might last through a year...or more, which makes the cost much more bearable</li>
            <li> Those are the areas that concern me the most and because of the repetitive use of the muscles in those areas, the lines tend to get deeper with age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is absorbed into the skin a lot fast than any other night creams I have used.</li>
            <li> Second, it smells ok (not bad not good) and it is greaseless.</li>
            <li> You can have your cake and eat it too with the convenience of a pump, very ingeniously designed and embedded in the top, and the ability to take the jaw wide top off and get that last little bit of expensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, the product has a slight scent, overall a light clean scent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my facial skin is so super sensitive; that one or more ingredients in this jar have caused some serious out breaks after two weeks of nightly use.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin and wrinkles and nothing else is working, then it might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again, given the abundance of far less costly options, but so far am happy with it as a winter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I first started using Scalisi, I tried to make a direct comparison by using Scalisi on the left side of my face and hands and nothing on the others.  </li>
            <li> But in the first three weeks of trying it out every day the cream has been a pleasure to use, very soothing to the skin, with a scent that is perhaps innocuous but pleasant and unlikely to clash with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, unless there&#x27;s a huge difference in the next two weeks (not likely, halfway in) I will go back to Bath and Body Works Cherry Blossom cream</li>
            <li> Once I stopped using this product, I had to use Proactive reparative lotion to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> The claims that this product make, give me the impression that it&#x27;s trying to be an alternative to Botox, although it does not state that directly.</li>
            <li> Well, I pushed my next Botox appointment a month out and gave this product a try in the meantime in order to really give it a chance.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find it was not -- in fact, I use it both morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn’t feel greasy at all and absorbs into my skin well, making my face feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> course topical creams can&#x27;t really fix underlying conditions, that may be rooted in your DNA, your age and health issues, and of course everyone hopes that they might, a hope that springs eternal.</li>
            <li> maybe this works to keep ones hands soft, but ...</li>
            <li> The big question is whether it is worth the price but that will take using the rest of the cream and the total results before I can decided.</li>
            <li> For now, although it is somewhat expensive, if the price point is within your comfort zone it&#x27;s recommended to try with hopes for good things.</li>
            <li> If for no other reason, I am a new convert for this</li>
            <li> I love the way the product dispenses, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Usually about 2 hours later, before going to bed, I would smooth another layer on my whole face, once again covering the problem areas.</li>
            <li> For the time allotted, I used what I usually use, a combination of Olay Regenerist plus Roc wrinkle cream products on one side of my face (don&#x27;t laugh) and Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream on the other.</li>
            <li> After looking at the ingredients, the key ingredient in this cream is Squalene, which is derived from olives, high moisturizing and plumps up wrinkles to reduce their appearance.</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry, AWC moisturizes well without feeling heavy, and there is no nasty scent to give you a headache.</li>
            <li> The cream itself she describes as very thick and somewhat mealy, and while it eventually feels nice on the skin, the initial texture and thickness is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does seem to help with the wrinkles ever so slightly but will take daily use for quite awhile to see any significant difference.</li>
            <li> I am not too familiar with the Scalisi Brand of products; however, if the rest of their line compares half as favorable as this one, I will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but I only really notice it for the first few minutes that it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> but I only really notice it for the first few minutes that it&#x27;s on</li>
            <li> Personally, on my tight budget, I probably would not pay that much even for a moisturizer, despite the high quality of this one.</li>

            <li> The scent is not unpleasant, but it does have a very slight fragrance of household cleaner.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only used the product for less than half that time, so I will be sure to update when I have used it</li>
            <li> Non greasy, slightly thick, but soaks in and leaves your skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Next, if you are 20 years old, this cream is not for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality moisturizer that got me through a dry winter.</li>
            <li> me, I suffer from Diabetes Type II and as a consequence I have very dry skin on my face, my nose and eyes in particular.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, the jar is long-lasting, and after two months I&#x27;ve barely used any of it; I&#x27;ve been applying it nightly, but a little bit is all you need.</li>
            <li> The very fine lines do seem a bit less noticeable, though it&#x27;s hard to tell whether that&#x27;s my imagination.</li>
            <li> After putting on the cream, I have noticed that the hydration and smoothness do help reduce the appearance--though not necessarily the existence--of lines in general.</li>

            <li> You need to press down on a disk that covers the top of the jar and product comes out a small hole on the middle.</li>
            <li> Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream promises to make wrinkles appear less noticeable by plumping up the areas making wrinkles look and feel less</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for some of the other chemical ingredients in this product, like butylene glycol.</li>
            <li> Push down on the base and it pushes up the amount of moisturizer you need (awesome).</li>
            <li> However, the effect is not nearly dramatic enough to claim a &amp;#34;45% reduction,&amp;#34; and there is little if any noticeable change over time.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that the cream was going to feel thick and uncomfortble because when you dip some out of the jar with your finger it does feel really rich and thick.</li>
            <li> For me  too much or too little comes out and on several occasions shot up in the air.  </li>
            <li> I have used several major brand facial creams and lotions with minimal results for re-hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the reason I find the price a little high.</li>
            <li> However, considering that this product does not have any dramatic effects (so far), I&#x27;m not sure whether the $70 dollar cost is justified.</li>
            <li> However, considering that this product does not have any dramatic effects (so far), I&#x27;m not sure whether the $70 dollar cost is justified.</li>
            <li> So, definitely not a natural product.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping this jar will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Long term</li>
            <li> but I have used this daily for 3 weeks and still have half a jar left</li>

            <li> Her first complaint was the smell was so strong that she found it impossible to apply it just before going to bed at night, because all it would do was keep her awake.  </li>
            <li> It has an odd odor, not sure where to place it really.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it does look like this generous container--where a little goes a long way--will last several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it does look like this generous container--where a little goes a long way--will last several months.  </li>
            <li> The cream doesn&#x27;t claim to make wrinkles vanish, just to make them less obvious and perhaps slow the development of new ones.</li>
            <li> but there are definitely less deep</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially in the wintertime, my skin tends to get very dry.</li>
            <li> The claims that this product makes are pretty dramatic claims, stating &amp;#34; relax the appearance of muscle tightening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;45% reduction in the appearance of wrinkles in 8 weeks&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I should report that with this product a little goes a long, long way.</li>
            <li> wife does have sensitive skin however, and we would have stopped this little experiment if it became clear that there was anything in it that was irritating.</li>
            <li> face has never been terribly dry, even in the winter, so just hydrating those areas with other creams and moisturizers never really seemed to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But the results so far have been encouraging, it at least has had a soothing and somewhat softening effect.</li>
            <li> While some have found this cream to be irritating, this has not been the case for my wife who used it for a month straight.  </li>
            <li> that it does contain macadamia and hazel, so be careful if you have a nut</li>
            <li> Note that it does contain macadamia and hazel, so be careful if you have a nut allergy.  </li>
            <li> Just press on the disk and wrinkle cream comes up through a hole in the center of the disk.</li>
            <li> a side note, the instructions say it can take up to 8 weeks to lose 50% of your wrinkles, but Amazon Vine makes me do this review after 30 days, so there may be additional benefits taking place in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re talking about ridding your skin of wrinkles (or minimizing them as much as possible), the price of an item is not nearly as important as the results.</li>
            <li> I knew I was in trouble when I gave the entire collection to her as a gift</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t find it to work any better than the less expensive products I usually use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously... the jar lasted from the end of December until mid-June, so despite the fact that it&#x27;s a fairly expensive product, it certainly lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scalisi sells a less \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; moisturizer for those without dry skin, and from what I can tell, people seem to like it.</li>
            <li> little bit of this cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> While it is not a large container, you only have to use a small amount at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She said that maybe, just maybe, there were fewer wrinkles above her nose, but she was not really sure.  </li>
            <li> Also, the pump--one of the other selling points--has stopped working, so I need to dip my fingers into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it&#x27;s pricey -</li>
            <li> There is no possible way that she would pay the higher price for a product which she finds to be so uniformly unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Two people who did not know I have been using this product remarked within the past few days that I am “looking well-rested” and that’s proof enough for</li>
            <li> the down side, this stuff is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the look and direction to use only at night, I thought the cream would be heavy, thick and oily.  </li>
            <li> even if a container lasts a month and a half - that&#x27;s still eight containers per year, which adds up.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream has a slight scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cream has a slight scent</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t notice any particular improvement, and probably will continue to use the less expensive creams she has used in the past.  </li>
            <li> or if you stopped using it, difficult to say so far.</li>
            <li> The packaging is also green.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything horrible to her skin, but I honestly can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li> do seem a bit less noticeable, though it&#x27;s hard to tell whether that&#x27;s my imagination.</li>
            <li> Just a small dab is needed for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic...</li>
            <li> The price seems extravagant, but there is a lot of product in this small jar, though I can&#x27;t speak to the dispenser as mine refused to work</li>
            <li> The instructions say to give eight weeks to see close to 50% wrinkle reduction, and while I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s not working, I just don&#x27;t know how to measure wrinkle reduction, so I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two weeks.</li>
            <li> Be careful, your wife may become addicted too.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly expensive cream (roughly the cost of a few cases of beer, as I see it).  </li>
            <li> to the claims about reducing wrinkles, it is hard to confirm this.  </li>
            <li> The price is also pretty outrageous for what it is.</li>
            <li> by itself probably would have been enough for her to give up on this, but she also found the container to be incredibly annoying, as it fell apart every time she opened it.  </li>
            <li> My wife has become addicted to this product, and the others in Scalisi Skincare&#x27;s line.</li>
            <li> I have used this product nightly now for almost 30 days, and have already seen a dramatic reduction in under-eye wrinkles and sleep lines.  </li>
            <li> The effect was fairly dramatic where I had lingering redness from persistant eczema</li>
            <li> My one regret is that the cream is fairly expensive and when this is gone I don’t think I can afford to buy more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If any cream could work miracles, even an expensive cream, no one would fork over $10,000+ for a facelift and all those laser machines would collect dust.    </li>
            <li> It is very expensive, and arrives in an unintuitive pump container.</li>
            <li> (Yeah, I have a bad habit of doing that with stuff.)  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The claims that this product makes are pretty dramatic claims, stating &amp;#34; relax the appearance of muscle tightening&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;45% reduction in the appearance of wrinkles in 8 weeks&amp;#34;. After a month of using this product, I will say that it is very moisturizing, and I like it for that, but that&#x27;s a lot of money for a good moisturizer when I didn&#x27;t notice anything as far as relaxing the muscles on my face or reducing wrinkles. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, and I use Botox to smooth out the lines I&#x27;ve already got and also to prevent them from getting worse. There&#x27;s a lot of skincare products out there targeting women who are fearful or against trying something like Botox. The claims that this product make, give me the impression that it&#x27;s trying to be an alternative to Botox, although it does not state that directly. Well, I pushed my next Botox appointment a month out and gave this product a try in the meantime in order to really give it a chance. I love the way the product dispenses, and a little goes a long way. It appears that this product will last somewhere between 2 and 3 months. It is moisturizing and a nice cream for nighttime. After looking at the ingredients, the key ingredient in this cream is Squalene, which is derived from olives, high moisturizing and plumps up wrinkles to reduce their appearance. I don&#x27;t particularly care for some of the other chemical ingredients in this product, like butylene glycol. The description proudly proclaims it is &amp;#34;paraben free&amp;#34;, but people who care about avoiding parabens generally want to avoid glycols as well. So, definitely not a natural product. The price is also pretty outrageous for what it is. You are basically paying for a fancy container. If you want to try the moisturizing benefits of squalene you can search for it on Amazon and find more natural options for $10.  In conclusion, this is a nice cream in a nice package, but too many ingredients I don&#x27;t care for, way overpriced, and definitely not effective enough to make me give up Botox.to make me give up Botox.</li>
            <li> Scalisi Skin Care Advanced Wrinkle Cream promises a 45% reduction in wrinkles in eight weeks.  I believe them.  I have used this product nightly now for almost 30 days, and have already seen a dramatic reduction in under-eye wrinkles and sleep lines.  Two people who did not know I have been using this product remarked within the past few days that I am “looking well-rested” and that’s proof enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser is interesting, allowing just a small amount of the cream to come out of the jar at a time, so you can place it exactly where most needed.  I have found myself looking forward to applying it each night, as each application leaves the skin feeling noticeably tighter and yet more supple.  My one regret is that the cream is fairly expensive and when this is gone I don’t think I can afford to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while it lasts, I expect to continue to enjoy it.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have tried many wrinkle creams over my 67 years, some good and some not.  I&#x27;ve been using this almost a month now &amp; while I&#x27;m not really sure how it is on wrinkles yet, I do know that I love the silky smooth feeling it gives my face.  It glides on and feels really good on my skin.  I think I will see improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles as I continue to use Scalisi advanced wrinkle cream.  It is rather pricey so time will tell if I decide to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This $72 wrinkle cream is quite nice. It is very expensive, and arrives in an unintuitive pump container. Once you figure out how to use it, it works great, until it breaks, which mine did about 1/3 of the way through the jar. The cream is thick and is easy to apply. It has an odd odor, not sure where to place it really. The cream has had no effect on facial wrinkles that I can perceive, but does a good job moisturizing and lasts a long time. Worth the money? Not to this reviewer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this now for two weeks and think it is very good--don&#x27;t see and drastic difference but per the manufacturer, it&#x27;s too soon to tell.  However, unless there&#x27;s a huge difference in the next two weeks (not likely, halfway in) I will go back to Bath and Body Works Cherry Blossom cream and/or Sabon body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are just as nice and ONE-TENTH the price.</li>
            <li> Probably the best moisturizer I have tried. Also the most expensive. You don&#x27;t need to use a lot so I&#x27;m hoping this jar will go a long way. If I can get three months out of it, that would make the cost more reasonable. I love the moisturizing qualities as it makes my skin feel great. It does seem to help with the wrinkles ever so slightly but will take daily use for quite awhile to see any significant difference. The big question is whether it is worth the price but that will take using the rest of the cream and the total results before I can decided. If you have dry skin and wrinkles and nothing else is working, then it might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> By the look and direction to use only at night, I thought the cream would be heavy, thick and oily.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it was not -- in fact, I use it both morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve not seen any real changes (do you ever with these things?) I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks, but will definitely continue using it, hoping for changes to appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels upon application, a light nourishment to my face.  I hope to experience the results they speak of in promotion... and I can&#x27;t help but wonder if the name has to do with the beautiful young character on Game of Thrones.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream for a month now and have been pleased at how well it moisturizes my skin. It says it reduces wrinkles in eight weeks, but I am required to do this review now, so I will update it in a month if there is anything worth adding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of this cream goes a long way. Just a small dab is needed for my face and neck. It doesn’t feel greasy at all and absorbs into my skin well, making my face feel soft and moisturized. The scent is not unpleasant, but it does have a very slight fragrance of household cleaner. As for the wrinkles, I don’t currently notice them being any less than what they were, but my skin seems to have a nice healthy glow since I’ve been regularly moisturizing with this product.</li>
            <li> The Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream is a quality skin care product. It is a night cream to wear when sleeping, but can also be used at times when you want a little more intense moisture for your skin. It is a bit expensive, but as my wife says, since she&#x27;s the one who uses it, you have to pay for the better creams, lotions, and make up. While it is not a large container, you only have to use a small amount at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many people look for a miracle cure that will just erase all wrinkles and impurities from their appearance. This is true of weight loss, aging, etc. This cream will reduce the appearance of wrinkles, but it won&#x27;t eliminate them entirely. And it doesn&#x27;t promise to, so it does what it says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to give this product a couple of months to see the best results, but my wife who has been using it for a couple of weeks says she really likes it and thinks she can tell a difference. Even if it doesn&#x27;t eliminate wrinkles, it is a very good moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality moisturizing wrinkle cream!</li>
            <li> Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream arrives in a jar that exudes the aura of a high quality cosmetic cream. The time line suggested by Scalisi for best results with the cream, up to six months, is a lot longer than the deadline for a review of the cream. But in the first three weeks of trying it out every day the cream has been a pleasure to use, very soothing to the skin, with a scent that is perhaps innocuous but pleasant and unlikely to clash with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser top is an interesting solution to the problem of jar tops that require the user to scoop some cream out with their finger tips and pumps that always leave a usable amount of the product in the container when the pump \\&quot;runs out\\&quot;. You can have your cake and eat it too with the convenience of a pump, very ingeniously designed and embedded in the top, and the ability to take the jaw wide top off and get that last little bit of expensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course topical creams can&#x27;t really fix underlying conditions, that may be rooted in your DNA, your age and health issues, and of course everyone hopes that they might, a hope that springs eternal. But the results so far have been encouraging, it at least has had a soothing and somewhat softening effect. Long term or if you stopped using it, difficult to say so far. Will keep using the product and report back with a review update further along in the six months that Scalisi suggests for getting the best results. For now, although it is somewhat expensive, if the price point is within your comfort zone it&#x27;s recommended to try with hopes for good things.</li>
            <li> Though it can be dangerous to ones health to hand your spouse a jar of &amp;#34;Advanced Wrinkle Cream,&amp;#34; it helps that my young and lovely wife has always taken very good care of her skin and frankly, does not have many (if any) wrinkles to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But being the trouper that she is, she willingly took on the task of using SCALISI SKINCARE ADVANCED WRINKLE CREAM in place of the lotion that she normally uses and did so faithfully for the next six months. Six months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously... the jar lasted from the end of December until mid-June, so despite the fact that it&#x27;s a fairly expensive product, it certainly lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife does have sensitive skin however, and we would have stopped this little experiment if it became clear that there was anything in it that was irritating. In addition to being very easy on her skin, she also noted that it wasn&#x27;t loaded up with any kind of fragrance. As something she applied before going to bed, this is something I appreciated as well, since I would much prefer not to feel like I had dozed off in the perfume aisle of a department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note, it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; in any way; the skin seems to absorb it without looking like you just slathered your face with petroleum jelly. (I&#x27;ve heard of women who actually apply Vaseline to their hands and then don a pair of gloves before bedtime... maybe this works to keep ones hands soft, but ...ewww.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a very nice product. It&#x27;s not magic...but then again, my wife started out looking terrific and ended the experiment six months later still looking terrific.</li>
            <li> While some have found this cream to be irritating, this has not been the case for my wife who used it for a month straight.  I tested it once, too, right under my eyes, and found that although I can feel that it is there, it is not at all irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the claims about reducing wrinkles, it is hard to confirm this.  My wife did not notice any additional wrinkles as a result of using this cream, but she also did not notice any significant reduction.  She said that maybe, just maybe, there were fewer wrinkles above her nose, but she was not really sure.  This is a fairly expensive cream (roughly the cost of a few cases of beer, as I see it).  For that price, one might expect the results to be a bit more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we suddenly notice a reduction in wrinkles, I will immediately return here to report the good news.  But in the meantime, my wife is still a bit wrinkly.</li>
            <li> This is a very good moisturizer that lessens the appearances of wrinkles or lines and also renders clarity to your complexion over time.  Having reactive skin lately, was pleasantly surprised that after applying this Scalisi Advanced Wrinkle Cream experienced no tingling, irritation or redness whatsoever.  Formula includes primarily silicone (dimethicone), macademia, hazel and cucumber oils. No detectable fragrance, and the pump feature didn&#x27;t exactly cooperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using for maybe a week and a half (during the day and as a night cream) noticed my complexion felt smoother and looked clearer and more even.  The effect was fairly dramatic where I had lingering redness from persistant eczema patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a recommendation for ultimate results with any moisturizer.  Wash and exfoliate with a microfiber towel. Any and all dry skin or flakes vanish, so that whatever you apply will penetrate so much more effectively.  PLUS, your makeup will glide on flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside here is the price tag.  Personally, the most I&#x27;ve even spent on a moisturizer was $30.00, so one star off for pricing.  The cost, although it may be warranted, is certainly a far reach out of most people&#x27;s cosmetic budget.</li>
            <li> Scalisi AWC says it will \\&quot;relax the appearance of muscle tightening and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.\\&quot; So let me start by saying that I appreciate the honesty here. The cream doesn&#x27;t claim to make wrinkles vanish, just to make them less obvious and perhaps slow the development of new ones. If any cream could work miracles, even an expensive cream, no one would fork over $10,000+ for a facelift and all those laser machines would collect dust.    Next, if you are 20 years old, this cream is not for you. Scalisi sells a less \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; moisturizer for those without dry skin, and from what I can tell, people seem to like it. If your skin is dry, AWC moisturizes well without feeling heavy, and there is no nasty scent to give you a headache. The product contains patented peptides. These are not Scalisi patents, by the way, but I will leave you to do your own research as that is beyond the scope of this review, and I don&#x27;t want to nerd out completely on the ingredients.    The price seems extravagant, but there is a lot of product in this small jar, though I can&#x27;t speak to the dispenser as mine refused to work and I eventually broke it while trying to fix it. (Yeah, I have a bad habit of doing that with stuff.)  I like the concept, especially the fact that the pump relies on a simple mechanism that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room or weight. The packaging is also green. Lots of details have been considered and incorporated.    Results: the product asks you to give it eight weeks, and claims a 45% reduction in wrinkles after that time. Eight weeks is a reasonable timeframe, given that mature skin cells turn over slower than a baby&#x27;s, but I have yet to see an explanation of the 45%. It works for 45% of users? Wrinkles seem reduced by 45%? How could you even achieve the latter, given that wrinkling is a result of volume loss and skin laxity? I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll buy it again, given the abundance of far less costly options, but so far am happy with it as a winter moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Update: Having now used this for 8 weeks, I&#x27;d like to update my review. Even though I like the product, I felt it only right to change my 4 star review to 3 stars, because it doesn&#x27;t live up to its advertising. On the positive side, the jar is long-lasting, and after two months I&#x27;ve barely used any of it; I&#x27;ve been applying it nightly, but a little bit is all you need. It&#x27;s a high quality moisturizer that got me through a dry winter. When you apply it, your skin immediately feels cool, smooth, and healthy. With all the moisturizing and even the healthy glow this cream gives, wrinkles and fine lines do become less noticeable. However, the effect is not nearly dramatic enough to claim a &amp;#34;45% reduction,&amp;#34; and there is little if any noticeable change over time. Also, the pump--one of the other selling points--has stopped working, so I need to dip my fingers into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a high quality, silky moisturizer that leaves the skin feeling soft and hydrated without the greasiness of some moisturizers. Scalisi advertises a 45% reduction in the appearance of wrinkles within 8 weeks. So far, I have only used the product for less than half that time, so I will be sure to update when I have used it longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One unique aspect of Scalisi Skincare cream is its container, which uses a pump dispenser (just open the top lid and push down) keep the product fresh and hygienic by eliminating the need to dip your fingers into the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially in the wintertime, my skin tends to get very dry. Previously, I used Jergen&#x27;s as a moisturizer, and I Scalisi seems to be doing a slightly better job of keeping my skin hydrated (I was happy with Jergen&#x27;s, so this means Scalisi does great). The cream is smooth and silky, with a light (slightly chemical) scent that would suit either gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note that this product is not advertised as a wrinkle remover, and indeed, so far it hasn&#x27;t performed any miracles on the crows&#x27; feet in the corners of my eyes. The very fine lines do seem a bit less noticeable, though it&#x27;s hard to tell whether that&#x27;s my imagination. After putting on the cream, I have noticed that the hydration and smoothness do help reduce the appearance--though not necessarily the existence--of lines in general. Overall, my skin feels healthier. However, considering that this product does not have any dramatic effects (so far), I&#x27;m not sure whether the $70 dollar cost is justified. Personally, on my tight budget, I probably would not pay that much even for a moisturizer, despite the high quality of this one. On the other hand, it does look like this generous container--where a little goes a long way--will last several months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that it does contain macadamia and hazel, so be careful if you have a nut allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sure to update as this product has more time to do its thing!fine lines do seem a bit less noticeable, though it&#x27;s hard to tell whether that&#x27;s my imagination.

            <li> My wife gave this wrinkle cream a fair shot before giving up on it.  She had very little good to say about it.  Her first complaint was the smell was so strong that she found it impossible to apply it just before going to bed at night, because all it would do was keep her awake.  Of course, this meant that she had to remember to apply a couple of hours before bedtime, which is a bit counter-intuitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That by itself probably would have been enough for her to give up on this, but she also found the container to be incredibly annoying, as it fell apart every time she opened it.  The cream itself she describes as very thick and somewhat mealy, and while it eventually feels nice on the skin, the initial texture and thickness is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the wrinkles?  Well, who knows.  It didn&#x27;t do anything horrible to her skin, but I honestly can&#x27;t say that I noticed any difference.  She didn&#x27;t notice any particular improvement, and probably will continue to use the less expensive creams she has used in the past.  There is no possible way that she would pay the higher price for a product which she finds to be so uniformly unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Now, I can&#x27;t say the price is amazing...but the product is pretty good! First, the dispenser is a wonderful addition to using this product! Push down on the base and it pushes up the amount of moisturizer you need (awesome). Second, the product has a slight scent, overall a light clean scent. Third, the product is a spectacular moisturizer! Non greasy, slightly thick, but soaks in and leaves your skin super soft! Forth, the only issue is I didn&#x27;t see a difference with lines or color of my skin. This is the reason I find the price a little high. But, if price isn&#x27;t an issue the moisturizer is fabulous! Fifth, I did not break out, or notice any reactions whatsoever! Lastly, I&#x27;m worried I won&#x27;t know when the product gets low because you can&#x27;t see in the container.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizer - not too heavy and it absorbs quickly enough that it can be applied just before makeup. The scent is pleasant and dissipates quickly. Too soon too say if the wrinkle reducing claims are accurate. What I dislike is the packaging - it seems cheap and flimsy. You need to press down on a disk that covers the top of the jar and product comes out a small hole on the middle. For me  too much or too little comes out and on several occasions shot up in the air.  Usually something this price would have more deluxe packaging</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizer, but pricey.  I guess whether I recommend it comes down to whether it works better for you on wrinkle reduction than more affordable moisturizers, and like most reviewers, I&#x27;m just not sure.    My wife agreed to stand in as test subject, and reports that as an overnight moisturizer, this is great.  It goes on smoothly, has a very mild fragrance, and feels good.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s pricey - even if a container lasts a month and a half - that&#x27;s still eight containers per year, which adds up.  So the ultimate question is whether it works to reduce wrinkles.    Like most reviewers, I&#x27;m not sure.  My wife looks great, but she looked great before she used this cream as well.  ;)  The instructions say to give eight weeks to see close to 50% wrinkle reduction, and while I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s not working, I just don&#x27;t know how to measure wrinkle reduction, so I&#x27;m not sure.  You may need to give it a try yourself.     If I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d design a test along these lines:  Take a bunch of pictrures over the course of eight weeks - same time of day, same lighting, close enough to show any wrinkles and maybe to avoice hairstyle changes.  Then print them out and ask people (1) to dell wich were from week 0 and which were from week 8, and (2) their epinions of the change in wrinkles, if any.  I wish I had done that, and if you try it, I&#x27;d love to read your results!</li>
            <li> I love this Scalisi Advanced Wrinkle Cream. Even though I&#x27;ve not been using it for the eight weeks required in order to see a reduction in wrinkles, my skin is looking very good, smooth and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product claims to reduce the appearance of wrinkles by 45% in 8 weeks (clinical results). It contains a patented peptide combination of ingredients. It has a unique disk dispenser that covers the surface of the cream completely so that you don&#x27;t contaminate the product by touching it. Just press on the disk and wrinkle cream comes up through a hole in the center of the disk. Very cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a variety of skin care products for the past three months, and I love this one for silky-feeling and younger-looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Scalisi Skincare, for my complimentary Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream!</li>
            <li> Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream is definitely a very good moisturizer.  It hydrates the skin, but is light and not greasy at all.  Using a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; to dispense the product is a clever idea - and makes a lot more sense that sticking your fingers into it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it is too early for me to tell if its claims of being able to &amp;#34;relax the appearance of muscle tightening and reduce the appearance of wrinkles&amp;#34; are accurate or not since Scalisi recommends using this product for up to 8 weeks to see results and as part of the Vine program I am required to write a review within 30 days.  If I find out any additional info on whether this product is definitely able to do what it claims to do (or is definitely not able to do what it claims to do) then I will update this review accordingly.</li>
            <li> I have two people in our household using this cream... my wife has been using it since it arrived and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two weeks. She reports that she cannot tell a significant improvement over her \\&quot;wrinkles,\\&quot; but that is not my reason for use...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I should report that with this product a little goes a long, long way. It is expensive, but I think it might last through a year...or more, which makes the cost much more bearable (it&#x27;s relative). Second, it smells ok (not bad not good) and it is greaseless. It absorbs quickly into the skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I suffer from Diabetes Type II and as a consequence I have very dry skin on my face, my nose and eyes in particular. I have used several major brand facial creams and lotions with minimal results for re-hydrating my skin. this Scalisi cream has worked wonders with my skin and the blotchiness I&#x27;ve had for a couple years. If for no other reason, I am a new convert for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product review update when my wife provides the details of her experience.</li>
            <li> The best thing I can say about this cream is its moisturizing effect.  It goes on very light, without leaving residue, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed for a long time after application.  However, as for the smoothing effect, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for a moisturizer, this is great.  For a wrinkle-reducer, however, I think there are probably better options out there.</li>
            <li> I have been somewhat tardy in reviewing this product; however, I wanted to be as totally fair as possible and be sure my positive feelings were not altered by those feelings.  I am not too familiar with the Scalisi Brand of products; however, if the rest of their line compares half as favorable as this one, I will be back for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started using Scalisi, I tried to make a direct comparison by using Scalisi on the left side of my face and hands and nothing on the others.  I could not maintain my schedule and leave the house half-flocked, but I did the split comparison while at home.  Then he said with a roar, it works.  No, it did not transmogrify me into a crackless old man, but it sure tightened those wrinkles noticeably.  I felt as if I had lathered my face and hand with an alum solution.  Skin resilence that left years ago appeared to be lerking around the bones seeking that escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see every reason to continue using this cream and who knows with continued use there is no telling what age I could pass for.</li>
            <li> I wish my review were more positive, but I had a severe allergic reaction. On the surface this product touts many benefits, such as smoother skin, 45% less wrinkles in 8 weeks and Paraben free. Unfortunately my facial skin is so super sensitive; that one or more ingredients in this jar have caused some serious out breaks after two weeks of nightly use. Once I stopped using this product, I had to use Proactive reparative lotion to clear up my skin. My skin is almost back to normal, and I have gone back to using Arcona &#x27;Magic White Ice&#x27; Jumbo Hydrating Gel which has always given me great results. I suppose I can always use it as a hand lotion provided my hands don&#x27;t turn red or blotchy. NO recommendation.</li>
            <li> This really deserves a 3.5 stars, but because I was taught to round a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34; up to the next highest digit, I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.  I must freely admit I didn&#x27;t use this cream - I gave it to my wife.  She&#x27;s so beautiful that she doesn&#x27;t need it, but she tried it anyway.  :-)  Anyway, on the plus side, this cream dispenses easily, and it&#x27;s light smooth and hydrating.  It does help with some of the fine lines that she has on her face, and her skin is clear so there&#x27;s no reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, this stuff is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, the instructions say it can take up to 8 weeks to lose 50% of your wrinkles, but Amazon Vine makes me do this review after 30 days, so there may be additional benefits taking place in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizing night cream. I have been using it for four weeks now and I have seen a minor reduction in the fine wrinkles beside my eyes and around my mouth.  The cream feels great on my sensitive skin. It has a smooth consistency and rubs into skin easily, without leaving behind a greasy residue. The cream is not heavily scented, making it perfect for those who are also sensitive to scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a unique pump-top container which dispenses one small dollop at a time, in the perfect amount for a single application.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re talking about ridding your skin of wrinkles (or minimizing them as much as possible), the price of an item is not nearly as important as the results. That is to say, if I thought that a particular skin care product worked several times better than another, I&#x27;d be willing to pay several times the price. Such was not the case with this cream. In my former (pre stay at home mom) life, I worked in a STEM field, so it should come as no surprise that, when trying to figure out how well this worked, I turned to science. For the time allotted, I used what I usually use, a combination of Olay Regenerist plus Roc wrinkle cream products on one side of my face (don&#x27;t laugh) and Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream on the other. Hypothesis: the more expensive a product, the better it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I liked the lighter feel of Scalisi better than either of the other products I usually use (they are more viscous), after several weeks I noticed zero difference between the skin on the left and right side of my face, especially around and under my eyes. Conclusion: the cost of a product doesn&#x27;t necessarily correlate with its effectiveness. I plan to continue using this cream (as I tend not to waste things) until it runs out because I do really like the results. However, I didn&#x27;t find it to work any better than the less expensive products I usually use.</li>
            <li> My wife has become addicted to this product, and the others in Scalisi Skincare&#x27;s line. I knew I was in trouble when I gave the entire collection to her as a gift and she fell in love with it. Now she expects refills all the time. She says it&#x27;s done wonders for her skin and that&#x27;s enough for me. She feels great. She also LOVES that it&#x27;s healthy for her skin and the science backs up the claims. Be careful, your wife may become addicted too.</li>
            <li> Scalisi Skincare Advanced Wrinkle Cream promises to make wrinkles appear less noticeable by plumping up the areas making wrinkles look and feel less deep.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to try this in the area&#x27;s around my mouth (smile lines) and the corners of my eyes. Those are the areas that concern me the most and because of the repetitive use of the muscles in those areas, the lines tend to get deeper with age.&lt;br /&gt;My face has never been terribly dry, even in the winter, so just hydrating those areas with other creams and moisturizers never really seemed to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;I used this Cream at night. In the evening when I removed makeup and did my skin cleanse for the night I would apply a layer of this cream to the problem areas I was concentrating on. Usually about 2 hours later, before going to bed, I would smooth another layer on my whole face, once again covering the problem areas. At first I thought that the cream was going to feel thick and uncomfortble because when you dip some out of the jar with your finger it does feel really rich and thick. As you smooth it over your skin though you can feel the cream thinning out and it is absorbed into the skin a lot fast than any other night creams I have used. It went in so good that by the time I re-did the problem areas a second time, that also was absorbed into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure as I use the cream longer I will see more positive effects but after about 3 weeks I can already see that it is making a difference.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels hydrated and the skin, especially over my cheeks and cheek bones, looks healthier than it did before I started. My smile lines are still deep but I can see that the ends of them are softening out more and have hopes that they will look more filled in after a few more weeks. The lines at the corners of my eyes are almost always erased. When I wash my face with my cleanser and have no cream on my face, I can still see them but there are definitely less deep and when I have the cream on my face those lines pretty much disappear.&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a slight scent but I only really notice it for the first few minutes that it&#x27;s on and it&#x27;s not a heavy scent or one that is gross - kind of like the light scent of roses ( odd because that doesn&#x27;t appear to be an ingredient).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to use these cream and see just how much of a change I can get out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I see from the products web site that they recommend using their companion moisturizer over the top of the cream if you are going to use it for daytime so that it will &#x27;seal in&#x27; the cream. Trying that also sounds like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little spendy but I have used this daily for 3 weeks and still have half a jar left so I think it&#x27;s worth the price - I have paid more for other products that didn&#x27;t show me any positive changes.n my face those lines pretty much disappear.&lt;br /&gt;The cream has a slight scent but I only really notice it for the first few minutes that it&#x27;s on and it&#x27;s not a heavy scent or one that is gross - kind of like the light scent of roses ( odd because that doesn&#x27;t appear to be an ingredient).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to continue to use these cream and see just how much of a change I can get out of it.&lt;br /&gt;I see from the products web site that they recommend using their companion moisturizer over the top of the cream if you are going to use it for daytime so that it will &#x27;seal in&#x27; the cream.
