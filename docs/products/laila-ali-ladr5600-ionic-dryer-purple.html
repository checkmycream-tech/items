            <li>I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product and laila ali!</li>
            <li>Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Aside from the comb, The dryer itself is nice</li>
            <li>Great and just great for natural hair.....</li>
            <li>This Blow Dryer is very strong, meaning the wind that comes out of it.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is the best dryer I have ever purchased by far.  </li>
            <li>It gets REALLY hot, which is great.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the comb attachment.</li>
            <li>:) Really this dryer is great, I use it once a month to blow out my 4a/c hair.</li>
            <li>I can truly say I really love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I use the comb attachment, which I love.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair, Recommend this dryer !!</li>
            <li>Great and not heavy at all</li>
            <li>The dryer is ok, a medium setting would make this a better product since the hi setting gets very hot very quickly.</li>
            <li>Comb attachment breaks too easily.</li>
            <li>I really liked Laila Ali&#x27;s demo and I purchased the product because the nozzle size easily fits into my hand and the long comb is seated a good distance from the heat of the dryer.</li>
            <li>The blow dryer is light weight and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and gets HOT!</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really anything spectacular about this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Overall a great purchase for the price</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t comb through my hair as well as I thought it would, especially since the description says that it&#x27;s great for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>/heat settings were good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>There is also a cool button on the front of the handle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it could have  lasted much longer if that nozzle hadn&#x27;t overcooked it.</li>
            <li>Not a bad blow dryer, just wish this could have a cool hair setting.</li>
            <li>If there was a medium setting, that would be a LOT better for me - my sister and mom like the intense heat, but I&#x27;d prefer a lower setting to prevent heat damage.</li>
            <li>The dryer itself had gotten so hot, so very quickly that it melted the comb attachment so that smoke was emitting from my hair, the comb attachment and from the dryer itself.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it come with the comb attachment to help blow dry her hair straight.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer really helps when I take out my hair from braids and need my hair to be tangle free when getting them braided again.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair dryer so far.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer so far.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot very fast.</li>
            <li>and then my hair is super straight.</li>
            <li>it was also shipped well and quick thanks</li>
            <li>I usually dread doing my own hair at home because its so much work and time but using this blow dryer has made it more bearable.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good dryer, I&#x27;ve never used one like this before, it dries faster than my old Vidal Sassoon that finally konked out after 8 years.</li>
            <li>Click it up the speed would be higher with hotter heat.  </li>
            <li>First time I had a dryer with one.</li>
            <li>Thanks Laila Ali!  </li>
            <li>so that was my first reason for looking into purple blow dryers.</li>
            <li>It gets my daughters hair nice and dry and straight within 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It works really well with my thick, wavy hair and on top of that it&#x27;s so cute and purple.</li>
            <li>I unplugged it to let it rest and cool completely off</li>
            <li>It does what most hairdryers do which is dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was very bouncy and pretty straight.</li>
            <li>Luckily I still had my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Use this with Pure Jojoba oil as a heat protectant works like butter, hair like butter...</li>
            <li>Gets the job done fast</li>
            <li>It straightens the hair very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as straight as I would like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking to see if I can replace it, it was really helpful in drying my hair.</li>
            <li>The comb is very stable.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is very light weight and dries lightening fast.</li>
            <li>The high is  extremely HOT and is equivalent to a medium speed on most other dryers.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw Laila&#x27;s video demonstration using it in the same manner.</li>
            <li>But there are only two settings, plus a cool shot.</li>
            <li>less then 5 minutes honestly love the attachment.</li>
            <li>After my second use I realized that it was pretty light weight and not so big or bulky.</li>
            <li>Also, the comb attachment could be a little better.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and quieter than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>This is light weight but powerful compared to the other one I had just purchased 6 months prior.</li>
            <li>Great item old fashion look but dries my long thick hair in</li>
            <li>I bought this blow dryer when it was $25, but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this dryer at the new price.</li>
            <li>I recieved the Laila Ali LADR5600 Ionic Dryer, Purple from amazon last week and used it for the first time over the weekend.  </li>
            <li>Make my hair soft and de-tangled and I have natural hair.</li>
            <li>So far there has been no problems at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and needed this in my life for those days I wanted to blow my hair out...</li>
            <li>The end result left my hair pretty straight, soft, and not overly dry.  </li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds low and high.</li>
            <li>I am so very sorry to have to issue this rating because I was really happy to find this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using the dryer regularly for about 4 months and the comb attachment is yet to slip off or break (I have coarse 4c hair), however I hope to purchase a higher quality blow dryer in the near future.</li>
            <li>On the 4th blowdrying session,  the comb attachment broke first on one side and then on the other side.</li>
            <li>The comb falls off frequently after several uses.</li>
            <li>Cut my hair drying time down in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: today my precious dryer fried and went dead after using a crappy concentrator nozzle that overheated it.</li>
            <li>dryer wasn&#x27;t hot enough and the comb wasn&#x27;t sturdy enough to blow dry hair.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is the pik that came with it pretty much disintegrated when I used it the second time and did my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>but it dried me and my daughters hair very fast.</li>
            <li>Of course I still used a flat iron after to style, but my hair was pretty tame after using this hair dryer.  </li>

            <li> but I use a flat iron afterwards</li>
            <li> Swicth it down the speed would be low with moderate heat.  </li>
            <li> I dried my hair straight in less than 10 mins using the pick.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely dry and break off.</li>
            <li> but when I tried again even turning it on the cooler setting failed because it quickly overheated and started smoking.</li>
            <li> The low speed is not COOL but a medium heat.  .    </li>
            <li> I typically dry my hair by holding the dryer upside down with the nozzle in my hand as opposed to the handle.</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair less than 30 min</li>
            <li> Her website for using the blow dryer and other styling tools is [...]  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust any other hair dryer at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and we both have very thick and long natural hair.</li>
            <li> It usually takes on average about 20 minutes with a regular blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have used other blow dryers in the past and even with heat protectant products, my hair would still be dry and brittle after blow drying it.  </li>
            <li> Someone mentioned in previous reviews that the comb didnt stay on.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is not ideal for natural curly / kinky hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dig or scratch my scalp like other comb attachments I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It works well if you are working in small sections.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the third time, I had just turned it on and begun to use it when I noticed smoke coming from my hair.</li>
            <li> It did for me, even with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is as ethnic as it gets, and I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Sorry:(</li>
            <li> The pik attachment isn&#x27;t as bad as some of the reviews state.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the comb broke after three uses.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very disappointed it broke in a million pieces after just two uses.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Destroyed my hair. Made my hair extremely dry and break off. Never had that happen before. Use at your own risk.</li>
            <li> dryer wasn&#x27;t hot enough and the comb wasn&#x27;t sturdy enough to blow dry hair. I returned it for a refund. I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product. Sorry:(</li>
            <li> This is light weight but powerful compared to the other one I had just purchased 6 months prior. Gets the job done fast</li>
            <li> Been using this in Italy for 2 months. Glad I bought it :)</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with her purchase!</li>
            <li> Comb attachment breaks too easily. Disappointed that the comb broke after three uses. Aside from the comb, The dryer itself is nice</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and quieter than my old dryer. The comb attachment and dual voltage is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment is not ideal for natural curly / kinky hair. I purchasd this item and only used it 3 times. On the 4th blowdrying session,  the comb attachment broke first on one side and then on the other side.</li>
            <li> Great and just great for natural hair.....</li>
            <li> Love this product and laila ali!</li>
            <li> Very nice blow dryer. It straightens the hair very well. I love it.</li>
            <li> Great and not heavy at all</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really anything spectacular about this hair dryer. It does what most hairdryers do which is dry hair. The comb attachment makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I recieved the Laila Ali LADR5600 Ionic Dryer, Purple from amazon last week and used it for the first time over the weekend.  It is a great hair dryer.  I dried my hair straight in less than 10 mins using the pick.  The end result left my hair pretty straight, soft, and not overly dry.  I have used other blow dryers in the past and even with heat protectant products, my hair would still be dry and brittle after blow drying it.  My hair would look like a big puff ball aka. chaka khan.  But no puffball this time around.  Of course I still used a flat iron after to style, but my hair was pretty tame after using this hair dryer.  FYI I am african-american and my hair type is 3c.  The pick is awsome and appears durable.  The blow dryer is light weight and easy to handle.  The two dryier speeds/heat settings were good enough for me.  Click it up the speed would be higher with hotter heat.  Swicth it down the speed would be low with moderate heat.  There is also a cool button on the front of the handle.  I usually dread doing my own hair at home because its so much work and time but using this blow dryer has made it more bearable.  Overall a great purchase for the price and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It works really well with my thick, wavy hair and on top of that it&#x27;s so cute and purple. My favorite hair dryer so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has the comb attachment. This blow dryer dries your hair quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as straight as I would like but I use a flat iron afterwards and then my hair is super straight. It has 2 speeds low and high.The high is  extremely HOT and is equivalent to a medium speed on most other dryers. The low speed is not COOL but a medium heat.  .    Her website for using the blow dryer and other styling tools is [...]  I would recommend it for basic blow drying. The comb attachment is great</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my niece and she loves it. It&#x27;s great that it come with the comb attachment to help blow dry her hair straight. This was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it. Make my hair soft and de-tangled and I have natural hair. Someone mentioned in previous reviews that the comb didnt stay on. It did for me, even with my thick hair. I love the comb attachment. First time I had a dryer with one. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is the best dryer I have ever purchased by far.  It gets my daughters hair nice and dry and straight within 10 minutes.  It usually takes on average about 20 minutes with a regular blow dryer.  Thanks Laila Ali!  this product rocks!!!!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot very fast. The comb falls off frequently after several uses.</li>
            <li> I brought this because the recent blow dryer I had I think burned out or something. Whatever happened it just stopped working. This Blow Dryer is very strong, meaning the wind that comes out of it. I was very pleased with it. And the provided comb is very good also. So far there has been no problems at all. This blow dryer really helps when I take out my hair from braids and need my hair to be tangle free when getting them braided again. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I received my blow dryer and I have been nothing but please with it! It&#x27;s not bulky and it&#x27;s lightweight yet get the job done and done well</li>
            <li> Very light weight and gets HOT!</li>
            <li> The dryer is ok, a medium setting would make this a better product since the hi setting gets very hot very quickly. The pik attachment isn&#x27;t as bad as some of the reviews state. It works well if you are working in small sections. I have been using the dryer regularly for about 4 months and the comb attachment is yet to slip off or break (I have coarse 4c hair), however I hope to purchase a higher quality blow dryer in the near future. I bought this blow dryer when it was $25, but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this dryer at the new price.</li>
            <li> The pick comb broke on 2nd use</li>
            <li> I love this dryer so far. I have used it all of twice but it dried me and my daughters hair very fast. I&#x27;m black and we both have very thick and long natural hair. The only complaint I have is the pik that came with it pretty much disintegrated when I used it the second time and did my daughters hair. I&#x27;m looking to see if I can replace it, it was really helpful in drying my hair. So I&#x27;m very disappointed it broke in a million pieces after just two uses. Other than that it is very light weight and dries lightening fast. Cut my hair drying time down in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: today my precious dryer fried and went dead after using a crappy concentrator nozzle that overheated it. I had it over a year since my review and it was so great I just reordered another one. I don&#x27;t trust any other hair dryer at this point. The heat is awesome and just what I need and it has been a great working device until now. I&#x27;m sure it could have  lasted much longer if that nozzle hadn&#x27;t overcooked it.</li>
            <li> Great item old fashion look but dries my long thick hair in less then 5 minutes honestly love the attachment. I&#x27;m a purple lover so that was my first reason for looking into purple blow dryers. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase it was also shipped well and quick thanks</li>
            <li> Not a bad blow dryer, just wish this could have a cool hair setting.</li>
            <li> Awesome ! Great for natural hair, Recommend this dryer !!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! No burnouts and no malfunction. Perfect for me and my needs</li>
            <li> Use this with Pure Jojoba oil as a heat protectant works like butter, hair like butter... :) Really this dryer is great, I use it once a month to blow out my 4a/c hair. No breakage and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair. Ergonomics are good hold by the handle or the nozzle.</li>
            <li> I can truly say I really love this hair dryer. After my second use I realized that it was pretty light weight and not so big or bulky. I use the comb attachment, which I love. It doesn&#x27;t dig or scratch my scalp like other comb attachments I&#x27;ve used in the past. My hair was very bouncy and pretty straight. GREAT JOB LAILA!!!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good dryer, I&#x27;ve never used one like this before, it dries faster than my old Vidal Sassoon that finally konked out after 8 years. Overall, it&#x27;s great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine. It gets REALLY hot, which is great. But there are only two settings, plus a cool shot. If there was a medium setting, that would be a LOT better for me - my sister and mom like the intense heat, but I&#x27;d prefer a lower setting to prevent heat damage. Also, the comb attachment could be a little better. It doesn&#x27;t comb through my hair as well as I thought it would, especially since the description says that it&#x27;s great for ethnic hair. My hair is as ethnic as it gets, and I&#x27;m not impressed. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to glide through, but I was expecting it to comb my hair easier than it did, and my hair was detangled!</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer! I can dry my hair less than 30 min</li>
            <li> Great heat so I get dried really fast.</li>
            <li> A very nice dryer and is especially good for anyone on the go. I am thoroughly pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and needed this in my life for those days I wanted to blow my hair out...</li>
            <li> I am so very sorry to have to issue this rating because I was really happy to find this product. I really liked Laila Ali&#x27;s demo and I purchased the product because the nozzle size easily fits into my hand and the long comb is seated a good distance from the heat of the dryer. I typically dry my hair by holding the dryer upside down with the nozzle in my hand as opposed to the handle. This one was a perfect fit and weight. I was excited when I saw Laila&#x27;s video demonstration using it in the same manner. I used the dryer three times in two months. Unfortunately, the third time, I had just turned it on and begun to use it when I noticed smoke coming from my hair. The dryer itself had gotten so hot, so very quickly that it melted the comb attachment so that smoke was emitting from my hair, the comb attachment and from the dryer itself. There were no safety shut-off features that kicked in. I unplugged it to let it rest and cool completely off but when I tried again even turning it on the cooler setting failed because it quickly overheated and started smoking. Luckily I still had my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The comb is very stable.</li>
