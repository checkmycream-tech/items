            <li>two forks that hold the razor and the brush bend very easy</li>
            <li>I got on Amazon and found this one at a good price and even though it is meant for a razor and a brush, it works just fine to hold both razors that he has.</li>

            <li>It makes the bathroom look nice, elegant and yet holds it&#x27;s function.</li>
            <li>Good quality construction, but it doesn&#x27;t quite fit my razor and badger brush.</li>

            <li>It just looks real nice and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This stand has a beautiful and *very* shiny chrome finish.  </li>
            <li>It was great when it first arrived, but the color has gradually gotten a bit off.  </li>
            <li>A beautiful razor stand that will stand out in the modern man&#x27;s bathroom.  </li>

            <li>It holds my Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor and Tweezerman Shaving Brush perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Looks attractive and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space as a big/bulky electric shaver.</li>
            <li>So the brush was all I was able to get.</li>
            <li>Very well made, great quality.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t actually many options.</li>
            <li>:  After several weeks this stand has performed flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>MANY STANDS ARE GOING FOR 30 PLUS DOLLARS...</li>
            <li>IT IS STYLISH...    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Col. Conk stand for over 3 years now and am still pleased.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a stand that would hold both my safety razor and brush but most of them on amazon cost more than I&#x27;d like to spend.</li>
            <li>Of course my wife has more area than I.</li>
            <li>I am planning to buy 2 more for my sons.</li>
            <li>If you want a better stand its going to cost you around $100.00.</li>
            <li>The Colonel&#x27;s stand is a handsome looking stand that compliments any razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>I need it for function more than anything.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred something more non skid</li>
            <li>but I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the look of the stand.</li>
            <li>It holds and matches my Parker Double Edge Razor PERFECTLY as well as my Art of Shaving brush.</li>
            <li>more do you say about a stand?</li>
            <li>I unscrewed it to find even more rust.</li>
            <li>If the Colonel Conk Evernice fits your brush and razor, and most will, it presents an attractive and reasonably priced solution for keeping your shaving area neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>I was pleased upon opening the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stand is still serviceable and looks OK.</li>
            <li>If you used this on the sink it might hold up better, but in the shower there is no way.  </li>
            <li>for the money I had hoped for better.</li>
            <li>It should be better if the shaving brush side,   was a bit wider, so it can hold everytype of shaving brushes.</li>
            <li>and they fit nicely.  </li>
            <li>My husband has enjoyed his.</li>
            <li>The brush can not be hung by the handle like many others.  </li>
            <li>I have only had the stand for a week or two, but it&#x27;s working great for me!</li>
            <li>this adds to our bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li>I tried fitting my Mach-3 razor on the razor part of the stand</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is more of a decoration to my bathroom than just a stand.</li>
            <li>Buy this stand, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great addition to my shaving collection!</li>
            <li>I looks elegant but will be useable for years to come.  </li>
            <li>Nothing feels more manly than displaying the tools you use to shave to your friends and family, and what better way to do that than on this shiny stand?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a good price for something that will look great and last - plus it matches my razor!</li>
            <li>For the price and &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; labelling, was expecting something a bit more substantive.</li>
            <li>Very durable stand and great chrome construction.</li>
            <li>What more do you want?</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;d recommend you check the measurements against your brush just to be sure.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit their own product (brush).  </li>
            <li>(most noticeably on the knurled part of the stem).  </li>
            <li>The stand is perfect match in design with the Merkur 180 Steel Cross Hatching.</li>
            <li>More brown spots gradually appeared within a week.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I did-</li>
            <li>$25)which is a much better match</li>
            <li>Sure, it can hold your razor and brush, but it can also: Be used as a paperweight, even in hurricane winds, stop a bear with the power of a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick, make men admire you and make women love you because of your epically manly taste in shaving accessories.</li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>but it sure seems it will hold up</li>
            <li>but I was hoping I&#x27;d be able to hang my Mach 3 razor from it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>BASICALLY BETTER PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li>I love this stand.</li>
            <li>It is simple and not flamboyant and performs its purpose perfectly.</li>
            <li>This stand is great, it holds my razor really well.</li>
            <li>It keeps things more compact and off the counter.</li>
            <li>However, as a safety razor user for many years this is one of the lower quality</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>Why spend more money for something that sits in the bathroom?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this stand for two years or more.</li>
            <li>My razors and brushes both fit nicely on it.</li>
            <li>got most of the spots off</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this razor stand for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Like many others, I just wanted a stand to hold my shaving tools, but most of them were way out of my budget.</li>
            <li>Keeps my brush and razor neatly stored on the counter top.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>All the components feel &#x27;quality&#x27; to me and really looks great holding my Parker 99r and brush.</li>
            <li>But I still cant get the rust off the counter top.</li>
            <li>seems like the more</li>
            <li>I love the chrome finish.</li>
            <li>Im satisfied</li>
            <li>so i could hang the brush lower than from the top</li>
            <li>A wonderful item to classically display a safety razor and shave brush.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps 3 1/2 stars are more in order.</li>
            <li>So I have to set it on top of the opening, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>fit most brush handles, might have to hang it by the middle.&lt;br /&gt;-needs to be cleaned often to look nice</li>
            <li>I purchased many of these along with badger brushes, bowls and soap as gifts.</li>
            <li>It is solid and looks great by my sink!  </li>
            <li>I have read reviews talking about rusting stands and wobbling bases, I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li>Prevents water from degrading your brush and razor - a necessity, even more than quality aftershave or soap.</li>
            <li>This product is both elegant and well made.</li>
            <li>Now it looks more gold.  </li>
            <li>If I were to improve the design, I would put two more holders on it for another brush and razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m hooked for life, I am going to look for something a bit nicer and more durable.  </li>
            <li>This stand is reasonably priced, well constructed and makes an attractive, practical storage stand for razor &amp; brush.</li>
            <li>love the look of this in my bathroom</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I remembered to order the stand.</li>
            <li>The forks should be longer and bent up more to hold the razor and brush on.</li>
            <li>Took a chance and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market</li>
            <li>it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week.</li>
            <li>Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss</li>
            <li>but I with it had more lather.</li>
            <li>I couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i LOVE THIS FIXTURE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME MORE SPACE</li>
            <li>ON MY SINK TOP</li>
            <li>AND IS A SAFE WAY TO STORE MY RAZOR.</li>
            <li>No problems with tipping and aesthetically appealing.</li>
            <li>well built and seems like it will last a lifetime.. very happy with it and would recomend it</li>
            <li>will bring a sophisticated look to your counter and bathroom and women will love it.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this stand holding my Merkur Futur safety razor and shave brush.  </li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t get a better looking stand for the money.</li>
            <li>what more can i expect?</li>
            <li>fast shipping, great quality</li>
            <li>My brush doesn&#x27;t fit nicely</li>
            <li>so I improvised and made it fit another way!</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better for others</li>
            <li>Outstanding razor stand for the money.</li>
            <li>and I am still glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>

            <li>Very nice looking &amp; keeps the brush &amp; razor ready for use.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>This will certainly clean it up and leave a nice look for him.</li>
            <li>However it is a decent weight and the finish looks great.</li>
            <li>High quality and great value product.</li>
            <li>but it fit great with them good universal stand.</li>
            <li>It looks so beautiful and classy with my silver handle brush and my chrome</li>

            <li>Fits my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor perfectly.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Chrome with no blemishes so far.</li>
            <li>My first impression is good.  </li>
            <li>But, quality is pretty good</li>
            <li>Got this to go with my DE Merkur, and it looks pretty good.</li>

            <li>Looks nice and does the job...holds perfectly the Merkur Heavy Duty Edge Razo #34C and a brush...</li>
            <li>Great classic finish, should be able to fit your shaving needs.</li>
            <li>I use a Gillette Fusion razor and a standard, wooden-handle shaving brush, and both fit perfectly onto the stand.  </li>
            <li>It looks awesome in my bathroom and was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit actually.  </li>

            <li>100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle with Free Stand.  </li>
            <li>This stand is nice and solid and does the job at a great price.</li>
            <li>It looks good on my sink and so far the chrome has stayed nice.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure many others will fit in them.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean</li>
            <li>However, because the razor stand has a large opening, the Merkur Futur fit in it very nicely where the balance is in the handle of the razor.  </li>
            <li>It has been more than a year, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure the majority of the brushes will work fine.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice stand to display their shaving gear!</li>

            <li>should fit mostly all brushes and safty razors</li>
            <li>I had some cheap brushes before, but I got one that was actually pretty good</li>
            <li>I just wish the razor side fit a Gillette Fusion better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Check the measurements of your components to make sure they&#x27;ll fit before ordering.</li>
            <li>And most importantly....</li>

            <li>Many reviews state that they fit</li>

            <li>so the stand doesn&#x27;t tip over easily.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you clean it every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Love the clean organized look of this item.  </li>
            <li>Everything does unscrew for easy cleaning though.  </li>

            <li>I strongly endorse this product.</li>
            <li>4 months going strong.</li>
            <li>It is high quality and looks good.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to buy another one unless this one gets lost or my wife gets pissed at me and this is the nearest object to hurl in my general direction lol</li>
            <li>I am glad to report that it is true...</li>
            <li>but this stand is more of a nickel finish then a true chrome one.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to and looks nice.</li>
            <li>I thought it was kind of pricey at first, but now I know why.</li>
            <li>This looks great, has a nice weight to it and is WAY cheaper than any of the other comparable stands.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want its plastic tears down playing the marvelous shine</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does its job in holding a razor and a brush and looked good new.  </li>
            <li>and it is still as good as new.</li>
            <li>It holds my Merkur DE razor just fine.</li>
            <li>and now even it fits just fine.</li>
            <li>I read that some people had issues with the brush holder, I use an Omega 63171 and the stand grips it fine by the handle, as designed.</li>
            <li>It holds the razor and the brush in a fine position for air drying.</li>
            <li>The razor side holds my razor fine, but the brush side won&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li>The razor does not like to hang perfectly perpendicular to the prongs but always at a slightly \\&quot;off\\&quot; angle.</li>
            <li>fits just fine in it.  </li>
            <li>My shaving brush fits just fine as well.    </li>
            <li>This colonel conk stand is beautiful and very functional as well as priced reasonably</li>
            <li>The chrome plating is doing fine on mine after 8 months of use,  </li>
            <li>It holds the razor just fine, but could stand to be 1/8&amp;#34; wider on the brush side.</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this fine product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s chrome coloring makes it match well with most razors as well, so it&#x27;s pretty stylish.</li>
            <li>This works fine, does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>Holds my parker razor and horse hair shave brush just fine.</li>

            <li>No frills and holds my brush and razor fine.  </li>
            <li>, it is fine and it does work to suit my needs.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping it fits better when I get an EJ Super Badger.</li>
            <li>Looks good, steady, holds brush and razor well, reasonable price compared to many over priced ones that don&#x27;t look or work any better.</li>
            <li>It fits his Feather brand safety razor great, but would easily work for larger safety razors or even a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li>both fit fine.</li>
            <li>I have a Parker synthetic brush and it doesn&#x27;t fit the handle, however, fits just fine at the knot.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive about buying this stand after reading some of the reviews, but it turned out to be perfect out of the box.</li>
            <li>Nice little piece, and great for storing the shaving accouterments.</li>
            <li>B0018OXOUA Kingsley Badger Shave Brush - White # 28]] and its a great fit.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several months and it is holding up great and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic showcase for your double edged razor and brush combo - great way to class up your bathroom.</li>
            <li>That is IF THEY FIT.  </li>
            <li>I can get the brush to fit if I insert it where the bristles meet the handle, which does get the job done.</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t tip over....very important.</li>
            <li>Merkur HD and Baxters shave brush fit well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too tall that it doesn&#x27;t fit in our medicine cabinet and has a disc of flexible foam on the bottom to give it stability.    </li>
            <li>I may replace this in the future to get him a fancy one from a specialty shop, but this works great and is a necessity for keeping his shaving stuff neat.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>Should fit almost any razor and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Deluxe Stainless Steel 4 Prong Safety Razor and Shave</li>
            <li>It looked great for a week or two, but by the third week it started to rust.  </li>
            <li>Even the cheap [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Great stand, low cost, what else do you want in a razor/brush stand?  </li>
            <li>It is solidly constructed and does a great job of just standing there displaying your shaving gear.     </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it&#x27;d be great for my Double edge safety razor</li>
            <li>The hooks fit my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It looks fantastic on the sink counter.  </li>
            <li>that I know it will fit longer ones as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>This is very needed if you do this kind of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the cheap Van der Haggen set for 10 dollars, and the brush that comes with it won&#x27;t fit through the handle, so I have to place it between where the hairs and handle meet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and has not rusted a bit...</li>
            <li>Both my brush and DE razor fit with no problems.</li>
            <li>Very sleek and sturdy, looks nice on my bathroom counter-top.</li>
            <li>Over priced and cheap</li>
            <li>compared to the chrome of my razors and brushes, the chrome of this stand has a bit more of a golden tint to it.</li>
            <li>This thing looks great, but rusting is a definite problem.</li>
            <li>Style is important when I shave and it is important to my wife.  </li>

            <li>, I managed to grab it for $16 and free shipping.  </li>

            <li>Really nice stainless steel razor stand .</li>
            <li>fit well with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Great product, very solid, well balanced.</li>
            <li>The picture provided would lead one to believe, \\&quot;this instrument MAY be cheaply made with cheap  components\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Please note it does fit my Art of Shaving travel brush.  </li>
            <li>Razor fits snuggly and securely.</li>
            <li>Having a brush stand is an absolute must for maintaining a shaving brush and having the bracket for the razor as well helps keep things tidy.</li>
            <li>This is a well made and very functional product that is also nice looking.</li>
            <li>However, the majority of stands that I saw wouldn&#x27;t fit safety razors.  </li>
            <li>Honestly i did not expect much for the price paid.</li>
            <li>Great e-bayer, I look forward to our next exchange!</li>
            <li>My fault:many reviews said their brush wouldn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>and of course mine didn&#x27;t fit either.</li>
            <li>to keep it free of water marks and dust and the like.</li>
            <li>I have used this stand for just under a year, and found it very solid and attractive looking.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Handle of brush won&#x27;t fit in holder.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t fit my razor or my brush.</li>
            <li>It has held up well and really looks nice.</li>
            <li>Nice heft to to this stand and seems very well made for the price.</li>
            <li>It holds his razor perfectly however the slot for the brush is a bit narrow.  </li>
            <li>but overall it doesn&#x27;t rust and looks great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this stand for a few years now and it still looks great!  </li>
            <li>I like the weighted bottom, the smooth chrome finish</li>
            <li>Nice modern look.  </li>
            <li>It fit my brush.  </li>
            <li>It fit my razor.  </li>
            <li>It is not some light weight junk product.</li>
            <li>and you could see theseveral light scratches across it.</li>
            <li>gp/product/B000053L6W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2several light scratches across it.</li>
            <li>this cheap</li>
            <li>Husband is very picky about his shaving things, however he was thrilled to get this stand.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it was going to fit that, but for the price I risked it.</li>
            <li>So far so good, no rusting yet.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 months now, and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the good quality of this stand.  </li>
            <li>Good product so far.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Good for the price, but be sure that you have a smaller sized brush before you buy this.     </li>
            <li>/&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this stand and just ordered another one for a new razor and brush.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold the mach 3 razor too well, the balance isn&#x27;t quite right, but it manages ok</li>
            <li>Instead of hanging by the top of the handle, it rests right where the hair and handle meet.  </li>
            <li>I figure if you don&#x27;t use chemicals to clean it, it should be fine.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur 180 Long Safety Razor, and the Escali Pure Badger Brush fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>A little more hardiness and its pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever, but for the price it is very nice.</li>
            <li>But I have a very nice Vulfix shaving brush which only fits around the brush part - not around the handle.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to clean and keep clean</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, easy to use and most of all does not take too much space on the counter.</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality stand at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>A quick wipe with a rag gets rid of it easily though.</li>
            <li>This is a very attractive holder for my new double edge razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>The long handled razor hangs great, with no clearance issues, and the texture of the stand matches the 180&#x27;s handle</li>
            <li>MANY STANDS HAVE HIGHER PRICE TAGS</li>
            <li>I explained the corrosion issue to her and she has agreed to replace the stand explaining that occasionally the plating process can be affected by dust or dirt on the metal prior to plating, I&#x27;m really happy that their customer service was good</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s true that not all brushes might fit.</li>
            <li>and if you can overlook these minor issues it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>Completely worth it!</li>
            <li>Full size brush will fit I assume but a travel size like I got for my husband falls through the slot.  </li>
            <li>The travel size badger brush doesn&#x27;t fit, but the full size does and so does his razor.  </li>
            <li>Originally I had purchased it just to unclutter the counter-top, but this ended up being quite a bit nicer than I suspected.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also too small for  my best badger brush from Art of Shaving...  </li>
            <li>and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure how stable this thing was gonna be, but</li>
            <li>This little guy sits proudly on my sink and keeps my brush and razor looking stylish and protected at all times.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ts a good stand for the money, takes up little room on the counter, and holds the items nicely (though the Omega brush I bought it with has to be hung by the bristles</li>
            <li>Very heavy duty, holds his shaving gear wonderfully.</li>
            <li>As I am a  new returnee to DE shaving this stand is nicely affordable.</li>
            <li>it still looks nice and new.</li>
            <li>Excellent item, very stylish and well made, looks wonderful and is quite useful as well, the slot for the brush could stand to be a little bit bigger but other than that it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Clean and sleek looking for the Merkur razor that I purchased too.  </li>
            <li>Looks clean on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I use to keep my Double Edge Razor and Badger Brush in the bowl I use, but this cleans it up the counter top and looks nice.</li>
            <li>..looks clean and sparkles..adds a touch of class to a drab countertop..</li>
            <li>After getting my husband a safety razor and a shaving kit, he wanted a way to dry his brush, and this works great.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish has stayed clean, and matches any bathroom decor.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, but it could be sized better, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>For the price, it looks clean and efficient.</li>
            <li>and I also clean it with soap and water every so often.</li>
            <li>This stand is clean, sturdy, and has not shown any rust or tarnish in my months with it.</li>
            <li>Extremely clean and bubble wrapped.</li>
            <li>This stand is clean looking and does its job.</li>
            <li>Color is slightly yellow but fit and finish is good.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use with my Fusion Phantom Razor and Tweezerman shaving brush so that it they can air dry, and not clutter up my bathroom sink, and it worked out great.</li>
            <li>Looks clean and holds blade and brush with no problems.</li>
            <li>This looks great, is surprisingly heavy duty, and lets my brush air out nicely on top of everything.  </li>
            <li>and there is a speckling of rust spots, makes it have character but for those that like everything clean and shiny, this may be a problem.</li>
            <li>Great for the razor and soap brush to air dry</li>
            <li>This stand is all I need to hold my gear when I am not shaving, it allows my brush and razor to dry when I am not using them and looks great as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean &amp; just the right size &amp; weight.</li>
            <li>Fits my Rooney Style 2 Small Super Silvertip shaving brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit the badger brush I bought, but it was great for all the other stuff like how it looked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep an eye on it for any pitting (as a previous reviewer had experienced) but so far soo good.</li>
            <li>The price was right too!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li>Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li>Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li>, I use it daily and it stays clean and bright.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not an item that makes me super excited.</li>
            <li>Maybe if the razor side was angled up a little more, but mostly it&#x27;s because the body of the Mach 3 is kind of funky to begin with.</li>
            <li>It take minimal space &amp; looks great also.  </li>
            <li>Got this stand to complete my set and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the chrome finish as soon as I saw it - as it goes well with my old Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li>Looks nice sitting on the counter - like and old barber shop look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly well made and solid, but it doesn&#x27;t sit quite level and wobbles a bit if you bump it.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy and stylish stand.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a good stand for the money that you pay for it.</li>
            <li>Good looking stand, but my only issue was that the brush I have, a vulfix, does not sit well on the stand.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and solid.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this, as it really makes drying out the brush</li>
            <li>It looks cool and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Overall good stand though.</li>
            <li>Good solid construction.</li>
            <li>Seems ironic holding a cheap disposable razor with a chrome holder!</li>
            <li>I love the stainless construction.</li>
            <li>Overall good buy</li>
            <li>Still, not a bad purchase; might buy again.</li>
            <li>Everything fit great, and it was nice to let the brush hang the proper way and dry the way its supposed to between shaves.  </li>
            <li>Rusts pretty easy but sturdy</li>
            <li>but it comes apart pretty easily.</li>
            <li>But, to make up for those two problems, the entire thing can be easily disassembled (using the cap nut at the top) and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to keep it clean and wipe up wet spots on it to keep the finish nice.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice piece, not very fancy.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>Other than this one thing, it is a great prioduct.</li>
            <li>It looks great and is must heavier than I expected!</li>
            <li>and I have to spin the bottom to tighten the nut but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>This stand is a great options for those of you with the EJ DE89 or other chrome finished razors.</li>
            <li>The chrome finish is attractive and goes well with most razors (particularly well with other chrome plated razors).</li>
            <li>and I am confident it will stay as new for your lifespan!</li>
            <li>Nice but tends to rust and need you to clean it off a bit to much but for the price decent.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re just looking for something to keep your razor and brush up, it&#x27;s fine, but don&#x27;t expect it to keep looking pretty forever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be surprised if it costs more than $1 to make so the markup is huge.</li>
            <li>Not only was the most stylish in my opinion, but it was $100 to $200 cheaper</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a quick set of observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Gillette Super Speed razor fits on the stand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:I have used this daily for the last 4 years and it is holding up well, very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>and it was delivered quickly</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up a bunch of space and provides adequate space beneath the brush for air flow.</li>
            <li>i will super glue it (problem solved).</li>
            <li>It yellowed rather quickly</li>
            <li>I liked the stand but had to return it because it does not fit the Art of Shaving brush, otherwise it&#x27;s a nice stand.</li>
            <li>Cheap simple effective.</li>
            <li>Just recently however I have starting using the shave soap that is best when applied with a brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked alll over the net for a nice stand to put in my bathroom, and this fit my style.</li>
            <li>Pros: holds your razor and brush, super sturdy</li>
            <li>well (a Merkur for me), but I was looking for something a bit more steady.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to any fellow wetshaver. :)</li>
            <li>the right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand looks good, fits my razor and my brush with enough clearance to the bottom of the stand</li>
            <li>Now i look and feel like a professional shaver!! :)</li>
            <li>A little jury-rigging sometimes solved the problem but it may be worth measuring the shaft and razor head to be sure they will have a good seat.</li>
            <li>Has a clean look and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Other then that I like the weight of it, but it would be nice if it was more even, for the price paid.</li>
            <li>people have warned that not all brushes fit into this guy, but more than likely if your brush doesn&#x27;t fit by the handle you can hang it by the knot.</li>
            <li>Save your money on the more expensive ones and give this guy a try, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be more than pleased with it!</li>
            <li>The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued.</li>
            <li>It does a great job with most brushes and all razors, but my Art of Shaving brush does not fit into the slot for the brush, which causes me much sadness.</li>
            <li>Something like this probably cost less than 5 dollars to make but it does the trick and looks great.</li>
            <li>I bought a Parker silver handle silvertip badger brush ($59) and knew I needed a stand to dry it so it will keep in good working order.</li>
            <li>also good for assisting in keeping the razor dry</li>
            <li>Tall enough to fit most any razor, and I was so happy that multiple different sized brushes fit!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much fancier than I am!!</li>
            <li>own two full size badger brushes (and one travel size brush) and can report back that the popular Tweezerman Shave Brush fits perfectly, while my Art of Shaving brush that came part of a set (Sandalwood pre-shave oil, shaving cream, lotion, and brush with black handle ) does not fit.</li>
            <li>I hoped on here and saw this and figured if its half as good as what they were selling it would be a sound investment.</li>
            <li>And while I don&#x27;t have a safety razor right now, it does a perfectly adequate job holding my Mach 4 and Omega brush.</li>
            <li>The stand has a very good weight to it; in order for it to be knocked over, something would have to hit it fairly hard.  </li>
            <li>This stand works fine and, in my opinion, is priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wobble that much and stands just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it holds my double edge razor and brush which will  allow them to dry better in the upright position after i use them.</li>
            <li>It just wouldn&#x27;t fit the Parker pure badger brush I have.</li>
            <li>Great little stand to keep things organized.</li>
            <li>This is a great little piece.</li>
            <li>I have to say that his is a great little stand.  </li>
            <li>It works great, looks good and costs a lot less than other options.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy and looks great in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I am happy that it holds my razor and brush firmly and does not shift or wobble.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the investment and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would have still bought it because I think it is still worth the money</li>
            <li>every guest whom comes over always comments on how nice the stand looks on the shelf above our sink.</li>
            <li>This is a nice simple razor stand.  </li>
            <li>This Razor Stand is good quality and it gets wet and doesnt get affected by it either.</li>
            <li>Nice stand, well built, solid, doesn&#x27;t fall over.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal, since I didn&#x27;t buy it to hold the razor, but it would be nice if it did.</li>
            <li>I love the organization and classy looking display  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking stand</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if the razor/brush holders were a standard size and would fit mine.  </li>
            <li>worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, serves its function well, and is relatively inexpensive, but that&#x27;s all a matter of preference and perspective.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re going to use it, it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Chrome looks great and it is much heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li>A nice stand overall.  </li>
            <li>this was well worth the money</li>
            <li>Works as expected and it looks good.</li>
            <li>This is a nice stand that seems very solid.</li>
            <li>As I return to a straight safety razor I saved more money and since my blade are now so much cheaper than the cartridges I use to use...</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, but it would be nice to widen it 1mm or so to keep this from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of all the stand-like things I own, this is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li>I am using it to hold a Merkur Progress Adjustable Double Edge Safety Razor and the Parker 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Deluxe Olivewood Handle).  </li>
            <li>The razor stand portion is perfect, but the poor brush side and the fact that it loves to lose it&#x27;s chrome plating makes me dock it 2 stars.    </li>
            <li>feels solid and nicely compliments the Merkur.</li>
            <li>It has a nice solid feel with some heft to it that makes for a stable stand.</li>
            <li>Simple yet nice.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Looks nice if your on a budget grab it, if you could throw an extra $20 on a stand I would.  </li>
            <li>but so far it is ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li>Hopefully that will protect it good enough that I&#x27;ll get a couple years of service out of it, until I replace it with a stainless steel one.  </li>
            <li>I cry myself to sleep every night now, because I love it so much and can&#x27;t really use it often with the brush I like.</li>
            <li>do it because at $26 it is well worth the money</li>
            <li>Apart from being a bit wobbly, this thing will hold a DE and brush just fine, but chances are, you&#x27;re looking at this over other options because of how nice it looks.  </li>
            <li>I use the Shea Moisture shave brush (~$9 from Target) and it fits great; no problems with the handle being too large like other reviews.</li>
            <li>the Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle just fine!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I went back to the classic razor, refills are cheaper and I think a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful</li>
            <li>I tried to clean it off with a metal cleaner and managed to get rid of most of it except for a tiny brown spot.</li>
            <li>The head is average with nice plating and the whole look is industrial with a knurled knob/nut on top.  </li>
            <li>The stand holds my razor and brush well, weighted nicely and looks really nice, especially with my Merkur long handle razor and chrome brush.</li>
            <li>i decided on this Col.Conk version due to price and some good reviews.</li>
            <li>too surprising other brushes won&#x27;t work - not all brushes are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it just doesn&#x27;t look right.    </li>
            <li>The razor handle needs to be snuggly put in or it can fall right off as well.  </li>
            <li>It holds my stuff just right, but the chrome finish flakes off</li>
            <li>It has to be placed just right or it will fall off.</li>
            <li>just right.   </li>
            <li>Being a beginner, the price was right too.</li>
            <li>I hit it up with some automotive wax in the joints right when I got it just in case.</li>
            <li>and i have noticed that when it came to me it was a beautiful silver color and now it is more or a yellow/light gold in thought that this was a bit weird</li>
            <li>B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]], just sold by a different vendor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy accessory with clean lines.  </li>
            <li>This high quality stand meets my needs, but it is a squeeze to fit in my Proraso brand boar brush.</li>
            <li>From Tweezermans to my high end Badger brushes, they all seem to fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super easy thing to do to ensure that it looks nice for longer than usual.</li>
            <li>it is a very sturdy stand and looks really great if bought it less than a month ago</li>
            <li>If you have a small handled brush, this is a great stand.</li>
            <li>My brush didn&#x27;t fit normally</li>
            <li>Just wipe it down and it will be good for another couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still wipe down the fixtures between uses to keep them in good condition.</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a little bit more money for something  more durable.</li>
            <li>This is a very heavy well made stand and looks great in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Sure, one could easily knock it over if jostled or otherwise used in a manner other than intended.  </li>
            <li>There are several other stands for two to three times the price of this one, and I think this stand is as good or better.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well, received quickly.</li>
            <li>The stand is quite heavy though and my safety razor and brush fit nicely in it.</li>
            <li>and therefore I make sure to keep it clean &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>but I can remedy that myself with a quick mod.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and has a nice, simple design that matches a variety of razor types very well.  </li>
            <li>I have the tweezerman brush and have been able to balance it not by the handle (too wide to fit) but on the nose between handle and bristles.</li>
            <li>This stand looks great.on your sink,keeps your brush &amp; razor dry &amp; handy.</li>
            <li>Nice way to keep organized and dry.</li>
            <li>My brush doesn&#x27;t fit like a glove necessarily but it does fit and that is all that counts.</li>
            <li>The handle is black, and the chrome finish look good.</li>
            <li>Keeps a good quality brush &amp; razor conveniently stored and less susceptible to accidental damage.</li>
            <li>Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter.</li>
            <li>This stand has enough weight in the bottom that it&#x27;s very sturdy, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Despite getting splashed all the time, it has remained nice and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on the counter like my previous stand, made of stained wood, did.</li>
            <li>Be sure and read all of the other fine reviews for safety razor shaving items on Amazon.</li>
            <li>in all a pretty nice holder to dry out the badger brush.</li>
            <li>It holds them all very very well without tipping over.  </li>
            <li>I like this stand very much.</li>
            <li>It really does look great and it is much nicer than my previous stand.</li>
            <li>It is very nice and it has an initial impression of being fragile, but it actually is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>Maybe a little to soon for a good review</li>
            <li>But it does the job and looks good, a little weary of the listed issue w/pitting and flaking</li>
            <li>very sturdy is what it says it is and will last me very long, nice to whom who wants to have a nice looking stand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and clean looking, and my items fit well.</li>
            <li>And it seems as if it will last for many years.</li>
            <li>Its a safety razor and brush stand, hasn&#x27;t rusted and for something as simple as holding your razor and brush I can&#x27;t see spending more.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m taking my pogonology gear to the shop to make sure it all fits.</li>
            <li>I like it and its pretty hefty.</li>
            <li>This is my first razor stand.  </li>
            <li>I love this stand because it has a simple, yet eye-catching design.</li>
            <li>the first thing I noticed is that when placed on the counter or wherever you will place it, it is lopsided.</li>
            <li>They somehow lost the order and then most likely shipped it to someone else.  </li>
            <li>The stand is nice, but be careful if you are buying the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>First is that product origin is stated on web as US and it is not.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t anticipate this thing lasting more than a 5-7 years.</li>
            <li>My brush is larger than most others in the market</li>
            <li>Was reluctant to spend the money at first</li>
            <li>B003BHCAGQ stainless-steel version]], which also stands an inch higher.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This stand is pretty compatible with lost accesories I use mine all the time</li>
            <li>Well made and inexpensive compared to many similar stands out there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty hefty, and as you can see from the pictures, it holds</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is a smaller handled brush that will fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works exactly as designed.  </li>
            <li>Very simple, yet elegant design.</li>
            <li>given the price of this stand, and assuming you have a smaller brush, this is an ok unit.</li>
            <li>Buy the stand recommended for you brush there are many different brush handle sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have three brands of this type stand they all seem to be made exactly the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, why pay more because the box has a different name on it.</li>
            <li>Started to rust after the first year or so.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy as well.</li>
            <li>but something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li>So while it&#x27;s nice, you have to be careful that it fits.  </li>
            <li>very shining.&lt;br /&gt;i just recommended anyone who need to to stand on something the razor and the brush!</li>
            <li>(would look better with a chrome handled brush, which I&#x27;ll pick up when I wear out my current brush....)</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality.</li>
            <li>Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week.</li>
            <li>Keeps my razor and bursh ready to use!</li>
            <li>Definitely something that adds some class to the bathroom counter top, rather than detract or look cluttered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Not expensive compared to</li>
            <li>This stand does exactly what it should, holds my shaving brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li>He seemed to love it, i only gave it to him yesterday</li>
            <li>Bought this stand as an add-on to a full set of new shaving equipment.  </li>
            <li>My brush fits nicely on one side, the razor on the other.  </li>
            <li>Other than that....constructed nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice and inexpensive, looks sharp in chrome.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading the other reviews I was going to give it some time before I made my own rating</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true that the larger shave brushes won&#x27;t fit it very well-</li>
            <li>Considering the high price, however, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a great deal.  </li>
            <li>I currently have two brushes that I alternate between, a Tweezerman and a Simpson Special, and they both fit the brush holder just fine (one at a time, of course).</li>
            <li>Decent and economical stand with substantial weight.</li>
            <li>Most razors should fit without any problem but some brushes may not fit.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t modify the stand at all because the chrome would be ruined if I did, but overall it&#x27;s a very solid stand, and the price is quite fair.</li>
            <li>Has a nice heft to it and just looks flat out classy!</li>
            <li>Out of the box, it works good and looks good, but after a bit of time the finish on it gets really ugly with spots that will not come off with cleaning.</li>
            <li>It fit my other cheaper brush handles fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly if it fits your razor and brush, I only hope it stays in great condition for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not surprised by this as, like most things today, it&#x27;s built to a price point to maximize profit.</li>
            <li>SHIPPING AND HANDLING WAS PRETTY FAST.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quality shaving stand, and a pretty reasonable price, this is the stand for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but I would have liked to have just a tiny bit more room for the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clever design: simple and elegant.  </li>
            <li>I love it and have gotten tons of compliments from people who have gone in to use the bathroom and see it on my sink (kind of a weird thing to compliment right?</li>
            <li>Needs to be wiped down regularly to keep it from looking too dingy because of the bright chrome finish that shows grunge quickly.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it&#x27;ll hold the brush you have and intend on having for a long time!</li>
            <li>I just bought this a little while ago, but I love it!  </li>
            <li>and it does keep the razor and brush in better shape by letting them drain and dry.</li>
            <li>(I will be getting a better one soon) is also too small to fit in the stand.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it works and is very steady.  </li>
            <li>I was able to bend it back and now it looks normal again.  </li>
            <li>This works, hasnt rusted and keeps my razor safely immobilized and allows my brush to dry with the bristles hanging down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li>It cleans up easily with a damp towel, and has enough weight to keep it in one place when I am taking a razor or brush on and off of the stand.</li>
            <li>Only note, not all brushes will slide easily into the holder.  </li>
            <li>slight yellowing to the chrome, but its a nice stand for my Merkur 33c and boar brush.</li>
            <li>Large handled brushes will have to be hung where the hair meets the handle.  </li>
            <li>I have four badger brushes (an A of E large, an A of E travel, a Parker chrome and a Rooney Emillion 2) and this holder fits NONE of them.  </li>
            <li>B000K8FUFM Omega 13109 Creamy Curved Handle Pure Badger Shaving Brush]].  </li>
            <li>I have to have my brush facing a certain way in order for the butt of the brush to slide into the prongs.</li>
            <li>I understand that everything will rust if by water after a certain amount of time, but my Merkur DE shaver does not.</li>
            <li>Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand]]</li>
            <li>, IT HAS A VERY HIGH QUALITY CHROME STEEL.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>While it will be gentle on a counter top I would be careful with it sucking up moisture, take care to make sure the sink under it stays dry.</li>
            <li>Nice looking stand, but a little unstable.</li>
            <li>A nice addition to any sink to but a little pricey.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little shaving stand.</li>
            <li>It holds the razor and brush pretty high, so it can probably hold almost any length of brush/razor.</li>
            <li>Works well a convenient way to store your razor and brush easy to clean could be a little wider to hold the brush</li>
            <li>portion that holds the brush and razor are just a piece of flat metal that has been chromed, it&#x27;s flimsy and easily bent.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this stand if you want something that looks good, will last quite a long time, and won&#x27;t break your wallet.</li>
            <li>My only quibble is that my Art of Shaving Brush (which was a gift) doesn&#x27;t fit very well in the brush holder -</li>
            <li>Stand comes with a great polished finish and is a must have for the simple everyday DE shaving enthusiast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve replaced mine with a stainless steel model.</li>
            <li>If you search for razor stands, you&#x27;ll see that you can spend as much as you want on these things.  </li>
            <li>You could use this holder with a much longer handled razor if you wished.</li>
            <li>Its reasonable and convenient.</li>
            <li>It is very stable and serves its function.</li>
            <li>The whole stand can be washed in the sink if you need.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying a stainless steel version of this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also made in Taiwan rather than Red China, an important consideration for me.</li>
            <li>It is now VERY rusty in LOTS of spots and there are lots of pits in the chrome.  </li>
            <li>Connections secure w/ enough weight to keep from being pulled when accessing razor.  </li>
            <li>The shine has held up very well with minimum maintenance.</li>
            <li>The stand&#x27;s finish matches the Merkur&#x27;s razor very well.    </li>
            <li>It gets the job done well without taking up to much counter space.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not too much to say here.</li>
            <li>Add to that, it&#x27;s priced very inexpensively</li>
            <li>, it stands ready to hold my safety razor and soap brush at the ready.  </li>
            <li>It does what I got it for very well.    </li>
            <li>However, I keep a Mach 3 around for days when I need to shave but don&#x27;t have time to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Only gave it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t really fit my brush.  </li>
            <li>thanks for your prompt service also..</li>
            <li>If they would fix that I would really like this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When items like these come in pieces, packed cheaply, it really takes away from the product, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>, there is nothing else to really say about this product.</li>
            <li>High quality!</li>
            <li>My stand is in the bathroom rack and while I cannot do much about the ambient humidity, I do try to ensure that there are no water spots on it at all times.</li>
            <li>This has held up really well.</li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy stand&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>Stand is sturdy and compact; does make take up much space.</li>
            <li>Probably the most space-efficient way to store wet shaving materials.</li>
            <li>A bit of a warning though if you&#x27;re very picky...</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Does what it is suppose to very well.</li>
            <li>Elegant look to your wet shaving supplies.  </li>
            <li>It really ups the property value of my double-wide.  </li>
            <li>This stand does what it says, complements my shaver (Merkur 34c), and is a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but it will survive the occasional light bump that will happen in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I had to tweak the arms open with a set of pliers for it to fit.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very good-looking stand that does what it should, you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and shiney, proving it was made well.</li>
            <li>Not a whole lot more to say.</li>
            <li>Anything at or above 28 mm simply won&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li>Also, when I was traveling and wanted to disassemble the stand so that it would fit into my suitcase, I discovered that the entire thing is held together by a screw at the bottom, underneath the velvety material.</li>
            <li>it does the job of holding the razor and the brush but looses its looks fast.</li>
            <li>but some are through the stainless material.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I really like this holder.  </li>
            <li>This is a much better option than leaving a wet razor on the counter or in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>i would give it more if it had a wide brush slot.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and has a weight at the bottom</li>
            <li>no signs of rust still very shiny</li>
            <li>Some shaving brushes don&#x27;t fit well depending on their size and handle shape, but that&#x27;s probably a universal problem with stands.  </li>
            <li>this specific one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Skip it, wish I spent more or kept looking.....</li>
            <li>This is a a quality item and is really shiny and well plated, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li>but that does not matter much.</li>
            <li>If it ever breaks, I think I might try something else, but I really don&#x27;t have any issues with it.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I got my son a razor for Christmas alone with extra razor blades, dish and soap, kindle paper light , brush.</li>
            <li>Holds both very well.</li>
            <li>Just as I expected, stylish and affordable.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished, Col. Conk.</li>
            <li>It is not balanced and wobbles too much.</li>
            <li>very snazzy</li>
            <li>This stand is very functional.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really praise it</li>
            <li>:)  Not too flashy, solid construction, and great functionality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for about four months, and it really classes up my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Thanks much.</li>
            <li>the price, one can&#x27;t complain too much, but it does leave one wishing it&#x27;d be of sturdier construction.</li>
            <li>The only problem is this won&#x27;t fit my Parker Brush</li>
            <li>My roommate takes really steamy shores and it causes mildew sometimes in bathroom which then has to be cleaned up of course</li>
            <li>very sleek and holds my razor and brush for shaving.</li>
            <li>, it does not work with Art of Shaving brushes because the handle of the brush is too big and it doesn&#x27;t fit there .</li>
            <li>the stand is very duarable.</li>
            <li>Anytime I move the stand, the razor and brush fall off, if a gentle bump will send the equipment falling.</li>
            <li>Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors.</li>
            <li>You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li>Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much when I placed the order for this stand.</li>
            <li>Also the hangar tab plate that the brush and razor hang from is a lot thicker than it shows in the picture (maybe 2 or 3 times thicker) VERY sturdy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Doesnt fall over and it is really nich chrome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the brush holder has fit the different varieties my relatives have had through the years, some of their razors slipped through or would not balance sufficiently.</li>
            <li>So this stand was a must and very affordable too.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and works very well with my EJ razor and Tweezerman brush.  </li>
            <li>It does all these things very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>: nothing really...</li>
            <li>I found that it does not hold the razor very well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Its nothing fancy, but it does its job, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>If you shave like a real man, you need this product.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and very shiny.</li>
            <li>(the handle is too big to fit in it).</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the top is etched because if you need to pick it up with wet, soapy fingers, it won&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>I was looking at stands that cost two to three times as much as this one</li>
            <li>If getting the most from your dollar spent is your goal</li>
            <li>- Nice heavy feel&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This item is made of nice heavy chromed stainless steel.</li>
            <li>This is a very simple, chrome stand, with a knurled design, that actually coordinates nicely with my razors.    </li>
            <li>kinda heavy and looks nice on my sink.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li>Simple, classy, and elegant way to show off your razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>This universal stand works great, is heavy (that counts these days!), and is easy to simply &amp;#34;wipe polish&amp;#34; with a damp cloth or sponge.</li>
            <li>The reviews that say its only good for a few months is right.</li>
            <li>I have several razors and brushes, and so far the Wee Scot is the only one that doesn&#x27;t fit the stand (it&#x27;s very small, but an awesome brush).</li>
            <li>It stays pretty easily, which isn&#x27;t helpful considering that a wet brush and handle hang from it after use.  </li>
            <li>Most of the men in my life own a Colonel Conk Evernice (model 775) razor stand due to conscientious gifting from Christmas and birthdays ever since I gave my brother one a few years ago.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t to say that other brushes would fit appropriately, but if this side was slightly larger by just a hair, it would accommodate my brush.</li>
            <li>The old timers had it right a shaving brush and soap and a stand is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Since the original purchase, I bought another one as a Christmas present for my brother and he really likes it too.</li>
            <li>The thin metal part that holds the razor / brush could be a little beefier to make the overall package more attractive, but it functions just fine.</li>
            <li>It is a nice tall stand and can usually hold the brush by the handle, but for certain thicker handles (like the Semogue 620)</li>
            <li>Other than my satin Futur stand set, this is my favorite looking stand of all I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>Bargain priced versus many of the other options out there.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was suppose to put on the other side</li>
            <li>I thought at first this stand would be a cheap metal stand and not heavy enough to support my shaving brush and my safety razor.</li>
            <li>It came with the chrome chipped and bubbled but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>Fits my razor (Merkur) and brush (Tweezerman) perfectly, but there&#x27;s a distinct yellow tone to the chrome when compared to my razor, and after less than a year I started to get green corrosion spots.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a very large safety razor (Merkur Futur) and the handle is very large.  </li>
            <li>One of these days I&#x27;ll invest in a new brush that hopefully will fit better, but you&#x27;d think the brush holder would accommodate a wider span of commonly used brushes.</li>
            <li>Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor (also known as the Merkur 23C), and for that use it&#x27;s a fine stand.</li>
            <li>and it still has yet corrode, so I assume it is a decent stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany]] on it</li>
            <li>I occasionally disassemble it to clean the dust off</li>
            <li>Great product adds class to you bathroom and makes shaving eaiser no more fumbling around for your razor and brush all at the same place.  </li>
            <li>Simple and clean.</li>
            <li>Long Handled Razor and Tweezerman Badger Hair brush just fine</li>
            <li>This product was too small for my badger brush, which defeated the whole point of getting this kind of stand...</li>
            <li>Finding older, interesting safety razors on the other hand .....</li>
            <li>Its made of high quality and some real weight to the item.</li>
            <li>Very modern sleek and classy and fits well on my counter.</li>
            <li>I hang my Gillette Fusion on it just fine, but be aware that he Tweezerman shaving brush does not fit into it exactly as it should</li>
            <li>This is a good stand for a typical razor and smaller handled brush.</li>
            <li>recommendation: make sure you dry your shaving set  &amp;#34;DRY&amp;#34; before setting them on the stand and move the razor stand far from your faucet to avoid water damage.  </li>
            <li>You are not supposed to store brushes on their side or top because they do not dry properly.  </li>
            <li>This can be fixed, but no one should have to fix a product to make it function like it is supposed in the first place.</li>
            <li>Guess not a lot of people see these in a young guys bathroom though hahaha!)</li>
            <li>My first razor stand, I was surprised with its weight and sturdiness.</li>
            <li>Cool simple design.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful simplistic stand.</li>
            <li>hopefully i dont run into this, so far this stand is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>, it is kind of small and can not be adjusted.</li>
            <li>Its not a bad product, but it wont last forever.  </li>
            <li>If you have gotten your double edged shaving tools, it is very important to have a razor stand such as this to help care for your products.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I have to wipe it down way more often than my razor and brush handle</li>
            <li>- I need a new place to show it off!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any reason why it won&#x27;t stay perfectly new forever!</li>
            <li>: 8/2/2013 - I&#x27;m happy to report that the original stand has not really gotten any worse.</li>
            <li>The knurling makes it easy to move with a wet hand  </li>
            <li>I find that makes the brush and razor  more visible to my eye when I&#x27;m stumbling around half asleep.</li>
            <li>This razor stand serves quite well, and the slight upturn of the arms hold a brush and razor securely (assuming you aren&#x27;t shaking and waving it around!).</li>
            <li>So I am still able to use it, but it just looks odd hanging that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>main concern</li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>Probability being that it will most likely sit next to my sink.</li>
            <li>The main being that the razor I bought (Merkur 180) doesn&#x27;t quite \\&quot;fit\\&quot; onto that part of the stand.</li>
            <li>It just works&#x27; I am particularly fond of the fact that it&#x27;s so well balanced, removing the brush or razor doesn&#x27;t make it want to tip over.</li>
            <li>Jagger Rn6 Contemporary Chrome Plated Shaving Soap Bowl</li>
            <li>I had read reviews on several similar products and this one seemed to be the most well-liked.</li>
            <li>The stand has a decent heft to it.  </li>
            <li>All in all, decent price, steady, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like the classic chrome look as it matches my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stand is well made, good metal construction and heavy enough to do the job.</li>
            <li>Timeless, classic styling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m decently picky, and it works well.</li>
            <li>Sure, it feels heavy and its chromed and all, but the inside is still cheap pewter, and the other reviews here don&#x27;t exactly bode well for its longevity.</li>
            <li>then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
            <li>Overall compared to other far more expensive stands I think this is the best bang for the buck</li>
            <li>The stand is nice and appears to be durable, the only issue is the brush holder is not wide enough for my brush.</li>
            <li>I was a little bit worried because other reviewers experienced corrosion for this item.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I don&#x27;t really know what else to say, other than it does the job well and looks good doing it.</li>
            <li>Also - my brush (from The Body Shop) fit snugly when I first bought the brush, but the wood has since expanded slightly and no longer fits.</li>
            <li>would recommend this stand highly.</li>
            <li>but the chrome is just not that high of quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>that said, it&#x27;s seemingly high quality.</li>

            <li>Feels sturdy and high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended you get this item as a part of your shaving kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are more stylized models out there, laying flat as well as upright, and lots of different finish materials as well - in the end I am needing function and not trying to make a style statement with my shaving kit so this is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a fine product for retro wet shavers.</li>
            <li>As far as the brush side goes it does not hold a \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; Pure Badger brush like the brushes pictured are being held.</li>
            <li>This is an elegant little razor/brush stand for your bath.  </li>
            <li>Little wobbly on counter top.</li>

            <li>The stand does not fall over as it is, but a little more stability would be better.&lt;br</li>

            <li>razor fit with room to spare, letting the brush dry out in the open and secure on a holder vs just sitting on the handle base on the counter is perfect with this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps to keep my silver tip brush dry and clean.</li>
            <li>No machine marks or imperfections, its very shiny and the chrome plating is professional.</li>

            <li>Not shoddy.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is a universal holder and will hold pretty much all brushes and razors (even cartridge ones).</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll just put my razor away in the medicine cabinet like a normal person instead of using some shiny overpriced bauble.</li>
            <li>It is solid, heavy, and holds both my Merkur long handle Double edge and my tweezerman badger hair brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll spend a few bucks more on this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Worth the cost as it will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li>stand does not hold a brush by the handle, but by the knot, so it makes the stand top heavy and prone to falling over.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, its larger than it looks and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read more than a few reviews complaining that this stand is unstable.  </li>
            <li>While my badger brush sits in the holder fine (and it will due to the shape of brush handles which differ in diameter as they reach the top), my Mühle razor does not fit the holder.</li>
            <li>Not hard to figure out</li>
            <li>This allows the brush to air dry and keeps the razor in a safe position for the next use.  </li>
            <li>The entire upper portion of the unit feels like it is made of strong metal.</li>
            <li>Okay this was simple indulgence I could not live without.  </li>
            <li>It sits on the counter right next to the sink and often gets splashed with water, yet there is no sign of any rust.  </li>
            <li>Now the \\&quot;puck\\&quot; is very slightly preventing the metal plate from touching the counter surface.     </li>
            <li>My Edwin Jagger brush fits fine, and it is usually next to my Edwin Jagger DE89L or a Gillette Superspeed Red Tip.  </li>
            <li>The stand breaks down for easy packing during travels.</li>
            <li>May want to apply a wax, or other barrier to preserve a fuss free shine.</li>
            <li>I had reservations about buying this due to not knowing if my razor would fit.</li>

            <li>4 star, it functions as its supposed to; doesn&#x27;t do anything new.</li>
            <li>I got this for Christmas along with a new brush.  </li>
            <li>This stand coordinates well with my new and vintage styled DE razors (even the fat ones).</li>
            <li>He loves the new razor/brush holder.</li>
            <li>I wanted/needed a stand for my new safety-razor and brush setup.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost 2 years and it looks new.</li>
            <li>I am using this for my new brush and razor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New...</li>
            <li>For those who have used and looking for something new I would avoid this one.</li>
            <li>It still shines just like when it was new.</li>
            <li>Holds my tweezerman badger brush and Gillete NEW and SS with no problems.</li>
            <li>but this looks brand new</li>
            <li>still so I&#x27;m debating on purchasing the new stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Along with the stand I bought a new Parker Ivory handled brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll purchase a new brush.</li>
            <li>I pulled it out and quickly realized the majority of the weight was at the base (which is good!).</li>
            <li>Further, the opening for the razor will fit only the slenderest of handles...forget a Merkur HD, etc.  </li>
            <li>The chrome finish has a nice gloss, although I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s longevity, as I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>The stand looks nice and matches my Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor.</li>
            <li>really nicely and fits a few different brushes well.  </li>
            <li>I was very worried that I would not find a stand that could hold my brushed, stainless steel brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li>Nice and heavy material, not likely to tip.  </li>
            <li>The silver metallic look to it is very classy.    </li>
            <li>Was surprised at the high quality of this stand.</li>
            <li>Personally, with these features, I think any price under $1000 would be very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Very classy</li>
            <li>Very classy.</li>
            <li>Its very much the opposite.</li>
            <li>My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving, but I like to keep my counter clean and organized, so when I got all of my new supplies, naturally I got a stand for them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a stand problem per say, but just be aware that there are multiple brush handle sizes.  </li>
            <li>Now if only they had one that holds the modern cartridge razors my wife uses!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed all the reviews that say the opening is too small for most brushes.</li>
            <li>It holds most small and medium brushes as well.</li>
            <li>Feels pretty solid though.</li>
            <li>the chrome is well done,why pay more for the same design of the other brands</li>
            <li>First time DE razor user, so I went all out and bought the individual components one needs for a full-service shave.</li>
            <li>I could not find this in any of the local stores, seems harder to find the old style razors and razor blades as most people don&#x27;t use them anymore.</li>
            <li>and I an only image this is going to meet water as most of us would place this stand near our sinks.</li>
            <li>When i received the stand, it met my expectations and it is a good solid stand for my heavy silver brush and double edge razor.  </li>
            <li>but it is a little wobbly and tips over too easily.</li>
            <li>Excellent base design with decent waiting for the price.  </li>
            <li>The stand can be made to fit AOS with some slight spreading of the tangs.  </li>
            <li>Just as expected, came quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Given the low price and the nuisance, I didn&#x27;t bother returning it, but please be aware that this stand will not work properly with certain brushes.</li>
            <li>very well made stand, sturdy, Does not tarnish, cleans easily, Hooks do not bend easily and spring back to position if the stand is knocked over (which is difficult to do).</li>
            <li>It was a pretty flat finish for chrome</li>
            <li>Despite other reviews it does not hold my The Art of Shaving brush that comes with the The Art of Shaving Full Size Kit-Sandalwood  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046GEJY2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28.</li>
            <li>I am planning on purchasing a different stand that will hold my brush, Merkur, and my new Straight.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why this stand is important, it allows for the brush to hang dry and be stored properly.  </li>
            <li>when buying it was that the brush or the razor would not fit, but the Merkur 34C Razor fits just fine as does the Tweezerman Brush.</li>
            <li>When compared to other razor stands, the Colonel Conk 775 does exactly what it needs to at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>(SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger.)  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly preferable to keeping your shaving supplies simply lying on their sides on a bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li>The brush side had to be bent out a little bit to fit the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure to give it a simple wipe down every once in a while to avoid calcium build up from water splashes!</li>
            <li>I just recently migrated to the classic way of shaving and picked up this stand to hold my new razor and brush.  </li>
            <li>so I doubled down with the proglide for those special occassions.</li>
            <li>This does it&#x27;s job but needs to be wiped clean and dry on a regular basis to avoid permanent spots.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t fit and consequently this stand just holds my razor now, which is sort of a waste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Issues:  None so far.  </li>
            <li>Would it have killed either Colonel Conk or Amazon to indicate the maximum handle diameter that will fit?</li>
            <li>Results so far: NO Rust.</li>
            <li>So as far as one review to it being made of pewter</li>
            <li>As for brushes, I&#x27;ve had no trouble hanging brushes like the Tweeserman and Edwin Jagger badger brushes.</li>
            <li>Quality made of stainless steel that should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>Made my razor and brush purchase complete.</li>
            <li>B000CB8Q4Y Omega Professional Boar Hair Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li>i wish I could send it back, but to much time has elapsed since my purchase date.</li>
            <li>I really like the overall design of this unit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s chrome finish, and has a padded underside that has some sort of soft foam-like material.</li>
            <li>For an old safety razor,stand and brush, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this stand for about two weeks, and so far have had no problems.</li>
            <li>Together with merkur razor and brush makes a complete shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>This is metal folks, this is going to have water contact is damn near every day.</li>
            <li>Holds my DE razor and old shave brush.  </li>
            <li>Delightfully surprised by the heft, size, and sturdiness of this item.</li>
            <li>Very disappointing...don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li>5 star old school shave holder.</li>
            <li>As soon as I picked up the box, I was surprised at the weight...</li>
            <li>i was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.</li>
            <li>If you do that, you&#x27;ll also need an O-ring on the razor handle near the blades to keep the razor&#x27;s eliptical handle from turning sideways and falling out.  </li>
            <li>However, so far mine looks pristine.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly six months now, and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely a plus and well appreciated.</li>
            <li>So far, still looks shiny from day 1.</li>
            <li>So far no rust anywhere on it</li>
            <li>I have to recognize that my prejudice was deeply far away from truth.</li>
            <li>primary drawback is the width of the razor holder, which will not fit all models of razor.</li>
            <li>I bought my son two different safety razors for Christmas and he really loves them and how well they shave</li>
            <li>A solid construction that features a highely shiny metal look, seemlessly integrates with any modern bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can not speak of how it holds up, but so far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s already been some water that&#x27;s dripped on the base, and so far, no corrosion, but I&#x27;m going to try my best to wipe the water away so it doesn&#x27;t corrode!  </li>
            <li>Plus, shaving brushes last much longer and function a lot better if they dry while in an upside down rather than upright</li>
            <li>This includes both modern and vintage razors with handles of all lengths (I&#x27;ve used razors ranging from small vintage Gillette Tech razors and the Edwin Jagger DE89 to longer handled razors like the Gillette Super Adjustable &amp; Edwin Jagger Chatsworth).</li>
            <li>opening for blade is too wide and and you need to positon the handlejust right to let it stay....</li>
            <li>It can break down easily if you wanted to travel with it, but the aforementioned weight might be a problem.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re willing to take it apart and polish it every day, don&#x27;t expect it to look like the pictures for very long.</li>
            <li>Very nice,although too hard to keep shiny clean.</li>
            <li>However, upon arrival, the stand did not stand sturdily on its own, and often tipped due to an uneven bottom.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the actual stand is completely metal unlike the picture which appears to show two sections as white plastic.</li>
            <li>It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this order and just recentely purchased this same model, but in black.</li>
            <li>so it is probably not typical experience for everyone.</li>
            <li>In short, I would not recommend this particular brand and design.</li>
            <li>The chrome seems of decent quality, so I would expect it to last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is decently priced and appears solid.  </li>
            <li>The holding prongs on the top are a little thin but are working just fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty simply to keep clean by wiping it down with a dry cloth.</li>
            <li>The only odd thing was that it wouldn&#x27;t fit my fatter handled Art of shaving brush-</li>
            <li>Since I also use a shaving brush, I actually accomplished two things in one by having a way to let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>The black felt bleeds if it gets wet and stained my bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li>The base is waited to keep it from tipping over too easily, and it looks nice anywhere you put it.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by the weight and apparent quality of this stand.</li>
            <li>It holds a Gillette with a long handle and a shaving brush real well.  </li>
            <li>My brush must be bigger than normal.</li>
            <li>I bought this about a year ago, when I first started wet shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor.</li>
            <li>I like the stand, but it is a tight fit for my brush, which is not exorbitantly big or anything.</li>
            <li>Holds all of my brushes (WSP Baroness Silvertip, Semogue 1470, Parker Pure BAdger with Blue Wood Handle, Semogue Owners Club Boar Bristle and Semogue Owners Club 2 Band Badger) and all myu razors (Merkur 34c, Merkur 180 and Gillette 1956 Red Tip)</li>
            <li>It is a bit on the pricey side for being just a stand, but there were very few options available.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the other reviews I have not experienced any rust on it without doing anything more than wiping off a bit of soap rarely.</li>
            <li>Note that the brand new shininess is lost since watermarks are left after taking a steamy shower.  </li>
            <li>I was taken back a bit by the price, but it isn&#x27;t like I am going to have to buy a new stand again soon.    </li>
            <li>This is evidently a new product, because I looked all over the web for just such a product before ordering the stand version.</li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge&lt;br /&gt;Proraso</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for about a month now, and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li>After several months of use it still has the finish of a new item.</li>
            <li>This is really helpful with the brush, because it allows it to dry.  </li>
            <li>Hanging up your brush really helps it dry.  </li>
            <li>At least as a sort of beginner set, this stand is more than enough to satisfy.</li>
            <li>This model is an exact match for the extra long handled D/E Merker blade.  </li>
            <li>: if anything does go wrong I can buy 5 of these for the same price as one for $100.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: thie is Sept. 16th 2013: Brush &amp; razor stand is still holding up good.</li>
            <li>It feels very solid and has a very professional look.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any major issues with it.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it does exactly what you think a shave stand should do.  </li>
            <li>The razor didn&#x27;t fit until I stretched out the opening on the razor side slightly.  </li>
            <li>As a lazy dude, I do not wipe it clean.  </li>
            <li>In other words, the narrowest part of the brush handle is still too wide to fit between the prongs on the stand.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, heavy, well built stand that can be easily cleaned whenever it gets too dirty.</li>
            <li>For me this is little pricey but it was worth buying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels heavy and durable, wipes clean, and no sign of any rust after several months of use.  </li>
            <li>Second the brush holder is fairly narrow, it will only hold my brush by the top of the bristles instead of the handle, not a major deal but something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While there are more expensive duos out there, Colonel Conk&#x27;s option combines affordability with durability and high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>small still to fit in a smaller bathroom.</li>
            <li>Where either the manufacturer or Amazon falls far short is regarding the product specifications.</li>
            <li>Turned out to be much handier than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I think my old Mach 5 is jealous, so I keep it on a different shelf.  </li>
            <li>and it just looks so old school and fancy at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints so far and will be providing an update in the next 6 months or so.</li>
            <li>I fixed it with a simple modification.</li>
            <li>Now I have a complete set to last forever.</li>
            <li>in fact, it just barely gets on there.</li>
            <li>However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes.</li>
            <li>It came already assembled and it seems solid and well built so far.</li>
            <li>It looks okay but is a poorly designed product.</li>
            <li>Poor quality for something that just sits there most of the time and barely gets touched.  </li>
            <li>The razor balances precariously and the slightest bump sends the razor to the counter top or even worse, the floor.  </li>
            <li>The chrome shows water spots like crazy and now 3 years later its harder and harder to clean them off (to be fair</li>
            <li>Allows the razor and brush to dry and is ready to go the next time.</li>
            <li>so it takes up a bit more space on the sink but at least your brush stays dry</li>
            <li>While the razor stand is a little wide (Didnt fit an art of shaving one I got as a gift), I have no other complaints.</li>
            <li>The base of this stand is very stable so it is not easy to tip, also looks nice and easy to shine.</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s see how long it looks shiny and new..</li>
            <li>I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The felt on the bottom seems a bit flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t extend to the edge of the metal, but other than that it seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a razor hanging from the other side, so I was a bit worried about counter balance, but it hasn&#x27;t (and I don&#x27;t ever really see it)</li>
            <li>First and foremost the average shave brush is to big to use in this stand.</li>
            <li>had to send this back because the handle of my shaving brush was too thick to fit.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the stand has a sort of grippy rubber base to prevent it from rusting (most importantly) and to keep it from sliding around.</li>
            <li>Though it looks nice I find that this brand and model safety razor stand, with its uneven bottom - highest point of the bottom being the center, causing the stand to wobble in all directions - and badger brush arm lacking a width wide enough to hold even a standard sized brush, also lacks in practicality for ownership.  </li>
            <li>Since its new cannot comment on how long the finish will last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if your sink ever gets wet, but mine does, and I can easily see a bit of missed water causing this to rot off.    </li>
            <li>The only thing to note is that the middle pole screws into the bottom plate, which is hollow and filled with a black hockey puck shaped foam.</li>
            <li>shaving and buying cheap BIC throw away razors was a waste of money and never really shaved close enough.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m often pretty messy when it comes to getting soap or water on the counter and where I keep the stand itself.</li>
            <li>I was gonna deduct a star at first because my brush did not fit great.(likely</li>
            <li>My wife bought me an Art of Shaving Gift card for xmas and finally got around to using it, after pricing everything including stands I decided on a really good brush, unfortunately their stands like this started at 80 bucks!</li>
            <li>While its well built and heavy, the brush holder was not large enough to fit my art of shaving brush.</li>
            <li>In short, it dries everything I need to have dried after shaving and keeps it looking orderly, but not necessary clean do to the dry spots from the drip.</li>
            <li>First off I&#x27;m a black male with coarse hair and if you&#x27;re the same you can relate with hairs growing any and everyway but straight down...</li>
            <li>I purchased this stand about a year and a half ago and it has held up very well.</li>
            <li>It allows both the brush and the razor to air dry completely.</li>
            <li>; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>very minor quibble of mine is that it fits my brush VERY snugly, to the point that I worry I&#x27;m marring the finish of the shave brush handle by putting it in, and it&#x27;s not that wide of a brush</li>
            <li>It holds my Edwin Jagger DE89 razor very well and my Edwin Jagger brush although it&#x27;s a bit tight.  </li>
            <li>It is heavy enough to hold a razor and brush without tipping over if you aren&#x27;t super careful hanging up your man grooming equipment.</li>
            <li>The narrow side holds his razor and the large opening holds a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>If you have anything other than a small travel-sized brush, don&#x27;t expect it to fit properly.    </li>
            <li>I thought 15 bucks for it is a little much, and that&#x27;s why I might try something else.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very sturdy and with a little care should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, but the wobble makes it feel a little cheap.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> If not for that one problem I would have given this product a perfect 5 star rating.</li>

            <li> It makes the bathroom look nice, elegant and yet holds it&#x27;s function.</li>
            <li> Good quality construction, but it doesn&#x27;t quite fit my razor and badger brush.</li>
            <li> It is nice looking, sturdy and will undoubtedly hold up for many years.</li>
            <li> It looks nice on my sink top.  </li>
            <li> Hold both items securely and keeps them in good shape.</li>

            <li> I have a Merkur 34C, which is one of the most popular safety razors on the market.</li>
            <li> you know that chrome need to be polished and cleaned to look good, so I was expecting that, but not every brush will fit</li>
            <li> Good deal and the brush and razor fit on it without any problems.</li>
            <li> Fit the brush and razor easily and looks great.  </li>

            <li> Looks nice has nice weight to it to hold my brush and my razor.. will fit a merkur 38c &amp;#34; barber pole&amp;#34; and a parker brush</li>
            <li> but I would liked one more stylish and fancy.</li>
            <li> It just looks real nice and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stand has a beautiful and *very* shiny chrome finish.  </li>
            <li> It was great when it first arrived, but the color has gradually gotten a bit off.  </li>
            <li> A beautiful razor stand that will stand out in the modern man&#x27;s bathroom.  </li>
            <li> A fine quality stand that adds elegance to the counter!</li>
            <li> If it corrodes when stored in the bathroom, I will buy something else, but for now its fine!</li>
            <li> Super product!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best bases available and I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> Cleans easy and shines nice.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice addition to my bathroom and makes airing out my brush easy.</li>

            <li> Stand looks nice and holds my Merkur 34C HD razor just fine.  </li>
            <li> Works just fine and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush (both bought on Amazon) and it works great.</li>
            <li> Get this to proudly display your classic man grooming items!</li>
            <li> The shaving stand works wonderfully, with enough room to hold both brush and razor.  </li>
            <li> It holds my Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor and Tweezerman Shaving Brush perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Looks attractive and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space as a big/bulky electric shaver.</li>
            <li> So the brush was all I was able to get.</li>
            <li> Very well made, great quality.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t actually many options.</li>
            <li> :  After several weeks this stand has performed flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> MANY STANDS ARE GOING FOR 30 PLUS DOLLARS...</li>
            <li> IT IS STYLISH...    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Col. Conk stand for over 3 years now and am still pleased.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a stand that would hold both my safety razor and brush but most of them on amazon cost more than I&#x27;d like to spend.</li>
            <li> Of course my wife has more area than I.</li>
            <li> I am planning to buy 2 more for my sons.</li>
            <li> If you want a better stand its going to cost you around $100.00.</li>
            <li> The Colonel&#x27;s stand is a handsome looking stand that compliments any razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> I need it for function more than anything.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred something more non skid</li>
            <li> but I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the look of the stand.</li>
            <li> It holds and matches my Parker Double Edge Razor PERFECTLY as well as my Art of Shaving brush.</li>
            <li> more do you say about a stand?</li>
            <li> I unscrewed it to find even more rust.</li>
            <li> If the Colonel Conk Evernice fits your brush and razor, and most will, it presents an attractive and reasonably priced solution for keeping your shaving area neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> I was pleased upon opening the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stand is still serviceable and looks OK.</li>
            <li> If you used this on the sink it might hold up better, but in the shower there is no way.  </li>
            <li> for the money I had hoped for better.</li>
            <li> It should be better if the shaving brush side,   was a bit wider, so it can hold everytype of shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> and they fit nicely.  </li>
            <li> My husband has enjoyed his.</li>
            <li> The brush can not be hung by the handle like many others.  </li>
            <li> I have only had the stand for a week or two, but it&#x27;s working great for me!</li>
            <li> this adds to our bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> I tried fitting my Mach-3 razor on the razor part of the stand</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is more of a decoration to my bathroom than just a stand.</li>
            <li> Buy this stand, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great addition to my shaving collection!</li>
            <li> I looks elegant but will be useable for years to come.  </li>
            <li> Nothing feels more manly than displaying the tools you use to shave to your friends and family, and what better way to do that than on this shiny stand?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a good price for something that will look great and last - plus it matches my razor!</li>
            <li> For the price and &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; labelling, was expecting something a bit more substantive.</li>
            <li> Very durable stand and great chrome construction.</li>
            <li> What more do you want?</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d recommend you check the measurements against your brush just to be sure.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit their own product (brush).  </li>
            <li> (most noticeably on the knurled part of the stem).  </li>
            <li> The stand is perfect match in design with the Merkur 180 Steel Cross Hatching.</li>
            <li> More brown spots gradually appeared within a week.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I did-</li>
            <li> $25)which is a much better match</li>
            <li> Sure, it can hold your razor and brush, but it can also: Be used as a paperweight, even in hurricane winds, stop a bear with the power of a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick, make men admire you and make women love you because of your epically manly taste in shaving accessories.</li>
            <li> okay..</li>
            <li> but it sure seems it will hold up</li>
            <li> but I was hoping I&#x27;d be able to hang my Mach 3 razor from it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> BASICALLY BETTER PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> I love this stand.</li>
            <li> It is simple and not flamboyant and performs its purpose perfectly.</li>
            <li> This stand is great, it holds my razor really well.</li>
            <li> It keeps things more compact and off the counter.</li>
            <li> However, as a safety razor user for many years this is one of the lower quality</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> Why spend more money for something that sits in the bathroom?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for two years or more.</li>
            <li> My razors and brushes both fit nicely on it.</li>
            <li> got most of the spots off</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this razor stand for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Like many others, I just wanted a stand to hold my shaving tools, but most of them were way out of my budget.</li>
            <li> Keeps my brush and razor neatly stored on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> All the components feel &#x27;quality&#x27; to me and really looks great holding my Parker 99r and brush.</li>
            <li> But I still cant get the rust off the counter top.</li>
            <li> seems like the more</li>
            <li> I love the chrome finish.</li>
            <li> Im satisfied</li>
            <li> so i could hang the brush lower than from the top</li>
            <li> A wonderful item to classically display a safety razor and shave brush.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps 3 1/2 stars are more in order.</li>
            <li> So I have to set it on top of the opening, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> fit most brush handles, might have to hang it by the middle.&lt;br /&gt;-needs to be cleaned often to look nice</li>
            <li> I purchased many of these along with badger brushes, bowls and soap as gifts.</li>
            <li> It is solid and looks great by my sink!  </li>
            <li> I have read reviews talking about rusting stands and wobbling bases, I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li> Prevents water from degrading your brush and razor - a necessity, even more than quality aftershave or soap.</li>
            <li> This product is both elegant and well made.</li>
            <li> Now it looks more gold.  </li>
            <li> If I were to improve the design, I would put two more holders on it for another brush and razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m hooked for life, I am going to look for something a bit nicer and more durable.  </li>
            <li> This stand is reasonably priced, well constructed and makes an attractive, practical storage stand for razor &amp; brush.</li>
            <li> love the look of this in my bathroom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I remembered to order the stand.</li>
            <li> The forks should be longer and bent up more to hold the razor and brush on.</li>
            <li> Took a chance and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market</li>
            <li> it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week.</li>
            <li> Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss</li>
            <li> but I with it had more lather.</li>
            <li> I couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> i LOVE THIS FIXTURE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME MORE SPACE</li>
            <li> ON MY SINK TOP</li>
            <li> AND IS A SAFE WAY TO STORE MY RAZOR.</li>
            <li> No problems with tipping and aesthetically appealing.</li>
            <li> well built and seems like it will last a lifetime.. very happy with it and would recomend it</li>
            <li> will bring a sophisticated look to your counter and bathroom and women will love it.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this stand holding my Merkur Futur safety razor and shave brush.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t get a better looking stand for the money.</li>
            <li> what more can i expect?</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great quality</li>
            <li> My brush doesn&#x27;t fit nicely</li>
            <li> so I improvised and made it fit another way!</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work better for others</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor stand for the money.</li>
            <li> and I am still glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> The finish is very nicely done and the knurling matches very well with my Merkur HD.  </li>
            <li> Very nice looking &amp; keeps the brush &amp; razor ready for use.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This will certainly clean it up and leave a nice look for him.</li>
            <li> However it is a decent weight and the finish looks great.</li>
            <li> High quality and great value product.</li>
            <li> but it fit great with them good universal stand.</li>
            <li> It looks so beautiful and classy with my silver handle brush and my chrome</li>
            <li> I use a Merkur 180 long handle and it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fits my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Chrome with no blemishes so far.</li>
            <li> My first impression is good.  </li>
            <li> But, quality is pretty good</li>
            <li> Got this to go with my DE Merkur, and it looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> This holder works perfectly for my Merkur 180 long handle safety razor, and also for my brush.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality stand that does exactly what it is intended for. :D</li>
            <li> Looks nice and does the job...holds perfectly the Merkur Heavy Duty Edge Razo #34C and a brush...</li>
            <li> Great classic finish, should be able to fit your shaving needs.</li>
            <li> I use a Gillette Fusion razor and a standard, wooden-handle shaving brush, and both fit perfectly onto the stand.  </li>
            <li> It looks awesome in my bathroom and was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit actually.  </li>
            <li> my razor and my brush fit perfectly on it, and looking at the stand you&#x27;d think they were made by the same company!  </li>
            <li> 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle with Free Stand.  </li>
            <li> This stand is nice and solid and does the job at a great price.</li>
            <li> It looks good on my sink and so far the chrome has stayed nice.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure many others will fit in them.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean</li>
            <li> However, because the razor stand has a large opening, the Merkur Futur fit in it very nicely where the balance is in the handle of the razor.  </li>
            <li> It has been more than a year, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure the majority of the brushes will work fine.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice stand to display their shaving gear!</li>
            <li> but its been great so far.</li>
            <li> Fit&#x27;s my long handled Merkur and Tweezerman Brush perfectly with a bit of room to spare.</li>
            <li> should fit mostly all brushes and safty razors</li>
            <li> I had some cheap brushes before, but I got one that was actually pretty good</li>
            <li> I just wish the razor side fit a Gillette Fusion better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Check the measurements of your components to make sure they&#x27;ll fit before ordering.</li>
            <li> And most importantly....</li>
            <li> A perfect addition to any wet shaving set-up.</li>
            <li> Many reviews state that they fit</li>
            <li> This device is very shiny and has a good weight to it.  </li>
            <li> The stainless steel looks good on the bathroom counter too.</li>
            <li> Good quality is appreciated.</li>
            <li> If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, works and looks Great!</li>
            <li> It just kinda \\&quot;sits on\\&quot; the thing and will fall off easily.</li>
            <li> Tips and turns easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to screw together.</li>
            <li> This can be easily cleared up with some water and vinegar.</li>
            <li> Like any shiny metal drip spots will develop if water gets on it, but are easily wiped off.</li>
            <li> The Colonel Conk stand is minimalist attractive, quite heavy and keeps a good hold on the razor and brush.</li>
            <li> So, aside from not being able to use it currently, the stand is great.  </li>
            <li> Holds my razor and brush very well and looks nice on the vanity top.</li>
            <li> so the stand doesn&#x27;t tip over easily.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you clean it every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Love the clean organized look of this item.  </li>
            <li> Everything does unscrew for easy cleaning though.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re both easy to get to.  </li>
            <li> my husband uses this to store his safety razor and it helps to keep it safe and clean</li>
            <li> Colonel Conk stand easily accomodates a Merkur 180(23c) and VDH brush.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use stand..  </li>
            <li> It wipes off easily and I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while now without any complaints.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to see why people use</li>
            <li> This is a nice solid, good looking stand for your DE razor and brush.</li>
            <li> I strongly endorse this product.</li>
            <li> 4 months going strong.</li>
            <li> It is high quality and looks good.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to buy another one unless this one gets lost or my wife gets pissed at me and this is the nearest object to hurl in my general direction lol</li>
            <li> I am glad to report that it is true...</li>
            <li> but this stand is more of a nickel finish then a true chrome one.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to and looks nice.</li>
            <li> I thought it was kind of pricey at first, but now I know why.</li>
            <li> This looks great, has a nice weight to it and is WAY cheaper than any of the other comparable stands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want its plastic tears down playing the marvelous shine</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does its job in holding a razor and a brush and looked good new.  </li>
            <li> and it is still as good as new.</li>
            <li> It holds my Merkur DE razor just fine.</li>
            <li> and now even it fits just fine.</li>
            <li> I read that some people had issues with the brush holder, I use an Omega 63171 and the stand grips it fine by the handle, as designed.</li>
            <li> It holds the razor and the brush in a fine position for air drying.</li>
            <li> The razor side holds my razor fine, but the brush side won&#x27;t hold.  </li>
            <li> The razor does not like to hang perfectly perpendicular to the prongs but always at a slightly \\&quot;off\\&quot; angle.</li>
            <li> fits just fine in it.  </li>
            <li> My shaving brush fits just fine as well.    </li>
            <li> This colonel conk stand is beautiful and very functional as well as priced reasonably</li>
            <li> The chrome plating is doing fine on mine after 8 months of use,  </li>
            <li> It holds the razor just fine, but could stand to be 1/8&amp;#34; wider on the brush side.</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this fine product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chrome coloring makes it match well with most razors as well, so it&#x27;s pretty stylish.</li>
            <li> This works fine, does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> Holds my parker razor and horse hair shave brush just fine.</li>
            <li> Holds razor and brush just fine.</li>
            <li> This holds the brush just fine</li>
            <li> With those modifications to the stand and razor, it&#x27;s been working fine.</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> The side that holds the brush is fine, works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor side holds my merkel just fine though.  </li>
            <li> holds my gellitt pro glide razor just fine.</li>
            <li> No frills and holds my brush and razor fine.  </li>
            <li> , it is fine and it does work to suit my needs.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping it fits better when I get an EJ Super Badger.</li>
            <li> Looks good, steady, holds brush and razor well, reasonable price compared to many over priced ones that don&#x27;t look or work any better.</li>
            <li> It fits his Feather brand safety razor great, but would easily work for larger safety razors or even a cartridge razor.</li>
            <li> both fit fine.</li>
            <li> I have a Parker synthetic brush and it doesn&#x27;t fit the handle, however, fits just fine at the knot.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying this stand after reading some of the reviews, but it turned out to be perfect out of the box.</li>
            <li> Nice little piece, and great for storing the shaving accouterments.</li>
            <li> B0018OXOUA Kingsley Badger Shave Brush - White # 28]] and its a great fit.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months and it is holding up great and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic showcase for your double edged razor and brush combo - great way to class up your bathroom.</li>
            <li> That is IF THEY FIT.  </li>
            <li> I can get the brush to fit if I insert it where the bristles meet the handle, which does get the job done.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t tip over....very important.</li>
            <li> Merkur HD and Baxters shave brush fit well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too tall that it doesn&#x27;t fit in our medicine cabinet and has a disc of flexible foam on the bottom to give it stability.    </li>
            <li> I may replace this in the future to get him a fancy one from a specialty shop, but this works great and is a necessity for keeping his shaving stuff neat.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> Should fit almost any razor and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Deluxe Stainless Steel 4 Prong Safety Razor and Shave</li>
            <li> It looked great for a week or two, but by the third week it started to rust.  </li>
            <li> Even the cheap [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Great stand, low cost, what else do you want in a razor/brush stand?  </li>
            <li> It is solidly constructed and does a great job of just standing there displaying your shaving gear.     </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it&#x27;d be great for my Double edge safety razor</li>
            <li> The hooks fit my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It looks fantastic on the sink counter.  </li>
            <li> that I know it will fit longer ones as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This is very needed if you do this kind of shaving.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the cheap Van der Haggen set for 10 dollars, and the brush that comes with it won&#x27;t fit through the handle, so I have to place it between where the hairs and handle meet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and has not rusted a bit...</li>
            <li> Both my brush and DE razor fit with no problems.</li>
            <li> Very sleek and sturdy, looks nice on my bathroom counter-top.</li>
            <li> Over priced and cheap</li>
            <li> compared to the chrome of my razors and brushes, the chrome of this stand has a bit more of a golden tint to it.</li>
            <li> This thing looks great, but rusting is a definite problem.</li>
            <li> Style is important when I shave and it is important to my wife.  </li>
            <li> Escali badger hair brush hangs free and undisturbed.  </li>
            <li> All the while, my DE89 remained spot free.</li>

            <li> , I managed to grab it for $16 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> The skinny handles and travel brushes are the ones that fit.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Really nice stainless steel razor stand .</li>
            <li> fit well with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Great product, very solid, well balanced.</li>
            <li> The picture provided would lead one to believe, \\&quot;this instrument MAY be cheaply made with cheap  components\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Please note it does fit my Art of Shaving travel brush.  </li>
            <li> Razor fits snuggly and securely.</li>
            <li> Having a brush stand is an absolute must for maintaining a shaving brush and having the bracket for the razor as well helps keep things tidy.</li>
            <li> This is a well made and very functional product that is also nice looking.</li>
            <li> However, the majority of stands that I saw wouldn&#x27;t fit safety razors.  </li>
            <li> Honestly i did not expect much for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Great e-bayer, I look forward to our next exchange!</li>
            <li> My fault:many reviews said their brush wouldn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> and of course mine didn&#x27;t fit either.</li>
            <li> to keep it free of water marks and dust and the like.</li>
            <li> I have used this stand for just under a year, and found it very solid and attractive looking.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Handle of brush won&#x27;t fit in holder.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t fit my razor or my brush.</li>
            <li> It has held up well and really looks nice.</li>
            <li> Nice heft to to this stand and seems very well made for the price.</li>
            <li> It holds his razor perfectly however the slot for the brush is a bit narrow.  </li>
            <li> but overall it doesn&#x27;t rust and looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for a few years now and it still looks great!  </li>
            <li> I like the weighted bottom, the smooth chrome finish</li>
            <li> Nice modern look.  </li>
            <li> It fit my brush.  </li>
            <li> It fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> It is not some light weight junk product.</li>
            <li> and you could see theseveral light scratches across it.</li>
            <li> gp/product/B000053L6W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2several light scratches across it.</li>
            <li> this cheap</li>
            <li> Husband is very picky about his shaving things, however he was thrilled to get this stand.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if it was going to fit that, but for the price I risked it.</li>
            <li> So far so good, no rusting yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 months now, and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the good quality of this stand.  </li>
            <li> Good product so far.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Good for the price, but be sure that you have a smaller sized brush before you buy this.     </li>
            <li> /&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this stand and just ordered another one for a new razor and brush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the mach 3 razor too well, the balance isn&#x27;t quite right, but it manages ok</li>
            <li> Instead of hanging by the top of the handle, it rests right where the hair and handle meet.  </li>
            <li> I figure if you don&#x27;t use chemicals to clean it, it should be fine.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur 180 Long Safety Razor, and the Escali Pure Badger Brush fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> A little more hardiness and its pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever, but for the price it is very nice.</li>
            <li> But I have a very nice Vulfix shaving brush which only fits around the brush part - not around the handle.</li>
            <li> and it is easy to clean and keep clean</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, easy to use and most of all does not take too much space on the counter.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality stand at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> A quick wipe with a rag gets rid of it easily though.</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive holder for my new double edge razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> The long handled razor hangs great, with no clearance issues, and the texture of the stand matches the 180&#x27;s handle</li>
            <li> MANY STANDS HAVE HIGHER PRICE TAGS</li>
            <li> I explained the corrosion issue to her and she has agreed to replace the stand explaining that occasionally the plating process can be affected by dust or dirt on the metal prior to plating, I&#x27;m really happy that their customer service was good</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s true that not all brushes might fit.</li>
            <li> and if you can overlook these minor issues it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Completely worth it!</li>
            <li> Full size brush will fit I assume but a travel size like I got for my husband falls through the slot.  </li>
            <li> The travel size badger brush doesn&#x27;t fit, but the full size does and so does his razor.  </li>
            <li> Originally I had purchased it just to unclutter the counter-top, but this ended up being quite a bit nicer than I suspected.  </li>
            <li> Worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also too small for  my best badger brush from Art of Shaving...  </li>
            <li> and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure how stable this thing was gonna be, but</li>
            <li> This little guy sits proudly on my sink and keeps my brush and razor looking stylish and protected at all times.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts a good stand for the money, takes up little room on the counter, and holds the items nicely (though the Omega brush I bought it with has to be hung by the bristles</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty, holds his shaving gear wonderfully.</li>
            <li> As I am a  new returnee to DE shaving this stand is nicely affordable.</li>
            <li> it still looks nice and new.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, very stylish and well made, looks wonderful and is quite useful as well, the slot for the brush could stand to be a little bit bigger but other than that it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Clean and sleek looking for the Merkur razor that I purchased too.  </li>
            <li> Looks clean on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I use to keep my Double Edge Razor and Badger Brush in the bowl I use, but this cleans it up the counter top and looks nice.</li>
            <li> ..looks clean and sparkles..adds a touch of class to a drab countertop..</li>
            <li> After getting my husband a safety razor and a shaving kit, he wanted a way to dry his brush, and this works great.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish has stayed clean, and matches any bathroom decor.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, but it could be sized better, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> For the price, it looks clean and efficient.</li>
            <li> and I also clean it with soap and water every so often.</li>
            <li> This stand is clean, sturdy, and has not shown any rust or tarnish in my months with it.</li>
            <li> Extremely clean and bubble wrapped.</li>
            <li> This stand is clean looking and does its job.</li>
            <li> Color is slightly yellow but fit and finish is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Fusion Phantom Razor and Tweezerman shaving brush so that it they can air dry, and not clutter up my bathroom sink, and it worked out great.</li>
            <li> Looks clean and holds blade and brush with no problems.</li>
            <li> This looks great, is surprisingly heavy duty, and lets my brush air out nicely on top of everything.  </li>
            <li> and there is a speckling of rust spots, makes it have character but for those that like everything clean and shiny, this may be a problem.</li>
            <li> Great for the razor and soap brush to air dry</li>
            <li> This stand is all I need to hold my gear when I am not shaving, it allows my brush and razor to dry when I am not using them and looks great as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean &amp; just the right size &amp; weight.</li>
            <li> Fits my Rooney Style 2 Small Super Silvertip shaving brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit the badger brush I bought, but it was great for all the other stuff like how it looked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep an eye on it for any pitting (as a previous reviewer had experienced) but so far soo good.</li>
            <li> The price was right too!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li> Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li> Once it arrived I was right!</li>
            <li> , I use it daily and it stays clean and bright.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not an item that makes me super excited.</li>
            <li> Maybe if the razor side was angled up a little more, but mostly it&#x27;s because the body of the Mach 3 is kind of funky to begin with.</li>
            <li> It take minimal space &amp; looks great also.  </li>
            <li> Got this stand to complete my set and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked the chrome finish as soon as I saw it - as it goes well with my old Gillette razors.  </li>
            <li> Looks nice sitting on the counter - like and old barber shop look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly well made and solid, but it doesn&#x27;t sit quite level and wobbles a bit if you bump it.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy and stylish stand.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good stand for the money that you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Good looking stand, but my only issue was that the brush I have, a vulfix, does not sit well on the stand.</li>
            <li> The quality is good and solid.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this, as it really makes drying out the brush</li>
            <li> It looks cool and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Overall good stand though.</li>
            <li> Good solid construction.</li>
            <li> Seems ironic holding a cheap disposable razor with a chrome holder!</li>
            <li> I love the stainless construction.</li>
            <li> Overall good buy</li>
            <li> Still, not a bad purchase; might buy again.</li>
            <li> Everything fit great, and it was nice to let the brush hang the proper way and dry the way its supposed to between shaves.  </li>
            <li> Rusts pretty easy but sturdy</li>
            <li> but it comes apart pretty easily.</li>
            <li> But, to make up for those two problems, the entire thing can be easily disassembled (using the cap nut at the top) and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to keep it clean and wipe up wet spots on it to keep the finish nice.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice piece, not very fancy.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> Other than this one thing, it is a great prioduct.</li>
            <li> It looks great and is must heavier than I expected!</li>
            <li> and I have to spin the bottom to tighten the nut but other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> This stand is a great options for those of you with the EJ DE89 or other chrome finished razors.</li>
            <li> The chrome finish is attractive and goes well with most razors (particularly well with other chrome plated razors).</li>
            <li> and I am confident it will stay as new for your lifespan!</li>
            <li> Nice but tends to rust and need you to clean it off a bit to much but for the price decent.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just looking for something to keep your razor and brush up, it&#x27;s fine, but don&#x27;t expect it to keep looking pretty forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be surprised if it costs more than $1 to make so the markup is huge.</li>
            <li> Not only was the most stylish in my opinion, but it was $100 to $200 cheaper</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a quick set of observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Gillette Super Speed razor fits on the stand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:I have used this daily for the last 4 years and it is holding up well, very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> and it was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up a bunch of space and provides adequate space beneath the brush for air flow.</li>
            <li> i will super glue it (problem solved).</li>
            <li> It yellowed rather quickly</li>
            <li> I liked the stand but had to return it because it does not fit the Art of Shaving brush, otherwise it&#x27;s a nice stand.</li>
            <li> Cheap simple effective.</li>
            <li> Just recently however I have starting using the shave soap that is best when applied with a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked alll over the net for a nice stand to put in my bathroom, and this fit my style.</li>
            <li> Pros: holds your razor and brush, super sturdy</li>
            <li> well (a Merkur for me), but I was looking for something a bit more steady.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to any fellow wetshaver. :)</li>
            <li> the right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand looks good, fits my razor and my brush with enough clearance to the bottom of the stand</li>
            <li> Now i look and feel like a professional shaver!! :)</li>
            <li> A little jury-rigging sometimes solved the problem but it may be worth measuring the shaft and razor head to be sure they will have a good seat.</li>
            <li> Has a clean look and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Other then that I like the weight of it, but it would be nice if it was more even, for the price paid.</li>
            <li> people have warned that not all brushes fit into this guy, but more than likely if your brush doesn&#x27;t fit by the handle you can hang it by the knot.</li>
            <li> Save your money on the more expensive ones and give this guy a try, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be more than pleased with it!</li>
            <li> The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued.</li>
            <li> It does a great job with most brushes and all razors, but my Art of Shaving brush does not fit into the slot for the brush, which causes me much sadness.</li>
            <li> Something like this probably cost less than 5 dollars to make but it does the trick and looks great.</li>
            <li> I bought a Parker silver handle silvertip badger brush ($59) and knew I needed a stand to dry it so it will keep in good working order.</li>
            <li> also good for assisting in keeping the razor dry</li>
            <li> Tall enough to fit most any razor, and I was so happy that multiple different sized brushes fit!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much fancier than I am!!</li>
            <li> own two full size badger brushes (and one travel size brush) and can report back that the popular Tweezerman Shave Brush fits perfectly, while my Art of Shaving brush that came part of a set (Sandalwood pre-shave oil, shaving cream, lotion, and brush with black handle ) does not fit.</li>
            <li> I hoped on here and saw this and figured if its half as good as what they were selling it would be a sound investment.</li>
            <li> And while I don&#x27;t have a safety razor right now, it does a perfectly adequate job holding my Mach 4 and Omega brush.</li>
            <li> The stand has a very good weight to it; in order for it to be knocked over, something would have to hit it fairly hard.  </li>
            <li> This stand works fine and, in my opinion, is priced reasonably.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wobble that much and stands just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it holds my double edge razor and brush which will  allow them to dry better in the upright position after i use them.</li>
            <li> It just wouldn&#x27;t fit the Parker pure badger brush I have.</li>
            <li> Great little stand to keep things organized.</li>
            <li> This is a great little piece.</li>
            <li> I have to say that his is a great little stand.  </li>
            <li> It works great, looks good and costs a lot less than other options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and looks great in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I am happy that it holds my razor and brush firmly and does not shift or wobble.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would have still bought it because I think it is still worth the money</li>
            <li> every guest whom comes over always comments on how nice the stand looks on the shelf above our sink.</li>
            <li> This is a nice simple razor stand.  </li>
            <li> This Razor Stand is good quality and it gets wet and doesnt get affected by it either.</li>
            <li> Nice stand, well built, solid, doesn&#x27;t fall over.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal, since I didn&#x27;t buy it to hold the razor, but it would be nice if it did.</li>
            <li> I love the organization and classy looking display  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking stand</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if the razor/brush holders were a standard size and would fit mine.  </li>
            <li> worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, serves its function well, and is relatively inexpensive, but that&#x27;s all a matter of preference and perspective.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re going to use it, it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Chrome looks great and it is much heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> A nice stand overall.  </li>
            <li> this was well worth the money</li>
            <li> Works as expected and it looks good.</li>
            <li> This is a nice stand that seems very solid.</li>
            <li> As I return to a straight safety razor I saved more money and since my blade are now so much cheaper than the cartridges I use to use...</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, but it would be nice to widen it 1mm or so to keep this from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of all the stand-like things I own, this is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li> I am using it to hold a Merkur Progress Adjustable Double Edge Safety Razor and the Parker 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Deluxe Olivewood Handle).  </li>
            <li> The razor stand portion is perfect, but the poor brush side and the fact that it loves to lose it&#x27;s chrome plating makes me dock it 2 stars.    </li>
            <li> feels solid and nicely compliments the Merkur.</li>
            <li> It has a nice solid feel with some heft to it that makes for a stable stand.</li>
            <li> Simple yet nice.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Looks nice if your on a budget grab it, if you could throw an extra $20 on a stand I would.  </li>
            <li> but so far it is ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.</li>
            <li> Hopefully that will protect it good enough that I&#x27;ll get a couple years of service out of it, until I replace it with a stainless steel one.  </li>
            <li> I cry myself to sleep every night now, because I love it so much and can&#x27;t really use it often with the brush I like.</li>
            <li> do it because at $26 it is well worth the money</li>
            <li> Apart from being a bit wobbly, this thing will hold a DE and brush just fine, but chances are, you&#x27;re looking at this over other options because of how nice it looks.  </li>
            <li> I use the Shea Moisture shave brush (~$9 from Target) and it fits great; no problems with the handle being too large like other reviews.</li>
            <li> the Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle just fine!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I went back to the classic razor, refills are cheaper and I think a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful</li>
            <li> I tried to clean it off with a metal cleaner and managed to get rid of most of it except for a tiny brown spot.</li>
            <li> The head is average with nice plating and the whole look is industrial with a knurled knob/nut on top.  </li>
            <li> The stand holds my razor and brush well, weighted nicely and looks really nice, especially with my Merkur long handle razor and chrome brush.</li>
            <li> i decided on this Col.Conk version due to price and some good reviews.</li>
            <li> too surprising other brushes won&#x27;t work - not all brushes are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it just doesn&#x27;t look right.    </li>
            <li> The razor handle needs to be snuggly put in or it can fall right off as well.  </li>
            <li> It holds my stuff just right, but the chrome finish flakes off</li>
            <li> It has to be placed just right or it will fall off.</li>
            <li> just right.   </li>
            <li> Being a beginner, the price was right too.</li>
            <li> I hit it up with some automotive wax in the joints right when I got it just in case.</li>
            <li> and i have noticed that when it came to me it was a beautiful silver color and now it is more or a yellow/light gold in thought that this was a bit weird</li>
            <li> B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]], just sold by a different vendor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy accessory with clean lines.  </li>
            <li> This high quality stand meets my needs, but it is a squeeze to fit in my Proraso brand boar brush.</li>
            <li> From Tweezermans to my high end Badger brushes, they all seem to fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super easy thing to do to ensure that it looks nice for longer than usual.</li>
            <li> it is a very sturdy stand and looks really great if bought it less than a month ago</li>
            <li> If you have a small handled brush, this is a great stand.</li>
            <li> My brush didn&#x27;t fit normally</li>
            <li> Just wipe it down and it will be good for another couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still wipe down the fixtures between uses to keep them in good condition.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a little bit more money for something  more durable.</li>
            <li> This is a very heavy well made stand and looks great in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Sure, one could easily knock it over if jostled or otherwise used in a manner other than intended.  </li>
            <li> There are several other stands for two to three times the price of this one, and I think this stand is as good or better.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well, received quickly.</li>
            <li> The stand is quite heavy though and my safety razor and brush fit nicely in it.</li>
            <li> and therefore I make sure to keep it clean &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> but I can remedy that myself with a quick mod.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and has a nice, simple design that matches a variety of razor types very well.  </li>
            <li> I have the tweezerman brush and have been able to balance it not by the handle (too wide to fit) but on the nose between handle and bristles.</li>
            <li> This stand looks great.on your sink,keeps your brush &amp; razor dry &amp; handy.</li>
            <li> Nice way to keep organized and dry.</li>
            <li> My brush doesn&#x27;t fit like a glove necessarily but it does fit and that is all that counts.</li>
            <li> The handle is black, and the chrome finish look good.</li>
            <li> Keeps a good quality brush &amp; razor conveniently stored and less susceptible to accidental damage.</li>
            <li> Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter.</li>
            <li> This stand has enough weight in the bottom that it&#x27;s very sturdy, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Despite getting splashed all the time, it has remained nice and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on the counter like my previous stand, made of stained wood, did.</li>
            <li> Be sure and read all of the other fine reviews for safety razor shaving items on Amazon.</li>
            <li> in all a pretty nice holder to dry out the badger brush.</li>
            <li> It holds them all very very well without tipping over.  </li>
            <li> I like this stand very much.</li>
            <li> It really does look great and it is much nicer than my previous stand.</li>
            <li> It is very nice and it has an initial impression of being fragile, but it actually is pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little to soon for a good review</li>
            <li> But it does the job and looks good, a little weary of the listed issue w/pitting and flaking</li>
            <li> very sturdy is what it says it is and will last me very long, nice to whom who wants to have a nice looking stand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and clean looking, and my items fit well.</li>
            <li> And it seems as if it will last for many years.</li>
            <li> Its a safety razor and brush stand, hasn&#x27;t rusted and for something as simple as holding your razor and brush I can&#x27;t see spending more.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m taking my pogonology gear to the shop to make sure it all fits.</li>
            <li> I like it and its pretty hefty.</li>
            <li> This is my first razor stand.  </li>
            <li> I love this stand because it has a simple, yet eye-catching design.</li>
            <li> the first thing I noticed is that when placed on the counter or wherever you will place it, it is lopsided.</li>
            <li> They somehow lost the order and then most likely shipped it to someone else.  </li>
            <li> The stand is nice, but be careful if you are buying the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> First is that product origin is stated on web as US and it is not.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t anticipate this thing lasting more than a 5-7 years.</li>
            <li> My brush is larger than most others in the market</li>
            <li> Was reluctant to spend the money at first</li>
            <li> B003BHCAGQ stainless-steel version]], which also stands an inch higher.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This stand is pretty compatible with lost accesories I use mine all the time</li>
            <li> Well made and inexpensive compared to many similar stands out there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hefty, and as you can see from the pictures, it holds</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there is a smaller handled brush that will fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works exactly as designed.  </li>
            <li> Very simple, yet elegant design.</li>
            <li> given the price of this stand, and assuming you have a smaller brush, this is an ok unit.</li>
            <li> Buy the stand recommended for you brush there are many different brush handle sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have three brands of this type stand they all seem to be made exactly the same.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , why pay more because the box has a different name on it.</li>
            <li> Started to rust after the first year or so.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> but something to be aware of.  </li>
            <li> So while it&#x27;s nice, you have to be careful that it fits.  </li>
            <li> very shining.&lt;br /&gt;i just recommended anyone who need to to stand on something the razor and the brush!</li>
            <li> (would look better with a chrome handled brush, which I&#x27;ll pick up when I wear out my current brush....)</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality.</li>
            <li> Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week.</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor and bursh ready to use!</li>
            <li> Definitely something that adds some class to the bathroom counter top, rather than detract or look cluttered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Not expensive compared to</li>
            <li> This stand does exactly what it should, holds my shaving brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li> He seemed to love it, i only gave it to him yesterday</li>
            <li> Bought this stand as an add-on to a full set of new shaving equipment.  </li>
            <li> My brush fits nicely on one side, the razor on the other.  </li>
            <li> Other than that....constructed nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice and inexpensive, looks sharp in chrome.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the other reviews I was going to give it some time before I made my own rating</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s true that the larger shave brushes won&#x27;t fit it very well-</li>
            <li> Considering the high price, however, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a great deal.  </li>
            <li> I currently have two brushes that I alternate between, a Tweezerman and a Simpson Special, and they both fit the brush holder just fine (one at a time, of course).</li>
            <li> Decent and economical stand with substantial weight.</li>
            <li> Most razors should fit without any problem but some brushes may not fit.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t modify the stand at all because the chrome would be ruined if I did, but overall it&#x27;s a very solid stand, and the price is quite fair.</li>
            <li> Has a nice heft to it and just looks flat out classy!</li>
            <li> Out of the box, it works good and looks good, but after a bit of time the finish on it gets really ugly with spots that will not come off with cleaning.</li>
            <li> It fit my other cheaper brush handles fine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly if it fits your razor and brush, I only hope it stays in great condition for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not surprised by this as, like most things today, it&#x27;s built to a price point to maximize profit.</li>
            <li> SHIPPING AND HANDLING WAS PRETTY FAST.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quality shaving stand, and a pretty reasonable price, this is the stand for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but I would have liked to have just a tiny bit more room for the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clever design: simple and elegant.  </li>
            <li> I love it and have gotten tons of compliments from people who have gone in to use the bathroom and see it on my sink (kind of a weird thing to compliment right?</li>
            <li> Needs to be wiped down regularly to keep it from looking too dingy because of the bright chrome finish that shows grunge quickly.</li>
            <li> Just make sure it&#x27;ll hold the brush you have and intend on having for a long time!</li>
            <li> I just bought this a little while ago, but I love it!  </li>
            <li> and it does keep the razor and brush in better shape by letting them drain and dry.</li>
            <li> (I will be getting a better one soon) is also too small to fit in the stand.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it works and is very steady.  </li>
            <li> I was able to bend it back and now it looks normal again.  </li>
            <li> This works, hasnt rusted and keeps my razor safely immobilized and allows my brush to dry with the bristles hanging down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li> It cleans up easily with a damp towel, and has enough weight to keep it in one place when I am taking a razor or brush on and off of the stand.</li>
            <li> Only note, not all brushes will slide easily into the holder.  </li>
            <li> slight yellowing to the chrome, but its a nice stand for my Merkur 33c and boar brush.</li>
            <li> Large handled brushes will have to be hung where the hair meets the handle.  </li>
            <li> I have four badger brushes (an A of E large, an A of E travel, a Parker chrome and a Rooney Emillion 2) and this holder fits NONE of them.  </li>
            <li> B000K8FUFM Omega 13109 Creamy Curved Handle Pure Badger Shaving Brush]].  </li>
            <li> I have to have my brush facing a certain way in order for the butt of the brush to slide into the prongs.</li>
            <li> I understand that everything will rust if by water after a certain amount of time, but my Merkur DE shaver does not.</li>
            <li> Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand]]</li>
            <li> , IT HAS A VERY HIGH QUALITY CHROME STEEL.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> While it will be gentle on a counter top I would be careful with it sucking up moisture, take care to make sure the sink under it stays dry.</li>
            <li> Nice looking stand, but a little unstable.</li>
            <li> A nice addition to any sink to but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little shaving stand.</li>
            <li> It holds the razor and brush pretty high, so it can probably hold almost any length of brush/razor.</li>
            <li> Works well a convenient way to store your razor and brush easy to clean could be a little wider to hold the brush</li>
            <li> portion that holds the brush and razor are just a piece of flat metal that has been chromed, it&#x27;s flimsy and easily bent.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this stand if you want something that looks good, will last quite a long time, and won&#x27;t break your wallet.</li>
            <li> My only quibble is that my Art of Shaving Brush (which was a gift) doesn&#x27;t fit very well in the brush holder -</li>
            <li> Stand comes with a great polished finish and is a must have for the simple everyday DE shaving enthusiast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced mine with a stainless steel model.</li>
            <li> If you search for razor stands, you&#x27;ll see that you can spend as much as you want on these things.  </li>
            <li> You could use this holder with a much longer handled razor if you wished.</li>
            <li> Its reasonable and convenient.</li>
            <li> It is very stable and serves its function.</li>
            <li> The whole stand can be washed in the sink if you need.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying a stainless steel version of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also made in Taiwan rather than Red China, an important consideration for me.</li>
            <li> It is now VERY rusty in LOTS of spots and there are lots of pits in the chrome.  </li>
            <li> Connections secure w/ enough weight to keep from being pulled when accessing razor.  </li>
            <li> The shine has held up very well with minimum maintenance.</li>
            <li> The stand&#x27;s finish matches the Merkur&#x27;s razor very well.    </li>
            <li> It gets the job done well without taking up to much counter space.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not too much to say here.</li>
            <li> Add to that, it&#x27;s priced very inexpensively</li>
            <li> , it stands ready to hold my safety razor and soap brush at the ready.  </li>
            <li> It does what I got it for very well.    </li>
            <li> However, I keep a Mach 3 around for days when I need to shave but don&#x27;t have time to use a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Only gave it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t really fit my brush.  </li>
            <li> thanks for your prompt service also..</li>
            <li> If they would fix that I would really like this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When items like these come in pieces, packed cheaply, it really takes away from the product, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> , there is nothing else to really say about this product.</li>
            <li> High quality!</li>
            <li> My stand is in the bathroom rack and while I cannot do much about the ambient humidity, I do try to ensure that there are no water spots on it at all times.</li>
            <li> This has held up really well.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy stand&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> Stand is sturdy and compact; does make take up much space.</li>
            <li> Probably the most space-efficient way to store wet shaving materials.</li>
            <li> A bit of a warning though if you&#x27;re very picky...</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to very well.</li>
            <li> Elegant look to your wet shaving supplies.  </li>
            <li> It really ups the property value of my double-wide.  </li>
            <li> This stand does what it says, complements my shaver (Merkur 34c), and is a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> but it will survive the occasional light bump that will happen in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I had to tweak the arms open with a set of pliers for it to fit.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a very good-looking stand that does what it should, you&#x27;ve found it.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and shiney, proving it was made well.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot more to say.</li>
            <li> Anything at or above 28 mm simply won&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li> Also, when I was traveling and wanted to disassemble the stand so that it would fit into my suitcase, I discovered that the entire thing is held together by a screw at the bottom, underneath the velvety material.</li>
            <li> it does the job of holding the razor and the brush but looses its looks fast.</li>
            <li> but some are through the stainless material.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> I really like this holder.  </li>
            <li> This is a much better option than leaving a wet razor on the counter or in a drawer.  </li>
            <li> i would give it more if it had a wide brush slot.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and has a weight at the bottom</li>
            <li> no signs of rust still very shiny</li>
            <li> Some shaving brushes don&#x27;t fit well depending on their size and handle shape, but that&#x27;s probably a universal problem with stands.  </li>
            <li> this specific one is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Skip it, wish I spent more or kept looking.....</li>
            <li> This is a a quality item and is really shiny and well plated, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> but that does not matter much.</li>
            <li> If it ever breaks, I think I might try something else, but I really don&#x27;t have any issues with it.  </li>
            <li> I got this because I got my son a razor for Christmas alone with extra razor blades, dish and soap, kindle paper light , brush.</li>
            <li> Holds both very well.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected, stylish and affordable.</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished, Col. Conk.</li>
            <li> It is not balanced and wobbles too much.</li>
            <li> very snazzy</li>
            <li> This stand is very functional.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really praise it</li>
            <li> :)  Not too flashy, solid construction, and great functionality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about four months, and it really classes up my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Thanks much.</li>
            <li> the price, one can&#x27;t complain too much, but it does leave one wishing it&#x27;d be of sturdier construction.</li>
            <li> The only problem is this won&#x27;t fit my Parker Brush</li>
            <li> My roommate takes really steamy shores and it causes mildew sometimes in bathroom which then has to be cleaned up of course</li>
            <li> very sleek and holds my razor and brush for shaving.</li>
            <li> , it does not work with Art of Shaving brushes because the handle of the brush is too big and it doesn&#x27;t fit there .</li>
            <li> the stand is very duarable.</li>
            <li> Anytime I move the stand, the razor and brush fall off, if a gentle bump will send the equipment falling.</li>
            <li> Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors.</li>
            <li> You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li> Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I placed the order for this stand.</li>
            <li> Also the hangar tab plate that the brush and razor hang from is a lot thicker than it shows in the picture (maybe 2 or 3 times thicker) VERY sturdy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Doesnt fall over and it is really nich chrome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the brush holder has fit the different varieties my relatives have had through the years, some of their razors slipped through or would not balance sufficiently.</li>
            <li> So this stand was a must and very affordable too.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and works very well with my EJ razor and Tweezerman brush.  </li>
            <li> It does all these things very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> : nothing really...</li>
            <li> I found that it does not hold the razor very well.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Its nothing fancy, but it does its job, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> If you shave like a real man, you need this product.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and very shiny.</li>
            <li> (the handle is too big to fit in it).</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the top is etched because if you need to pick it up with wet, soapy fingers, it won&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> I was looking at stands that cost two to three times as much as this one</li>
            <li> If getting the most from your dollar spent is your goal</li>
            <li> - Nice heavy feel&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This item is made of nice heavy chromed stainless steel.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple, chrome stand, with a knurled design, that actually coordinates nicely with my razors.    </li>
            <li> kinda heavy and looks nice on my sink.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy.</li>
            <li> Simple, classy, and elegant way to show off your razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> This universal stand works great, is heavy (that counts these days!), and is easy to simply &amp;#34;wipe polish&amp;#34; with a damp cloth or sponge.</li>
            <li> The reviews that say its only good for a few months is right.</li>
            <li> I have several razors and brushes, and so far the Wee Scot is the only one that doesn&#x27;t fit the stand (it&#x27;s very small, but an awesome brush).</li>
            <li> It stays pretty easily, which isn&#x27;t helpful considering that a wet brush and handle hang from it after use.  </li>
            <li> Most of the men in my life own a Colonel Conk Evernice (model 775) razor stand due to conscientious gifting from Christmas and birthdays ever since I gave my brother one a few years ago.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t to say that other brushes would fit appropriately, but if this side was slightly larger by just a hair, it would accommodate my brush.</li>
            <li> The old timers had it right a shaving brush and soap and a stand is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Since the original purchase, I bought another one as a Christmas present for my brother and he really likes it too.</li>
            <li> The thin metal part that holds the razor / brush could be a little beefier to make the overall package more attractive, but it functions just fine.</li>
            <li> It is a nice tall stand and can usually hold the brush by the handle, but for certain thicker handles (like the Semogue 620)</li>
            <li> Other than my satin Futur stand set, this is my favorite looking stand of all I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> Bargain priced versus many of the other options out there.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was suppose to put on the other side</li>
            <li> I thought at first this stand would be a cheap metal stand and not heavy enough to support my shaving brush and my safety razor.</li>
            <li> It came with the chrome chipped and bubbled but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li> Fits my razor (Merkur) and brush (Tweezerman) perfectly, but there&#x27;s a distinct yellow tone to the chrome when compared to my razor, and after less than a year I started to get green corrosion spots.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a very large safety razor (Merkur Futur) and the handle is very large.  </li>
            <li> One of these days I&#x27;ll invest in a new brush that hopefully will fit better, but you&#x27;d think the brush holder would accommodate a wider span of commonly used brushes.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor (also known as the Merkur 23C), and for that use it&#x27;s a fine stand.</li>
            <li> and it still has yet corrode, so I assume it is a decent stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany]] on it</li>
            <li> I occasionally disassemble it to clean the dust off</li>
            <li> Great product adds class to you bathroom and makes shaving eaiser no more fumbling around for your razor and brush all at the same place.  </li>
            <li> Simple and clean.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Razor and Tweezerman Badger Hair brush just fine</li>
            <li> This product was too small for my badger brush, which defeated the whole point of getting this kind of stand...</li>
            <li> Finding older, interesting safety razors on the other hand .....</li>
            <li> Its made of high quality and some real weight to the item.</li>
            <li> Very modern sleek and classy and fits well on my counter.</li>
            <li> I hang my Gillette Fusion on it just fine, but be aware that he Tweezerman shaving brush does not fit into it exactly as it should</li>
            <li> This is a good stand for a typical razor and smaller handled brush.</li>
            <li> recommendation: make sure you dry your shaving set  &amp;#34;DRY&amp;#34; before setting them on the stand and move the razor stand far from your faucet to avoid water damage.  </li>
            <li> You are not supposed to store brushes on their side or top because they do not dry properly.  </li>
            <li> This can be fixed, but no one should have to fix a product to make it function like it is supposed in the first place.</li>
            <li> Guess not a lot of people see these in a young guys bathroom though hahaha!)</li>
            <li> My first razor stand, I was surprised with its weight and sturdiness.</li>
            <li> Cool simple design.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful simplistic stand.</li>
            <li> hopefully i dont run into this, so far this stand is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> , it is kind of small and can not be adjusted.</li>
            <li> Its not a bad product, but it wont last forever.  </li>
            <li> If you have gotten your double edged shaving tools, it is very important to have a razor stand such as this to help care for your products.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have to wipe it down way more often than my razor and brush handle</li>
            <li> - I need a new place to show it off!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any reason why it won&#x27;t stay perfectly new forever!</li>
            <li> : 8/2/2013 - I&#x27;m happy to report that the original stand has not really gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> The knurling makes it easy to move with a wet hand  </li>
            <li> I find that makes the brush and razor  more visible to my eye when I&#x27;m stumbling around half asleep.</li>
            <li> This razor stand serves quite well, and the slight upturn of the arms hold a brush and razor securely (assuming you aren&#x27;t shaking and waving it around!).</li>
            <li> So I am still able to use it, but it just looks odd hanging that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> main concern</li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> Probability being that it will most likely sit next to my sink.</li>
            <li> The main being that the razor I bought (Merkur 180) doesn&#x27;t quite \\&quot;fit\\&quot; onto that part of the stand.</li>
            <li> It just works&#x27; I am particularly fond of the fact that it&#x27;s so well balanced, removing the brush or razor doesn&#x27;t make it want to tip over.</li>
            <li> Jagger Rn6 Contemporary Chrome Plated Shaving Soap Bowl</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on several similar products and this one seemed to be the most well-liked.</li>
            <li> The stand has a decent heft to it.  </li>
            <li> All in all, decent price, steady, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the classic chrome look as it matches my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stand is well made, good metal construction and heavy enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> Timeless, classic styling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m decently picky, and it works well.</li>
            <li> Sure, it feels heavy and its chromed and all, but the inside is still cheap pewter, and the other reviews here don&#x27;t exactly bode well for its longevity.</li>
            <li> then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
            <li> Overall compared to other far more expensive stands I think this is the best bang for the buck</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and appears to be durable, the only issue is the brush holder is not wide enough for my brush.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried because other reviewers experienced corrosion for this item.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I don&#x27;t really know what else to say, other than it does the job well and looks good doing it.</li>
            <li> Also - my brush (from The Body Shop) fit snugly when I first bought the brush, but the wood has since expanded slightly and no longer fits.</li>
            <li> would recommend this stand highly.</li>
            <li> but the chrome is just not that high of quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> that said, it&#x27;s seemingly high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I appreciate those that think the quality is high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this stand for anyone Shaves with a safety razor</li>
            <li> If you are using shaving brush for shave, this is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Feels sturdy and high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended you get this item as a part of your shaving kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are more stylized models out there, laying flat as well as upright, and lots of different finish materials as well - in the end I am needing function and not trying to make a style statement with my shaving kit so this is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a fine product for retro wet shavers.</li>
            <li> As far as the brush side goes it does not hold a \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; Pure Badger brush like the brushes pictured are being held.</li>
            <li> This is an elegant little razor/brush stand for your bath.  </li>
            <li> Little wobbly on counter top.</li>
            <li> Wish it would look better for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> The stand does not fall over as it is, but a little more stability would be better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, attractive, and subtle.</li>
            <li> razor fit with room to spare, letting the brush dry out in the open and secure on a holder vs just sitting on the handle base on the counter is perfect with this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps to keep my silver tip brush dry and clean.</li>
            <li> No machine marks or imperfections, its very shiny and the chrome plating is professional.</li>
            <li> I really like this stand so far.</li>
            <li> Not shoddy.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is a universal holder and will hold pretty much all brushes and razors (even cartridge ones).</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just put my razor away in the medicine cabinet like a normal person instead of using some shiny overpriced bauble.</li>
            <li> It is solid, heavy, and holds both my Merkur long handle Double edge and my tweezerman badger hair brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll spend a few bucks more on this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Worth the cost as it will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> stand does not hold a brush by the handle, but by the knot, so it makes the stand top heavy and prone to falling over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, its larger than it looks and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read more than a few reviews complaining that this stand is unstable.  </li>
            <li> While my badger brush sits in the holder fine (and it will due to the shape of brush handles which differ in diameter as they reach the top), my Mühle razor does not fit the holder.</li>
            <li> Not hard to figure out</li>
            <li> This allows the brush to air dry and keeps the razor in a safe position for the next use.  </li>
            <li> The entire upper portion of the unit feels like it is made of strong metal.</li>
            <li> Okay this was simple indulgence I could not live without.  </li>
            <li> It sits on the counter right next to the sink and often gets splashed with water, yet there is no sign of any rust.  </li>
            <li> Now the \\&quot;puck\\&quot; is very slightly preventing the metal plate from touching the counter surface.     </li>
            <li> My Edwin Jagger brush fits fine, and it is usually next to my Edwin Jagger DE89L or a Gillette Superspeed Red Tip.  </li>
            <li> The stand breaks down for easy packing during travels.</li>
            <li> May want to apply a wax, or other barrier to preserve a fuss free shine.</li>
            <li> I had reservations about buying this due to not knowing if my razor would fit.</li>
            <li> Nice, solid little stand.  </li>
            <li> Where I live at</li>
            <li> 4 star, it functions as its supposed to; doesn&#x27;t do anything new.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas along with a new brush.  </li>
            <li> This stand coordinates well with my new and vintage styled DE razors (even the fat ones).</li>
            <li> He loves the new razor/brush holder.</li>
            <li> I wanted/needed a stand for my new safety-razor and brush setup.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost 2 years and it looks new.</li>
            <li> I am using this for my new brush and razor.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Shaving Soap, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 5.2 oz (150 ml), New...</li>
            <li> For those who have used and looking for something new I would avoid this one.</li>
            <li> It still shines just like when it was new.</li>
            <li> Holds my tweezerman badger brush and Gillete NEW and SS with no problems.</li>
            <li> but this looks brand new</li>
            <li> still so I&#x27;m debating on purchasing the new stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Along with the stand I bought a new Parker Ivory handled brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll purchase a new brush.</li>
            <li> I pulled it out and quickly realized the majority of the weight was at the base (which is good!).</li>
            <li> Further, the opening for the razor will fit only the slenderest of handles...forget a Merkur HD, etc.  </li>
            <li> The chrome finish has a nice gloss, although I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s longevity, as I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The stand looks nice and matches my Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor.</li>
            <li> really nicely and fits a few different brushes well.  </li>
            <li> I was very worried that I would not find a stand that could hold my brushed, stainless steel brush and safety razor.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy material, not likely to tip.  </li>
            <li> The silver metallic look to it is very classy.    </li>
            <li> Was surprised at the high quality of this stand.</li>
            <li> Personally, with these features, I think any price under $1000 would be very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Very classy</li>
            <li> Very classy.</li>
            <li> Its very much the opposite.</li>
            <li> My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> My wife is very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving, but I like to keep my counter clean and organized, so when I got all of my new supplies, naturally I got a stand for them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a stand problem per say, but just be aware that there are multiple brush handle sizes.  </li>
            <li> Now if only they had one that holds the modern cartridge razors my wife uses!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed all the reviews that say the opening is too small for most brushes.</li>
            <li> It holds most small and medium brushes as well.</li>
            <li> Feels pretty solid though.</li>
            <li> the chrome is well done,why pay more for the same design of the other brands</li>
            <li> First time DE razor user, so I went all out and bought the individual components one needs for a full-service shave.</li>
            <li> I could not find this in any of the local stores, seems harder to find the old style razors and razor blades as most people don&#x27;t use them anymore.</li>
            <li> and I an only image this is going to meet water as most of us would place this stand near our sinks.</li>
            <li> When i received the stand, it met my expectations and it is a good solid stand for my heavy silver brush and double edge razor.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little wobbly and tips over too easily.</li>
            <li> Excellent base design with decent waiting for the price.  </li>
            <li> The stand can be made to fit AOS with some slight spreading of the tangs.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected, came quickly and well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Given the low price and the nuisance, I didn&#x27;t bother returning it, but please be aware that this stand will not work properly with certain brushes.</li>
            <li> very well made stand, sturdy, Does not tarnish, cleans easily, Hooks do not bend easily and spring back to position if the stand is knocked over (which is difficult to do).</li>
            <li> It was a pretty flat finish for chrome</li>
            <li> Despite other reviews it does not hold my The Art of Shaving brush that comes with the The Art of Shaving Full Size Kit-Sandalwood  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046GEJY2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28.</li>
            <li> I am planning on purchasing a different stand that will hold my brush, Merkur, and my new Straight.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why this stand is important, it allows for the brush to hang dry and be stored properly.  </li>
            <li> when buying it was that the brush or the razor would not fit, but the Merkur 34C Razor fits just fine as does the Tweezerman Brush.</li>
            <li> When compared to other razor stands, the Colonel Conk 775 does exactly what it needs to at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> (SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger.)  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly preferable to keeping your shaving supplies simply lying on their sides on a bathroom shelf.</li>
            <li> The brush side had to be bent out a little bit to fit the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure to give it a simple wipe down every once in a while to avoid calcium build up from water splashes!</li>
            <li> I just recently migrated to the classic way of shaving and picked up this stand to hold my new razor and brush.  </li>
            <li> so I doubled down with the proglide for those special occassions.</li>
            <li> This does it&#x27;s job but needs to be wiped clean and dry on a regular basis to avoid permanent spots.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t fit and consequently this stand just holds my razor now, which is sort of a waste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Issues:  None so far.  </li>
            <li> Would it have killed either Colonel Conk or Amazon to indicate the maximum handle diameter that will fit?</li>
            <li> Results so far: NO Rust.</li>
            <li> So as far as one review to it being made of pewter</li>
            <li> As for brushes, I&#x27;ve had no trouble hanging brushes like the Tweeserman and Edwin Jagger badger brushes.</li>
            <li> Quality made of stainless steel that should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Made my razor and brush purchase complete.</li>
            <li> B000CB8Q4Y Omega Professional Boar Hair Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li> i wish I could send it back, but to much time has elapsed since my purchase date.</li>
            <li> I really like the overall design of this unit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s chrome finish, and has a padded underside that has some sort of soft foam-like material.</li>
            <li> For an old safety razor,stand and brush, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for about two weeks, and so far have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Together with merkur razor and brush makes a complete shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> This is metal folks, this is going to have water contact is damn near every day.</li>
            <li> Holds my DE razor and old shave brush.  </li>
            <li> Delightfully surprised by the heft, size, and sturdiness of this item.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> 5 star old school shave holder.</li>
            <li> As soon as I picked up the box, I was surprised at the weight...</li>
            <li> i was pleasantly surprised when it arrived.</li>
            <li> If you do that, you&#x27;ll also need an O-ring on the razor handle near the blades to keep the razor&#x27;s eliptical handle from turning sideways and falling out.  </li>
            <li> However, so far mine looks pristine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly six months now, and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a plus and well appreciated.</li>
            <li> So far, still looks shiny from day 1.</li>
            <li> So far no rust anywhere on it</li>
            <li> I have to recognize that my prejudice was deeply far away from truth.</li>
            <li> primary drawback is the width of the razor holder, which will not fit all models of razor.</li>
            <li> I bought my son two different safety razors for Christmas and he really loves them and how well they shave</li>
            <li> A solid construction that features a highely shiny metal look, seemlessly integrates with any modern bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can not speak of how it holds up, but so far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s already been some water that&#x27;s dripped on the base, and so far, no corrosion, but I&#x27;m going to try my best to wipe the water away so it doesn&#x27;t corrode!  </li>
            <li> Plus, shaving brushes last much longer and function a lot better if they dry while in an upside down rather than upright</li>
            <li> This includes both modern and vintage razors with handles of all lengths (I&#x27;ve used razors ranging from small vintage Gillette Tech razors and the Edwin Jagger DE89 to longer handled razors like the Gillette Super Adjustable &amp; Edwin Jagger Chatsworth).</li>
            <li> opening for blade is too wide and and you need to positon the handlejust right to let it stay....</li>
            <li> It can break down easily if you wanted to travel with it, but the aforementioned weight might be a problem.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re willing to take it apart and polish it every day, don&#x27;t expect it to look like the pictures for very long.</li>
            <li> Very nice,although too hard to keep shiny clean.</li>
            <li> However, upon arrival, the stand did not stand sturdily on its own, and often tipped due to an uneven bottom.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the actual stand is completely metal unlike the picture which appears to show two sections as white plastic.</li>
            <li> It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this order and just recentely purchased this same model, but in black.</li>
            <li> so it is probably not typical experience for everyone.</li>
            <li> In short, I would not recommend this particular brand and design.</li>
            <li> The chrome seems of decent quality, so I would expect it to last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is decently priced and appears solid.  </li>
            <li> The holding prongs on the top are a little thin but are working just fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty simply to keep clean by wiping it down with a dry cloth.</li>
            <li> The only odd thing was that it wouldn&#x27;t fit my fatter handled Art of shaving brush-</li>
            <li> Since I also use a shaving brush, I actually accomplished two things in one by having a way to let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> The black felt bleeds if it gets wet and stained my bathroom counter top.</li>
            <li> The base is waited to keep it from tipping over too easily, and it looks nice anywhere you put it.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by the weight and apparent quality of this stand.</li>
            <li> It holds a Gillette with a long handle and a shaving brush real well.  </li>
            <li> My brush must be bigger than normal.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago, when I first started wet shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor.</li>
            <li> I like the stand, but it is a tight fit for my brush, which is not exorbitantly big or anything.</li>
            <li> Holds all of my brushes (WSP Baroness Silvertip, Semogue 1470, Parker Pure BAdger with Blue Wood Handle, Semogue Owners Club Boar Bristle and Semogue Owners Club 2 Band Badger) and all myu razors (Merkur 34c, Merkur 180 and Gillette 1956 Red Tip)</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the pricey side for being just a stand, but there were very few options available.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the other reviews I have not experienced any rust on it without doing anything more than wiping off a bit of soap rarely.</li>
            <li> Note that the brand new shininess is lost since watermarks are left after taking a steamy shower.  </li>
            <li> I was taken back a bit by the price, but it isn&#x27;t like I am going to have to buy a new stand again soon.    </li>
            <li> This is evidently a new product, because I looked all over the web for just such a product before ordering the stand version.</li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge&lt;br /&gt;Proraso</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for about a month now, and it still looks brand new.</li>
            <li> After several months of use it still has the finish of a new item.</li>
            <li> This is really helpful with the brush, because it allows it to dry.  </li>
            <li> Hanging up your brush really helps it dry.  </li>
            <li> At least as a sort of beginner set, this stand is more than enough to satisfy.</li>
            <li> This model is an exact match for the extra long handled D/E Merker blade.  </li>
            <li> : if anything does go wrong I can buy 5 of these for the same price as one for $100.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: thie is Sept. 16th 2013: Brush &amp; razor stand is still holding up good.</li>
            <li> It feels very solid and has a very professional look.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any major issues with it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it does exactly what you think a shave stand should do.  </li>
            <li> The razor didn&#x27;t fit until I stretched out the opening on the razor side slightly.  </li>
            <li> As a lazy dude, I do not wipe it clean.  </li>
            <li> In other words, the narrowest part of the brush handle is still too wide to fit between the prongs on the stand.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, heavy, well built stand that can be easily cleaned whenever it gets too dirty.</li>
            <li> For me this is little pricey but it was worth buying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels heavy and durable, wipes clean, and no sign of any rust after several months of use.  </li>
            <li> Second the brush holder is fairly narrow, it will only hold my brush by the top of the bristles instead of the handle, not a major deal but something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While there are more expensive duos out there, Colonel Conk&#x27;s option combines affordability with durability and high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> small still to fit in a smaller bathroom.</li>
            <li> Where either the manufacturer or Amazon falls far short is regarding the product specifications.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be much handier than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I think my old Mach 5 is jealous, so I keep it on a different shelf.  </li>
            <li> and it just looks so old school and fancy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints so far and will be providing an update in the next 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> I fixed it with a simple modification.</li>
            <li> Now I have a complete set to last forever.</li>
            <li> in fact, it just barely gets on there.</li>
            <li> However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes.</li>
            <li> It came already assembled and it seems solid and well built so far.</li>
            <li> It looks okay but is a poorly designed product.</li>
            <li> Poor quality for something that just sits there most of the time and barely gets touched.  </li>
            <li> The razor balances precariously and the slightest bump sends the razor to the counter top or even worse, the floor.  </li>
            <li> The chrome shows water spots like crazy and now 3 years later its harder and harder to clean them off (to be fair</li>
            <li> Allows the razor and brush to dry and is ready to go the next time.</li>
            <li> so it takes up a bit more space on the sink but at least your brush stays dry</li>
            <li> While the razor stand is a little wide (Didnt fit an art of shaving one I got as a gift), I have no other complaints.</li>
            <li> The base of this stand is very stable so it is not easy to tip, also looks nice and easy to shine.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see how long it looks shiny and new..</li>
            <li> I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The felt on the bottom seems a bit flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t extend to the edge of the metal, but other than that it seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a razor hanging from the other side, so I was a bit worried about counter balance, but it hasn&#x27;t (and I don&#x27;t ever really see it)</li>
            <li> First and foremost the average shave brush is to big to use in this stand.</li>
            <li> had to send this back because the handle of my shaving brush was too thick to fit.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the stand has a sort of grippy rubber base to prevent it from rusting (most importantly) and to keep it from sliding around.</li>
            <li> Though it looks nice I find that this brand and model safety razor stand, with its uneven bottom - highest point of the bottom being the center, causing the stand to wobble in all directions - and badger brush arm lacking a width wide enough to hold even a standard sized brush, also lacks in practicality for ownership.  </li>
            <li> Since its new cannot comment on how long the finish will last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if your sink ever gets wet, but mine does, and I can easily see a bit of missed water causing this to rot off.    </li>
            <li> The only thing to note is that the middle pole screws into the bottom plate, which is hollow and filled with a black hockey puck shaped foam.</li>
            <li> shaving and buying cheap BIC throw away razors was a waste of money and never really shaved close enough.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m often pretty messy when it comes to getting soap or water on the counter and where I keep the stand itself.</li>
            <li> I was gonna deduct a star at first because my brush did not fit great.(likely</li>
            <li> My wife bought me an Art of Shaving Gift card for xmas and finally got around to using it, after pricing everything including stands I decided on a really good brush, unfortunately their stands like this started at 80 bucks!</li>
            <li> While its well built and heavy, the brush holder was not large enough to fit my art of shaving brush.</li>
            <li> In short, it dries everything I need to have dried after shaving and keeps it looking orderly, but not necessary clean do to the dry spots from the drip.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m a black male with coarse hair and if you&#x27;re the same you can relate with hairs growing any and everyway but straight down...</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand about a year and a half ago and it has held up very well.</li>
            <li> It allows both the brush and the razor to air dry completely.</li>
            <li> ; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> very minor quibble of mine is that it fits my brush VERY snugly, to the point that I worry I&#x27;m marring the finish of the shave brush handle by putting it in, and it&#x27;s not that wide of a brush</li>
            <li> It holds my Edwin Jagger DE89 razor very well and my Edwin Jagger brush although it&#x27;s a bit tight.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy enough to hold a razor and brush without tipping over if you aren&#x27;t super careful hanging up your man grooming equipment.</li>
            <li> The narrow side holds his razor and the large opening holds a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> If you have anything other than a small travel-sized brush, don&#x27;t expect it to fit properly.    </li>
            <li> I thought 15 bucks for it is a little much, and that&#x27;s why I might try something else.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very sturdy and with a little care should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but the wobble makes it feel a little cheap.</li>
            <li> The base is nicely weighted and I have had no balance problems even with my Gillette Fatboy and oversized custom stainless handles.  </li>
            <li> I should also mention that the base is nicely weighted and is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with rust/discoloration at all just some hard water spots that rub right off.</li>
            <li> Outside of my tweak to get it to sit flat, I have zero complaints and can only conclude that others that are hung up on this are just that.  </li>
            <li> Most of my other stuff was broken or damaged.</li>
            <li> This stand&#x27;s weight resists being knocked over by a gentle shove and passing cats -- a valuable feature when countertop space is at a premium or you need to trust putting your razor down won&#x27;t end up with a loose cartridge on the floor or in the sink.</li>
            <li> The base has decent weight and the finish is nice looking.</li>
            <li> It is just a little small for my cheap boar brush</li>
            <li> Then again, I&#x27;m conscious of other people&#x27;s reports of this</li>
            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be tall enough to hold the extra long safety razor I have, but it&#x27;s plenty tall enough.  </li>
            <li> Price was a little on the high end, get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> I was disappointed and they did offer me half the shipping fee refund, The stand itself looks like nice quality however the brush holder part does not fit the way I thought it&#x27;s kind of tight.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t comment on how it holds up over time because I haven&#x27;t had it for long, but it seems quite solid, so I expect it to last a while.</li>
            <li> It is tall enough even for an extra long razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> G Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180, 10 Double Edge Platinum Blades]], although I didn&#x27;t buy mine with blades.  </li>
            <li> B002A8JO1Q Merkur Heavy Duty Classic Safety Razor]], I wanted a razor stand that went well with it and my brush without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li> The problem some people seem to have had with the padding on the bottom not touching the surface certainly wasn&#x27;t an issue with the one they sent</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and really have very few complaints.</li>
            <li> If you look at it long enough you will leave a mark on it.</li>
            <li> Bit pricey, but hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> does it sit flat?</li>
            <li> That why the brush&#x27;s are made with a flat bottom</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moreover, it holds your shaving brush in the proper drying position, which will ensure a long life.</li>
            <li> I have a Parker 96R long handle, which still has plenty of room to swing, and an Art of Shaving brush that slots in quite well, currently.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tall enough to hold my long handle</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sit flat.</li>
            <li> It works well enough as long as nothing bumps it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Evernice for a month or so now and think it will probably last a long time.</li>
            <li> (the other more expensive stands) just seem wrong to spend more on the stand than the razor.</li>
            <li> after some time in use the bottom settled and now it sits flat.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the other reviewers in helping other Amazon.com shoppers make informed choices!</li>
            <li> (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY</li>
            <li> Just cause it is pretty inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t mean anything.  </li>
            <li> But I invested 20 USD on it, so I can&#x27;t justify throwing it out and buying a new one that might also not fit my brush...</li>
            <li> You must get one if you use a brush since they don&#x27;t dry properly if left resting on the handle.</li>
            <li> The brush is allowed to dry properly.</li>
            <li> A stand is the only way to properly dry your brush.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have to hang my shaving brush from the junction of the handle and the bristles, rather than from the handle because the gap for hanging the brush by the handle isn&#x27;t wide enough to accommodate any of my 5 shaving brush handles.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty metal looks very professional.</li>
            <li> I mean, you are really getting multiple tools for the price of 2!  </li>
            <li> find no flaws with the fit and finish or the stand, just the right size and the weighted base keeps it in place even with a safety razor and brush resting in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially like that the ends of the prongs are slightly curled up, so no slipping off of the razor will occur.</li>
            <li> I had to gently bend up the prongs very slightly to give the brush and razor a little more stability, but other than that, the stand is totally functional, and has a small footprint, which I like in my small space.</li>
            <li> There are other more expensive stands that may look fancier</li>
            <li> The main problem is that two of the three brushes I have, do not fit this stand!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of odd that the base&#x27;s weight isn&#x27;t in proportion to the rest, considering how much weight there is in the rest of the stand.</li>
            <li> The razor just barely fits in there because the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the stand are a little short.</li>
            <li> I use to use my late fathers straight razor when I started out</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how nice it was.</li>

            <li> The stem seems ever-so-slightly crooked, but not really noticeable.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> A bit larger than expected</li>
            <li> The chroming/finish is of good quality although I am leery about the base as it has a foam insert on the bottom</li>
            <li> has a good hefty base-</li>
            <li> It is not easily tipped over, is large enough to hold everything, and small enough to take up a minimum of space.</li>
            <li> As long as it is dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews with this same issue.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t touch this other than for basic cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I subtracted 3 stars due to only being 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it is adding a little more wear and tear to an expensive brush than I would like.</li>
            <li> The next star was lost due to finish.</li>
            <li> Judging by the quality of it, it will be very long time until I need another one, if ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, there are plenty of other stand choices out there, so you are by no means limited to simply this one.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a stand like this for your brush; allowing it to dry with the bristles pointing up can swell the handle and cause the bristles to mildew or fall out.</li>
            <li> I dry it off after shaving.</li>
            <li> It has a heavy base, providing great stability.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update (after about 1 month use): Do try to ensure that the stand is kept dry at all times as the chrome may corrode.</li>
            <li> This keeps my razor and brush air dry.</li>
            <li> I wipe off any drops of water on the stand and towel dry my brush and razor before putting them on the stand.</li>

            <li> it helps dry your brush and razor and prevent the razor from rusting.</li>
            <li> Shiny chrome finish, nice solid base.  </li>
            <li> The base is sufficiently wide for a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could not live without this stand</li>
            <li> The brush side is a little thin, so I had to work the wooden handle of my brush down to fit in the stand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any rust as I&#x27;m big careful to keep it dry after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Very nice finish and sturdy heavy base.</li>
            <li> Just wipe it down when you&#x27;re done with it and it seems like it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This stand matches my Merkur 38 HD, my chrome handled silvertip badger bristle brush, and provides that extra shine to contrast my dark mango wood shave soap bowl.</li>
            <li> This stand was smaller than expected, but heavier than expected !</li>
            <li> My Merkur Vision barely fits blade-down, and my ceramic fat-handled brush does not fit at all.    </li>
            <li> The smaller hook is not big enough to hold my thick razor handle.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of this stand, but was disappointed in the product that was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base of the item has some kind of foam rubber on it, it does not sit even on a flat surface</li>
            <li> I have really hard water where I live).  </li>
            <li> but I made a slight modification and for the price it lets my brush dry properly.</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t rusted and stays shiny since I wipe it down daily.  </li>
            <li> I hang it upside down from the middle of the handle.</li>
            <li> gets quite dirty looking very very quickly but does not corrode.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than 4 months and the chrome plating is flaking off and corroding off of the entire stand.</li>
            <li> Essentially I added a layer of epoxy putty to the small weight and then sealed what was left with the fun-tak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what size it is, but it could definitely hold a bigger brush, too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the chrome finish gets ruined quickly if you&#x27;re keeping this in a bathroom.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Under the base is a large Nut that holds it together, this nut has gotten extremely rusted in one year (You can&#x27;t see it, as it is hidden, so that is good).&lt;br /&gt;The chrome corroded quickly, while my razor and brushes chrome show no sign of corrosion, making me think this stand uses low quality metals.</li>
            <li> It has just enough weight to not tip over if it takes a little knock from a Listerine bottle or something.  </li>
            <li> I assumed it&#x27;d be some flimsy little cheapo stand because the price was so low.</li>
            <li> Was a little larger than I expected, but is not an issue.</li>
            <li> it does not fit average/commong items, useless, my razor or toothbrush or shave brush do not fit, ok quality for money</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough to prevent accidental tipping.  </li>
            <li> Standard razor will not fit in slot.  </li>
            <li> Not much to review here.</li>
            <li> So, I wouldn&#x27;t drag it around a lot on your counter...</li>
            <li> Yes, when I get it wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy enough to be stable on the corner of my sink.    </li>
            <li> I try to review all products that I order, however some things theirs just not much to say.</li>
            <li> It was what I&#x27;ve expected.  </li>
            <li> Shaving brushes come in a wide variety of shapes and diameters, as well as quality.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t work - you&#x27;d think they would have tried the stand with a few different typed of razors!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had with the holder for the razor was the prongs were uneven.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t even want to waste $20 on this stand, I&#x27;ve seen pictures of people simply using screws/nails  sticking out halfway from the wall to fashion a makeshift stand for their shaving utensils.</li>
            <li> I have AOS brushes as well as some cheaper drug store brushes and it does not fit any of them by the handle, only the knots.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heavy, and it is built to last.  </li>
            <li> The razor won&#x27;t stay in its holder at all, and as far as the brush, it will only fit at the base of the bristles, the holder is too narrow to hold it at the knot.</li>
            <li> Not much to like or dislike about it.</li>
            <li> Heavy, well put together with a solid feel.</li>
            <li> Some badger brushes might not fit on this (the Art of Shaving brush is too big)</li>
            <li> I removed the foam and carefully carved out a section in the middle where the screw holds the top to the base.</li>
            <li> Why should this thing with the amount of money I spent on it?</li>
            <li> Alittle wobbly, because the screw on the bottom isn&#x27;t recessed, but no real complaints.</li>
            <li> but I guess there&#x27;s not much that is anymore.</li>
            <li> I have only had this stand for a few weeks</li>
            <li> This is not really the stands fault</li>
            <li> Everything is I expected.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that whenever I go to wipe off the porcelain counter, there is always a green ring under the stand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It serves its essential function of keeping a razor and a badger-hair brush upright without problems, despite being loaded with heavy steel razors or tucked into a corner.</li>
            <li> it just wastes space now since I can only put my DE razor on it and not my brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to hold my razor and brush while taking up minimal space.</li>
            <li> It is well made and of heavy construction, looks like it would last forever.</li>
            <li> Minus three stars; It&#x27;s already showing signs of rust—I purchased just 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and heavy enough to hold a shaver, brush, or both without tipping over.  </li>
            <li> My Tweezerman brush simply does not fit the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> your brush handle or razor is too wide, it will not fit properly in the stand.</li>
            <li> Both the base and the top part of the holder have multiple pits that are forming.</li>
            <li> The chrome is disintegrating and starting to spot with rust on the top rack, shaft, and the base.  </li>
            <li> &quot; chrome safety razor stand is sturdy and nicely finished, and the base is heavy enough to prevent the stand from tipping over.</li>
            <li> mo10NRHPJ9Q8HQV]]The Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor and Brush stand has a weighted base and a nice chrome finish.</li>
            <li> my own attempt to fix the base of the stand I used a combination of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The base has nice heft to it to keep the stand upright.</li>
            <li> Base is weighted nicely so that it stays in place on the counter and doesn&#x27;t wobble.</li>
            <li> The base is sturdy and the finish is nice.</li>
            <li> The base has a nice bit of weight to it to hold your brush and razor without tipping.</li>
            <li> Base is nice and heave so</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it is a little wobbly, so expect some minor shaking (like a slightly off-center table at a restaurant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lets handle dry upside down</li>
            <li> (Letting it dry upside down -- with the bristles pointing up -- will, in my experience, soften the glue over time resulting in lost bristles when you use it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor side hold manyt different razors woithout issue, but the bruch side is narrow and may not fit your brush (I hang mine with bristles down, with 100% of handle above the opening).</li>
            <li> Allows your brush to air dry upside down for thorough drying.</li>
            <li> and it is tall enough even for brushes a little longer than say an average length I have the Elite&#x27;s Synthetic Shaving Brush which seems a little long</li>
            <li> Bottom line is if your new to this just look for any product that is stainless not chrome, solid base and has a 5 star rating in the 90%.</li>
            <li> The only way to get at the screw was to cut a small hole in the center of the material.</li>
            <li> Previously, I would just lay my badger brush, but found it didn&#x27;t dry well and took up counter space.</li>
            <li> It also could use a heavier base, as when I put my razor and brush back on I need to be careful or it will knock over rather easily.</li>
            <li> These spots are tiny and barely noticeable but the finish is so thin they cannot be buffed out.</li>
            <li> My base is not weighted, and while thick and large it is in fact a cheap hollow stamping.  </li>
            <li> I had the same issues everyone else has had with the rubber piece up inside the base too far, a big washer fixed that.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is it is a little tight for my brush and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hoping I will not have the finish coming off like some of the other reviewers</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my razors are \\&quot;user grade\\&quot;, meaning they aren&#x27;t all that pretty.</li>
            <li> Holds all my brushes big and small.  </li>
            <li> a Merkur 180 or a Merkur Futur (depending on which one I am using) on the other.  </li>
            <li> then the other chrome stands on this site.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result is that the sharp metal rim rests on the countertop, scratching it.</li>
            <li> No rust or other degradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so this is just a tiny bit small for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It was awfully pretty when I took it out of the box except for the fact that one of the prongs was already broken off!</li>
            <li> First, the bottom was lined with a fake velvet material.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say other than it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a sturdy product that grips the razor and the brush, and doesn&#x27;t let them fall off every time you make contact with it, as some other products seemed to do.</li>
            <li> Has not corroded like other reviewers noted.</li>
            <li> (as one other person has pointed out on these reviews)</li>

            <li> Looks sharp.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll hang there, but the fit is very insecure and wobbly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other things I&#x27;ve gleaned from other reviews that haven&#x27;t been an issue for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No real frills but just works!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot you can ask for with this thing other than \\&quot;will it hold my razor?\\&quot; or \\&quot;will it hold my brush?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any pitting or other quality issues at all.  </li>
            <li> Other than one &amp;#34;Dud&amp;#34</li>
            <li> 2.5 years of use this stnad finally has some small rust spots on it.</li>
            <li> and it looks sharp.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other stands either.</li>
            <li> but the razor keeps slipping and falling down no matter how you put it.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get supplies for wet shaving unless you order it or go to a bigger city.</li>
            <li> For a product of this quality I would have expected to pay less than $10.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit on the handle and only on the base of the brush.</li>
            <li> heavy base with a nice look.</li>
            <li> Nice heavy base to it, so it won&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li> The sizing is a little small for my brush though, I expected it to hold on the middle of the handle of the brush, but instead it holds between the bottom of the handle and the bristles.  </li>
            <li> The base is very secure and does not tip over.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other comments, those who are complaining of it corroding are probably messy people that have a moldy wet counter and don&#x27;t take care of their stuff.</li>
            <li> I read about rusting in other reviews but so far i have not experienced this problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decently made with the exception of the base which really needs a bottom pad.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d probably be hard pressed to find a polished nickel stand otherwise, especially at such a price.</li>
            <li> My brush handle is a little too big to fit in it, so I slide it in at the base of the bristles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What might have been a useful product for me in fact is just a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> quality of the finish and build quality is just average.</li>
            <li> The base is heavier than expected and prevents easy knock over.  </li>
            <li> I wipe it down once in awhile to keep the dust off it and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> holds my brush upside down as it&#x27;s intended to be and</li>
            <li> Just wipe it down when you get some water on it</li>
            <li> Store the brush with the bristles down so the water and soap drain off and don&#x27;t make mold and eat at the hair knot.</li>
            <li> but I do wipe it down before storing them after shaving.</li>
            <li> however, there is 1 down side.  </li>
            <li> and this beats it hands down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily my dad chucked the brush up in the lathe and turned the handle slot down for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was remedied when all of the items were placed in the stand (they weighted it down).</li>
            <li> I like the clean polished look and the solid, heavy base.</li>
            <li> I keep it on a small shelf away from the sink to keep it dry which probably helps.</li>
            <li> The only thing negative (besides the price) about it is that the little forks that hold your brush got bent over time.  </li>
            <li> The metal that is formed to the curvature of the base ends in a fairly sharp edge that could gouge or scratch surfaces quite easily.</li>
            <li> The metal that is formed to the curvature of the base ends in a fairly sharp edge that could gouge or scratch surfaces quite easily.    </li>
            <li> It fits a Gillette Black Beauty DE razor</li>
            <li> When you do put your safety razor or brush on this it will cause them to slowly slip off over the next few days tilting towards the heavier of the two items.</li>
            <li> I had to force the brush into the holder, slightly damaging the brush handle.</li>
            <li> This was slightly bent where the brush goes.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year and a half ago and it is still rust-free.</li>
            <li> The arms curl up at the ends slightly to keep your razor falling off.</li>
            <li> I use it the less I get</li>
            <li> would be slightly wider</li>
            <li> Previously, I just had the brush and razor lying on their sides, and using this stand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Filipino</li>
            <li> if you see it for less and are on the fence-</li>
            <li> Decent mass to it, so it&#x27;s not going to go flying across the room if you look at it wrong.  </li>
            <li> It has a heavy and sturdy base which rarely falls over and is easy to polish up when it gets dirty.</li>
            <li> The upper appears to be stainless but base which is hollow with a rubber insert, is rusting from the edge.</li>
            <li> I lifted it up one day to find little black specks of the material stuck onto my counter.</li>
            <li> This little stand keeps my counter less cluttered.  </li>
            <li> The opening is a tight 28 mm.</li>
            <li> Both are held well without being too tight.  </li>
            <li> rubber bottom piece is not water tight either.</li>
            <li> The brush holder was a little small; I have a brush from The Art of Shaving and that brush was too wide for the brush holder.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that my Tweezerman brush didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry!</li>
            <li> However, the side for the razor was a little tight</li>
            <li> The brush opening is a little tight for my Omega boars</li>
            <li> I bought mine Dec 19 2011, so I&#x27;ve had it a little over two months.</li>
            <li> I took it to the shop, bent the prongs just a little</li>
            <li> Taking up little space, it helps organize the clutter in the bathroom and</li>
            <li> well (I use a Merkur Progressive adjustable #570), and didn&#x27;t fall over with just the razor on board, although it was beginning to be a little bit unsteady.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well-made and with a little heft to it</li>
            <li> However, the base of the unit is a cheap and hollow chrome casing with a small weight and foam pad inside.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll slide into the holder a little easier now.</li>
            <li> And a little nit-picky thing for me</li>
            <li> have to squeeze the bristles a little to get it in the holder to avoid splitting the knot while it&#x27;s being insert into the U shape holder.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a razor stand to keep the bathroom counter a little neater.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> **little</li>
            <li> A little sticker told me so.</li>
            <li> but I guess DE shaving requires a little investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does rust and gets pitted after a little while.  </li>
            <li> So when it arrived I rubbed a little gun oil on it to help prevent the rust.</li>
            <li> I can assemble or disassemble it in a minute and it takes up little space in my luggage.  </li>
            <li> The brush side works perfectly fine, and the weighted base makes it sturdy.</li>
            <li> Easily remedied by screwing base off and inserting a plain metal washer over screw post before reassembling.</li>
            <li> The razor side will hold your DE razor no problem, but the brush side is just a little too narrow to hold my Omega badger brush.</li>
            <li> It is a little tall for my razor and brush, and the brush holder is a bit narrow for my brush (though it works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Base is a little small making it somewhat unstable, and the brush holder side is a little small for most brushes.</li>
            <li> I use my Grandfathers old DE razor and felt bad about not having a proper place to put it after each shave.</li>
            <li> MY BRUSH AND THE RAZOR WOULD NOT FIT   </li>
            <li> One exception, today I bought a Parker with a crome handle that is quite heavy.</li>
            <li> Heavy weight and durable.</li>
            <li> Its performance is dead on...</li>
            <li> However, brushes with thicker handles may not fit well or may need to be hung at the knot rather than at the handle.</li>
            <li> In fact, a handle as wide as the Tweeserman brush is about as thick as it will take if you intend to hang it by the handle.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews before I bought it that the chrome will start coming off.  </li>
            <li> The slot is way too narrow.</li>
            <li> It accommodates my fairly heavy safety razor</li>
            <li> The slot for the brush is way too narrow.  </li>
            <li> Van Der Hagen (VDH) brush]] will not fit.  </li>
            <li> It always manages to twist itself out and fall within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Do not buy unless you want to replace again in a few months.</li>
            <li> My Parker brush would not fit.  </li>
            <li> However, the Vulfix 404 shave brush I have does not fit like a brush</li>
            <li> It keeps the bathroom counter organized and prevents the razor and brush from being misplaced.</li>
            <li> The Parker Shaving Brush i bought to go with it does not fit into the brush hanger side.</li>
            <li> Wobbly, with a cheap base layer.</li>
            <li> This has really poor longevity and it looks like it&#x27;s resold by four or five different brand names.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because I have a few items in my bathroom that are chrome</li>
            <li> Weighted bottom makes this stable even with heavy Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Shave Brush.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars if only the base would have been solid metal.but overall</li>
            <li> As some have mentioned, it has a rather narrow fork for the brush holder.</li>
            <li> However, it has a few design flaws.</li>
            <li> started rusting in a few months.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and was concerned that it may not fit my razor and brush that I had</li>
            <li> The bottom plate is heavy</li>
            <li> Neither of these handles will fit in it and they have to be hung with the opening hugging the base of the brush itself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand hoping it wouldn&#x27;t break in a few months.</li>
            <li> (not relevant trying to get word minium)</li>
            <li> Has green tint to</li>
            <li> It does not fit my Art of Shaving brush</li>
            <li> May not fit all brushes handle.</li>
            <li> It is not cheaply made so</li>
            <li> About a few months into owning this stand, the chrome on the bottom plate started bubbling.</li>
            <li> I imagine that in a few months it would start rusting on the underside of the unit like others</li>
            <li> Works well for the few weeks</li>
            <li> however my shaving brush handle did not fit in stand.</li>
            <li> The brush holder side is just a tad too narrow.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, after a few months of use, the chrome began to flake and chip off of the stand.</li>
            <li> : Wider knotted brushes might not fit.</li>
            <li> It does not fit my G.B.S. brush.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal I suppose.</li>
            <li> No more hunting around for where I sat my razor down.</li>
            <li> Bought this product not certain if it would work with my thick boar bristle brush</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this stand - the only reason to get another one is if you are on an extreme budget and want to get a crap plastic stand, but this isn&#x27;t really that expensive.</li>
            <li> The chrome has held up well over the past year and a half.</li>
            <li> This holder is a bit bland and ordinary.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no good way to dry your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is high enough so that the razor and brush are about one inch from the base of the stand.  </li>
            <li> A few things to consider:    Don&#x27;t hang your brushes or razors while still dripping wet - this is not good for them or the stand.  </li>
            <li> First the base while hefty has a hollow bottom with a foam style pad.</li>
            <li> The chrome, as all chrome things do, gets a little dingy with soap especially on the side that holds the brush (since it drips directly onto the base).</li>
            <li> Colonel Conk sounds like a British brand to me but the stand is made in Taiwan where labor is a lot less expensive than in the UK.    </li>
            <li> A few small alterations and</li>
            <li> Seems nice and heavy, but the lame base is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with my brush (link below), it does not fit properly.</li>
            <li> Nothing a $5 rust spray won&#x27;t take care of, but it&#x27;s a little too late for my razor stand, so I&#x27;ll be ordering another.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was NOT meant for larger razors or brushes.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in about 1 week in a small box in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> It does not have a rubber base but the stainless steel base looks smooth.</li>
            <li> As a precaution, I put a small amount of wax on it to protect it from water/moisture.  </li>
            <li> but it has stabilized and not really gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> Of course it is too small if you try to hang the brush by the handle.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what is was designed to do:   (1) Hold a Brush   </li>
            <li> past - &#x27;</li>
            <li> It now has small grooves on either side of the handle</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the brush holder is two small</li>
            <li> Well designed such that it is difficult for it to just slide out.  </li>
            <li> I will not knock this item for not fitting a razor that it&#x27;s not supposed to</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with his Gillette Mach 3 razor and The Art of Shaving brush, the stand is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> my razor has small tabs that make it want to slide out of the slot.</li>
            <li> Small dislike(s): 1.</li>
            <li> Brush holder is too small for my brush handle.</li>
            <li> The brush opening on the stand is too small for the brush.  </li>
            <li> : Not sure why its made of &amp;#34;Badger&amp;#34; hair but its working.</li>
            <li> Feels like the same quality as the expensive ones from AOS</li>
            <li> Works well with small to medium knots.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say that I&#x27;m taking this down to a 1 star as I expected this to be a small occurrence  </li>
            <li> The weight at the base is just right.  </li>
            <li> the locking nut in the base under the non skid foam can be felt, but it doesn&#x27;t go proud of the base on mine.  </li>
            <li> Very well made with a sturdy heavy base.  </li>
            <li> Stand is study, does what it should, but just looks ugly now next to my other bathroom</li>
            <li> I am now ready to buy a real expensive stand</li>
            <li> Brush side too narrow to accommodate the brush handle so it has to rest at the base near the bristles, and not securely at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the base has a soft rubber black material.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply hard to find razor stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t press hard-</li>
            <li> It doesnt scratch from hard water and its well built.</li>
            <li> I had bought this stand at least 4-5 months ago.</li>
            <li> a lot of guys have complained about tarnish, rust and pitting.</li>
            <li> The base - which is chromed metal - will, after a time, develop &#x27;bumps&#x27; and green spots which don&#x27;t come out, like the chrome trim on an old car.</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t happen for a while at least.</li>
            <li> You cannot tighten it either because the very bottom, underneath has a glued rubber base.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the time to deal with returning it and the shipping was somewhat slow.</li>
            <li> I mean, this is the &#x27;sneak up behind the guy robbing my house and knock him out&#x27; type of sturdy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to crown my newly installed pedestal sink and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I mean, how could anyone not like this?  </li>
            <li> I mean, it doesn&#x27;t tip over or anything.</li>
            <li> It was working out well, till I noticed a small hint of rust near the base.</li>
            <li> would of got 5 stars but middle base cushion (black foam) comes out and sticks to sink counter,</li>
            <li> I will back-up what several other reviewers have stated, that the soft pad on the bottom of the base doesn&#x27;t even touch the counter-top, but the bottom edge of the metal base does.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that the foam does not cover the entire base of the unit and the metal  touches the ground more than the padding.</li>
            <li> thing I find to be bothersome (and this is very small) is that the prongs for the brush side are a</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality of the stand, though the other products (wet shave cup, brush) seem to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and well built!</li>
            <li> Even Tarn-X could not clean off the red rust stains on the base.  </li>
            <li> This started about 6 months ago, and while I could keep it at bay for a little while, it just got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> but if you hang your wet brush on it,,,, it drips on the base.. also,, doesn&#x27;t hold other brands of brushes (at least theo ne</li>
            <li> However, the stand made a lot of sense to help keep the razor off of dirty surfaces and allow the brush to dry easier.    </li>
            <li> seriously, I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for a couple years, and just now bought a stand for my brush and razor.  </li>
            <li> The rubber on the bottom of the base was uneven (bowed out in the middle) and caused the stand to wobble.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than I can buy in a shave store.</li>
            <li> The stand has a heavy base and a quite sturdy platform for your shave brush and safety razor and feels as if it will last for years to come.</li>
            <li> Base is heavy enough to keep from tipping.  </li>
            <li> The base is adequately heavy to be stable with only one side loaded.</li>
            <li> The bottom circular plate surface will deform like crazy if you do not wipe it every single day.  </li>
            <li> It has a weighted soft rubber bottom base and even chrome.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of years service, the base developed some corrosion.  </li>
            <li> bar with hangers is very heavy, but actual base isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The center piece is wobbly and not screwed into the base piece tightly.</li>
            <li> Heavy base with rubber bottom prevents tipping and slipping.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the foam insert under the base, which bulges out to the the point that it&#x27;s not stable on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has a wobbly base.</li>
            <li> Sadly it has too small of an opening for the brush and has been sitting on a shelf since I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> The stand works, and for the price you really can&#x27;t be too disappointed, but I found the base to be a little wobbly and lacking in weight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE 08/17/2012: Very small spots of rust beginning to appear on the base of the stand where water from the razor drips down and slowly dries.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a cinch, using a little alcohol on a cotton round takes care of any spots or droplets that may happen on the base or hooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably the least expensive brush/razor stand on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to pick up some felt or thin plastic</li>
            <li> One of the things I was concerned about was something that can&#x27;t be shown in a photo - the base being properly weighted so the stand doesn&#x27;t have a tendency to tip over.  </li>
            <li> This is a defective, poorly designed product.  </li>
            <li> It is turning green in spots and just looks dirty even after cleaning it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Weighty enough in the base that it won&#x27;t just fall over.</li>
            <li> Within months, this started corroding, the thin layer of metal peeling off and rusting all around.</li>
            <li> Second is the felted bottom is recessed within the chrome base about 1/16th of an inch, which means it will scratch up your countertop or glass shelf.</li>
            <li> This Safety Razor Stand has a very solid base.  </li>
            <li> Base is quite sturdy and will not tip over, even if one side is left vacant.</li>
            <li> This item is both the nicest looking and least expensive of the safety razor stands I found.  </li>
            <li> I think the price is a bit expensive for what it is but at least it works.</li>
            <li> Kinda frustrating.</li>
            <li> Still, it doesn&#x27;t actually topple over, but I was expecting the base to be heavier.</li>
            <li> get the least expensive</li>
            <li> The base has enough weight on it to hold everything up even if I remove the razor or brush from the stand.  </li>
            <li> There is zerio rust or metal deterioration on the outside, or bottom base.</li>
            <li> The only caveat I had was the rubber base was a bit rounded at the bottom</li>
            <li> Then I rook some clear RTV Silicone put on the treads of the screw base and tightened it down and cleaned off the excess silicone that squished out the sides if the post that should keep water from getting into the innards of the base.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Mediocre quality, the base is not totally stable.</li>
            <li> I had to take a star or two off though, because the chrome is peeling off in two or three locations; at the base of the pole, on the base, and right below the holder arms.  </li>
            <li> The stand arrived with a loose base.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about an inch wide so measure up the base or anywhere around your brush to estimate how it&#x27;s going to hang from the stand.</li>
            <li> The rubber pad on the base keeps it from slipping around on the sink.</li>
            <li> holds a Tweezerman brush (at the base, not where the bristles meet the handle) and an unknown model of Merkur DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottom of the base is a rubber disc that is supposed to extend beyond the sharp metal rim, so that the rubber disc rests upon the countertop.</li>
            <li> I was expecting some rust on the weighted base, based on some other reviews, but I have not seen that with mine.</li>
            <li> The base that is comes with has a slight curve to it that causes this, whether your have something hanging from it or not.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> , not even a year has passed (well, a little over since I took forever to update this) and the corrosion is taking over the base.</li>
            <li> base could be a little wider and/or heavier.</li>
            <li> BUT I WAS WRONG....</li>
            <li> THE RAZOR THAT WAS NOT TOO EXPENSIVE..    </li>
            <li> YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH THIS BEAUTY..</li>
            <li> sorry to hear the neg reviews for this stand.</li>
            <li> The base of the unit is heavy weight</li>
            <li> i think is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> Works well, fits my razor and shaving brush, base is heavy so its stable.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: December 1, 2011 - Sad to say that the chrome has started to pit on this.</li>
            <li> (Sad face)  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want/need to pay $100+ for a name-brand model or something complicated.  </li>
            <li> The finish is a sticker or something fake.  </li>
            <li> The razor stand has a heavy, sturdy base.</li>
            <li> Given it&#x27;s lousy ability to handle humidity</li>
            <li> I was wrong on both assumptions.</li>
            <li> well I just wish these things weren&#x27;t so expensive...</li>
            <li> Heavy base keeps it stable.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive and does the job.  </li>
            <li> It cannot hold my Merkur Futur razor unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet had it fall over, but it seems like it wouldn&#x27;t be difficult for that to happen.</li>
            <li> But if you are lazy, watch the bubbles and dots grow on your base plate.</li>
            <li> The stand I received had the rubber base recessed several millimeters within the base.</li>
            <li> was supposed to be metal but is plastic and has already broken bad design...</li>
            <li> The worst thing I can say about it is that the polished metal base hangs over the soft pad on the bottom that is suppose to keep it from scratching up your table surface.</li>
            <li> Moreover, this is a disappointment that could&#x27;ve been avoided.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Instead, I have to use the hair-base transition which is a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> I twisted the base to tighten it and now it&#x27;s sturdy.</li>
            <li> Bad bad quality finish.</li>
            <li> so this was not too bad.  </li>
            <li> but it does its job and isn&#x27;t too pricey and doesn&#x27;t look bad doing it.</li>
            <li> I got some Walmart shaving soap to go with it, which doesn&#x27;t look too bad on the thing.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews talking about the bad quality and rusting concern me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> It looks, well, ugly.</li>
            <li> Buy it you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this up, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The base was badly tarnished when it arrived along with the stem.  </li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Base rusts over time.  </li>
            <li> works well for Parker 99R razor but for my parker shaving brush it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold it vertical, it tips it off at like 45degrees, which is really annoying</li>
            <li> The foam pad that is glued to the underside is not flush with the chrome base.</li>
            <li> The stand should be kept out of standing water - the base will rust.  </li>
            <li> No problem with base scratching vanity.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had this stand for three months and already the base is corroded.</li>
            <li> yes, no issues with the foam base.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the bottom base that connects to the metal contour base isn&#x27;t flush.</li>
            <li> Plus, the foam pad that is glued to the underside is not flush with the chrome base.</li>
            <li> twists together at the base, and I have noticed it get&#x27;s lose all the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those guys that buys his DE razors in a set with a brush and a base.</li>
            <li> and now I see the chrome is peeling off at the base.</li>
            <li> The finish is coming off around the base of the rod that attaches to the bottom base.</li>
            <li> I also like how the base is weighted and that the stand has padding at the bottom.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not gonna knock anybody out with the base</li>
            <li> Within 1 week of using I&#x27;ve noticed a spot of rust on the base where the foam is glued to.</li>
            <li> the base rusted underneath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base leaves rust spots every where.  </li>
            <li> The brush side, though, is too skinny to hold the top-most crease on the base of my brush.  </li>
            <li> but there is still about an inch between tip and base</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crap for 25 bucks, should be sold at the 99cents store</li>
            <li> The water drips over time to the base plate and the surface of the plate started to deform.  </li>
            <li> so it is really annoying in terms of that......</li>
            <li> Weighted base that has never flipped over.</li>
            <li> I replace it, I&#x27;m going to look for one that has a wider base.</li>
            <li> The base is weighted so it holds my razor without tipping over and</li>
            <li> The base has a grippy pad on the bottom so that it won&#x27;t slip or slide.</li>
            <li> biggest gripe is the base already looks kinda nasty.</li>
            <li> However, I no longer needed it once I returned the horrible escali badger brush (see review).</li>
            <li> which looks awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> beautiful stand  , well made</li>
            <li> Bad bad quality finish. If you look at it long enough you will leave a mark on it.</li>
            <li> This is a good stand for a typical razor and smaller handled brush. I used this when I first got started and had a small handled badger hair brush. Everything fit great, and it was nice to let the brush hang the proper way and dry the way its supposed to between shaves.  When I moved to a larger brush though (which you&#x27;ll want to do at some point) it didn&#x27;t fit and consequently this stand just holds my razor now, which is sort of a waste. This one isn&#x27;t fancy, but it gets the job done. Just make sure it&#x27;ll hold the brush you have and intend on having for a long time!</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a nickle, or satin nickle finish to match my bathroom decor, but pricing on this was to tempting to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;I find no flaws with the fit and finish or the stand, just the right size and the weighted base keeps it in place even with a safety razor and brush resting in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more stylized models out there, laying flat as well as upright, and lots of different finish materials as well - in the end I am needing function and not trying to make a style statement with my shaving kit so this is just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Perfecto brush, and Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl razor fit with room to spare, letting the brush dry out in the open and secure on a holder vs just sitting on the handle base on the counter is perfect with this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend, I would say I would purchase again, but I have no fears of it breaking or corroding.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving, but I like to keep my counter clean and organized, so when I got all of my new supplies, naturally I got a stand for them too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern when buying it was that the brush or the razor would not fit, but the Merkur 34C Razor fits just fine as does the Tweezerman Brush. It looks great on my counter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on how it holds up over time because I haven&#x27;t had it for long, but it seems quite solid, so I expect it to last a while.</li>
            <li> Product just as described.  Clean and sleek looking for the Merkur razor that I purchased too.  Wanted razor to have proper care.  Looks clean on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, heavy, well built stand that can be easily cleaned whenever it gets too dirty. I recommend.</li>
            <li> This stand has a beautiful and *very* shiny chrome finish.  My brush fits nicely on one side, the razor on the other.  It&#x27;s weighted and balances the two items well.  No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> The shaving stand works wonderfully, with enough room to hold both brush and razor.  It is tall enough even for an extra long razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this stand highly.</li>
            <li> This is a good stand with 1 problem. The black felt bleeds if it gets wet and stained my bathroom counter top. If not for that one problem I would have given this product a perfect 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> After about 2 or 3 years, it&#x27;s still shiny and still holds my razor and brush as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  The stand has a nice shiny chrome finish.  Note that the brand new shininess is lost since watermarks are left after taking a steamy shower.  It holds my Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor and Tweezerman Shaving Brush perfectly.  The weight at the base is just right.  It&#x27;s heavy enough to prevent accidental tipping.  The bottom of the base has a soft rubber black material.  So far so good, no rusting yet.</li>
            <li> Base rusts over time.  I&#x27;ve replaced mine with a stainless steel model.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Looks attractive and doesn&#x27;t take up as much space as a big/bulky electric shaver.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me an Art of Shaving Gift card for xmas and finally got around to using it, after pricing everything including stands I decided on a really good brush, unfortunately their stands like this started at 80 bucks! So the brush was all I was able to get. I hoped on here and saw this and figured if its half as good as what they were selling it would be a sound investment. Boy was I glad!! Upon opening it I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this one or the one for 80 bucks. Now my brush and razor are proudly displayed in my bathroom and it looks really good. Well worth the investment and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Heavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Cant find any!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with my Merkur 180 Long Handled Chrome Safety Razor (also known as the Merkur 23C), and for that use it&#x27;s a fine stand. The only thing I didn&#x27;t care for was the spongy felt material on the bottom of the stand. Not a huge deal, but the wobble makes it feel a little cheap. The long handled razor hangs great, with no clearance issues, and the texture of the stand matches the 180&#x27;s handle perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own two full size badger brushes (and one travel size brush) and can report back that the popular Tweezerman Shave Brush fits perfectly, while my Art of Shaving brush that came part of a set (Sandalwood pre-shave oil, shaving cream, lotion, and brush with black handle ) does not fit. They look almost identical in size, but the AOS brush it just a hair to fat to hang properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I have a brush stand for my AOS brush, but even if I didn&#x27;t, I could still make it work by hanging the brush where the hairs meet the handle. Doesn&#x27;t look as nice when you do that but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush&lt;br /&gt;ASIN: B000G647Y8&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman 2801 h Mens Shaving Brush]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Chrome&lt;br /&gt;ASIN: B000NL0T1G&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Handled Safety]]</li>
            <li> Bought this in November 2009 with my Merkur Solingen Futur Adjustable Double Edge Safety Razor. This is a very nice looking stand. And it seems as if it will last for many years.</li>
            <li> Standard razor will not fit in slot.  What were they thinking?  It just kinda \\&quot;sits on\\&quot; the thing and will fall off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good looking holder, holds things well if they fit.  That is IF THEY FIT.  The razor side will hold your DE razor no problem, but the brush side is just a little too narrow to hold my Omega badger brush.</li>
            <li> Returned. Very nice,although too hard to keep shiny clean. Very well made, great quality. Packaged very well, received quickly. Simple return process. Very happy with my first purchase via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not much to review here. It holes up my razor and brush well. The worst thing I can say about it is that the polished metal base hangs over the soft pad on the bottom that is suppose to keep it from scratching up your table surface. So, I wouldn&#x27;t drag it around a lot on your counter... you&#x27;ll likely scratch it.</li>
            <li> I had to put my brush up by the handle/bristles, so it was not held where I wanted it to but I built my shave kit up so this was not too bad.  Great razor stand!</li>
            <li> I bought a Parker silver handle silvertip badger brush ($59) and knew I needed a stand to dry it so it will keep in good working order. I searched here for a stand and this is what I came up. It&#x27;s also the cheapest. There aren&#x27;t actually many options. It looks so beautiful and classy with my silver handle brush and my chrome Edwin Jagger DE89 razor and also my Murker 178. It&#x27;s much fancier than I am!! Highly recommended to any fellow wetshaver. :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for chrome to match your bathroom decor, this isn&#x27;t your razor stand. If you&#x27;re looking for polished nickel, you&#x27;re in luck. You&#x27;d probably be hard pressed to find a polished nickel stand otherwise, especially at such a price.</li>
            <li> I think this is way overpriced for what it is hence the 4 starts....Something like this probably cost less than 5 dollars to make but it does the trick and looks great.</li>
            <li> This looks great on my counter top! I&#x27;ve had no issues with rust/discoloration at all just some hard water spots that rub right off. Just make sure your brush fits!</li>
            <li> works well for Parker 99R razor but for my parker shaving brush it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold it vertical, it tips it off at like 45degrees, which is really annoying</li>
            <li> Appearance:  This is a nice looking stand, and will jazz up your shaving kit while being practical.  No flaking of chrome so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function:  After several weeks this stand has performed flawlessly.  Earlier listed problems with scratching have not been an issue for me.  Perhaps they changed manufacturing processes?  Does not work with all brushes. Large handled brushes will have to be hung where the hair meets the handle.  Not a stand problem per say, but just be aware that there are multiple brush handle sizes.  I initially thought it would be tippy, but that has not proved to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues:  None so far.  This seems to be a good stand at a nice price.</li>
            <li> Its a safety razor and brush stand, hasn&#x27;t rusted and for something as simple as holding your razor and brush I can&#x27;t see spending more.</li>
            <li> BEFORE I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT I THOUGHT   MY BRUSH AND THE RAZOR WOULD NOT FIT   ON THIS STAND BUT I WAS WRONG....IT DID FIT PERFECTLY..    WHY I LIKE THIS STAND...    1. IT IS INEXPENSIVE...    MANY STANDS ARE GOING FOR 30 PLUS DOLLARS... A NO WAY FOR ME   FOR A SIMPLE STAND.. I WANTED SOMETHING TO HOLD THE BRUSH AND   THE RAZOR THAT WAS NOT TOO EXPENSIVE..    2. IT IS FUNCTIONAL...    MANY STANDS HAVE HIGHER PRICE TAGS BUT THEY MAY NOT HOLD   BOTH THE BRUSH AND THE RAZOR, THIS ONE HOLDS BOTH WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED..    3. IT IS STYLISH...    YES IT LOOKS GOOD.. WITH THE CRHOME FINISH LOOKS GREAT WHEN COMBINED WITH   THE RAZOR.. MY WIFE LOVES IT AND LIKES TO SHOW IT OFF.. SHE THINKS   IT IS DEFINETELY A GREAT BUY..    YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH THIS BEAUTY..</li>
            <li> Good fit and finish.  I expect this to last years.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect stand for a shaving brush and razor. I use a Gillette Fusion razor and a standard, wooden-handle shaving brush, and both fit perfectly onto the stand.  Be aware that the actual stand is completely metal unlike the picture which appears to show two sections as white plastic.</li>
            <li> I bought this to crown my newly installed pedestal sink and was disappointed. The foam pad that is glued to the underside is not flush with the chrome base. The metal that is formed to the curvature of the base ends in a fairly sharp edge that could gouge or scratch surfaces quite easily. Seems nice and heavy, but the lame base is a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Probably the least expensive brush/razor stand on the market. It&#x27;s decently made with the exception of the base which really needs a bottom pad. As is, the metal \\&quot;cup\\&quot; edges are exposed and tend to scratch whatever surface it&#x27;s put on. I&#x27;m going to pick up some felt or thin plastic/rubber to fix the problem myself. I&#x27;m not surprised by this as, like most things today, it&#x27;s built to a price point to maximize profit. I&#x27;d be surprised if it costs more than $1 to make so the markup is huge. Colonel Conk sounds like a British brand to me but the stand is made in Taiwan where labor is a lot less expensive than in the UK.    Does it serve the purpose? Well, kinda. It holds my Merkur DE razor just fine. Where either the manufacturer or Amazon falls far short is regarding the product specifications. My Tweezerman brush simply does not fit the way I expected it to. In other words, the narrowest part of the brush handle is still too wide to fit between the prongs on the stand. I can get the brush to fit if I insert it where the bristles meet the handle, which does get the job done. However, it just doesn&#x27;t look right.    Would it have killed either Colonel Conk or Amazon to indicate the maximum handle diameter that will fit? Given the low price and the nuisance, I didn&#x27;t bother returning it, but please be aware that this stand will not work properly with certain brushes.</li>
            <li> If you search for razor stands, you&#x27;ll see that you can spend as much as you want on these things.  I didn&#x27;t need anything fancy, just something to hang my brush and razor on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the Col. Conk stand for over 3 years now and am still pleased.  The chrome is still shiny, and I am anything but diligent in wiping it off or anything.  It has just enough weight to not tip over if it takes a little knock from a Listerine bottle or something.  My Edwin Jagger brush fits fine, and it is usually next to my Edwin Jagger DE89L or a Gillette Superspeed Red Tip.  I have no plans to replace this, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Disposable razors won&#x27;t stay on it. Holds Tweezerman shaving brush well.</li>
            <li> Simple and solid - you need this or something similar if you shave using a brush.  Take care of your tools.</li>
            <li> This device is very shiny and has a good weight to it.  Unfortunately, it was NOT meant for larger razors or brushes.  My Merkur Vision barely fits blade-down, and my ceramic fat-handled brush does not fit at all.    Also, the bottom of this stand has felt on it.  I&#x27;m not sure if your sink ever gets wet, but mine does, and I can easily see a bit of missed water causing this to rot off.    Next time I&#x27;m taking my pogonology gear to the shop to make sure it all fits.</li>
            <li> Nice looking, sturdy razor/brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen some videos/reviews saying that theirs had a \\&quot;nickel\\&quot; looking finish, but mine has a great looking chrome finish. Matches my Merkur 180 Long Handle razor perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery (from amazon) was on time and on point also.</li>
            <li> I will back-up what several other reviewers have stated, that the soft pad on the bottom of the base doesn&#x27;t even touch the counter-top, but the bottom edge of the metal base does. This can be fixed, but no one should have to fix a product to make it function like it is supposed in the first place. The stand is quite heavy though and my safety razor and brush fit nicely in it. I&#x27;m just hoping I will not have the finish coming off like some of the other reviewers have experienced.     My razor: Merkur Model 180 long-handled safety razor  My brush: Kingsley Badger Shave Brush - White #28    Thanks to the other reviewers in helping other Amazon.com shoppers make informed choices!</li>
            <li> I wanted a stand that would hold both my safety razor and brush but most of them on amazon cost more than I&#x27;d like to spend. This stand is not a work of art but it does its job and isn&#x27;t too pricey and doesn&#x27;t look bad doing it. Mine has yet to give me any reason to complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor stand for about a week so I can&#x27;t comment on the long-term durability. I use a Merkur 180 long handle and it fits perfectly. I use the Shea Moisture shave brush (~$9 from Target) and it fits great; no problems with the handle being too large like other reviews. The stand is solidly made with a solid rubber pad on the bottom. Arrived in about 1 week in a small box in bubble wrap. I recommend using a stand like this for your brush; allowing it to dry with the bristles pointing up can swell the handle and cause the bristles to mildew or fall out.</li>
            <li> The stand is good for what it is, but is clearly cheap quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The portion that holds the brush and razor are just a piece of flat metal that has been chromed, it&#x27;s flimsy and easily bent. Does not convey sturdiness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to send this back because the handle of my shaving brush was too thick to fit.</li>
            <li> I like this item. It has cleared some space in my area of the bathroom counter. Of course my wife has more area than I.</li>
            <li> This stand is made well, holds my razor and brush like it should, and even happens to have the same design as the grip of my safety razor, you would think I got it all as a set! I love it and have gotten tons of compliments from people who have gone in to use the bathroom and see it on my sink (kind of a weird thing to compliment right? Guess not a lot of people see these in a young guys bathroom though hahaha!)</li>
            <li> I use to keep my Double Edge Razor and Badger Brush in the bowl I use, but this cleans it up the counter top and looks nice. There is a nice finish to the product and it has a nice heft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for over 4 months now and it looks just like it did when I got it.    A few things to consider:    Don&#x27;t hang your brushes or razors while still dripping wet - this is not good for them or the stand.  The stand should be kept out of standing water - the base will rust.  The stand should be wiped off occasionally to prevent water spots/build up.    I am planning to buy 2 more for my sons.</li>
            <li> A fine quality stand that adds elegance to the counter!</li>
            <li> This is also another gift I purchased for my son.</li>
            <li> sorry to hear the neg reviews for this stand. I bought mine Dec 19 2011, so I&#x27;ve had it a little over two months. Maybe a little to soon for a good review but its been great so far. If you want a better stand its going to cost you around $100.00. I know because I checked it out before buying this one. Yes, when I get it wet I dry it off after shaving. Not hard to figure out you should do this knowing it only cost $20.00. Results so far: NO Rust. No problem with base scratching vanity. I have three shave brushes and it fits all of them. One exception, today I bought a Parker with a crome handle that is quite heavy. I took it to the shop, bent the prongs just a little and now even it fits just fine. So as far as one review to it being made of pewter I think not. Ever try to bend Pweter?? End results: if anything does go wrong I can buy 5 of these for the same price as one for $100.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: thie is Sept. 16th 2013: Brush &amp; razor stand is still holding up good. No rust, and looks just as good as when I bought it</li>
            <li> Fit the brush and razor easily and looks great.  It also looks like it will last.  Heavy weight and durable.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand at Merz Apothecary in Chicago. It is a simple thing - a stand to hold your razor and shaving brush. It does this simple task with elegance. I like the clean polished look and the solid, heavy base. Unfortunately my razors are \\&quot;user grade\\&quot;, meaning they aren&#x27;t all that pretty. They work well, but te stand is the best looking part of my set up.    There are a lot of different styles out there. This one suited my needs and I pulled the trigger. I don&#x27;t regret it.    I haven&#x27;t had any issue with corrosion yet, but if I do I will revise my review here and report it on my blog at [...]. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Fits both my Merkur and my vintage Gillette.  Holds all my brushes big and small.  Looks good on the counter top with my kit in it.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about buying this stand after reading some of the reviews, but it turned out to be perfect out of the box. Will see how it stands up (pun!) over time. Finish is good, I like the size, and it fits all of my razors perfectly. I read that some people had issues with the brush holder, I use an Omega 63171 and the stand grips it fine by the handle, as designed. Perfect little stand coupled with amazons great shipping and price give me no reason not to rate 5 stars at this time.</li>
            <li> The Colonel&#x27;s stand is a handsome looking stand that compliments any razor and brush.  The finish is very nicely done and the knurling matches very well with my Merkur HD.  Its performance is dead on... It holds the razor and the brush in a fine position for air drying.</li>
            <li> The stand works great.   I have been using it for about 3 months now, and so far so good.  For the price, is a great stand.</li>
            <li> When compared to other razor stands, the Colonel Conk 775 does exactly what it needs to at a reasonable price. I will periodically swap out razors &amp; brushes for others in my collection. The model 775 stand works perfectly with all of them thus far. This includes both modern and vintage razors with handles of all lengths (I&#x27;ve used razors ranging from small vintage Gillette Tech razors and the Edwin Jagger DE89 to longer handled razors like the Gillette Super Adjustable &amp; Edwin Jagger Chatsworth). As for brushes, I&#x27;ve had no trouble hanging brushes like the Tweeserman and Edwin Jagger badger brushes. However, brushes with thicker handles may not fit well or may need to be hung at the knot rather than at the handle. In fact, a handle as wide as the Tweeserman brush is about as thick as it will take if you intend to hang it by the handle. As for reports of corrosion, I have yet to have this problem. Then again, I&#x27;m conscious of other people&#x27;s reports of this and therefore I make sure to keep it clean &amp; dry. The chrome finish is attractive and goes well with most razors (particularly well with other chrome plated razors).</li>
            <li> A very good looking razor and brush holder! Fit&#x27;s my long handled Merkur and Tweezerman Brush perfectly with a bit of room to spare. You could use this holder with a much longer handled razor if you wished. The brush holder was a little small; I have a brush from The Art of Shaving and that brush was too wide for the brush holder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a compact design and fits well in my bathroom cabinet.  But the brush side of the holder is far too narrow to hold my brush.  The razor side holds my razor fine, but the brush side won&#x27;t hold.  Others have noted this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I will look for a brand name set of brush and stand.</li>
            <li> Built solid and sturdy. Does what I got it to do. Bit pricey, but hopefully it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It fits my Tweezerman brush and Edwin Jagger DE perfectly. Very attractive to boot. I am not all that concerned with the chrome pitting....I need it for function more than anything. For this price point, I am happy with it. I knocked a star off for the bottom. I would have preferred something more non skid but I can remedy that myself with a quick mod.</li>
            <li> I just received the stand today along with the badger brush &amp; Van Der Hagen Shave Bowl &amp; Soap set.  One of the things I was concerned about was something that can&#x27;t be shown in a photo - the base being properly weighted so the stand doesn&#x27;t have a tendency to tip over.  It&#x27;s perfect, &amp; it also fits the Gilette Fusion razors.</li>
            <li> Simple. Classic. Low profile. Looks brilliant with a nice chrome safety razor and shave brush.</li>
            <li> This chromed razor stand is a nice one for the money. As I am a  new returnee to DE shaving this stand is nicely affordable. It&#x27;s heavy enough to be stable on the corner of my sink.    It fits a Gillette Black Beauty DE razor well but I think the brush holder side  could be larger to accommodate the brush handle.  My brush fits well in it at the junction of its bristles &amp; handle, however.    Want good function with a nice look?  Buy this one.  Want upscale &amp; \\&quot;gourmet\\&quot; shaving accoutrements?  Buy a fancier, different one.</li>
            <li> What see is what you get.  I&#x27;ve had the stand for about a year now and it still has yet corrode, so I assume it is a decent stainless steel.  The thin metal part that holds the razor / brush could be a little beefier to make the overall package more attractive, but it functions just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a nice solid, good looking stand for your DE razor and brush. The base of the unit is heavy weight so it won&#x27;t tip over....very important. It looks good too. There are other more expensive stands that may look fancier but I think you&#x27;ll be pleased with the look of the stand.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be much handier than I expected.  The base is heavier than expected and prevents easy knock over.  The knurling makes it easy to move with a wet hand  and it does keep the razor and brush in better shape by letting them drain and dry. I find that makes the brush and razor  more visible to my eye when I&#x27;m stumbling around half asleep.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had this stand for three months and already the base is corroded. It is leaving rust stains all over my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Nice looking stand, but a little unstable. High-quality chrome. Tips and turns easily. Still, not a bad purchase; might buy again.</li>
            <li> - Nice heavy feel&lt;br /&gt;- Merkur HD and Baxters shave brush fit well&lt;br /&gt;- Material on bottom is slip-resistant, but rubber would be better&lt;br /&gt;- Looks very nice in person</li>
            <li> Build quality of this piece is very good it is a very sturdy stand and looks really great if bought it less than a month ago and i have noticed that when it came to me it was a beautiful silver color and now it is more or a yellow/light gold in thought that this was a bit weird had I known it would do this is would have still bought it because I think it is still worth the money</li>
            <li> This stand adds an element of style and elegance to the bathroom. Its reasonable and convenient. Works like a champ.</li>
            <li> This is a well-constructed item. It feels very solid and has a very professional look. It will last a lot longer than I will.</li>
            <li> The finish is good and bright. Where I live at it&#x27;s hard to get supplies for wet shaving unless you order it or go to a bigger city.</li>
            <li> I try to review all products that I order, however some things theirs just not much to say. This is a shaving stand. it holds a razor and a brush. will lit rust? Probability being that it will most likely sit next to my sink. does it sit flat? yes, no issues with the foam base. The big question is does it hold my brush? Yes, i have ordered the Semogue 2015 Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush and it fits great! 5 stars for being what it said it was.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as part of a birthday gift.  He recommended a 5-star rating.  He has the Tweezerman shaving brush and it fits perfectly on the wider side and it matches his razor.  It&#x27;s not too tall that it doesn&#x27;t fit in our medicine cabinet and has a disc of flexible foam on the bottom to give it stability.    I may replace this in the future to get him a fancy one from a specialty shop, but this works great and is a necessity for keeping his shaving stuff neat.</li>
            <li> Beatiful stand i think is a bit expensive but it should last you for years.</li>
            <li> This stand works fine and, in my opinion, is priced reasonably.  It holds my Van Der Hagen brush one one end and a Merkur 180 or a Merkur Futur (depending on which one I am using) on the other.  The bottom of the stand is heavy and the stand is very stable.  I keep it in the medicine cabinet oriented sideways.</li>
            <li> Excellent item, very stylish and well made, looks wonderful and is quite useful as well, the slot for the brush could stand to be a little bit bigger but other than that it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday. Its very nice. Buy it if you need a good brush/safty razor stand. I like it and its pretty hefty. should fit mostly all brushes and safty razors</li>
            <li> Bought this one to hold my safety razor.  Works well.  Sturdy and good looking.  I guess it is a matter of preference, but I like the way it looks.  Recomend this one to those of you using safety razors.</li>
            <li> Great little stand to keep things organized. Would recommend purchasing one of these to keep your razor and brush in one neat place.</li>
            <li> holds my Parker razor and badger brush.    gets quite dirty looking very very quickly but does not corrode.    5/5 if only it could make me a coffee...</li>
            <li> I recently bought a chrome razor, shaving mug and shaving brush. It stands to reason that the stand should be chrome as well. Not only was the most stylish in my opinion, but it was $100 to $200 cheaper then the other chrome stands on this site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very sturdy and with a little care should last a lifetime. I&#x27;m very happy with mine!</li>
            <li> Excellent. This stand works great with the combination Tweezerman Shaving Brush and the Merkur Model 180 Long Handle Safety Razor to keep both off the counter and also make a display statement in the bathroom. Quality made of stainless steel that should last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and really have very few complaints. The main being that the razor I bought (Merkur 180) doesn&#x27;t quite \\&quot;fit\\&quot; onto that part of the stand. The razor does not like to hang perfectly perpendicular to the prongs but always at a slightly \\&quot;off\\&quot; angle. But that&#x27;s just aesthetics and really does what it is supposed to and the brush part works perfectly with the Tweezerman brush. Also the finish has a yellowish tinge compared to the razor. But I&#x27;m nitpicking. I recently switched to shaving with a safety razor and I really enjoy. At least as a sort of beginner set, this stand is more than enough to satisfy. It is very stable and serves its function.</li>
            <li> I liked the chrome finish as soon as I saw it - as it goes well with my old Gillette razors.  It adds a nice touch to my bathroom counter top.  The price was right too!</li>
            <li> Works well, fits my razor and shaving brush, base is heavy so its stable.  Good product !!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job.Plus it looks nice for the cost you can&#x27;t beat it.If you are looking for a stand get it.</li>
            <li> While the color doesn&#x27;t match the razor I bought, it suits its purpose as an attractive way to hold the razor and brush. I read a few reviews before I bought it that the chrome will start coming off.  I figure if you don&#x27;t use chemicals to clean it, it should be fine.  My husband was very pleased by it.</li>
            <li> Made my razor and brush purchase complete. It looks awesome in my bathroom and was everything I expected and more.</li>
            <li> This chrome stand is perfect for my shaving gear. It holds and matches my Parker Double Edge Razor PERFECTLY as well as my Art of Shaving brush. Taking up little space, it helps organize the clutter in the bathroom and every guest whom comes over always comments on how nice the stand looks on the shelf above our sink. Now if only they had one that holds the modern cartridge razors my wife uses!</li>
            <li> 4 star, it functions as its supposed to; doesn&#x27;t do anything new. Fits tweezerman badger brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first razor stand.  Judging by the quality of it, it will be very long time until I need another one, if ever. Edit: It&#x27;s now 2015 and this stand is still almost as good of shape as when I got it, very impressed.    The silver metallic look to it is very classy.    The stand has a very good weight to it; in order for it to be knocked over, something would have to hit it fairly hard.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues of it just falling over on its own.    The bottom doesn&#x27;t scratch the counter-top either.    My razor is a long-hand double-edge Merkur razor and the razor fits just fine in it.  My shaving brush fits just fine as well.    All in all, no complaints.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the bottom base that connects to the metal contour base isn&#x27;t flush. Other then that I like the weight of it, but it would be nice if it was more even, for the price paid.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job. I just got a wet-shaving set up with a Merkur 34C and a Tweezerman&#x27;s brush from Amazon - both fit fine. Should fit almost any razor and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more do you say about a stand? I can&#x27;t see anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with a Merker DE shaving handle and Escali brush. It hold them both perfectly and looks nice on my counter. The bottom of the stand has a sort of grippy rubber base to prevent it from rusting (most importantly) and to keep it from sliding around. The whole stand can be washed in the sink if you need.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the base is a rubber disc that is supposed to extend beyond the sharp metal rim, so that the rubber disc rests upon the countertop. The stand I received had the rubber base recessed several millimeters within the base. The result is that the sharp metal rim rests on the countertop, scratching it. I returned this item and ordered the [[ASIN:B004RQ4ACW Deluxe Stainless Steel 4 Prong Safety Razor and Shave Brush Shave Stand]]. It does not have a rubber base but the stainless steel base looks smooth. I have not yet received it to file a review.</li>
            <li> I use this to hang my brush and razor after shaving.  I keep them there until the next time I shave.  It hangs the brush so it dries properly.  The stainless steel looks good on the bathroom counter too.</li>
            <li> This safety razor stand is very, very, good!  I recently purchased a very large safety razor (Merkur Futur) and the handle is very large.  However, because the razor stand has a large opening, the Merkur Futur fit in it very nicely where the balance is in the handle of the razor.  As a precaution, I put a small amount of wax on it to protect it from water/moisture.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a nice manly stand. It is shiny and polished but has an almost industrial look to it. This looks great by the sink and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I had bought this stand at least 4-5 months ago. It was working out well, till I noticed a small hint of rust near the base. I unscrewed it to find even more rust. I guess you pay for what you get. Will be trying for another stand.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying a stainless steel version of this. I bought one about 2 years ago, and it is now pitted with rust all over. I have never left it wet after shaving, it just has not stood up to the humidity in the bathroom. It does its job great, and looks nice, until it starts rusting.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo10NRHPJ9Q8HQV]]The Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor and Brush stand has a weighted base and a nice chrome finish. Most razors should fit without any problem but some brushes may not fit. The diameter of the brush handle is the determining factor; some have handles with a larger diameter than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The width of the brush slot is 1\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The width of the razor slot is .5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your brush handle or razor is too wide, it will not fit properly in the stand. I demonstrate this in my video review. If the Colonel Conk Evernice fits your brush and razor, and most will, it presents an attractive and reasonably priced solution for keeping your shaving area neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: August, 2011 - I have not noticed even a speck of corrosion on my stand. Still looks as shiny as the day I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: December 1, 2011 - Sad to say that the chrome has started to pit on this. Both the base and the top part of the holder have multiple pits that are forming. Drat. Consequently, I am knocking my rating to 3 stars. It&#x27;s OK but the chrome is just not that high of quality otherwise it would not be pitting and corroding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: December 6, 2011 - I&#x27;m happy to say that I had a very pleasant phone call with Sharla at Colonel Conk. I explained the corrosion issue to her and she has agreed to replace the stand explaining that occasionally the plating process can be affected by dust or dirt on the metal prior to plating, I&#x27;m really happy that their customer service was good so I am restoring a star to my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 8/2/2013 - I&#x27;m happy to report that the original stand has not really gotten any worse. I stil use it and the replacement stand is still in the box. I&#x27;m quite happy with this even though it did start to develop some corrosion.. but it has stabilized and not really gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> I mean, how could anyone not like this?  It does its job of holding my razor and my brush.  That&#x27;s it, and that&#x27;s why I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by the weight and apparent quality of this stand. It&#x27;s also made in Taiwan rather than Red China, an important consideration for me. Fits my Rooney Style 2 Small Super Silvertip shaving brush perfectly. If the finish holds up, I&#x27;ll increase my rating to five stars. I was pleased upon opening the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 02/18/2011: Finishing holding up well, still looks great. I&#x27;ve noticed all the reviews that say the opening is too small for most brushes. Of course it is too small if you try to hang the brush by the handle. The brush hangs by the knot, NOT by the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 05/06/2011: Finish still holding up well. Have increased my rating to five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 01/21/2012: Finish still holding up well. No rust or other degradation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Query whether this is the same stand as [[ASIN:B003BHCAGQ Deluxe Stainless Steel Safety Razor and Shaving Brush Stand from Super Safety Razors]], just sold by a different vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 08/17/2012: Very small spots of rust beginning to appear on the base of the stand where water from the razor drips down and slowly dries. These spots are tiny and barely noticeable but the finish is so thin they cannot be buffed out. The stand is still serviceable and looks OK. It took 18 months for any problem to develop and it is minor.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, handsome piece of work. It just looks real nice and I highly recommend it.Brush and razor fit in it really good.</li>
            <li> I have four badger brushes (an A of E large, an A of E travel, a Parker chrome and a Rooney Emillion 2) and this holder fits NONE of them.  The slot is way too narrow. Further, the opening for the razor will fit only the slenderest of handles...forget a Merkur HD, etc.  A Futur? fuggadaboutit!     Plus, the foam pad that is glued to the underside is not flush with the chrome base. The metal that is formed to the curvature of the base ends in a fairly sharp edge that could gouge or scratch surfaces quite easily.    Sending back to Amazon for a refund.  This is a defective, poorly designed product.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas along with a new brush.  It looked great for a week or two, but by the third week it started to rust.  It is now VERY rusty in LOTS of spots and there are lots of pits in the chrome.  If you used this on the sink it might hold up better, but in the shower there is no way.  for the money I had hoped for better.</li>
            <li> For me this is little pricey but it was worth buying.&lt;br /&gt;It performs it&#x27;s job well. Also quality is good.</li>
            <li> Not shoddy.  Connections secure w/ enough weight to keep from being pulled when accessing razor.  I like it.</li>
            <li> It was what I&#x27;ve expected.  It should be better if the shaving brush side,   was a bit wider, so it can hold everytype of shaving brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice chrome finish, has a nice weight to it. A couple things keep it from being perfect however. First the base while hefty has a hollow bottom with a foam style pad. While it will be gentle on a counter top I would be careful with it sucking up moisture, take care to make sure the sink under it stays dry. Second the brush holder is fairly narrow, it will only hold my brush by the top of the bristles instead of the handle, not a major deal but something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a nice product that does the job it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
            <li> This stand is one excellent piece of equipment for a mans razor and brush. It has a heavy base, providing great stability. The stand breaks down for easy packing during travels. I would recommend this stand to anyone with a razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Very well built and looks great!</li>
            <li> I had put purchasing a razor/brush stand off, simply because I didn&#x27;t want to sink a bunch of money into shaving.  However, the stand made a lot of sense to help keep the razor off of dirty surfaces and allow the brush to dry easier.    The stand is well-made, delivered as promised and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  There are several other stands for two to three times the price of this one, and I think this stand is as good or better.</li>
            <li> Nice but tends to rust and need you to clean it off a bit to much but for the price decent.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It holds my razor&lt;br /&gt;It holds my brush&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s design matches my razor and brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It twists together at the base, and I have noticed it get&#x27;s lose all the time.&lt;br /&gt;Under the base is a large Nut that holds it together, this nut has gotten extremely rusted in one year (You can&#x27;t see it, as it is hidden, so that is good).&lt;br /&gt;The chrome corroded quickly, while my razor and brushes chrome show no sign of corrosion, making me think this stand uses low quality metals.</li>
            <li> It does a good job at holding my Merkur 180 and my Tweezerman brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest gripe is the base already looks kinda nasty. It is turning green in spots and just looks dirty even after cleaning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d only get this again if it were actually chromed and not some shiny metal.</li>
            <li> This item is made of nice heavy chromed stainless steel. Easy to screw together. Holds my Merkur Model 180 razor and Escali Badger brush.</li>
            <li> I like the razor stand.  It&#x27;s heavy and looks great in the bathroom.  It holds both the razor and the brush well.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and fits well with my brush and razor.  Great deal for the price and quality you get.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand about a year and a half ago and it has held up very well. Mine has none of the flaking or corroding that others have mentioned. I keep it on a small shelf away from the sink to keep it dry which probably helps. The shine has held up very well with minimum maintenance. I wipe it down once in awhile to keep the dust off it and that&#x27;s it. It holds my Edwin Jagger DE89 razor very well and my Edwin Jagger brush although it&#x27;s a bit tight.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this stand and just ordered another one for a new razor and brush.</li>
            <li> This is a nice simple razor stand.  Things to note.  Any water on this will appear as water marks. This can be easily cleared up with some water and vinegar. Also you should check on the size of the brush holder.  My brush is a bit bigger then expected so this is just a tiny bit small for me.</li>
            <li> This is a well made chromed stand by Col. Conk - it&#x27;s properly weighted and I have no worries that it will topple. The finish remains nice and it does it&#x27;s job well - it matches my chromed double edge razor nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very minor quibble of mine is that it fits my brush VERY snugly, to the point that I worry I&#x27;m marring the finish of the shave brush handle by putting it in, and it&#x27;s not that wide of a brush (SimplyBeautiful Basic 100% Pure Badger.)  It&#x27;s not a huge deal, but I would have liked to have just a tiny bit more room for the brush. I won&#x27;t modify the stand at all because the chrome would be ruined if I did, but overall it&#x27;s a very solid stand, and the price is quite fair.</li>
            <li> Perfect! It fits my shaving brush and 50&#x27;s Gillette safety razor and never even teeters.</li>
            <li> This is a good stand.  It&#x27;s actually fairly well made and has a nice finish. Considering the high price, however, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s a great deal.  It&#x27;s simply hard to find razor stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and have noticed no pitting or corrosion yet.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]] is a great way to show off and keep your razor and brush looking good for many years.    I have a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] and [[ASIN:B000LY2AKI Merkur Classic Safety Razor, Straight - #178 - Made In Germany]] on it and they fit nicely.  The stand&#x27;s finish matches the Merkur&#x27;s razor very well.    The product is made in Taiwan and seems like good quality. I was taken back a bit by the price, but it isn&#x27;t like I am going to have to buy a new stand again soon.    It does exactly what is was designed to do:   (1) Hold a Brush   (2) Hold a Razor    Overall, I would recommend this stand.  For the same price you can find stands that only hold a brush so having one that holds a razor as well is a bonus.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice piece, not very fancy.  It gets the job done well without taking up to much counter space.</li>
            <li> This Razor Stand is good quality and it gets wet and doesnt get affected by it either. Is good, i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband has enjoyed his. It holds his razor and shaving brush. It loves things being organized and having a specific place like this provides.</li>
            <li> I have had the Col. Conk shaving stand for about 15 minutes, and am now about to pack it up and send it back to Amazon. Here&#x27;s a quick set of observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Ir arrived nicely boxed and well-packaged for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s a nice shiny chrome, and appears to be well made.&lt;br /&gt;* The problem some people seem to have had with the padding on the bottom not touching the surface certainly wasn&#x27;t an issue with the one they sent me.&lt;br /&gt;* It accommodates my fairly heavy safety razor well (I use a Merkur Progressive adjustable #570), and didn&#x27;t fall over with just the razor on board, although it was beginning to be a little bit unsteady.&lt;br /&gt;* There is no way it fits my GBS Silvertip badger brush, so back it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What might have been a useful product for me in fact is just a disappointment. Moreover, this is a disappointment that could&#x27;ve been avoided.  Shaving brushes come in a wide variety of shapes and diameters, as well as quality. Had the product description given some indication about the maximum diameter for the brush, it could&#x27;ve saved us all the inconvenience and expense of having to return this to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, four stars for quality, but -1 star for the inconvenience of having to take this thing to the local UPS drop-off.</li>
            <li> Nice stand, well built, solid, doesn&#x27;t fall over.  Looks nice sitting on the counter - like and old barber shop look.</li>
            <li> I have an [[ASIN:B000CB8Q4Y Omega Professional Boar Hair Shaving Brush]] along with a [[ASIN:B0022R966S Merkur Standard Safety Razor #33C]] that I use with this stand.      The slot for the brush is way too narrow.  The brush can not be hung by the handle like many others.  The brush has to be squeezed and rotated into the slot to (1) get the brush in the holder and (2) keep the hair from being flaired/seperated from the rest of the bloom.  Even the cheap [[ASIN:B001A3HPT0 Van Der Hagen (VDH) brush]] will not fit.  The Razor however fits with no problem.    If you have anything other than a small travel-sized brush, don&#x27;t expect it to fit properly.    I am planning on purchasing a different stand that will hold my brush, Merkur, and my new Straight.  This one is heading for the Thrift Store.</li>
            <li> I have only had the stand for a week or two, but it&#x27;s working great for me! The stand has a nice weight to it so that I don&#x27;t accidentally knock it over while removing/replacing my shaving gear. It holds my Crabtree &amp; Evelyn shaving brush and my [[ASIN:B000QYEK88 Merkur 34C]] without any issues, and it looks nice and shiny!</li>
            <li> Wounderful simple product does what it should. Although it&#x27;s true that not all brushes might fit. It&#x27;s about an inch wide so measure up the base or anywhere around your brush to estimate how it&#x27;s going to hang from the stand.</li>
            <li> Bought for use with the Parker 99R Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor. Great product - finish is excellent - sturdy, handsome stand on our vanity. Great price.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not too much to say here. It&#x27;s a shiny chrome stand that holds my brush and razor. It&#x27;s simple and clean looking, and my items fit well. It&#x27;s fairly well made and solid, but it doesn&#x27;t sit quite level and wobbles a bit if you bump it.</li>
            <li> I love this stand because it has a simple, yet eye-catching design. It displays my brush and razor nicely. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> bought this stand for my badger-hair brush and mach 3 razor. It doesn&#x27;t hold the mach 3 razor too well, the balance isn&#x27;t quite right, but it manages ok</li>
            <li> Well balanced, nice Chrome. This works with both my Colonel Conk brush and my cheaper brushes. It also works well with both of my safety razors. Not a ton to say past - &#x27;It just works&#x27; I am particularly fond of the fact that it&#x27;s so well balanced, removing the brush or razor doesn&#x27;t make it want to tip over. Add to that, it&#x27;s priced very inexpensively and you have a must buy.</li>
            <li> Just bought this product last week and it now sits on the bathroom sink.  Well-made and with a little heft to it, it stands ready to hold my safety razor and soap brush at the ready.  No more hunting around for where I sat my razor down.</li>
            <li> This colonel conk stand is beautiful and very functional as well as priced reasonably, I use it daily and it stays clean and bright.</li>
            <li> Bought this stand for my merkur 180 (23c) razor and escali badger brush. The stands works as advertised, holds both razor and brush nicely. However, I no longer needed it once I returned the horrible escali badger brush (see review).</li>
            <li> I got this because I needed something to hold my shaving brush and this was the best compromise between cost and appearance. It does what I got it for very well.    However, I keep a Mach 3 around for days when I need to shave but don&#x27;t have time to use a straight razor. I have tried hanging the Mach 3 off this stand every which way and it just won&#x27;t stay put. It always manages to twist itself out and fall within a few minutes. It&#x27;s not a big deal, since I didn&#x27;t buy it to hold the razor, but it would be nice if it did.</li>
            <li> Is a great stand and looks very nice. Holds and mathces my Merkur Razor nicely. It is just a little small for my cheap boar brush but I&#x27;m hoping it fits better when I get an EJ Super Badger.</li>
            <li> I just recently migrated to the classic way of shaving and picked up this stand to hold my new razor and brush.  I think it&#x27;a great value and very stylish.  It has good weight to it and isn&#x27;t easily knocked over.  Like any shiny metal drip spots will develop if water gets on it, but are easily wiped off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than 4 months and the chrome plating is flaking off and corroding off of the entire stand. Do not buy unless you want to replace again in a few months.</li>
            <li> The stand works, and for the price you really can&#x27;t be too disappointed, but I found the base to be a little wobbly and lacking in weight.  The chrome plating is doing fine on mine after 8 months of use,  so I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.  3 for succeeding at holding my brush and razor, and an extra star for value (only because I couldn&#x27;t give it 3.5)</li>
            <li> This is a great piece.  Only gave it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t really fit my brush.  I have a standard &amp;#34;the art of shaving&amp;#34; mole-hair brush.  I have to force it into place.  Other than that....constructed nicely.</li>
            <li> I had to return this one for another type.  My Parker brush would not fit.  (Sad face)  I loved the design, however.</li>
            <li> I love the organization and classy looking display  this adds to our bathroom counter top. High quality and great value product.</li>
            <li> Looks great.  Holds the razor and brush perfectly.  No complaints.  Solid construction. Would recommend to a friend if they were in the market for one.</li>
            <li> It looks okay but is a poorly designed product. I tried fitting my Mach-3 razor on the razor part of the stand but it doesn&#x27;t work - you&#x27;d think they would have tried the stand with a few different typed of razors! Returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one of those guys that buys his DE razors in a set with a brush and a base. As a result, I have a collection of razors and brushes that sit in a drawer and I rotate between these every month or so. This stand coordinates well with my new and vintage styled DE razors (even the fat ones). It holds most small and medium brushes as well. It has a heavy and sturdy base which rarely falls over and is easy to polish up when it gets dirty. This is one of the best bases available and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s solid, looks great, and the base is weighted, so if only put a razor or shaving brush on one side it won&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li> A piece of quality antique !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is more of a decoration to my bathroom than just a stand. Spells quality all around.</li>
            <li> great for the shaving brush and razor,  cleans up good, just the right size, mailed product very fast, would buy again</li>
            <li> Bought this to hold my Merkur safety razor and badger brush. It fits them both perfectly and looks great. I believe this is a universal holder and will hold pretty much all brushes and razors (even cartridge ones). Heavy duty metal looks very professional.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my brush and razor. It holds the razor just fine, but could stand to be 1/8&amp;#34; wider on the brush side. I still make it work, but just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It holds a razor, and a brush.  Decent mass to it, so it&#x27;s not going to go flying across the room if you look at it wrong.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> solid design, made in Taiwan. The smaller hook is not big enough to hold my thick razor handle. But I use the larger hook. Not a problem for me. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Feels and looks like it is built well.  When your brush and DE razor are hanging on this by your sink, it looks like a gentlemens bathroom. Get one.</li>
            <li> Stand looks nice and holds my Merkur 34C HD razor just fine.  However, the Vulfix 404 shave brush I have does not fit like a brush should.  Instead of hanging by the top of the handle, it rests right where the hair and handle meet.  Manufacturer/seller should state what size brushes it fits......not all brushes are the same.</li>
            <li> excellent..looks clean and sparkles..adds a touch of class to a drab countertop..thanks for your prompt service also..</li>
            <li> Great stand, low cost, what else do you want in a razor/brush stand?  It is solidly constructed and does a great job of just standing there displaying your shaving gear.     I think my old Mach 5 is jealous, so I keep it on a different shelf.  I don&#x27;t want its plastic tears down playing the marvelous shine the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand gives off.     Buy this stand, you&#x27;ll love it. Trust me Ah ha ha ha!!</li>
            <li> This stand looks so fancy.  I have a badger brush and a chrome Merkur HD and it just looks so old school and fancy at the same time.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it&#x27;d be great for my Double edge safety razor and it looks nice but the first thing I noticed is that when placed on the counter or wherever you will place it, it is lopsided. The base that is comes with has a slight curve to it that causes this, whether your have something hanging from it or not. When you do put your safety razor or brush on this it will cause them to slowly slip off over the next few days tilting towards the heavier of the two items.</li>
            <li> I purchased this believing it would suit my needs for the Parker Brush I purchased ([[ASIN:B004U6P0NW B004U6P0NW]]  Sadly it has too small of an opening for the brush and has been sitting on a shelf since I purchased it.  It was also nothing short of a nightmare getting the product from the seller too.  They somehow lost the order and then most likely shipped it to someone else.  I did finally receive it a month or so after ordering it.  i wish I could send it back, but to much time has elapsed since my purchase date.</li>
            <li> He loves the new razor/brush holder. It will prolong the life of the brush and looks very nice on the vanity.</li>
            <li> I really like the overall design of this unit. The hooks fit my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] by the handle perfectly. The entire upper portion of the unit feels like it is made of strong metal. However, the base of the unit is a cheap and hollow chrome casing with a small weight and foam pad inside. The worst part is that the foam does not cover the entire base of the unit and the metal  touches the ground more than the padding. If they would fix that I would really like this stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my own attempt to fix the base of the stand I used a combination of [[ASIN:B000BOB8P6 Henkel 431348 Loctite 2-Ounce Epoxy Putty]] and [[ASIN:B001F57ZPW Henkel 1087306 Loctite 2-Ounce Fun-Tak Mounting Putty, Blue]]. Essentially I added a layer of epoxy putty to the small weight and then sealed what was left with the fun-tak. I&#x27;m very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it .</li>
            <li> I like this stand. It looks nice, and holds my brush (Tweezerman) and razor (1954 Gillette SuperSpeed) just fine. Mine shows no noticeable corrosion after 10 months, but I keep it on my dresser, not in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied. If it corrodes when stored in the bathroom, I will buy something else, but for now its fine!</li>
            <li> Does what I bought it for. Looks good. Has a good weight.</li>
            <li> This holds my Merkur perfectly, along with my brush.  It looks fantastic on the sink counter.  I took it apart and found no rust whatsoever.  Cleans easy and shines nice.  Buy it.</li>
            <li> Nice, solid little stand.  Looks great and the finish if fantastic.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this for me as a gift to go with my badger brush &amp; Edwin Jagger DE 89 razor.  It&#x27;s well made and a great product.  It holds both my brush and razor well and looks great doing it.  Overall, a great addition to my shaving collection!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the good quality of this stand.  I looks elegant but will be useable for years to come.  Sturdy but attractive.  heavier then it looks.  Over all impressed.</li>
            <li> The stand arrived with a loose base. I twisted the base to tighten it and now it&#x27;s sturdy. I was a little disappointed that my Tweezerman brush didn&#x27;t fit. I had to force the brush into the holder, slightly damaging the brush handle. It now has small grooves on either side of the handle so it&#x27;ll slide into the holder a little easier now. My Gillette Super Speed razor fits on the stand. The only problem I had with the holder for the razor was the prongs were uneven. Overall, it&#x27;s a nice looking stand and if you can overlook these minor issues it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> I wanted/needed a stand for my new safety-razor and brush setup.  I didn&#x27;t want/need to pay $100+ for a name-brand model or something complicated.  So I picked this one up based on the price and the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll add my 5-star review to the list.  It&#x27;s well made and has a nice, simple design that matches a variety of razor types very well.  And a little nit-picky thing for me, it came assembled, wrapped nicely in a box.  When items like these come in pieces, packed cheaply, it really takes away from the product, in my opinion.  Not his one, it&#x27;s all set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure if the razor/brush holders were a standard size and would fit mine.  Either they are, or mine are just the &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; size, since they both fit perfectly in the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice, but be careful if you are buying the [[ASIN:B000K8FUFM Omega 13109 Creamy Curved Handle Pure Badger Shaving Brush]].  It will hold the brush, but not the way it was meant to [It holds it where the brush meets the handle, not at the handle].</li>
            <li> Basic holder. Does it&#x27;s thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/4/17&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 4 years since I purchased this.&lt;br /&gt;The chrome began to bubble about 2 years ago.. and now I see the chrome is peeling off at the base.</li>
            <li> This is a great looking stand.  I have a Muhle razor and a Vufix badger brush.  My brush has an hour glass shaped handle and it fits nicely by the handle.  The stability is very good and weight is hefty.  I bought this to replace a holder and I prefer this one because it holds my brush by the handle and it is chrome.  If you have a medium brush and it is hour glass shaped handle this is a very nice apparatus for your razer and brush.  It really does look great and it is much nicer than my previous stand.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels more manly than displaying the tools you use to shave to your friends and family, and what better way to do that than on this shiny stand?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for a couple years, and just now bought a stand for my brush and razor.  I had some cheap brushes before, but I got one that was actually pretty good so I wanted to make it last longer by doing it the right way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand looks good, fits my razor and my brush with enough clearance to the bottom of the stand that I know it will fit longer ones as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great little piece. I bought my dad a badger hair brush and a Merkur razor for christmas. I got this stand so that he can display both pieces. This looks great and is made of great quality. The bottom of the stand also has some weight to it so it sits really solid. However, the side for the razor was a little tight so it didn&#x27;t sit exactly perfect but close enought. All in all its a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy and stylish stand. It should hold any razor and brush without a problem. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I could not use this stand. The rubber on the bottom of the base was uneven (bowed out in the middle) and caused the stand to wobble. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews with this same issue. I wound up purchasing the Frank Shaving Chrome brush and Razor Shaving Stand #35 and it is perfect. That stand is here: [[ASIN:B009ERABTU Frank Shaving Chrome brush and Razor Shaving Stand #35]]</li>
            <li> 3 years later, the metal &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; is starting to peel off.  Poor quality for something that just sits there most of the time and barely gets touched.  The finish is coming off around the base of the rod that attaches to the bottom base.</li>
            <li> great to hold brush and razor. easy to keep clean. like the appearance of it since its in chrome. received in a timely manner</li>
            <li> Received the shaving stand in very short order and it is already put to use.  Thank you for this fine product.</li>
            <li> This razor stand serves quite well, and the slight upturn of the arms hold a brush and razor securely (assuming you aren&#x27;t shaking and waving it around!). The base has nice heft to it to keep the stand upright. Needs to be wiped down regularly to keep it from looking too dingy because of the bright chrome finish that shows grunge quickly.</li>
            <li> The finish is a sticker or something fake.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and it&#x27;s showing its age.  There are rust spots and the finish is flaking off.  I don&#x27;t touch this other than for basic cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does its job in holding a razor and a brush and looked good new.  Other than that, there is nothing else to really say about this product.</li>
            <li> This is very needed if you do this kind of shaving.  Looks really nice, holds your brush and razor well.  Perfect fit actually.  This is really helpful with the brush, because it allows it to dry.  I just laid it on the side of the sink, but this works much better and looks good too.  High quality!</li>
            <li> This fits my husband&#x27;s safety razor and brush perfectly.  It make me happy because it help keeps the bathroom sink from getting too cluttered.</li>
            <li> Just nice in holding my Edwin Jagger De89 and Tweezerman brush. Weighty enough in the base that it won&#x27;t just fall over. Simplistically elegant in design, good build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (after about 1 month use): Do try to ensure that the stand is kept dry at all times as the chrome may corrode. My stand is in the bathroom rack and while I cannot do much about the ambient humidity, I do try to ensure that there are no water spots on it at all times.</li>
            <li> It was awfully pretty when I took it out of the box except for the fact that one of the prongs was already broken off! Sure, it feels heavy and its chromed and all, but the inside is still cheap pewter, and the other reviews here don&#x27;t exactly bode well for its longevity. I think I&#x27;ll just put my razor away in the medicine cabinet like a normal person instead of using some shiny overpriced bauble.</li>
            <li> My first razor stand, I was surprised with its weight and sturdiness. I hang my Gillette Fusion on it just fine, but be aware that he Tweezerman shaving brush does not fit into it exactly as it should (I believe this problem would affect only a couple of brushes on the smaller side like the Tweezerman and another model mentioned by another reviewer). I have the tweezerman brush and have been able to balance it not by the handle (too wide to fit) but on the nose between handle and bristles. Its 20 bucks for this thing so I don&#x27;t expect it to last forever, but for the price it is very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple, chrome stand, with a knurled design, that actually coordinates nicely with my razors.    I wouldn&#x27;t put a heckuva lot into \\&quot;DESIGN\\&quot; or \\&quot;FUNCTION\\&quot; with this simple stand, but it works for me.  If I owned a 10 million dollar house, with Phillip Starck Designed toilets, sinks, tubs and faucets, I may chose something a bit different.  But this is nice for me.  Just cause it is pretty inexpensive, doesn&#x27;t mean anything.  AOS charges up to 80 bucks for a simple stand just like this.  Don&#x27;t do it!  Buy it here!</li>
            <li> This stand looks great.on your sink,keeps your brush &amp; razor dry &amp; handy. When your friends see it they might ask you where you got it.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the deal.  It stays pretty easily, which isn&#x27;t helpful considering that a wet brush and handle hang from it after use.  I ordered the cheap Van der Haggen set for 10 dollars, and the brush that comes with it won&#x27;t fit through the handle, so I have to place it between where the hairs and handle meet.  It gets the job done, but you ultimately can knock it over if you don&#x27;t pay attention.  The razor handle needs to be snuggly put in or it can fall right off as well.  In short, it dries everything I need to have dried after shaving and keeps it looking orderly, but not necessary clean do to the dry spots from the drip.</li>
            <li> Within months, this started corroding, the thin layer of metal peeling off and rusting all around. I would recommend spending a little bit more money for something  more durable.</li>
            <li> I got this to hold my Tweezerman brush and Merkur razor, and it has been doing so faithfully for about six months. I&#x27;ve yet to see any tarnish, rust, etc. on this stand and I&#x27;m often pretty messy when it comes to getting soap or water on the counter and where I keep the stand itself. It looks nice and shiny with it&#x27;s chrome finish, and has a padded underside that has some sort of soft foam-like material. While the razor stand is a little wide (Didnt fit an art of shaving one I got as a gift), I have no other complaints. Its a good price for something that will look great and last - plus it matches my razor!</li>
            <li> Strong, Sturdy, Easy Clean Up, Perfect Size, and best of all... It saves an enormous amount of space around my sink. Completely worth it!</li>
            <li> Was surprised at the high quality of this stand. Kinda had low expectations because of the price. My Merkur 34c and tweezerman brush fit this perfectly and look amazing. I agree with the other comments, those who are complaining of it corroding are probably messy people that have a moldy wet counter and don&#x27;t take care of their stuff.</li>
            <li> For an old safety razor,stand and brush, this is the one for you.&lt;br /&gt;Get the razor stand,  the safety razor, brush and blades and you will be all set.</li>
            <li> This has held up really well. I have been using it for almost 2 years and it looks new. It&#x27;s easy to clean and has not rusted a bit...</li>
            <li> I dont know where the hell you would put your shave brush and razor if you didnt have one! This keeps my razor and brush air dry. Perfect!</li>
            <li> After getting my husband a safety razor and a shaving kit, he wanted a way to dry his brush, and this works great.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy stand&lt;br /&gt;Wish the brush opening size was listed.  I would have bought a larger one.&lt;br /&gt;By my measurements the brush opening is about 27 mm, however my 26mm brush fits snug.&lt;br /&gt;I have to squeeze the bristles a little to get it in the holder to avoid splitting the knot while it&#x27;s being insert into the U shape holder.</li>
            <li> I am glad to report that it is true... This is a high quality stand that does exactly what it is intended for. :D It is solid, heavy, and holds both my Merkur long handle Double edge and my tweezerman badger hair brush perfectly. I have no complaints so far and will be providing an update in the next 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> I am pleased at how awesome this thing looks! The chroming is excellent and it compliments my Edwin Jagger De89 perfectly!</li>
            <li> Stand is sturdy and compact; does make take up much space. The base is very secure and does not tip over. Looks good on the sink counter&#x27;</li>
            <li> This is a very attractive holder for my new double edge razor and brush.  It is also convenient and saves space.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a year and still haven&#x27;t see any rust or wear. I occasionally disassemble it to clean the dust off but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This stand looks great and does what its supposed to do. Both my brush and DE razor fit with no problems. I also like how the base is weighted and that the stand has padding at the bottom.</li>
            <li> This high quality stand meets my needs, but it is a squeeze to fit in my Proraso brand boar brush. Fits my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor perfectly. Easy to keep clean and looks great on a bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is attractive and functional. It keeps the bathroom counter organized and prevents the razor and brush from being misplaced.</li>
            <li> Perfect to fit the Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip badger brush and my new Harry&#x27;s razor. Beautifully made</li>
            <li> Very sleek and sturdy, looks nice on my bathroom counter-top. Probably the most space-efficient way to store wet shaving materials.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a budget stand for my Muhle R41 and AoS brush. It works great, looks good and costs a lot less than other options. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for about two weeks, and so far have had no problems. It is well balanced and sturdy, so there&#x27;s no fear of it falling over or not holding my razor and shaving brush. It&#x27;s chrome coloring makes it match well with most razors as well, so it&#x27;s pretty stylish. It&#x27;s certainly preferable to keeping your shaving supplies simply lying on their sides on a bathroom shelf. Plus, shaving brushes last much longer and function a lot better if they dry while in an upside down rather than upright position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are plenty of other stand choices out there, so you are by no means limited to simply this one. Shop around, and find one that looks good to you, and matches your budget. This is one of the cheapest ones out there, which is why I got it. It looks nice, serves its function well, and is relatively inexpensive, but that&#x27;s all a matter of preference and perspective. If you don&#x27;t even want to waste $20 on this stand, I&#x27;ve seen pictures of people simply using screws/nails  sticking out halfway from the wall to fashion a makeshift stand for their shaving utensils. Not as stylish, but perfectly functional. However, for me, this seemed like a perfect match and I don&#x27;t regret my purchase. I&#x27;ll update this review if I experience problems with the stand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chrome, it&#x27;s awesome, and I recommend this stand. Great for drying my brush and blades. If you don&#x27;t already have one, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Over priced and cheap&lt;br /&gt;the two forks that hold the razor and the brush bend very easy&lt;br /&gt;the brush holder is two small</li>
            <li> Promptly delivered and in perfect condition. Looks great but 2 issues. First is that product origin is stated on web as US and it is not. It is made in Taiwan. Second is the felted bottom is recessed within the chrome base about 1/16th of an inch, which means it will scratch up your countertop or glass shelf. Easily remedied by screwing base off and inserting a plain metal washer over screw post before reassembling. Now it is perfect.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t bet the price for a chrome safety razor stand. Time will tell for the chrome plating, looks very nice.</li>
            <li> Now that I own a [[ASIN:B002A8JO1Q Merkur Heavy Duty Classic Safety Razor]], I wanted a razor stand that went well with it and my brush without breaking the bank.  I found that with this razor stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my razor and my brush fit perfectly on it, and looking at the stand you&#x27;d think they were made by the same company!  The stand looks great in your bathroom and is a wonderful fixture.  My only gripe is that it is a little wobbly, so expect some minor shaking (like a slightly off-center table at a restaurant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive razor stand that looks great, look here!</li>
            <li> I purchased this stand along with a razor and the brush and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Esthetically pleasing, and functional, it&#x27;s a nice space saving option, after years of using bulky electric shaver with charger/cleaner. Well made.</li>
            <li> Very nice and clean stand.  It holds my Merkur Futur and Brush perfectly and looks great on the bathroom vanity</li>
            <li> looks really good and works like a charm. holds my brush upside down as it&#x27;s intended to be and the razor has plenty of clearance.</li>
            <li> Mediocre quality, the base is not totally stable. The Parker Shaving Brush i bought to go with it does not fit into the brush hanger side.</li>
            <li> This works fine, does it&#x27;s job.  I just wish the razor side fit a Gillette Fusion better. The brush side works perfectly fine, and the weighted base makes it sturdy.</li>
            <li> The foam on the bottom either wasn&#x27;t making contact with the counter or was falling out. I don&#x27;t remember which. I fixed it with a simple modification. Now it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> opening for blade is too wide and and you need to positon the handlejust right to let it stay....brush holder works great!</li>
            <li> Wobbly, with a cheap base layer. But functionaly.  For the price and &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; labelling, was expecting something a bit more substantive. Don&#x27;t anticipate this thing lasting more than a 5-7 years.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my razor!  It take minimal space &amp; looks great also.  Easy to clean &amp; just the right size &amp; weight.</li>
            <li> Very durable stand and great chrome construction. My wife commented on how nice it looked and I like that fact. You can leave it sit out on your sink and its not an eye sore. It holds my brush and Merkur 180 razor nicely. I like that it is solid enough so if I pull the brush out and the razor remains or vice versa- it doesn&#x27;t topple. Great product and great choice for anyone who is using a safety razor, shaving soap and a badger hair brush. Colonel nailed it on this one!</li>
            <li> Bought this stand as an add-on to a full set of new shaving equipment.  It&#x27;s sleek, shiny metal, and it does the job nicely.  It holds a beaver fur brush and safety razor just as advertised and it&#x27;s pretty simply to keep clean by wiping it down with a dry cloth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a razor and brush stand. It holds a razor and brush. What more do you want? The chrome finish has stayed clean, and matches any bathroom decor.</li>
            <li> This is a great stand. Since the original purchase, I bought another one as a Christmas present for my brother and he really likes it too. The only issue I had with it was my brush handle (Omega) was bigger than the hook. My brush is larger than most others in the market so it is probably not typical experience for everyone. I guess I&#x27;d recommend you check the measurements against your brush just to be sure. Otherwise, this is a great buy for the price and I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit their own product (brush).  The brush holder needs to be larger, otherwise I would have kept the item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that this is a nice starter stand, but that&#x27;s about it.  Fits my razor (Merkur) and brush (Tweezerman) perfectly, but there&#x27;s a distinct yellow tone to the chrome when compared to my razor, and after less than a year I started to get green corrosion spots.  (most noticeably on the knurled part of the stem).  If you&#x27;re just looking for something to keep your razor and brush up, it&#x27;s fine, but don&#x27;t expect it to keep looking pretty forever.</li>
            <li> This Safety Razor Stand has a very solid base.  It will help preserve the life of my husbands safety razors.  The holding prongs on the top are a little thin but are working just fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this product not certain if it would work with my thick boar bristle brush but, it worked perfectly. Good product so far. No problems to report.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 3 of these now for my growing DE &amp; Brush collection. Other than my satin Futur stand set, this is my favorite looking stand of all I&#x27;ve come across. A bit of a warning though if you&#x27;re very picky... compared to the chrome of my razors and brushes, the chrome of this stand has a bit more of a golden tint to it.</li>
            <li> The razor stand has a heavy, sturdy base. There is ample room for brush and razor. Good quality is appreciated.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality razor stand which fits my long handed Mecur safety razor perfectly. It&#x27;s not the most stylish stand buts its sturdy built and has a great manly feel to it. Overall compared to other far more expensive stands I think this is the best bang for the buck and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over two years now and rust has formed where the brush hangs. I used metal polish and got a lot of it off, but I think its in too deep to get the rest. Other than that it is great. Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> this is really great item to organize your razor and brush in your bathroom, it helps you keep everything organized</li>
            <li> Looks just like the picture, feels like it&#x27;s a quality material. Does what it is suppose to very well. I like it</li>
            <li> Just bought my first Edwin Jagger and wanted to have a nice looking stand for it, this stand looks great and is well made, i also have a cheap tweezerman shaving brush that fits perfectly on it too..Now i look and feel like a professional shaver!! :)</li>
            <li> Elegant look to your wet shaving supplies.  It really ups the property value of my double-wide.  Warning, lots of bling when cleaned.</li>
            <li> I Bought the Col Conk 775 Stand to use with my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and [[ASIN:B0018OXOUA Kingsley Badger Shave Brush - White # 28]] and its a great fit. The stand is perfect match in design with the Merkur 180 Steel Cross Hatching. The Stand is sturdy and bright chrome, both razor and brush fit nicely on the holders and the bottom rubber padding is good for protecting my marble bathroom top. I would recommend it highly if it fits your razor and brush, I only hope it stays in great condition for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:I have used this daily for the last 4 years and it is holding up well, very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Together with merkur razor and brush makes a complete shaving experience.  Nice to have a place to hang your shaving implements.</li>
            <li> This thing looks great, but rusting is a definite problem. Nothing a $5 rust spray won&#x27;t take care of, but it&#x27;s a little too late for my razor stand, so I&#x27;ll be ordering another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stand.  It holds your brush and razor.  It holds them all very very well without tipping over.  It&#x27;s a stand.  This was not a haiku.    Update 1 year later:  The chrome is disintegrating and starting to spot with rust on the top rack, shaft, and the base.  This has really poor longevity and it looks like it&#x27;s resold by four or five different brand names.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Does the job, just what I needed.  This is heavier and thicker metal than expected.&lt;br /&gt;My razors and brush fit perfectly</li>
            <li> Looks good, holds the razor and brush perfectly.  Easy to clean, easy to use and most of all does not take too much space on the counter.</li>
            <li> This stand does what it says, complements my shaver (Merkur 34c), and is a reasonable price.  The rubber pad on the base keeps it from slipping around on the sink. Go for it.</li>
            <li> This does it&#x27;s job but needs to be wiped clean and dry on a regular basis to avoid permanent spots. Decent and economical stand with substantial weight.</li>
            <li> This is a nice stand.  Mine was made in Taiwan. My base is not weighted, and while thick and large it is in fact a cheap hollow stamping.  The shaft makes up the weight of the stand.  The shaft is substantial in weight and diameter.  The head is average with nice plating and the whole look is industrial with a knurled knob/nut on top.  It fits all of my D/E razors.  I have AOS brushes as well as some cheaper drug store brushes and it does not fit any of them by the handle, only the knots. A slimmer brush may hang by the handle. The stand can be made to fit AOS with some slight spreading of the tangs.  I did not measure my brushes nor research the size of the head, I bought based on the looks and reputation of the name.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent base design with decent waiting for the price.  You&#x27;re not gonna knock anybody out with the base but it will survive the occasional light bump that will happen in the bathroom.  Therefore, 5 stars for being sturdy and well constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handsome, like me and my Merker.  Style is important when I shave and it is important to my wife.  This model is an exact match for the extra long handled D/E Merker blade.  Looks like the set was made for it.  Chrome-plate and the textured parts of the set are very similar to the Merker.  Escali badger hair brush hangs free and undisturbed.  Doesn&#x27;t get knocked out.  Well designed such that it is difficult for it to just slide out.  5 stars, style, design and compatibility with Merker razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price / Quality Ratio:  5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  it is not sterling silver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for 4 months now and haven&#x27;t had any rust or pitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor side holds my Merkur perfectly.  The brush side had to be bent out a little bit to fit the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand is sturdy and looks great on my bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great addition to my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> It holds my stuff just right, but the chrome finish flakes off which looks awful (for reference, I bought this in November 2013, and it is now March 2015). For a product of this quality I would have expected to pay less than $10. I would go for a higher-quality stand if possible.</li>
            <li> So far the weight and design are perfect. I a lot of guys have complained about tarnish, rust and pitting. This is metal folks, this is going to have water contact is damn near every day. If you want something to stay nice over the years. You need to take care of it as with anything else. Just wipe it down when you get some water on it and it should last for years to come. I have a Parker synthetic brush and it doesn&#x27;t fit the handle, however, fits just fine at the knot. The chrome is flawless and this baby shines.</li>
            <li> Within 1 week of using I&#x27;ve noticed a spot of rust on the base where the foam is glued to. I tried to clean it off with a metal cleaner and managed to get rid of most of it except for a tiny brown spot. I wipe off any drops of water on the stand and towel dry my brush and razor before putting them on the stand. More brown spots gradually appeared within a week. After cleaning it a second time, I have resigned myself to the fact that the stand is beyond maintenance. The &amp;#34;infection&amp;#34; spread to every part of the stand within 1 month. All the while, my DE89 remained spot free. Given it&#x27;s lousy ability to handle humidity I guess it was never intended for use in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> Yes it stands up. Yes it holds a razor. Yes it holds a brush. It does not Cha Cha or Tango. It holds things. Feels pretty solid though.</li>
            <li> That why the brush&#x27;s are made with a flat bottom so you store them on it. Then water and mold start eating at the brush knot and the bager hair start falling out. The Companys wont you to buy brushs faster. This is made write. Store the brush with the bristles down so the water and soap drain off and don&#x27;t make mold and eat at the hair knot.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a razor stand to keep the bathroom counter a little neater.  The Colonel Conk stand is minimalist attractive, quite heavy and keeps a good hold on the razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Cool simple design.  Holds my DE razor and old shave brush.  No issues with it.  Great classic finish, should be able to fit your shaving needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for years now and its not rusty or anything- kinda heavy and looks nice on my sink. The only odd thing was that it wouldn&#x27;t fit my fatter handled Art of shaving brush- I had to tweak the arms open with a set of pliers for it to fit. It fit my other cheaper brush handles fine. Was reluctant to spend the money at first but I am glad I did- lets handle dry upside down which is suppose to be good but who knows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVING- let me save you years of trial and error: take a warm shower &amp; wash your face with billy jealousy exfoliating facial cleanser, shave afterwards with a $50 Merkur safety razor handle with good blades (save $100&#x27;s on mach 3 refills!), use a $20 Tweezerman badger hair shaving brush to apply taylor of old street bond (or proraso) shaving cream (you can let it set in a minute), shave WITH the grain DOWN, SLOWLY, SOFTLY (don&#x27;t press hard- let the weight of the handle and sharp blade do the cutting), lastly rub on a fingertip of proraso pre/post shave cream while your face is still wet and let it dry! Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I&#x27;ve tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don&#x27;t want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O. Bigelow label) then get the cheap single blade disposables (mach 3&#x27;s are too aggressive) at a grocery store and you&#x27;ll notice a difference overnight.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my merkur and the brush and its a great product to have it looks great and its stand good.</li>
            <li> My husband has been placing his double edged razor in our toothbrush holder, and his badger brush is just laying on the sink. We needed a stand to hold both of these. This is absolutely perfect. It keeps the counters more tidy where my husband&#x27;s shaving essentials are concerned.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I have a few items in my bathroom that are chrome but this stand is more of a nickel finish then a true chrome one.I ended up buying another one (Royalshave Chrome $25)which is a much better match</li>
            <li> Looks nice has nice weight to it to hold my brush and my razor.. will fit a merkur 38c &amp;#34; barber pole&amp;#34; and a parker brush</li>
            <li> Construction is good and looks nice.  Base is weighted nicely so that it stays in place on the counter and doesn&#x27;t wobble.</li>
            <li> I am using this for my new brush and razor.&lt;br /&gt;This has a very solid weight and looks great on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This stand is designed to hold a razor and brush. And while I don&#x27;t have a safety razor right now, it does a perfectly adequate job holding my Mach 4 and Omega brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy (others fall over), very good construction, easy to clean and I haven&#x27;t had any major issues with it.  The sizing is a little small for my brush though, I expected it to hold on the middle of the handle of the brush, but instead it holds between the bottom of the handle and the bristles.  No issue though.</li>
            <li> It arrived as advertised, shiny and sturdy.  What can I say, it stands with the best of them.  I can&#x27;t imagine another stand standing the way this stand stands.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a very good-looking stand that does what it should, you&#x27;ve found it. It&#x27;s practical, too, because it keeps your razor out where it can dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, it holds your shaving brush in the proper drying position, which will ensure a long life. (Letting it dry upside down -- with the bristles pointing up -- will, in my experience, soften the glue over time resulting in lost bristles when you use it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have the space and are looking for a wall-mounted version, check out [[ASIN:B001XURHIY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 121 Hardwood Stand for Razor and Brush, Walnut Finish]]. This is evidently a new product, because I looked all over the web for just such a product before ordering the stand version. (The Model 121 isn&#x27;t touted as a wall mount, but I imagine that some double-sided tape would do the job.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit, April 2012:  I&#x27;m downgrading this review from 5 to 4 stars because of the tarnish issue. The base - which is chromed metal - will, after a time, develop &#x27;bumps&#x27; and green spots which don&#x27;t come out, like the chrome trim on an old car. It looks, well, ugly. I think I&#x27;ll spend a few bucks more on this [[ASIN:B003BHCAGQ stainless-steel version]], which also stands an inch higher.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this for a Christmas gift with ample shipping time. It was after Christmas, second week in January. The company did respond and said it was shipped but nothing. Second shipping finally arrived. I was disappointed and they did offer me half the shipping fee refund, The stand itself looks like nice quality however the brush holder part does not fit the way I thought it&#x27;s kind of tight. It serves it&#x27;s purpose however.</li>
            <li> I have a Parker safety razor and a Tweezerman brush that I use this stand for. The razor just barely fits in there because the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; on the stand are a little short. The brush side is a little thin, so I had to work the wooden handle of my brush down to fit in the stand. It looks nice, but it could be sized better, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Base is quite sturdy and will not tip over, even if one side is left vacant. Holds my parker razor and horse hair shave brush just fine. The chrome finish has a nice gloss, although I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s longevity, as I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks. Overall this is a good stand for the money that you pay for it.</li>
            <li> Sturdy metal!  That&#x27;s right!  It&#x27;s big, it&#x27;s heavy, and it is built to last.  I mean, this is the &#x27;sneak up behind the guy robbing my house and knock him out&#x27; type of sturdy and heavy.  I mean, you are really getting multiple tools for the price of 2!  Sure, it can hold your razor and brush, but it can also: Be used as a paperweight, even in hurricane winds, stop a bear with the power of a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick, make men admire you and make women love you because of your epically manly taste in shaving accessories. Personally, with these features, I think any price under $1000 would be very reasonable.</li>
            <li> its okay.. but if you hang your wet brush on it,,,, it drips on the base.. also,, doesn&#x27;t hold other brands of brushes (at least theo ne i got)</li>
            <li> Give you the old-timey feel in your bathroom.  It looks great on my glass shelf.  Sturdy and functional too.</li>
            <li> everything is wonderful, some very nice item and it was delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Corrodes quikly and does not stay nice and shiny like in the pictures. No amount of cleaning will fix it. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just took this out of the box and I am very impressed. I was not expecting something this nice. I figured that I would have to assemble it and that it would be somewhat flimsy. I was wrong on both assumptions. I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity but it sure seems it will hold up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a Baxter Best Badger brush and it fits perfectly in the holder. The chrome of the brush and the holder match and it looks very nice.</li>
            <li> Weighted bottom makes this stable even with heavy Parker Safety Razor 100% Silvertip Badger Shave Brush. Beautiful Chrome with no blemishes so far. Absolutely thrilled with Amazon Pickers and Packers with this order.  KUDOS!!!</li>
            <li> I was gonna deduct a star at first because my brush did not fit great.(likely the size of my brush as the issue) However until my luggage fell off the roof rack of my truck doing 90mph coming home from vacation, this thing amazed me. Most of my other stuff was broken or damaged. This was slightly bent where the brush goes. I bent it back in a vice and the brush fits great now.&lt;br /&gt;Finish held up great and help up to the fall great</li>
            <li> I will not knock this item for not fitting a razor that it&#x27;s not supposed to but I was hoping I&#x27;d be able to hang my Mach 3 razor from it (I will be getting a safty razor style handle that takes Mach 3 heads which should fit).  The shaving brush I got for free in a kit (I will be getting a better one soon) is also too small to fit in the stand.  So, aside from not being able to use it currently, the stand is great.  Good weight and quality, looks sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the measurements of your components to make sure they&#x27;ll fit before ordering.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all serves its purpose. Holds brush and razor with no problems at all. Sturdy and appears durable, time will tell.</li>
            <li> Be sure and read all of the other fine reviews for safety razor shaving items on Amazon. I did and followed their advice.

            <li> Holds my razor and brush very well and looks nice on the vanity top. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with rust but I do wipe it down before storing them after shaving.</li>
            <li> Excellent, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Well built looks like it was made to last.</li>
            <li> The stand holds my razor and brush well, weighted nicely and looks really nice, especially with my Merkur long handle razor and chrome brush.</li>
            <li> Great product adds class to you bathroom and makes shaving eaiser no more fumbling around for your razor and brush all at the same place.  The old timers had it right a shaving brush and soap and a stand is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and heavy.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t tip over every time I try and put the razor on it like the cheaper models do.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! Very sturdy and shiney, proving it was made well. Buy it you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT, IT HAS A VERY HIGH QUALITY CHROME STEEL. SHIPPING AND HANDLING WAS PRETTY FAST. BASICALLY BETTER PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> I love this stand. It is simple and not flamboyant and performs its purpose perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t take up a bunch of space and provides adequate space beneath the brush for air flow.</li>
            <li> This item is both the nicest looking and least expensive of the safety razor stands I found.  How often do you get both?  I&#x27;ve been using it for the last month, and it&#x27;s working like a charm.  A safety razor set, when you go badger and merkur, can be an investment.  This stand protects that investment.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t be tall enough to hold the extra long safety razor I have, but it&#x27;s plenty tall enough.  Also seems to be of good quality and craftsmanship.  I definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars if only the base would have been solid metal.but overall it serves it&#x27;s purpose. Helps to keep my silver tip brush dry and clean.</li>
            <li> Good looking stand, but my only issue was that the brush I have, a vulfix, does not sit well on the stand. It has to be placed just right or it will fall off.</li>
            <li> I use a Rishi razor and a Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush (both bought on Amazon) and it works great. It did not work with thicker handled brushes that I had before and probably wont work with the big handled razor&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Perfect razor stand.  Brush and razor fit nicely and it looks great on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This stand is great, it holds my razor really well. Despite other reviews it does not hold my The Art of Shaving brush that comes with the The Art of Shaving Full Size Kit-Sandalwood  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046GEJY2/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28. The stand looks nice and matches my Merkur Heavy Duty Double Edge Razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand about 3 years ago because it matched the design of my vintage tech razor from the 40&#x27;s.  The chrome shows water spots like crazy and now 3 years later its harder and harder to clean them off (to be fair I have really hard water where I live).  I will probably switch to something else soon but the stand performed well for its price range.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very nice chrome finish, it&#x27;s well constructed, and in general looks great!  I have a Merkur 38Hd and a Parker Shaving Brush.  They fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Hold my brush and my razor perfectly and looks magnificent doing it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for over 1 year and it&#x27;s still just as shiny and solid as the day I bought it.  a great addition to any shave set. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> Brush fits. Razor fits. Works as advertised. Not a whole lot more to say.</li>
            <li> Bought these with the double edge razor, blades, brush and soap for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day. He loved it all.</li>
            <li> would of got 5 stars but middle base cushion (black foam) comes out and sticks to sink counter, every time i move it. i will super glue it (problem solved). Other than that, works and looks Great!</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, but my husband rarely uses. it has held up well, no rusting or discoloration. if you&#x27;re going to use it, it&#x27;s worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> i kept it on the shelf in my shower.  the base rusted underneath.&lt;br /&gt;other wise it still looks nice and new.</li>
            <li> I just unboxed this stand.  My first impression is good.  It has a weighted soft rubber bottom base and even chrome.  It sits evenly.  Best of all, it fits an ecotools kabuki brush perfectly.  I&#x27;ll update over time if there are any issues.  But for now I am very happy with this item.  One note, I managed to grab it for $16 and free shipping.  So, watch the prices because they fluctuate.</li>
            <li> Excelente Product!! Just as described by seller!</li>
            <li> Um, well this stand fits my badger brush and Merkul 180 quite nicely... it hasn&#x27;t rusted and stays shiny since I wipe it down daily.  Do I &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34;?  No, it&#x27;s just a stand but it works well I just wish these things weren&#x27;t so expensive... that said, it&#x27;s seemingly high quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my huaband that leaves his stuff in the bathroom everyone uses. This will certainly clean it up and leave a nice look for him. Very classy</li>
            <li> Was a little larger than I expected, but is not an issue. Looks good on my benchtop and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to both hold my razor and brush, yet be stable and look good.  This Colonel Conk does the trick!  It is not easily tipped over, is large enough to hold everything, and small enough to take up a minimum of space. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year and a half ago and it is still rust-free. It works well for holding my safety razor and brush. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Bought this and it looks great with our chrome fittings in our bathroom. Holds whatever brush and razor combo I have had.</li>
            <li> This is a very solid, well built stand. It holds my Merkur safety razor and brush as intended. It is a bit on the pricey side for being just a stand, but there were very few options available.</li>
            <li> Giving this 4 stars because the quality was there. Chrome looks great and it is much heavier than I expected. As some have mentioned, it has a rather narrow fork for the brush holder. The opening is a tight 28 mm. It just wouldn&#x27;t fit the Parker pure badger brush I have. If you have a small handled brush, this is a great stand. Anything at or above 28 mm simply won&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li> Works with some of my Double Edge razors.</li>
            <li> Great product. Simple and clean. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Beautiful simplistic stand. No issues with rust or bending at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to give it a simple wipe down every once in a while to avoid calcium build up from water splashes!</li>
            <li> The product is very well build and beautifully matches my Merkur 34C razor :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Holds my merkur 510 progress adjustable long handle razor and Simpson Commodore 3 best badger shaving brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking &amp; keeps the brush &amp; razor ready for use.</li>
            <li> Rusts pretty easy but sturdy</li>
            <li> Delightfully surprised by the heft, size, and sturdiness of this item. Mirror-chrome finish. Fits my Tweezerman Badger brush and Merkur razor perfectly. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer. It fits his Feather brand safety razor great, but would easily work for larger safety razors or even a cartridge razor. It also fits his brush nicely. I&#x27;m not sure what size it is, but it could definitely hold a bigger brush, too. It keeps things more compact and off the counter. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> The base leaves rust spots every where.  The upper appears to be stainless but base which is hollow with a rubber insert, is rusting from the edge.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a bit disappointing. First and foremost the average shave brush is to big to use in this stand. The skinny handles and travel brushes are the ones that fit. You would think they would point that out. I appreciate those that think the quality is high. However, as a safety razor user for many years this is one of the lower quality stands you can buy. Overall I am very disappointed. Bottom line is if your new to this just look for any product that is stainless not chrome, solid base and has a 5 star rating in the 90%. For those who have used and looking for something new I would avoid this one.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice.  Full size brush will fit I assume but a travel size like I got for my husband falls through the slot.  He just turns it sideways.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Does the job and looks good on the counter. The brush opening is a little tight for my Omega boars but that&#x27;s okay, it now functions a a dedicated badger holder and looks good doing it. I wipe it off regularly with windex (or any window cleaner) to keep the thing from rusting in a foggy bathroom.</li>
            <li> A nice stand overall.  Heavy base with rubber bottom prevents tipping and slipping.  The razor side holds my Merkur 38 HD just right.   The brush side, though, is too skinny to hold the top-most crease on the base of my brush.  Instead, I have to use the hair-base transition which is a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> Nice and inexpensive, looks sharp in chrome.  Bargain priced versus many of the other options out there.  Why spend more money for something that sits in the bathroom?</li>
            <li> Works well a convenient way to store your razor and brush easy to clean could be a little wider to hold the brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for two years or more. It still shines just like when it was new. No corrosion noted. It holds a Gillette with a long handle and a shaving brush real well.  You must get one if you use a brush since they don&#x27;t dry properly if left resting on the handle.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand as a gift for my boyfriend. Unfortunately, with his Gillette Mach 3 razor and The Art of Shaving brush, the stand is pretty useless. We both agree that it does look nice, but in our home, it is not functional. The razor won&#x27;t stay in its holder at all, and as far as the brush, it will only fit at the base of the bristles, the holder is too narrow to hold it at the knot. I am returning it and will continue to look for a stand that will work with his shaving set.</li>
            <li> it does not fit average/commong items, useless, my razor or toothbrush or shave brush do not fit, ok quality for money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, attractive, and subtle. Metal seems to be good quality. The arms curl up at the ends slightly to keep your razor falling off.</li>
            <li> This was last years Christmas present for my husband,he put his shaving things on it and he has not stopped useing it since,plus it help me not to pick up after his shave</li>
            <li> this is really nice it has a good weight to it with felt on the bottom and it is tall enough even for brushes a little longer than say an average length I have the Elite&#x27;s Synthetic Shaving Brush which seems a little long but there is still about an inch between tip and base this was well worth the money the chrome is well done,why pay more for the same design of the other brands</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shaving stand. My razors and brushes both fit nicely on it. However, it has a few design flaws. First, the bottom was lined with a fake velvet material. Since this is a shaving stand, it sat near my sink, and of course the bottom got wet. I lifted it up one day to find little black specks of the material stuck onto my counter. Also, when I was traveling and wanted to disassemble the stand so that it would fit into my suitcase, I discovered that the entire thing is held together by a screw at the bottom, underneath the velvety material. The only way to get at the screw was to cut a small hole in the center of the material.</li>
            <li> Works great for my needs!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to say other than it works. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t tip over or anything. I think the price is a bit expensive for what it is but at least it works.</li>
            <li> it does the job of holding the razor and the brush but looses its looks fast. started rusting in a few months. got most of the spots off but some are through the stainless material.  it&#x27;s crap for 25 bucks, should be sold at the 99cents store</li>
            <li> It was perfect and my boyfriend loved it. I was very happy to do business with this company.  Thanks again</li>
            <li> This universal stand works great, is heavy (that counts these days!), and is easy to simply &amp;#34;wipe polish&amp;#34; with a damp cloth or sponge.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Not much to like or dislike about it. I&#x27;m happy. It holds my razor (Merkur) and my brush.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and it looks good.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby. He loves it. Add the brush and razor &#x3D; Very classy. Great shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this holder.  It work well with the razor and the Tweezerman shaving brush.  Worth the cost as it will last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> Parker Safety Razor 100% Best Badger Bristle Shaving Brush -- White &amp; Chrome Handle with Free Stand.  Unclear how others bought this item along with this stand.  Very disappointing...don&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this razor stand for my husband.  It is very attractive as well as functional.</li>
            <li> It looks great on the bathroom counter. My boar hair brush doesn&#x27;t quite fit to my liking but it&#x27;s functional.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product. Looks good on my vanity.  Does the job. A little pricey but I do not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> This stand does not work with well with the Merkur Futur.  The design does not allow the razor to sit flush in the slot.  I will have to return mine.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on several similar products and this one seemed to be the most well-liked. I did see some people mentioning the pitting or corroding, but after a couple of months I haven&#x27;t experienced those issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sturdy product that grips the razor and the brush, and doesn&#x27;t let them fall off every time you make contact with it, as some other products seemed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and was concerned that it may not fit my razor and brush that I had but it fit great with them good universal stand.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality stand at a decent price.  The photo makes it look like the shaft is not all metal, but it is (the middle part is knurled).  The stand has a decent heft to it.  The felt on the bottom seems a bit flimsy, and doesn&#x27;t extend to the edge of the metal, but other than that it seems to be very well made.  Holds a safety razor and shaving brush perfectly.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to, and can not complain. Would recommend to anyone looking for a simple razor stand</li>
            <li> looks good and works well.  Brush dries the way that it should.  The bottom plate is heavy so I never worry about this stand tipping over.</li>
            <li> This would be a 5 star product if the brush side was actually big enough to hold a brush. I have 2 brushes, a Van Der Hagen (the one you get in a kit at walmart) and a parker. Neither of these handles will fit in it and they have to be hung with the opening hugging the base of the brush itself. Other than this one thing, it is a great prioduct. It seems to be built with quality and its nice and shiney, looking nice on my sink.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I just wanted a stand to hold my shaving tools, but most of them were way out of my budget. I purchased this stand hoping it wouldn&#x27;t break in a few months. It has been more than a year, and it&#x27;s perfectly fine and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.    The only thing to note is that the middle pole screws into the bottom plate, which is hollow and filled with a black hockey puck shaped foam. The \\&quot;puck\\&quot;, however, is not as tall as the hollow plate, but thankfully is still attached to the middle pole. So the edges of the metal plate were scratching my bathroom sink counter. My solution was to cut a piece of cardboard and stick it in between the \\&quot;puck\\&quot; and the metal plate, and then screw in the pole. Now the \\&quot;puck\\&quot; is very slightly preventing the metal plate from touching the counter surface.     I use this stand daily. No problems whatsoever, and I envision it will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I had to gently bend up the prongs very slightly to give the brush and razor a little more stability, but other than that, the stand is totally functional, and has a small footprint, which I like in my small space. The Merkur 180 Long Safety Razor, and the Escali Pure Badger Brush fit perfectly. I would buy it again. If it weren&#x27;t for the bending thing mentioned above, I would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Attractive holder that holds my safety razor and shave brush.  This is a much better option than leaving a wet razor on the counter or in a drawer.  The wife approved of its looks as well.</li>
            <li> very well made stand, sturdy, Does not tarnish, cleans easily, Hooks do not bend easily and spring back to position if the stand is knocked over (which is difficult to do). Could easily be my last shave brush and razor stand.</li>
            <li> Product was on time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I must say what a surprise, looks great and works perfect!! Buy you can&#x27;t beat it for price. 5 star old school shave holder.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap and it does the job. i would give it more if it had a wide brush slot. (not relevant trying to get word minium)</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I was looking for. I use to use my late fathers straight razor when I started out shaving and buying cheap BIC throw away razors was a waste of money and never really shaved close enough. Now I have a complete set to last forever.</li>
            <li> I bought this this stand to go with my shaver and brush ,its a nice stand holds the brush and shaver great . It has some weight to it so the stand doesn&#x27;t tip over easily.</li>
            <li> Had it for a year and works great, and held up great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in August of 2010. It does what it is designed to do and adds a bit of panache to the sinktop.  I have not seen any evidence of rusting or pitting.</li>
            <li> Looks good on the counter. Heavy base keeps it stable. Holds your shaving paraphernalia and keeps it organized, helps dry shaving brush too.</li>
            <li> Nice and heavy. Holds razor and brush just fine.</li>
            <li> This holds my razor AND brush at the same time! Has not corroded like other reviewers noted. Just keep it dry.</li>
            <li> Keeps my brush and razor neatly stored on the counter top.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, lol.</li>
            <li> Really nice stainless steel razor stand . Will probably never rust .</li>
            <li> This is a nice stand that seems very solid. The only problem I have is it is a little tight for my brush and my razor has small tabs that make it want to slide out of the slot. A few small alterations and it works great.</li>
            <li> Very high quality. Nice and heavy. Beautiful. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Keeps my razor and brush from laying on the counter.</li>
            <li> Looks nice and does the job...holds perfectly the Merkur Heavy Duty Edge Razo #34C and a brush...just what I needed...</li>
            <li> This product holds my razor and brush.  It can sit inside a drawer or medicine cabinet, but I prefer to keep mine on the vanity.  This allows the brush to air dry and keeps the razor in a safe position for the next use.  The quality is good and solid.</li>
            <li> Great product. Sturdy.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and it is crappy. The center piece is wobbly and not screwed into the base piece tightly. You cannot tighten it either because the very bottom, underneath has a glued rubber base.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my merkur long handle safety razor and tweezerman&#x27;s shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both fit well with no problem.  It is very sturdy and has a weight at the bottom so you would not tip it over by trying to place or take out your shaving kits from the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give 5/5, however, there is 1 down side.  The bottom circular plate surface will deform like crazy if you do not wipe it every single day.  As a lazy dude, I do not wipe it clean.  I shave, rinse it and just put them back on the stand.  The water drips over time to the base plate and the surface of the plate started to deform.  Almost like a corrosion/oxidation.  Has green tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not that beautiful to look at, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: make sure you dry your shaving set  &amp;#34;DRY&amp;#34; before setting them on the stand and move the razor stand far from your faucet to avoid water damage.  But if you are lazy, watch the bubbles and dots grow on your base plate.</li>
            <li> was supposed to be metal but is plastic and has already broken bad design...</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Allows the razor and brush to dry and is ready to go the next time. Prevents brush frm falling apart in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Great product and great quality... It holds my Match 3 turbo with out any problem..</li>
            <li> Holds my brush and razor without any issues. Just make sure you clean it every once in a while. The residue from the items placed on it can rub and and it gives it a tarnished dingy look. A quick wipe with a rag gets rid of it easily though.</li>
            <li> This is an elegant little razor/brush stand for your bath.  Shiny chrome finish, nice solid base.  A good addition to the decor.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> No complaints. It&#x27;s sturdy, it hasn&#x27;t rusted. The felt bottom hasn&#x27;t come off. I see no deterioration or anything about it to show wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine holds a Tweezerman brush (at the base, not where the bristles meet the handle) and an unknown model of Merkur DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my bathroom which is the problem now - I need a new place to show it off!</li>
            <li> This stand is pretty compatible with lost accesories I use mine all the time no signs of rust still very shiny</li>
            <li> Perfect stand for my Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> Great product, very solid, well balanced. great value. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a shaving stand. I&#x27;ve owned the product for about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Well made and inexpensive compared to many similar stands out there.  It seems to hold all my razors well including Injectors and GEMs.  Some shaving brushes don&#x27;t fit well depending on their size and handle shape, but that&#x27;s probably a universal problem with stands.  The base is nicely weighted and I have had no balance problems even with my Gillette Fatboy and oversized custom stainless handles.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> First time DE razor user, so I went all out and bought the individual components one needs for a full-service shave. This, to me, must include the conk - and this specific one is fantastic. I have to admit I was leary of this purchase though, the picture does not do the product justice and the price would suggest the same compared to others. The picture provided would lead one to believe, \\&quot;this instrument MAY be cheaply made with cheap  components\\&quot;. As soon as I picked up the box, I was surprised at the weight...I pulled it out and quickly realized the majority of the weight was at the base (which is good!). I tightened the rod and it stands perfectly level with no swaying issues. All the components feel &#x27;quality&#x27; to me and really looks great holding my Parker 99r and brush. I would say it would hold just about ANY razor/brush you have and I can&#x27;t imagine ever needing to buy another one unless this one gets lost or my wife gets pissed at me and this is the nearest object to hurl in my general direction lol Great product and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very heavy duty, holds his shaving gear wonderfully.</li>
            <li> For the price, it looks clean and efficient. My brush and razor hang nicely from it.  All three make for a tasteful display on my sink.</li>
            <li> The reviews that say its only good for a few months is right. I had to paint it with rustoleum hammer paint. But I still cant get the rust off the counter top. Skip it, wish I spent more or kept looking.....</li>
            <li> When i received the stand, it met my expectations and it is a good solid stand for my heavy silver brush and double edge razor.  It is high quality and looks good.  Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> It looks great in the bathroom. It holds the razor and brush pretty high, so it can probably hold almost any length of brush/razor. I read issues about rusting, so I&#x27;ll have to wait and see. The bottom is nicely padded so it won&#x27;t scratch our glass shelves. Being a beginner, the price was right too.</li>
            <li> Okay this was simple indulgence I could not live without.  As I return to a straight safety razor I saved more money and since my blade are now so much cheaper than the cartridges I use to use...I used the pocket change to buy this beautiful stand.</li>
            <li> This stand is great. Heavy, well put together with a solid feel. Fits brush and DE safety razor perfectly.  Actually outshines the Edwin Jagger that sits on it, which says a lot.</li>
            <li> I use this to hold my razor. It makes the bathroom look nice, elegant and yet holds it&#x27;s function. I would recommend buying this if you have a nice razor to display!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my new shaving tools and I must say it works wonderfully. The holding prongs are curned such that it helps keep the shaver and brush in place even if moving the stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I find to be bothersome (and this is very small) is that the prongs for the brush side are a **little** to close together. I have to have my brush facing a certain way in order for the butt of the brush to slide into the prongs. Not a big deal, but it would be nice to widen it 1mm or so to keep this from happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep an eye on it for any pitting (as a previous reviewer had experienced) but so far soo good. Glad I bought this, as it really makes drying out the brush a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** Update 11/14/2013 *****&lt;br /&gt;Well, not even a year has passed (well, a little over since I took forever to update this) and the corrosion is taking over the base. This started about 6 months ago, and while I could keep it at bay for a little while, it just got worse and worse. I am sorry to say that I&#x27;m taking this down to a 1 star as I expected this to be a small occurrence  (as one other person has pointed out on these reviews) but I must have have the same problem. Stand is study, does what it should, but just looks ugly now next to my other bathroom utensils.&lt;br /&gt;***** Update 11/14/2013 *****</li>
            <li> Just dry it if there are any droplets on it and I am confident it will stay as new for your lifespan! I always place my brush and razor dry onto it and it is still as good as new. As long as it is dry I don&#x27;t see any reason why it won&#x27;t stay perfectly new forever! The people that have rust on it and discoloration is because they do not take care of it. But this is with every product you have, unless you take care of it it won&#x27;t look good. That&#x27;s why you also shave - to look and feel good, if you don&#x27;t take of yourself you won&#x27;t look good. Same is with your stuff. This is a a quality item and is really shiny and well plated, so I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its a stand. It stands things up nicely. Of all the stand-like things I own, this is definitely one of them.</li>
            <li> I have had this stand now for about two months and so far so good.  I read about rusting in other reviews but so far i have not experienced this problem.  The finish looks good and it does not tip over when in use.  I am using it to hold a Merkur Progress Adjustable Double Edge Safety Razor and the Parker 100% Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush (Deluxe Olivewood Handle).  The brush hangs/fits perfectly from the stand by the crome handle (not the knot) along with the razor perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a nice stand to display their shaving gear!</li>
            <li> The base of this stand is very stable so it is not easy to tip, also looks nice and easy to shine.</li>
            <li> Happy with it.  Would buy again.  Nice Quality.</li>
            <li> I like this stand.  I gave it 4 stars because it works and is very steady.  Small dislike(s): 1. The chrome is not as polished as the Merkur DE Razor I have but that does not matter much. If I wanted it to match I could have purchased a set.  2. It does not fit my Art of Shaving brush so I have to hang the brush higher/closer to the badger hair but there is not problem with it drying or balance.  Please note it does fit my Art of Shaving travel brush.  The brush handle is not as wide as the regular ones.  All in all, decent price, steady, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Looks very nice with my DSR and badger brush. I suppose its not necessary, but if you&#x27;re into DSRs, you&#x27;re also into finer things in life.</li>
            <li> Brush holder is too small for my brush handle. I just hang my brush from the point the bristles attach to the handle and that seems to work. The unit is holding up well after 6 months of use and I don&#x27;t have any other complaints.</li>
            <li> Good stand  but I would liked one more stylish and fancy.</li>
            <li> Good bang for the buck... let&#x27;s see how long it looks shiny and new.. like it</li>
            <li> Shiny chrome surface. May not fit all brushes handle. Hope it will last and not rust or discolor any time soon.</li>
            <li> This is a good stand, but I have had better. The main problem is that two of the three brushes I have, do not fit this stand! If the brush portion was just a bit wider, it would work great.    The razor stand portion is perfect, but the poor brush side and the fact that it loves to lose it&#x27;s chrome plating makes me dock it 2 stars.    Good for the price, but be sure that you have a smaller sized brush before you buy this.     When this dies, I will be ordering a different stand.</li>
            <li> I did read the other reviews and took a chance. While my badger brush sits in the holder fine (and it will due to the shape of brush handles which differ in diameter as they reach the top), my Mühle razor does not fit the holder. It was either take a chance or not purchase this product. I chose to do the former and that&#x27;s my regret.</li>
            <li> My badger brush fits as long as I put it just before where the bristles enter the knob. Razor fits snuggly and securely.</li>
            <li> This razor stand does a good job at holding the razor and brush.  If it ever breaks, I think I might try something else, but I really don&#x27;t have any issues with it.  I thought 15 bucks for it is a little much, and that&#x27;s why I might try something else.    The only thing negative (besides the price) about it is that the little forks that hold your brush got bent over time.  Don&#x27;t know how, maybe it was during travel.  I was able to bend it back and now it looks normal again.  What else can be said about it.  It holds a razor and brush.</li>
            <li> The Col. Conk Model 775 \\&quot;Evernice\\&quot; chrome safety razor stand is sturdy and nicely finished, and the base is heavy enough to prevent the stand from tipping over. I currently have two brushes that I alternate between, a Tweezerman and a Simpson Special, and they both fit the brush holder just fine (one at a time, of course). Having a brush stand is an absolute must for maintaining a shaving brush and having the bracket for the razor as well helps keep things tidy. This is a well made and very functional product that is also nice looking. I have been using it daily for about a month now, and it still looks brand new. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to  spend a lot of money on a stand since I wanted to get a good quality badger brush and razor. This stand is nice and solid and does the job at a great price. Some badger brushes might not fit on this (the Art of Shaving brush is too big) but I&#x27;m sure the majority of the brushes will work fine.</li>
            <li> bought this to hold my Merkur double edge razor and an Escali badger hair brush. feels solid and nicely compliments the Merkur. this is an item that looks good in any bathroom.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;m a black male with coarse hair and if you&#x27;re the same you can relate with hairs growing any and everyway but straight down... I&#x27;ve used a 5 blade razor for a while and this beats it hands down. My engrown hairs have went from many to about 5 per shave which is good considering my hair type. seems like the more I use it the less I get which is a plus.. I would suggest anyone who have the same hair type to purchase along with the art of shaving kit.</li>
            <li> Very nice stand to hold the razor and brush.  Feels heavy and durable, wipes clean, and no sign of any rust after several months of use.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this because I got my son a razor for Christmas alone with extra razor blades, dish and soap, kindle paper light , brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. It looks nice but it comes apart pretty easily. And it&#x27;s made in china. A little sticker told me so.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality item. It has a nice solid feel with some heft to it that makes for a stable stand. I love the chrome finish.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a stand for my husband to give him with the art of shaving set and merkur razor I bought him for Christmas.  However, the majority of stands that I saw wouldn&#x27;t fit safety razors.  This is perfect.  The travel size badger brush doesn&#x27;t fit, but the full size does and so does his razor.  It keeps the brush in good shape and looks nice on the vanity!</li>
            <li> I own a merkur 34c and a Kingsley badger brush. Holds both very well. Looks great and for the price, I would recommend</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of holding my razor and brush.  I would endorse this product and tell people to get this</li>
            <li> Good stand for good price. Holds my tweezerman badger brush and Gillete NEW and SS with no problems. Doesnt take up alot of space. Looks sharp.</li>
            <li> Newbie to DE safety razors and in process of building my kit for home and travel. When looking for stands i saw that they came in various forms and costs. not seeing a need for $100+ stand i decided on this Col.Conk version due to price and some good reviews.Honestly i did not expect much for the price paid. i was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. No machine marks or imperfections, its very shiny and the chrome plating is professional.Im satisfied and i would recommend this stand.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand for my boyfriend for Christmas. It looks great and is must heavier than I expected! I assumed it&#x27;d be some flimsy little cheapo stand because the price was so low. Its very much the opposite. Nice chrome finish, fits his brush and razor well. Its only had a month of use now but in the future, we&#x27;ll see how it stands up to water and rusting.</li>
            <li> I just bought this a little while ago, but I love it!  There&#x27;s already been some water that&#x27;s dripped on the base, and so far, no corrosion, but I&#x27;m going to try my best to wipe the water away so it doesn&#x27;t corrode!  It&#x27;s pretty hefty, and as you can see from the pictures, it holds the Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle just fine!  I don&#x27;t have a razor hanging from the other side, so I was a bit worried about counter balance, but it hasn&#x27;t (and I don&#x27;t ever really see it) fallen or moved at all.  The reason I do not have a razor hanging from it, is because it doesn&#x27;t hold Mach 3 razors so well.  Maybe if the razor side was angled up a little more, but mostly it&#x27;s because the body of the Mach 3 is kind of funky to begin with. No matter, I&#x27;m going to buy a safety razor anyway!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect stand for a razor and brush.  The design is neutral so that it goes with any type of decor.  Since buying it I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> The base of the item has some kind of foam rubber on it, it does not sit even on a flat surface I would not order this look for something else to use.</li>
            <li> it is a great add on to the bath tools</li>
            <li> Good quality construction, but it doesn&#x27;t quite fit my razor and badger brush. They&#x27;ll hang there, but the fit is very insecure and wobbly.</li>
            <li> Based on the price, this is a nice stand. The base has decent weight and the finish is nice looking.</li>
            <li> Nice way to keep organized and dry.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected, stylish and affordable. Also arrived promptly. Thanks! Great e-bayer, I look forward to our next exchange!</li>
            <li> well built product. And delivered promptly. I do with the brush side would be slightly wider so i could hang the brush lower than from the top</li>
            <li> This stand works well with my Edwin Jagger De86bl and my Escali brush.  Both are held well without being too tight.  Unlike some of the other reviews I have not experienced any rust on it without doing anything more than wiping off a bit of soap rarely.</li>
            <li> I have had this unit for some time.  It is nice looking, sturdy and will undoubtedly hold up for many years.</li>
            <li> My fault:many reviews said their brush wouldn&#x27;t fit and of course mine didn&#x27;t fit either.But, quality is pretty good and if they ever make one that will accept a standard brush I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> I like this stand very much. It has the right weight, the chroming is perfect on mine, and it looks great. Unfortunately with my brush (link below), it does not fit properly. It fits if I hang it just above the bristles but not by the handle. So I am still able to use it, but it just looks odd hanging that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00A3EL6YW \\&quot;The Prince\\&quot; High Density 2-Band Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush]]</li>
            <li> This holds the brush just fine but the razor keeps slipping and falling down no matter how you put it.....so it is really annoying in terms of that......otherwise all else is great</li>
            <li> Looks good, steady, holds brush and razor well, reasonable price compared to many over priced ones that don&#x27;t look or work any better.</li>
            <li> A wonderful item to classically display a safety razor and shave brush.  A nice addition to any sink to but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Well, it holds my brush and razor and it looks nice. Mission accomplished, Col. Conk. My only criticism is that I wish the brush and blade holders were side-by-side instead of on opposite ends. It would just be a bit easier for me to access both instruments that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things I&#x27;ve gleaned from other reviews that haven&#x27;t been an issue for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have warned that not all brushes fit into this guy, but more than likely if your brush doesn&#x27;t fit by the handle you can hang it by the knot. It may not be as attractive, but it still does what it&#x27;s meant to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corrosion also seems to be an issue, which could be linked to mineral build-up from tap water. To help prevent this, I dry the stand off when I&#x27;m done shaving and I also clean it with soap and water every so often. If mine corrodes despite my efforts, I&#x27;ll update my assessment.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to and looks nice doing it. The finish isn&#x27;t of the best quality. It yellowed rather quickly and I feel like I have to wipe it down way more often than my razor and brush handle (both chrome also) to keep it free of water marks and dust and the like. It also could use a heavier base, as when I put my razor and brush back on I need to be careful or it will knock over rather easily. Still a good value.</li>
            <li> Does what I need it to do and that is hold my brush and razor. The chrome is a good look too.</li>
            <li> This stand is excellent. I have a Merkrur 180 and it fits perfectly. My brush doesn&#x27;t fit like a glove necessarily but it does fit and that is all that counts. If you have gotten your double edged shaving tools, it is very important to have a razor stand such as this to help care for your products. The stand keeps the razor from rusting/dulling and helps to dry your brush. It looks cool and it works like a charm. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor stand that can compete with the pricey ones. My husband likes that it holds brush and razor.&lt;br /&gt;Very small still to fit in a smaller bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have used this stand for just under a year, and found it very solid and attractive looking.  It suits a variety of safety razor and brush sizes.  I have a Parker 96R long handle, which still has plenty of room to swing, and an Art of Shaving brush that slots in quite well, currently.  I had to take a star or two off though, because the chrome is peeling off in two or three locations; at the base of the pole, on the base, and right below the holder arms.  It&#x27;s not a lot yet, but this thing has only traveled with me once, and I kept it quite well protected.  A little more hardiness and its pretty much perfect.</li>
            <li> Perhaps 3 1/2 stars are more in order. It seems constructed sturdily. It looks fairly nice. It doesn&#x27;t hold the brush like I&#x27;d like (by the handle) because the gap is smaller than two different brushes. So I have to set it on top of the opening, if that makes sense. I&#x27;m sure there is a smaller handled brush that will fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price isn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d consider getting it again unless I saw something else that blew me away. It&#x27;s just not an item that makes me super excited. Finding older, interesting safety razors on the other hand .....</li>
            <li> Very good quality. My only complaint is the foam insert under the base, which bulges out to the the point that it&#x27;s not stable on the bathroom counter. I removed the foam and carefully carved out a section in the middle where the screw holds the top to the base. This solved the problem.</li>
            <li> This stand looks nice and seems well made but it is a little wobbly and tips over too easily. I would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> the locking nut in the base under the non skid foam can be felt, but it doesn&#x27;t go proud of the base on mine.  Holds my any of my Merkurs (short adjustable, 34c, 38c) and a Simpsons Chubby 1 or a Simpsons Tulip 2 no problem.</li>
            <li> It is not balanced and wobbles too much. Unless I have a defective one, I would rather have looked into another model.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice stand.  It is easy to clean. It looks nice on my sink top.  And most importantly....it holds my razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Got this to go with my DE Merkur, and it looks pretty good. I got some Walmart shaving soap to go with it, which doesn&#x27;t look too bad on the thing. The handle is black, and the chrome finish look good. Stands nice, didn&#x27;t have it tip over one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Looks very snazzy&lt;br /&gt;-Very Compacted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t fit most brush handles, might have to hang it by the middle.&lt;br /&gt;-needs to be cleaned often to look nice&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive, but I guess DE shaving requires a little investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/10/13: Six months in, I saw rust developing on the underside, bottom, and along the screw edges. Dot, after dots of rust. I am beginning to wonder when I am going to have to chuck this thing. Rust is like a disease, once it starts it will get everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I understand that everything will rust if by water after a certain amount of time, but my Merkur DE shaver does not. Why should this thing with the amount of money I spent on it? It seems like a finishing issue for the product to me. I subtracted 3 stars due to only being 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very nice finish and sturdy heavy base.</li>
            <li> This stand works perfectly with my Razor and my Edwin Jagger Brush. It will get the occasional film on it, but that&#x27;s to be expected in a bathroom. Just wipe it down and it will be good for another couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made. It takes about 30 seconds to put together, and has never come loose.&lt;br /&gt;It looks beautiful. I like the classic chrome look as it matches my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a well made peice. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and have yet to have any corrosition occur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept my Merkur razor in this stand for almost 2 years, and they look great together. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, great to hold tools..just wish it stayed shiny...suggestions?</li>
            <li> Had been looking for affordable stand. Simple yet nice.</li>
            <li> Solid Stand.  I purchased many of these along with badger brushes, bowls and soap as gifts.</li>
            <li> This works, hasnt rusted and keeps my razor safely immobilized and allows my brush to dry with the bristles hanging down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cant complain - matches the barley pattern on my EJ89BL really nicely and fits a few different brushes well.  No real frills but just works!</li>
            <li> Looks awesome holding my Parker badger brush and my 1964 Gillette Super Slim Adjustable. A perfect addition to any wet shaving set-up.</li>
            <li> Looks good, does what it needs to do. Alittle wobbly, because the screw on the bottom isn&#x27;t recessed, but no real complaints.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little shaving stand. It holds my razor and brush (like it&#x27;s supposed to) without problems. The chrome, as all chrome things do, gets a little dingy with soap especially on the side that holds the brush (since it drips directly onto the base). The underside also will collect water sometimes. But, to make up for those two problems, the entire thing can be easily disassembled (using the cap nut at the top) and easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations</li>
            <li> This shave stand from Col Conk is very solid and well made.  I have been using it for several months and it is holding up great and looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Little wobbly on counter top. Nice chrome. My brush must be bigger than normal. Handle of brush won&#x27;t fit in holder. Have to push brush hairs thru holder instead.</li>
            <li> Perfect stand for my gear!  It is solid and looks great by my sink!  I&#x27;ve had it for 2 weeks and its holding up well.</li>
            <li> Does the job. And looks good too! I&#x27;ve had this for 3 years or so. Still looks great. Well made.</li>
            <li> This stand is very functional. The chrome has held up well over the past year and a half. But it doesn&#x27;t fit my razor or my brush. I have a Merkur Futur and the holder only fits in the middle, so I hang it upside down from the middle of the handle. Not a huge deal I suppose. But I have a very nice Vulfix shaving brush which only fits around the brush part - not around the handle. So it is adding a little more wear and tear to an expensive brush than I would like. I will end up buying a more expensive stand that fits the brush. Something to bear in mind before you buy this.</li>
            <li> Well it is a chrome shave stand.  It is built to last.  Other than that it does exactly what you think a shave stand should do.  Can&#x27;t really praise it cause it is just a shave stand.  Guess I could say it doesn&#x27;t tip over.  It works exactly as designed.  It is not cheaply made so I expect it will sit by my sink till I go to the nursing home.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple years ago. It has held up well and really looks nice. Great product and I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I have read reviews talking about rusting stands and wobbling bases, I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. This stand is clean, sturdy, and has not shown any rust or tarnish in my months with it. I would definitely buy this stand again.</li>
            <li> Prevents water from degrading your brush and razor - a necessity, even more than quality aftershave or soap. This should be your second purchase after a badger brush.</li>
            <li> This product is both elegant and well made. The DES shaver and brush fit very nicely on it. My only complaint is that it has a wobbly base.</li>
            <li> It fits my Merkur Razor and my brush perfectly.  Seems just a tad wobbly, but not enough to be concerned about it tipping or falling over.</li>
            <li> Great item. Goos quality.  Hold both items securely and keeps them in good shape.</li>
            <li> It was great when it first arrived, but the color has gradually gotten a bit off.  Now it looks more gold.  Kinda frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have a Muhle R41 and an Art of Shaving badger hair brush in it and you would think that this stand was custom made for them. Nice heft to to this stand and seems very well made for the price. Save your money on the more expensive ones and give this guy a try, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be more than pleased with it!</li>
            <li> As good as it looks in the  metal (flesh).</li>
            <li> I use this with a brush and one of those 5-blade electric pivoting swiveling razors.  The razor didn&#x27;t fit until I stretched out the opening on the razor side slightly.  If you do that, you&#x27;ll also need an O-ring on the razor handle near the blades to keep the razor&#x27;s eliptical handle from turning sideways and falling out.  With those modifications to the stand and razor, it&#x27;s been working fine.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, sturdy stand. Tall enough to fit most any razor, and I was so happy that multiple different sized brushes fit!</li>
            <li> I really like this stand so far. It&#x27;s great for holding my [[ASIN:B000JMFELY Omega 63171 Stripey 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Stand]] and [[ASIN:B002RBF1PO Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome]]. I keep the stand with supplies in my medicine cabinet, but often I open it just to look at them. It&#x27;s just great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar with hangers is very heavy, but actual base isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s kind of odd that the base&#x27;s weight isn&#x27;t in proportion to the rest, considering how much weight there is in the rest of the stand. It doesn&#x27;t wobble a bit when I grab the brush or razor. Still, it doesn&#x27;t actually topple over, but I was expecting the base to be heavier.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and appears to be durable, the only issue is the brush holder is not wide enough for my brush. The brush I use is from Walmart it is the Van Der Hagen Premium Shave Set (Soap, Bowl, Brush).&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link to the brush set. http://www.amazon.com/Van-Der-Hagen-Premium-Shave/dp/B001A3HPT0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1351481489&amp;sr&#x3D;8-5&amp;keywords&#x3D;shaving+brush</li>
            <li> Very simple, yet elegant design. It doesn&#x27;t break bank and it does what it is supposed to do. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and I personally know nothing about men&#x27;s shaving items. However, this stand is gorgeous. When I received it, there were no finger prints or any marks. Extremely clean and bubble wrapped. Amazing quality. This is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried because other reviewers experienced corrosion for this item. However, so far mine looks pristine. It&#x27;s a fantastic showcase for your double edged razor and brush combo - great way to class up your bathroom. My only quibble is that my Art of Shaving Brush (which was a gift) doesn&#x27;t fit very well in the brush holder - in fact, it just barely gets on there. One of these days I&#x27;ll invest in a new brush that hopefully will fit better, but you&#x27;d think the brush holder would accommodate a wider span of commonly used brushes.</li>
            <li> This thing is simple, well made, and well chromed.  It fits my razor perfectly.  I haven&#x27;t bought a shaving brush yet, and probably will not need to.  The stand looks like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Very nice chrome stand that holds my Edwin Jagger DE89LBl razor and my Colonel 1001 brush.  It looks good on my sink and so far the chrome has stayed nice.  I would recommend getting this.  If I were to improve the design, I would put two more holders on it for another brush and razor.</li>
            <li> This stand is clean looking and does its job. The brush end hold my Escali badger brush perfectly. Shaver end holds my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly six months now, and have had no problems. It is a nice addition to my bathroom and makes airing out my brush easy. The finish on it is still holding up, and looks great!</li>
            <li> My Colonel Conk Badger Brush and Edwin Jagger De89lbl hang up nicely on this stand.  The base is waited to keep it from tipping over too easily, and it looks nice anywhere you put it.  Hanging up your brush really helps it dry.  I have no complaints in regards to this stand.</li>
            <li> I have to say that his is a great little stand.  My wife even commented that it looked great on the counter with my Edwin Jagger DE89 and Escali brush. :)  Not too flashy, solid construction, and great functionality.  I strongly endorse this product.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and looks nice. I especially like that the ends of the prongs are slightly curled up, so no slipping off of the razor will occur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about four months, and it really classes up my bathroom.  Previously, I just had the brush and razor lying on their sides, and using this stand made it look terrific.  Originally I had purchased it just to unclutter the counter-top, but this ended up being quite a bit nicer than I suspected.  I&#x27;ve seen no signs of tarnishing, and others who visit mention that it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this stand for about a year now it awesome! It doesnt scratch from hard water and its well built. It isnt like something from china.</li>
            <li> This holds my husbands razor and brush effectively and looks nice on the counter. Worth the purchase! He loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it does rust and gets pitted after a little while.  Wish it would look better for a little while longer.</li>
            <li> Stand works as advertised.  Color is slightly yellow but fit and finish is good.</li>
            <li> This is a very sturdy accessory with clean lines.  I am happy that it holds my razor and brush firmly and does not shift or wobble.  The design is simple enough to blend in with our bathroom</li>
            <li> My schick quattro looks awesome sitting on this thing. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was suppose to put on the other side so I doubled down with the proglide for those special occassions. I just wish there was a place to put my replacement razors. If I figure it out I will let you know. Just a tip for all you shaving enthusiasts, hai karate has been my go to after shave and it always delivers.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Fusion Phantom Razor and Tweezerman shaving brush so that it they can air dry, and not clutter up my bathroom sink, and it worked out great.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I like to hang the razor.  Fits Edwin Jagger brush</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the look and quality of this stand.  Much less expensive than I can buy in a shave store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for around a year and it still looks great.  It sits on the counter right next to the sink and often gets splashed with water, yet there is no sign of any rust.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I was very worried that I would not find a stand that could hold my brushed, stainless steel brush and safety razor. I am glad that I purchased this product. It allows both the brush and the razor to air dry completely. The stand is weighted well enough so that I can remove either and it will not tip over. The finish is also good because I keep this by the sink and its always getting water on it. Since I made the transition to safety razor shaving, I have been trying to find the best information and the best products to ensure that I have the best shave every time. This product is definitely a plus and well appreciated. Thanks much.</li>
            <li> Very well made with a sturdy heavy base.  It has a very good quality finish.  Both brush and razor fit perfectly.  Exceptional value compared to others that were many times the price.</li>
            <li> Nice unit-Simple-Arrived in nice box-Functions well-Not fancy gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great price and looks good</li>
            <li> Not too big for the vanity. Works well and looks great.</li>
            <li> About a few months into owning this stand, the chrome on the bottom plate started bubbling. I still have it about 2 years later, but the lower part of the leg is cracked, and the chrome is peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, one can&#x27;t complain too much, but it does leave one wishing it&#x27;d be of sturdier construction.</li>
            <li> Love the clean organized look of this item.  Purchased for hubby as a gift obviously for storing his wet-shave items. It holds his razor perfectly however the slot for the brush is a bit narrow.  Hubby remedied this by inverting his brush on top and it works out great.  It def eliminated the cluttered look of his shaving items and allows everything to air dry. Would recommend purchase.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of this stand, but was disappointed in the product that was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stand does not hold a brush by the handle, but by the knot, so it makes the stand top heavy and prone to falling over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the finish and build quality is just average. I imagine that in a few months it would start rusting on the underside of the unit like others have described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But given the price of this stand, and assuming you have a smaller brush, this is an ok unit.</li>
            <li> Whats it, it holds your DE and brush well.  Looks nice if your on a budget grab it, if you could throw an extra $20 on a stand I would.  But it does the job and looks good, a little weary of the listed issue w/pitting and flaking</li>
            <li> Looks clean and holds blade and brush with no problems. Feel like a boss for a rather nice price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rambo</li>
            <li> I liked the stand but had to return it because it does not fit the Art of Shaving brush, otherwise it&#x27;s a nice stand.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive and does the job.  Looks great showcasing my brush and Merkur razor. The chrome plating doesnt seem to pit like some reviews have stated.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t happen for a while at least.</li>
            <li> This stand matches well with my chromed out Edwin Jagger 89 ands fits my Escsti brush. So far, still looks shiny from day 1.</li>
            <li> My son and I both have one.  Simple, classy, and elegant way to show off your razor and brush.  Weighted base that has never flipped over.</li>
            <li> Great item I&#x27;ve been using it for well over a year and does its job! It does get stained by water a lot but overall it doesn&#x27;t rust and looks great.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased the Colonel Conk 775 stand. Since its new cannot comment on how long the finish will last. However it is a decent weight and the finish looks great. The only problem is this won&#x27;t fit my Parker Brush I purchased a year ago. Many reviews state that they fit, however I had to jam my brush in bending the arms a bit to make this work.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a lot you can ask for with this thing other than \\&quot;will it hold my razor?\\&quot; or \\&quot;will it hold my brush?\\&quot;.  Obviously everything will not work with it.  I&#x27;m using a Edwin Jagger DE89 and an Escali badger brush and it works perfectly.  It&#x27;s a shame that something like this is not made in the US but I guess there&#x27;s not much that is anymore.</li>
            <li> I use my Grandfathers old DE razor and felt bad about not having a proper place to put it after each shave. Solution, purchase the Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand. It is soooo nice! My wife even commented on how &amp;#34;Classy&amp;#34; the stand looks in our bathroom. Since I also use a shaving brush, I actually accomplished two things in one by having a way to let it dry naturally. Super product!!</li>
            <li> The finish is great. It&#x27;s tall enough to hold my long handle Merkur and my Parker silver tip brush fits perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the other reviews I was going to give it some time before I made my own rating but I found an issue that caused me to write this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom is rounded. It doesn&#x27;t sit flat. The rubber on the bottom bulges from the middle. If I put my brush in the stand before the razor it topples over.</li>
            <li> I have only had this stand for a few weeks so I don&#x27;t know how it will hold up in the long run.  It does the job for my smaller handled brush and standard size DE razor.  It cannot hold my Merkur Futur razor unfortunately.  The base is sturdy and the finish is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago, when I first started wet shaving.  If you are just getting into it, this is probably the way to go.  Now that I&#x27;m hooked for life, I am going to look for something a bit nicer and more durable.  The price reflects the quality in this case.  Its not a bad product, but it wont last forever.  Everything does unscrew for easy cleaning though.  And I&#x27;ve yet to find a brush or razor it won&#x27;t hold.  Recommended for first-timers, feeling it out.....</li>
            <li> I like the stand, but it is a tight fit for my brush, which is not exorbitantly big or anything.</li>
            <li> I could not find this in any of the local stores, seems harder to find the old style razors and razor blades as most people don&#x27;t use them anymore. This looks great up on the counter and the product works great and item had an accurate description and had a reasonable shipment time.</li>
            <li> holds my brush and razor without any issues. if i had one thing to complain about it would be that I wish it had a place to hold a shaving cream bowl.</li>
            <li> It is a little tall for my razor and brush, and the brush holder is a bit narrow for my brush (though it works).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I replace it, I&#x27;m going to look for one that has a wider base. I haven&#x27;t yet had it fall over, but it seems like it wouldn&#x27;t be difficult for that to happen.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice looking, sturdy, razor stand. I have a chrome handle shaving brush and chrome mug. This stand compliments those very nicely.</li>
            <li> No compaints here. This stand holds a Edwin Jagger or Merkur razor just fine. It also holds my parker and GBS brushes without problem. Overall I am pleased with this order and just recentely purchased this same model, but in black. Go for it!</li>
            <li> Holds everything as advertised...be a man, use a proper razor and shaving soap!  Get this to proudly display your classic man grooming items!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for a few years now and it still looks great!  I am now ready to buy a real expensive stand but this looks brand new still so I&#x27;m debating on purchasing the new stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I paid $20 for this but can&#x27;t remember.  In any case, this is really nice and fits my: Edwin Jagger DE89L, Parker butterfly safety razor, Parker olive wood silvertip badger hair brush, Merkur short handle Progress safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pick this up, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My fiance loved it and now it is collecting dust on the bathroom sink.  It does look nice holding the Silvertip Badger bristle shaving brush and fancy razor.  The razor does hang flawlessly with a very snug fitting. To be really fair I do dig the beard.</li>
            <li> Brush side too narrow to accommodate the brush handle so it has to rest at the base near the bristles, and not securely at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily my dad chucked the brush up in the lathe and turned the handle slot down for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something to consider: chrome is prone to attracts spots and drips from drying shaving gear. May want to apply a wax, or other barrier to preserve a fuss free shine.</li>
            <li> Works well for the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it. Has a clean look and the price was right. I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clever design: simple and elegant.  It&#x27;s the perfect fit for the brush and shaver I already have.  I&#x27;m also a big fan of chrome.  I only wish I could find this in the stores.</li>
            <li> A sturdy razor and brush stand that will add some class to your bathroom decor. Chrome is done very nice with no defects. Price was a little on the high end, get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> Buy the stand recommended for you brush there are many different brush handle sizes.&lt;br /&gt;I have three brands of this type stand they all seem to be made exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;So get the least expensive, why pay more because the box has a different name on it.</li>
            <li> I like the weighted bottom, the smooth chrome finish and it looks great on the sink top. It is very handy with the razor and brush conveniently placed.</li>
            <li> The side that holds the brush is fine, works as intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side that holds the razor is a bit short. The razor balances precariously and the slightest bump sends the razor to the counter top or even worse, the floor.  If the prongs would have been made longer they would offer enough support to make the razor stable. Had I the ability to see this in the store, I&#x27;d have got a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base could be a little wider and/or heavier. The stand does not fall over as it is, but a little more stability would be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, its 20 bucks, still looking for something that will hold my razor and make coffee.</li>
            <li> This stand is reasonably priced, well constructed and makes an attractive, practical storage stand for razor &amp; brush. Keeps a good quality brush &amp; razor conveniently stored and less susceptible to accidental damage.</li>
            <li> Nice modern look.  It holds the brush and razor for proper drying.  it is a fine product for retro wet shavers.</li>
            <li> Purchased along with Merkur long handle razor and Parker Badger brush in black/chrome. Both products fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Started to rust after the first year or so.  Overall good stand though.</li>
            <li> Fits my brush and razor perfectly.  Thankfully a rubber bottom so it does not leave rust rings.  So far no rust anywhere on it and it stays in the shower.</li>
            <li> I RETURNED THIS ITEM.....</li>
            <li> My girlfriend like the idea of having my razor and brush out on \\&quot;display\\&quot; in our bathroom.  This looks great, is surprisingly heavy duty, and lets my brush air out nicely on top of everything.  I haven&#x27;t seen any pitting or other quality issues at all.  Holds my long handled Merkur 180 without a problem.</li>
            <li> Great stand! Holds my Merkur 180 &amp; my Tweezerman perfectly! Pretty sturdy as well. It doesn&#x27;t wobble that much and stands just fine. The chrome finish is always shiny. My roommate takes really steamy shores and it causes mildew sometimes in bathroom which then has to be cleaned up of course but the stand doesn&#x27;t show any signs fatigue. Great stand for the price!</li>
            <li> very sleek and holds my razor and brush for shaving. Solid product and it hasnt rusted either.</li>
            <li> It fit my brush.  It fit my razor.  They&#x27;re both easy to get to.  Looks like it&#x27;s supposed to.  Solid construction.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I use this with [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]].&lt;br /&gt;I love the look of this in my bathroom and it holds both my brush and razor nicely.  You are not supposed to store brushes on their side or top because they do not dry properly.  That&#x27;s why this stand is important, it allows for the brush to hang dry and be stored properly.  The hooks are the perfect size for the two products I linked about and I&#x27;m sure many others will fit in them.  My only annoyance is when the brush hang dries, if it drips water then it leaves a water mark on the stand.  This is not really the stands fault but something to be aware of.  As long as you do not have water sitting on it or it sitting in water there should be no damage to the stand itself.  It does its job and looks good doing it.</li>
            <li> Chrome finish looks good.  It holds my edwin jagger de89lbl razor and brush with no problems.  I have nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice stand Really Nice.  So why only 3 stars.  Along with the stand I bought a new Parker Ivory handled brush.  The brush opening on the stand is too small for the brush.  It&#x27;s also too small for  my best badger brush from Art of Shaving...  So while it&#x27;s nice, you have to be careful that it fits.  C&#x27;est la vie.</li>
            <li> Though it looks nice I find that this brand and model safety razor stand, with its uneven bottom - highest point of the bottom being the center, causing the stand to wobble in all directions - and badger brush arm lacking a width wide enough to hold even a standard sized brush, also lacks in practicality for ownership.  In short, I would not recommend this particular brand and design.</li>
            <li> Good solid construction. Holds all of my brushes (WSP Baroness Silvertip, Semogue 1470, Parker Pure BAdger with Blue Wood Handle, Semogue Owners Club Boar Bristle and Semogue Owners Club 2 Band Badger) and all myu razors (Merkur 34c, Merkur 180 and Gillette 1956 Red Tip) so I have no complaints. Good piece of gear!</li>
            <li> Base is a little small making it somewhat unstable, and the brush holder side is a little small for most brushes.</li>
            <li> No complaints. This seems to be working quite well. Everything is I expected. I&#x27;m glad I remembered to order the stand.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this to store his safety razor and it helps to keep it safe and clean</li>
            <li> Well made and attractive however my shaving brush handle did not fit in stand. I&#x27;ll purchase a new brush.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Nice and heavy material, not likely to tip.  Since I don&#x27;t have a soap brush, I can share that side for my partner&#x27;s razor as well.</li>
            <li> This is good but the felt on the bottom collects moisture and causes rust. I keep mine in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Had it for about three month and it looks good matches my razor and I don&#x27;t see any discoloration or  something like that , it does not work with Art of Shaving brushes because the handle of the brush is too big and it doesn&#x27;t fit there .</li>
            <li> Good stand. Does what it should for storing my razor and brush properly. Finish seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> It just works.  The base is weighted so it holds my razor without tipping over and the finish has held up well.</li>
            <li> My razor fits in it and my brush fits in it and it looks nice, that&#x27;s all I could ask for in the product and it delivers. Nice heavy base to it, so it won&#x27;t fall over.</li>
            <li> A great product that is beautiful. It&#x27;s definitely a must have piece of equipment that compliments your razor and shave brush.</li>
            <li> mine doesn&#x27;t hold the brush like it&#x27;s supposed to.  The brush holder side is just a tad too narrow.  The razor side holds my merkel just fine though.  I have to place the brush fork between he bristles and the handle.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Looks nice while doing it.  Hasn&#x27;t rusted or shown any wear in over a year.</li>
            <li> Colonel Conk stand easily accomodates a Merkur 180(23c) and VDH brush.  Stand comes with a great polished finish and is a must have for the simple everyday DE shaving enthusiast.</li>
            <li> The base has a nice bit of weight to it to hold your brush and razor without tipping. The base has a grippy pad on the bottom so that it won&#x27;t slip or slide. The chrome seems of decent quality, so I would expect it to last for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this stand to be a very good value for the money and would recommend it to any of my friends who are in the market for one.</li>
            <li> It is a razor stand.  It stands.  And holds my razor and brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, I have a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]] and a [[ASIN:B002FC7B2G Merkur Long Handled Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome #180, 10 Double Edge Platinum Blades]], although I didn&#x27;t buy mine with blades.  The style of the stand matches my razor&#x27;s perfectly, and the brush fits very well on the brush side -- all in all, I am exceptionally pleased.</li>
            <li> Apart from being a bit wobbly, this thing will hold a DE and brush just fine, but chances are, you&#x27;re looking at this over other options because of how nice it looks.  Unfortunately, the chrome finish gets ruined quickly if you&#x27;re keeping this in a bathroom.  Unless you&#x27;re willing to take it apart and polish it every day, don&#x27;t expect it to look like the pictures for very long.</li>
            <li> very nice stand!&lt;br /&gt;easy to put together, and very shining.&lt;br /&gt;i just recommended anyone who need to to stand on something the razor and the brush!</li>
            <li> Happy with the look, holds my Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Razor and Tweezerman Badger Hair brush just fine (would look better with a chrome handled brush, which I&#x27;ll pick up when I wear out my current brush....)</li>
            <li> Looks great, functions great, and it is very reasonably priced. It is not some light weight junk product. I was very pleased as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> Awesome stand! I use the merkur 180 and the Escali badger brush, and the stand holds both with ease. No worrying about either falling and the stand is very duarable. Its great for drying the brush since it stands upright. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I thought at first this stand would be a cheap metal stand and not heavy enough to support my shaving brush and my safety razor. I have to recognize that my prejudice was deeply far away from truth. This stand is well made, good metal construction and heavy enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> This is very nice set. It&#x27;s simple and compact. It holds most of my razors and burshes perfectly and seems to be nicely balanced. It&#x27;s also a very good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand to hold my DE razor and shaving brush. It is a nice tall stand and can usually hold the brush by the handle, but for certain thicker handles (like the Semogue 620) it doesn&#x27;t fit on the handle and only on the base of the brush. I should also mention that the base is nicely weighted and is very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this stand.</li>
            <li> It works well enough as long as nothing bumps it. The forks should be longer and bent up more to hold the razor and brush on. Anytime I move the stand, the razor and brush fall off, if a gentle bump will send the equipment falling.</li>
            <li> This stand matches my Merkur 38 HD, my chrome handled silvertip badger bristle brush, and provides that extra shine to contrast my dark mango wood shave soap bowl. The stand has a heavy base and a quite sturdy platform for your shave brush and safety razor and feels as if it will last for years to come. Other than that, I don&#x27;t really know what else to say, other than it does the job well and looks good doing it. Cleaning is a cinch, using a little alcohol on a cotton round takes care of any spots or droplets that may happen on the base or hooks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this stand if you want something that looks good, will last quite a long time, and won&#x27;t break your wallet.</li>
            <li> occasionally it will get lose and I have to spin the bottom to tighten the nut but other than that it works great. Still looks just as good as when I bought and it doesn&#x27;t look like it will let go anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This item holds my brush and razor perfectly. I had reservations about buying this due to not knowing if my razor would fit.Took a chance and am glad I did.It was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this in my bathroom for well over a year now and there is no rust on it. It is heavy enough to hold a razor and brush without tipping over if you aren&#x27;t super careful hanging up your man grooming equipment. It looks high-class too. I hit it up with some automotive wax in the joints right when I got it just in case. It&#x27;s a super easy thing to do to ensure that it looks nice for longer than usual.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful shave stand, and my boyfriend loved it as a gift for Valentine&#x27;s day. However, upon arrival, the stand did not stand sturdily on its own, and often tipped due to an uneven bottom. This was remedied when all of the items were placed in the stand (they weighted it down). Furthermore, after a few months of use, the chrome began to flake and chip off of the stand. I understand that the moisture and humidity of a bathroom may help this process along, but shouldn&#x27;t have happened after 5-6 months of use. Disappointed in the quality of the stand, though the other products (wet shave cup, brush) seem to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> It is a very nice stand and it looks and works well, it holds both the razor and the brush.</li>
            <li> It has not begun to rust yet like others have said.  I have only had it for a month or so but so far it is ok</li>
            <li> 4 Month Review -After switching from Mach III razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is the listed product I am using as part of my &amp;#34;Shaving Arsenal.&amp;#34; It took me a while to find each piece needed to bring it all together. My approach was finding all the pieces that had the best reviews vs. price. Just about everything listed below was the &amp;#34;highest price&amp;#34; but luckily these items don&#x27;t cost much. Not CLOSE to as much as it costs to shave with Mach III Safety razors. If your ready to make the switch to a superior, and cheaper, alternative then check out the products below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stand: Safety Razor stand&lt;br /&gt; Once I learned that a stand was needed for the &amp;#34;Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush&amp;#34; I decided to go with this one. Its been 4 months and the chrome is still shining well. Its sturdy, and holds my double edged razor as well as the shaving brush as if this product was made just for them. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XURHNY/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_42&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handle: Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this handle is the quality. You can tell its not your basic cheap piece of metal. Its got a comfortable weight to it, keeps its brilliant chrome finish, and clean up is quick and easy. I consider myself a man with normal size hands  and don&#x27;t know why this one is considered &amp;#34;long handled.&amp;#34; Its just a tad longer than the Mach III razor I used to use. However, it’s a night and day difference compared to those &amp;#34;Safety razors.&amp;#34; It cuts very close with minimal passes. I&#x27;ve never had a shave that was this close before.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Merkur-Model-180-Handled-Safety/dp/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355613524&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;keywords&#x3D;double+edge+razor+handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades: 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve heard there are better blades on the Market but since I started out with a 100-pack it will be 2-YEARS until I need to buy any more since I change them out once a week. I&#x27;m half Filipino so I don&#x27;t have the thickest facial hair but definably pull off a goatee without a problem.  Other than one &amp;#34;Dud&amp;#34; all other blades have been very predictable and easy to use. I have gotten the occasional razor burn but that appears to be normal with any Double-edged razor. I was worried I would be opening myself up to more &amp;#34;risk&amp;#34; with these but feel that I am at no more risk than any other safety blade now that I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017ZECA6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_32&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush: Not sure why its made of &amp;#34;Badger&amp;#34; hair but its working. Where this brush looses a star is because it lost some of its bristles during the first week. Since then there haven&#x27;t been any more hair-loss and I&#x27;ve had no problems. 4 months going strong. It creates a nice lather and feels good against the skin. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G647Y8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_47&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving Soap: Prosaro Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;It works but I with it had more lather. Based on previous reviews, it sounds like the amount of lather has significantly decreased. Does it work? Yes, but I like a good lather. Anyways, its been 3 months and I feel like I have maybe gone through half of this container which isn&#x27;t bad. It also has a very fresh but subtle smell which I really like.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00837YY18/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_44?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap Bowl: Guess I didn&#x27;t need this since I am using the Proraso Shaving Soap which is self contained. For as simple as it is, it lost two stars. There is a rim that goes along the bottom that has (or had) a black rubber piece that ran around it to provide a good footing for the Bowl while on a counter. The very first day this part fell off, it didn’t seat on there, and it wasn&#x27;t glued. In the garbage that piece went. The next star was lost due to finish. It was a pretty flat finish for chrome and you could see theseveral light scratches across it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00404RI70/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked. Based on reviews I had a hunch I would really like this. Once it arrived I was right! It gives me a very fresh feeling after my morning shave, and has an amazing smell which isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. My wife is very sensitive to smells but this is one she actually admires.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000053L6W/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2several light scratches across it. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00404RI70/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_35&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Shave: Virgin Island Bay Rum by Clubman&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tested several types of Aftershave in stores but never found anything I liked.

            <li> Works just as promised keeps your brush dry in your razor too I highly recommend this stand for anyone Shaves with a safety razor</li>
            <li> I was happy with the purchase. But as in life, nothing is perfect. However, for the cost I&#x27;m satisfied and happy I didn&#x27;t have to go to the mall!</li>
            <li> Sturdy, well balanced.  Good finish, feels durable.  Looks great.  I couldnt ask for more.</li>
            <li> Cheap simple effective. Brush use may vary. Check your brush size before ordering.</li>
            <li> Received my brush razor stand today and I must say it&#x27;s really nice, that said I hope it stays that way. I had the same issues everyone else has had with the rubber piece up inside the base too far, a big washer fixed that. Then I rook some clear RTV Silicone put on the treads of the screw base and tightened it down and cleaned off the excess silicone that squished out the sides if the post that should keep water from getting into the innards of the base. Then I took some Carnauba Menguiars paste wax and polished it up REAL GOOD, which I&#x27;ll repeat from time to time. Hopefully that will protect it good enough that I&#x27;ll get a couple years of service out of it, until I replace it with a stainless steel one.  Real nice looking for something this cheap and that will earn it my five star rating in spite of the minor issues.</li>
            <li> This stand is great! It matches my Merkur safety razor perfectly and my shaving brush fits as well. All in all it does what I need it to do and it looks good doing it!!</li>
            <li> If you are using shaving brush for shave, this is highly recommended. Helps keep the brush and razor dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I placed the order for this stand. Once it got sent to me and I opened the box I was shocked at how nice it was. It is very heavy and well built! Also the hangar tab plate that the brush and razor hang from is a lot thicker than it shows in the picture (maybe 2 or 3 times thicker) VERY sturdy. The chrome plating is perfect out of the box. I will be sure to keep it clean and wipe up wet spots on it to keep the finish nice. Fit and finish is excellent. My razor and brush fit perfect. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This thing does the job.  It holds my razor and my brush, and looks great doing it.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for a couple of years now and it still looks good.  My only gripe is that whenever I go to wipe off the porcelain counter, there is always a green ring under the stand.</li>
            <li> What is there to say, this thing holds a razor and a brush and looks good. I use it to hold my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]] and my [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman  Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]]. Doesnt fall over and it is really nich chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 01/22/2015&lt;br /&gt;After 2.5 years of use this stnad finally has some small rust spots on it. I like the way it looks when cleaned up and there is a speckling of rust spots, makes it have character but for those that like everything clean and shiny, this may be a problem.</li>
            <li> Hold both my brush and razor next to my sink. It looks good and seems weel made for what it is.</li>
            <li> Husband is very picky about his shaving things, however he was thrilled to get this stand.  The narrow side holds his razor and the large opening holds a shaving brush.  It is high enough so that the razor and brush are about one inch from the base of the stand.  It is easy to clean and easy to keep clean. Looks perfect in bathrooms with silver, nickel or stainless steel hardware.</li>
            <li> Most of the men in my life own a Colonel Conk Evernice (model 775) razor stand due to conscientious gifting from Christmas and birthdays ever since I gave my brother one a few years ago. While there are more expensive duos out there, Colonel Conk&#x27;s option combines affordability with durability and high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It serves its essential function of keeping a razor and a badger-hair brush upright without problems, despite being loaded with heavy steel razors or tucked into a corner. This stand&#x27;s weight resists being knocked over by a gentle shove and passing cats -- a valuable feature when countertop space is at a premium or you need to trust putting your razor down won&#x27;t end up with a loose cartridge on the floor or in the sink. The base is sufficiently wide for a good grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chrome finish is attractive and resists spotting or rusting. I still wipe down the fixtures between uses to keep them in good condition. Cleaning up is a snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary drawback is the width of the razor holder, which will not fit all models of razor. While the brush holder has fit the different varieties my relatives have had through the years, some of their razors slipped through or would not balance sufficiently. A little jury-rigging sometimes solved the problem but it may be worth measuring the shaft and razor head to be sure they will have a good seat.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Everything is within reach when shaving and looks nice on the bathroom counter. Great for the razor and soap brush to air dry</li>
            <li> Some reviews stated that this will rust over time. So when it arrived I rubbed a little gun oil on it to help prevent the rust. This is a very heavy well made stand and looks great in the bathroom. worked great form my parker brush and Merkur razor. I will update if mine ever rusts.</li>
            <li> Since 2008 I have been using a safety razor to shave. Just recently however I have starting using the shave soap that is best when applied with a brush. So this stand was a must and very affordable too.</li>
            <li> This product was too small for my badger brush, which defeated the whole point of getting this kind of stand...it just wastes space now since I can only put my DE razor on it and not my brush. But I invested 20 USD on it, so I can&#x27;t justify throwing it out and buying a new one that might also not fit my brush...</li>
            <li> i LOVE THIS FIXTURE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS ME MORE SPACE ON MY SINK TOP AND IS A SAFE WAY TO STORE MY RAZOR.</li>
            <li> World&#x27;s perfect.  I use this daily to hold my safety razor and brush.</li>
            <li> Well built.  I would definitely buy it again.  Judging from the quality, though, I probably won&#x27;t have to ever replace it.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the money.  Quality is good (I give the finish an 8 out of 10).  Timeless, classic styling.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and works very well with my EJ razor and Tweezerman brush.  No problems with tipping and aesthetically appealing. If anything happens to it, would buy again.</li>
            <li> The base was badly tarnished when it arrived along with the stem.  Even Tarn-X could not clean off the red rust stains on the base.  It will hold up the brush and razor.  Looks like it sat in salt water for a month.</li>
            <li> was priced well and looks great ..  well built and seems like it will last a lifetime.. very happy with it and would recomend it</li>
            <li> Looks great on your countertop.  Very easy to clean will bring a sophisticated look to your counter and bathroom and women will love it.</li>
            <li> Quality is great. Base is nice and heave so it stays in place. Fits my razor and brush perfectly. Looks nice very nice on my vanity.</li>
            <li> The Colonel Conk stand has worked perfect for me in most every way. I have several razors and brushes, and so far the Wee Scot is the only one that doesn&#x27;t fit the stand (it&#x27;s very small, but an awesome brush). It cleans up easily with a damp towel, and has enough weight to keep it in one place when I am taking a razor or brush on and off of the stand.</li>
            <li> The product is decently priced and appears solid.  It fits my Tweezerman brush and Merkur razor perfectly.  All of the reviews talking about the bad quality and rusting concern me. Especially because I keep it in the shower, where I shave.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Was not chipped and hasn&#x27;t done so. The stem seems ever-so-slightly crooked, but not really noticeable. Fits my generic shaving brush that I got at a local bath store. It also holds a disposable razor, e.g. Mach3. I didn&#x27;t know if it was going to fit that, but for the price I risked it.Seems ironic holding a cheap disposable razor with a chrome holder! But it works and keep the brush and razor dry. When my pack of disposable razors go out I&#x27;ll invest in a DE razor.</li>
            <li> Just solid. I&#x27;m decently picky, and it works well. It doesn&#x27;t feel or stand like a product that&#x27;s much more expensive, but it&#x27;s definitely solid for the value.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this stand holding my Merkur Futur safety razor and shave brush.  It arrived earlier than expected.  Thank you for the quality product.</li>
            <li> Nicely constructed with a good heft to it. Has a nice quality feel to it and goes with my merkur strait razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> This shaving stand is doing great service holding my razor and brush, very pleased with it and it looks sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this stand for about two years. Previously, I would just lay my badger brush, but found it didn&#x27;t dry well and took up counter space. I purchased this to hold my razor and brush while taking up minimal space. It does all these things very well. It seems to be a quality stand with no wiggling or rocking while holding my shaving tools. It would make a great gift. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> this perfect to compliment my new razor system.Its made of high quality and some real weight to the item.This was a perfect add on to my new razor system</li>
            <li> I bought my son two different safety razors for Christmas and he really loves them and how well they shave but then he said he needed a stand for them in order to keep them from rusting. I got on Amazon and found this one at a good price and even though it is meant for a razor and a brush, it works just fine to hold both razors that he has. He really liked it so I was please too. You can find just about anything at Amazon and this was a very nice find.</li>
            <li> This stand has enough weight in the bottom that it&#x27;s very sturdy, which is nice. It can break down easily if you wanted to travel with it, but the aforementioned weight might be a problem. Despite getting splashed all the time, it has remained nice and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on the counter like my previous stand, made of stained wood, did.</li>
            <li> The water/soap has stained this and I thought it would not. Also the razor my husband uses will not stay firming in the space meant for it. It keeps falling off. He is a devout mug and brush man, so have to keep trying to find the ultimate stand for his brush and razor.</li>
            <li> Husband has been using this for over a year now, good stand for the price.</li>
            <li> This product looks great in the bathroom and saves space on the counter. Love that this holder is multifunction and the color is great too.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the weight of my badger brush tipping it. The base has enough weight on it to hold everything up even if I remove the razor or brush from the stand.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It came with the chrome chipped and bubbled but other than that I love it. I just don&#x27;t have the time to deal with returning it and the shipping was somewhat slow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stand in my bathroom, along with an EJ DE89 razor and a synthetic hair brush for well over a year. Its held up surprisingly well for the price. There is zerio rust or metal deterioration on the outside, or bottom base. I was expecting some rust on the weighted base, based on some other reviews, but I have not seen that with mine.</li>
            <li> The stand holds both my Merkur HD razor and badger hair brush perfectly and looks great on my counter. Quality seems to be up to snuff for the price. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> It holds my razor.  It holds my brush.  It stands on my sink.  It&#x27;s made of stainless steel.  It kind of matches my Merkur 180 Long-Handle.  It&#x27;s a stand.</li>
            <li> Keeps my razor and bursh ready to use!</li>
            <li> very sturdy is what it says it is and will last me very long, nice to whom who wants to have a nice looking stand</li>
            <li> Just as expected, came quickly and well packaged.  Only note, not all brushes will slide easily into the holder.  Bye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read various reviews about this having corrosion problems hopefully i dont run into this, so far this stand is exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li> perfect stand for my edwin jagger safety razor. It is well made and of heavy construction, looks like it would last forever. One day this will be an antique for my kids. It&#x27;s too bad I don&#x27;t have a son to pass it on to, just girls:( Well may be they will want to use it. I&#x27;ve looked alll over the net for a nice stand to put in my bathroom, and this fit my style. Cool and vintage!!!</li>
            <li> Pros: holds your razor and brush, super sturdy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: nothing really...I guess water stains don&#x27;t look good on it, so wipe them off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this stand - the only reason to get another one is if you are on an extreme budget and want to get a crap plastic stand, but this isn&#x27;t really that expensive.</li>
            <li> Easy to use stand..  Nicely asedembled, appears to be quicte stable.  Base is heavy enough to keep from tipping.  The razor side hold manyt different razors woithout issue, but the bruch side is narrow and may not fit your brush (I hang mine with bristles down, with 100% of handle above the opening).</li>
            <li> I have a Merkur 34C, which is one of the most popular safety razors on the market. I found that it does not hold the razor very well. The cut out could go further towards the stem and it would hold the razor flush. As far as the brush side goes it does not hold a \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; Pure Badger brush like the brushes pictured are being held. You have to put it on the stand where the brush enters the handle and then it kind of \\&quot;teeters\\&quot; on the stand. This isn&#x27;t to say that other brushes would fit appropriately, but if this side was slightly larger by just a hair, it would accommodate my brush. The chroming/finish is of good quality although I am leery about the base as it has a foam insert on the bottom and I an only image this is going to meet water as most of us would place this stand near our sinks.</li>
            <li> Holds my Merkur Future and Art of Shaving brush without any problems what so ever. I recommend this to tidy up any shave area.</li>
            <li> I got this stand for my Muehle safety razor and Edwin-Jagger badger brush. It is very nice and it has an initial impression of being fragile, but it actually is pretty sturdy. It has a good balance when it&#x27;s holding both the brush and the razor. The reason I don&#x27;t give it a 5 star review is because I thought it had a nice silver chrome finish, when in reality it has a kind of coppery chrome finish, which contrasts with my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the corrosion some people experience, I will have to test it for longer but I don&#x27;t see it will be a problem in my case, since I have a separate cabinet for my shaving accessories and I dry them before they go in. I&#x27;ll write an update in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Very good stand and you won&#x27;t get a better looking stand for the money. Keep in mind the coppery color, not silver.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, its larger than it looks and very sturdy. It looks great on my sink, I liked mine so much bought two more as gifts for my brother and best freind for fathers day.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do.  what more can i expect?</li>
            <li> I still use this product over a year later. It does a great job with most brushes and all razors, but my Art of Shaving brush does not fit into the slot for the brush, which causes me much sadness. I cry myself to sleep every night now, because I love it so much and can&#x27;t really use it often with the brush I like.</li>
            <li> Nice stand for the price (the finish isn&#x27;t the greatest).</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great quality</li>
            <li> A bit larger than expected so it takes up a bit more space on the sink but at least your brush stays dry</li>
            <li> This little stand keeps my counter less cluttered.  The brush is allowed to dry properly.</li>
            <li> A beautiful razor stand that will stand out in the modern man&#x27;s bathroom.  Definitely something that adds some class to the bathroom counter top, rather than detract or look cluttered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well constructed and a nice weight to the piece.  Beautiful finish, especially nice when paired with the Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> heavy base with a nice look. check your brush handle size before ordering</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas - works perfectly and matches his fancy razor</li>
            <li> Minus three stars; It&#x27;s already showing signs of rust—I purchased just 4 months ago. Fingerprint magnet. Two-stars remain for functionality, footprint and utility.</li>
            <li> Perfect product!  Same as advertised.</li>
            <li> It looks good on my vanity.  A stand is the only way to properly dry your brush.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any rust as I&#x27;m big careful to keep it dry after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Does just what it is designed to do. After several months of use it still has the finish of a new item. Holds every razor I own from Gillette&#x27;s to Gems, even lather catchers. Brush side is sized very nicely to hold all my brushes. From Tweezermans to my high end Badger brushes, they all seem to fit.</li>
            <li> I wanted a stand to hold my shaver and brush.  There are not a lot of choices out there.  This stand arrives fully assembled and is a very attractive stand.  It is sturdy and heavy enough to hold a shaver, brush, or both without tipping over.  My only criticism is it is grossly overpriced.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again. Fast delivery and it is easy to clean and keep clean holds my gellitt pro glide razor just fine.</li>
            <li> This stand was smaller than expected, but heavier than expected !&lt;br /&gt; A solid construction that features a highely shiny metal look, seemlessly integrates with any modern bathroom.&lt;br /&gt; It holds my shaving brush [EJ best badger] and EJ DE89bl razor perfectly, allowing them to dry after use.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccomend !</li>
            <li> you know that chrome need to be polished and cleaned to look good, so I was expecting that, but not every brush will fit, it is kind of small and can not be adjusted. the biggest problem: metal insert in the bottom of the stand (to add weight to keep it from flipping over) will rust and all that dirt will stain your counter. rubber bottom piece is not water tight either. so it is nice for some one who shaves without water.</li>
            <li> Holds my safety razor and badger brush in style.  Has a nice heft to it and just looks flat out classy!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I went back to the classic razor, refills are cheaper and I think a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful gift!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect stand for razor and brush!</li>
            <li> This item was perfect for holding both my boyfriends safety razor and his shaving brush. Good quality, good weight to it so it will stand up to both items being on it. It&#x27;s space-saving as well.</li>
            <li> perfect holder for brush, and razor.  hubby loves them  bought one for each of our sons</li>
            <li> Collects a lot of water droplets that need to be cleaned often, But hey its still standing!</li>
            <li> Sturdy and well made. It holds my brush and razor with no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to and looks nice. Feels sturdy and high quality. Feels like the same quality as the expensive ones from AOS</li>
            <li> it works - what else is there to say about a razor stand?  good value.  looks good.  holds my razor and brush.  if you need one, get this one.</li>
            <li> It holds my DE razor and my brush. What else can I say. My brush handle is a little too big to fit in it, so I slide it in at the base of the bristles. Its nothing fancy, but it does its job, so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the stainless construction. It wipes off easily and I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while now without any complaints.</li>
            <li> This does the job it is supposed to do. It holds up my badger brush and razor without any issues. It looks nice, with the Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a pretty nice holder to dry out the badger brush.</li>
            <li> A stand like this is a mandatory item for preservation of the brush, especially if the handle is not porcelain.</li>
            <li> great for organization and display!  stable enough for the price, and looks to be built to last.  i&#x27;m very happy with a formal stand for my razor and brush!</li>
            <li> we needed something to keep the razor off the counter and this did the trick. also good for assisting in keeping the razor dry</li>
            <li> This stand is all I need to hold my gear when I am not shaving, it allows my brush and razor to dry when I am not using them and looks great as well. Very fair price, and good value all around.</li>
            <li> My brush doesn&#x27;t fit nicely but I made a slight modification and for the price it lets my brush dry properly.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit the badger brush I bought, but it was great for all the other stuff like how it looked. (&#x3D;</li>
            <li> This stand is beautiful. It looks great in my bathroom. It came already assembled and it seems solid and well built so far.</li>
            <li> This little guy sits proudly on my sink and keeps my brush and razor looking stylish and protected at all times.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while now, and there are no signs of rust or corrosion.  If you shave like a real man, you need this product.</li>
            <li> This stand is a great options for those of you with the EJ DE89 or other chrome finished razors. It looks great on the counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Wider knotted brushes might not fit. Works well with small to medium knots.</li>
            <li> I love it! Very modern sleek and classy and fits well on my counter. My brush didn&#x27;t fit normally so I improvised and made it fit another way! For the price this is awesome!</li>
            <li> After a couple of years service, the base developed some corrosion.  It does it&#x27;s job and is generally attractive, but still it could be put together better.</li>
            <li> This holder is a bit bland and ordinary. It does not fit my G.B.S. brush.  Would be nice to know brush holder dimensions before buying. Amazon...I have a return heading your way. On the hunt for another brush &amp; razor holder.</li>
            <li> This tree does what it&#x27;s supposed to do- it&#x27;s true that the larger shave brushes won&#x27;t fit it very well- but it is a Colonel Conk stand so it shouldn&#x27;t be too surprising other brushes won&#x27;t work - not all brushes are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finish- I do wipe it off if I see water spots.  Only had it for three weeks- no issues yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;weight- has a good hefty base- hasn&#x27;t fallen over yet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shaving a month without a stand and now almost a month with it- it&#x27;s easy to see why people use these- there&#x27;s no good way to dry your brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for $26 shipped- if you see it for less and are on the fence- do it because at $26 it is well worth the money</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and very shiny. An accent to my bathroom,  but now I need a brush to match!  All around  a great deal.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my Merkur 180 based on its similar aesthetics. While its well built and heavy, the brush holder was not large enough to fit my art of shaving brush. Maybe it will work better for others</li>
            <li> Great stand...I thought it was kind of pricey at first, but now I know why. Great quality, nice looking and saves space.</li>
            <li> Great stand. Holds up my Tweezerman badger brush and Edwin Jagger well. I highly recommended you get this item as a part of your shaving kit.</li>
            <li> Great stand and very elegant, works well with any razor and brush. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for one!</li>
            <li> This holder works perfectly for my Merkur 180 long handle safety razor, and also for my brush.  It also looks great - really nice chrome plating.  I just got it so I can not speak of how it holds up, but so far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> No frills and holds my brush and razor fine.  Sure, one could easily knock it over if jostled or otherwise used in a manner other than intended.  I&#x27;ve read more than a few reviews complaining that this stand is unstable.  I did have to cut a small section out of the center of the pad at the bottom as the screw holding the whole this together was causing a bulge at the bottom (causing it to teeter a bit).  After I made this modification, the things works great!  Outside of my tweak to get it to sit flat, I have zero complaints and can only conclude that others that are hung up on this are just that.  If this will be a problem for you, go ahead and buy one of the more expensive stands.  I see no need.</li>
            <li> Outstanding razor stand for the money. Rubber bottom to prevent sliding around, good chrome finish. Good deal and the brush and razor fit on it without any problems.</li>
            <li> This great looking stand balances the razor well (a Merkur for me), but I was looking for something a bit more steady. Also - my brush (from The Body Shop) fit snugly when I first bought the brush, but the wood has since expanded slightly and no longer fits.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this stand for use on business trips and it works and looks nice.  I can assemble or disassemble it in a minute and it takes up little space in my luggage.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I have to hang my shaving brush from the junction of the handle and the bristles, rather than from the handle because the gap for hanging the brush by the handle isn&#x27;t wide enough to accommodate any of my 5 shaving brush handles.  Other than that, it is fine and it does work to suit my needs.</li>
            <li> perfect for the application it was purchased for.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed with this product. Out of the box, it works good and looks good, but after a bit of time the finish on it gets really ugly with spots that will not come off with cleaning.</li>
            <li> Sturdy for the price, great quality</li>
            <li> Reviews made me nervous but it&#x27;s holding up well&lt;br /&gt;No rust and fits my brush and blade perfectly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts a good stand for the money, takes up little room on the counter, and holds the items nicely (though the Omega brush I bought it with has to be hung by the bristles (the handle is too big to fit in it). Nice little piece, and great for storing the shaving accouterments.</li>
            <li> No complaints. Functions properly. Looks nice. Feels nice. If you are looking for a quality shaving stand, and a pretty reasonable price, this is the stand for you.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it holds my double edge razor and brush which will  allow them to dry better in the upright position after i use them.</li>
            <li> Got this stand to complete my set and it looks amazing. Doesn&#x27;t tip over at all. Hold my brush and razor perfectly. Not expensive compared to other stands either. Overall good buy</li>
            <li> Nice Rack! Does what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve had it for over a year and it shows no sign of corrosion. Just ducky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Evernice for a month or so now and think it will probably last a long time. I&#x27;ll keep my eye on the rust others have mentioned and update this review if it shows up, but for now, this product seems perfect for my use. The base is adequately heavy to be stable with only one side loaded. I like the fact that the top is etched because if you need to pick it up with wet, soapy fingers, it won&#x27;t slip. Just wipe it down when you&#x27;re done with it and it seems like it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is good stand at a good price point. I did not want a clone of this design because I did not want to deal with quality control of the knock offs. It appears to be a good decision. The chrome is very good and the stand has the feel and look of quality. It was made in Taiwan and the quality control seems to be there. I was looking at stands that cost two to three times as much as this one and I am still glad I bought this one. If getting the most from your dollar spent is your goal then this may be the one you. (the other more expensive stands) just seem wrong to spend more on the stand than the razor.</li>
            <li> What can I say, this product holds your safety razor and the shaving brush.  It does a good of that.  It also cleans well and looks zazzy in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This stand does exactly what it should, holds my shaving brush and safety razor. It looks really nice in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> This looks great, has a nice weight to it and is WAY cheaper than any of the other comparable stands.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to hang my razor and shave brush on. It looks good on our bathroom countertop and is sturdy.</li>
            <li> slight yellowing to the chrome, but its a nice stand for my Merkur 33c and boar brush.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret this buy, it&#x27;s sturdy, shiny, and feels substantial. If you buying a Merkur, this is it&#x27;s soul mate.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this stand it helps dry your brush and razor and prevent the razor from rusting.</li>
            <li> Allows your brush to air dry upside down for thorough drying. And keeps the razor blades from getting damaged. If you have the room on your sink, get one.</li>
            <li> Works just fine and looks nice. The only caveat I had was the rubber base was a bit rounded at the bottom and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure how stable this thing was gonna be, but after some time in use the bottom settled and now it sits flat.</li>
            <li> got this for the boyfriend who is this ourdoorsy type. He seemed to love it, i only gave it to him yesterday but he liked the idea of it.</li>
