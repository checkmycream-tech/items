            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>I have experienced difficulty using Cushion Grip adhesive...</li>
            <li>Cushion grip is great</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Apparently it is very popular.</li>
            <li>If you are patient and take the time to prepare and apply this product properly, it&#x27;s very effective for relining a denture.</li>
            <li>I found this product the best of the many that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Amazon had the best price - get it in the 4 pack and PRIME - of course FREE SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li>, you had the better price, and was even cheaper than what she was paying at the wal-mart store, she is very happy knowing she can still get this item</li>
            <li>I am going to stock up on Cushion Grip to make sure I am never without it because it is the greatest thing made for denture wearers.  </li>
            <li>and though it doesn&#x27;t have a great taste it keeps my gums and bones in good shape.</li>
            <li>this is the best thing i have found for my dentures it is by far the best thing i have found for my problem dentures</li>
            <li>The given instructions are good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is this product is superior to pastes and goo.</li>
            <li>THE POWDER DON&#x27;T COME OFF REALLY GOOD.  </li>
            <li>I have dentures that fit wonderfully well</li>
            <li>it is a really good deal.</li>
            <li>The concept sounded so good and so reassuring.</li>
            <li>The product is good quality.</li>
            <li>Good to go for 4-8 days.</li>
            <li>Not as good of an adhesive as I was led to believe but when combined with poly grip or fixodent</li>
            <li>Then, pop in your dentures with a bit of Poligrip and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this before good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m then good for the day,</li>
            <li>I needed a good product that lines my dentures and keeps them in place and this does that.</li>
            <li>WHAT GOOD IS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it works, and is a good product but,&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has been using this any length of time knows they are&lt;br /&gt;Beening</li>
            <li>Cushion Grip is without a doubt the best product available ( I&#x27;ve tried lots of them )</li>
            <li>After a good amount of weight loss I looked around and bought this for him.</li>
            <li>well, good price.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>yes it is good.</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m trying to find something that works as good with no luck</li>
            <li>/&gt;The texture of the adhesive felt good.</li>
            <li>Cushion grip works good for me, it takes some practice putting it on though.  </li>
            <li>Great product - I&#x27;ve always liked it.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product and it is one of a kind.  </li>
            <li>Good product ripoff on price  </li>
            <li>He loved it and it worked well for him.  </li>
            <li>For me, not so good.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased using the product.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Mom is so happy we were able to find it on the Internet.</li>

            <li>very satisfied with price, product and follow up and would never hesitate in ordering another product.</li>
            <li>After reading some of the most helpful reviews of folks that use this product,and offered great tips,I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>They would develop a profitable business and make so many people happy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A  great product which i hve used for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have dentures and this product is excellent for making them fit better , i would recommend this product for any one who  has dentures .</li>
            <li>It took a couple of tries for me to get the perfect amount for the best hold.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I hesitated at first to try this out because I had never heard of it, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give it a try - and I&#x27;m telling you - the best decision I have made since I decided to go with dentures.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>I understand why many people think it&#x27;s a hassle to use, my advice is don&#x27;t follow the instructions in the box!  </li>
            <li>I ordered four tubes and will be ordering more!</li>
            <li>stuff is great, but becoming too costly for my income.</li>
            <li>love this product will buy it on line always!</li>
            <li>So glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>

            <li>Best by far!!!!</li>
            <li>But it DOES pad any gaps between your gums and the denture form and makes wearing dentures a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>But it DOES pad any gaps between your gums and the denture form and makes wearing dentures a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>but this makes it easy so everyone is happy</li>
            <li>It is a thermoplastic that molds easily into you dentures and molds to the contours of your gums creating a great cushion and suction grip.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; works great to add a lining to my denture.</li>
            <li>the hold is amazing</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>Glad to have access to a good item</li>
            <li>Would be nice if this stuff was still being made.  </li>
            <li>I do have a sesitive mouth but the warm feeling lasts all of 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no nasty taste, thats a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Warm your tube.</li>
            <li>And to the person who posted this awesome solution thank you so much...</li>
            <li>Yes, warm it up to make it easier to work with, but</li>
            <li>Nice price -- As advertised – Prompt shipment –  Recommended</li>
            <li>Not as effective as Fixodent.</li>
            <li>I followed Echoscream&#x27;s instructions and I&#x27;m very happy with the results (thanks Echoscream).  </li>
            <li>They say this has the best hold and really keeps food out.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely thrilled to receive my Cushion Grip.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t eat that stuff with my own teeth.</li>
            <li>I did have good luck using the Cushion Grip on the bottom dentures, by applying more of the  product</li>
            <li>Using this for years -- absolutely the best dental product.</li>
            <li>It is okay, not as good as I thought it should be for that price</li>
            <li>(soak in warm water if needed to soften it for removal).  </li>
            <li>he&#x27;s thrilled.  </li>
            <li>and of course I kind of messed them up.  </li>
            <li>I WISH I would have found this stuff before I did all my own adjustments...</li>
            <li>and......if you are contemplating doing you own adjustments get it shipped overnight before you take a dremmell to your plate...........</li>
            <li>This product worked nicely.</li>
            <li>Best product I have found for its purpose / product lasts much longer than the box states - 4 days</li>
            <li>BUT LIKE MOST GOOD PRODUCTS THEY QUIT CARRYING IT</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>I cannot afford a new pair of dentures, so this product is wonderful to use.  </li>
            <li>He is SO happy he tried CUSHION GRIP and will be a forever user, this coming from someone who believes &amp;#34;It&#x27;s too good to be true!&amp;#34;, this stuff really is.  </li>
            <li>You can shape it and work with it very easily.</li>
            <li>The seller was very promt in sending it and it arrived in very good conditon, so that is why I have rated the seller with 5 stars</li>
            <li>It stays soft and conforms perfectly to your gums.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the greatest by far.</li>
            <li>All-in-all my dentures now fit and feel really good.</li>
            <li>It is even more effective then cushion grip or anything else I have found.</li>
            <li>By far the best denture product on the market</li>
            <li>My dentures fit so good now.  </li>
            <li>It gives you temporary, soft relines, at best.</li>
            <li>Made my 80 year old Mother so happy!</li>
            <li>Just being comfortable for the first time in a week is priceless.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for many years and with my new dentures it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>As a liner to fit it cannot be beat and once set ( a day or so) and clean with a good adhesive , you are good to mouth at will.  </li>
            <li>love love love!</li>
            <li>He was thrilled to find it and will recommend it to many more patients.</li>
            <li>This is great for people with dentures that do not fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>I believe the most important part of the denture for holding turns out to be along the gum line, and it does a good job there.</li>
            <li>on top of it to make a very strong seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping is very fast, Great stuff to reline your teeth with, I can&#x27;t eat with out it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>: \\&quot;What exactly are they doing that I am not doing myself and why, supposedly, works so great for others but not for us?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It gives a very secure feeling.</li>
            <li>It makes dentures very comfortable for 5-6 days without changing.</li>
            <li>It works well and is very comfortable to use..</li>
            <li>was very important</li>
            <li>any of them--so each is one of a kind custom made----and is unbelievably easy to use</li>
            <li>I would be more than glad to send what remains of this product to one of the happy customers that prompted me to purchase it in the first place.</li>
            <li>nothing better</li>
            <li>It aslo has no after taste and is firmer than most products of this type which prevents that squishy oozing.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately many of the chain drug stores stopped carrying this</li>
            <li>I have had dentures for MANY years.</li>
            <li>My dentist warned me that there is more of a problem keeping the lowers in.</li>
            <li>but I have had it hold up 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am perfectly satisfied   except for my latest order and it looked like it had expired on June 2009-however am using and seems to be ok</li>
            <li>This product is not a miracle cure, that is for sure.</li>
            <li>Now I love to find a \\&quot;die hard\\&quot; of this product and give them the 3 plus tubes.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li>However I haven&#x27;t used it on my top plate, just the lower.</li>
            <li>I use it for the cushion effect, not for gripping.</li>
            <li>Myself, I&#x27;m well pleased with the product for my use.</li>
            <li>WE love it.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that I am able to order bulk quanity @</li>
            <li>It holds better than anything I have ever tried.    </li>
            <li>Takes practice to use it but seems ok.</li>
            <li>There was a time, many moons ago, when I was often selfconscious about my dentures.</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s the next best thing to having my dentures relined.</li>
            <li>See more below.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE CUSHION GRIP.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years..  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind that I&#x27;ve been comfortable with.</li>
            <li>I Love Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li>She said in that case, she is going to order about 12 more tubes just for her store.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t \\&quot;overheat\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have found that using a blow dryer when the Cushion Grip is \\&quot;setting up\\&quot; helps the Cushion Grip adhere to the dentures better.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to by it in our drug store but have not been able to find it for awhile till now.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product, which allows user to eat all foods.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>i love this product.....</li>
            <li>Just wish I had bought more when I had the chance.</li>
            <li>I am however pleased I can still purchase it through you at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Only the greatest pain to remove off of the denture.</li>
            <li>The price was over $2.50 a tube more than Amazon.  </li>
            <li>As for the product he is satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>On his top denture it has lasted almost 2 months, on the bottom a week.</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>This can fill in the gaps that the dentist couldn&#x27;t even fix and it holds for 4 or more days before needing to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I love Cushion Grip Thermoplastic...</li>
            <li>No nasty lingering taste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure will take more than one tube.</li>
            <li>I followed one of the most well written reviews on this product, and did just as she wrote.</li>
            <li>It took me 20 minutes or better just for one denture.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did not give up on Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li>Overall - a great product!  </li>
            <li>I decided that for cosmetic reasons and to see if I could return to eating some of my favorite foods again I decided to try Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li>i will defiantly order more thsnks alot</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work that well, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything better</li>
            <li>Also, when the Cushion Grip seeps over the top edges of your denture, do not trim it away.</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for many years&lt;</li>
            <li>It is the perfect alternative to the more traditional brands like Poligrip and Fixodent.</li>
            <li>But as most of you know it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I love how this product works.</li>
            <li>When this supply runs out I will order more.</li>
            <li>Works well to hold improper fitting dentures.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I think this works great as a temporary fix until you can get to your dentist for a real adjustment.  </li>
            <li>in mind this product is not an adhesive, it&#x27;s purpose is to tighten the denture so the adhesive works better.  </li>
            <li>When the denture starts to be able to slip (for me about 45-60 minutes after putting them in)</li>
            <li>I prefer replacing it every day or two rather than spend and hour or more trying to peel it off.</li>
            <li>I realize we will be told to get to the dentist and get better fitting teeth, but that doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>Although it is supposed to be a denture adhesive that lasts four days, for me it is a reliner that lasts more than a week or two.  </li>
            <li>I still use a denture adhesive with it, but it fits so much better than it ever did before.    </li>
            <li>Then I remove the denture and trim off any excess that might bleed up over the top ridge of the denture.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li>I make sure I always keep some on hand.</li>
            <li>I found this to be the best longest lasting adhesive of any I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it  </li>
            <li>Will be definabely ordering some more  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this stuff.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it on my bottom dentures yet,</li>
            <li>Bought it many times over the years</li>
            <li>I find that four hours would be more acturate..  </li>
            <li>felt good on my gums to have fresh Cushion Grip on my dentures.</li>
            <li>Will get more, if not this brand, or others</li>
            <li>but now she uses Cushion Grip and it makes it much better for her , plus she chews a pack of gum almost every day.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect denture adhesive, look no further.  </li>
            <li>It works better than my expectations.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my parents, they can&#x27;t seem to find this anymore, but I was able to find it here.  </li>
            <li>have been using cushion grip for many years.</li>
            <li>A OK can,t beat this item</li>
            <li>Eating is much better than with just adhesive.</li>
            <li>and I love the way the product works.</li>
            <li>It works better than all the name brand products on the store shelves..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok ,,,,,,</li>
            <li>Order this thinking it would help keep my lower dentures in place better.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the product in the stores it is better by a factor of 10 magnitude.</li>
            <li>Better than the off the shelf brands.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to eat with them.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the timing they suggest, but also make sure you moisten the finger you use to press the Cushion Grip in place</li>
            <li>By using more Cushion Grip</li>
            <li>I was able to make the bottom dentures level.  </li>
            <li>then I had been able to do before.  </li>
            <li>I get blisters from the dentures since I have allergies to the material they are made of, with cushion grip after three years of not being able to wear my teeth</li>
            <li>and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as I&#x27;m sure you can tell the process of applying it can be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better than any of the creams and strips.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this stuff, I can have perfectly fitting teeth all the time.</li>
            <li>haventbeen able to find anything else</li>
            <li>America is now all about money, and more money.</li>
            <li>I love it but its discontinued.</li>
            <li>It is better that Fixident.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I am confident that my denture will stay in place when I have this applied.</li>
            <li>Much better than using an adhesive, no sticky residue to have to try to wash off every night.</li>
            <li>more can I say to use up the 15 words</li>
            <li>I have found nothing that works better.</li>
            <li>I can bite with it which I had not been able to do before.</li>
            <li>*!, you signed the paper after the wax denture fitting</li>
            <li>the pain in my gums was outstanding</li>
            <li>No nasty taste like most products, and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>Love this product, used it for years.</li>
            <li>Love it .....</li>
            <li>Need more</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied, just wish the company would continue making the product.</li>
            <li>I am sure there will be additional benefits.  </li>
            <li>I still work so being able to return to work confidently</li>
            <li>I will keep buying it at Amazon for sure.</li>
            <li>Apply more goo until it is all the way around.</li>
            <li>Apply to top denture.</li>
            <li>I can feel confident for many weeks using Cushion Grip with comfort and security.</li>
            <li>Have used it for many years and will continue.  </li>
            <li>she is able to obtain it</li>
            <li>but my top plate is NOT  going anywhere</li>
            <li>Simply the best product out there!&lt;br /&gt;Supply &amp; demand is one thing.</li>
            <li>sure hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I hope I will always be able to find it.</li>
            <li>I love cushion Grip</li>
            <li>sure you change 1st a week.</li>
            <li>so glad I found this product</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years I love it.</li>
            <li>Cushion Gip worked okay</li>
            <li>Been using it for years &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my mom, she can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li>It cushions when I bite, it fits fine, and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>People live longer nowadays----I am almost 83----basically healthy and intelligent, so don&#x27;t we deserve  a better quality of life ???????</li>
            <li>The next day the tops felt wonderful but the bottoms hurt so I easily removed the Cushion Grip and re-applied it.  </li>
            <li>Putting the denture in your mouth quickly before it cools,is imperative,or you will not get a good fit.</li>
            <li>and I just fell in love with it, and had to have one, very easy clean up, and so handy&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I am actually pretty good at that.</li>
            <li>My first try was not so good but lasted 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I always find it on Amazon for a pretty good deal.  </li>
            <li>The best adhesive I ever used for loose fitting dentures .  </li>
            <li>its the best product on the market for loose fitting dentures.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for any loose fitting denture or plate.</li>

            <li>You&#x27;ll still probably have to use a denture bonding agent because Denture Cream works by improving fit for better suction and comfort, Some say it works</li>
            <li>It makes my dentures fit better.</li>
            <li>Cushion Grip has been a lifesaver for me in that I am able to actually enjoy a meal without pain and a flopping denture.  </li>

            <li>hope this helps,as I said I tried it,thought it would really make a difference after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li>The dentures fit perfectly, were comfortable, and actually had to be  removed with difficulty.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good way to temporarily keep a badly fitting denture going until you can make the time to have a new one made or to have them relined.</li>

            <li>, strong hold...</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Craig Smalley, a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>this product did provide a cushion for me but didn&#x27;t provide any kind of adhesive and when I tried to take it off of my dentures the first night wearing cushion grip it took two of us 45 minutes to get it off of my dentures.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean off and if it would give me some kind of seal then I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, and a great find since it is so hard to locate in local stores.</li>
            <li>For some reason I cannot find this product in the area where I live and was delighted to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>works just fine for me</li>
            <li>But I grinned and beared it (pardon the pun) and all was fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and secure to gums.</li>
            <li>It does feel good at first but slides right off.</li>
            <li>It takes a little getting use to but the results are excellent.  </li>
            <li>Very good experience arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li>This unique thermoplastic formula is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I do realize that in the new world of dentures and denture users there if a fair amount of people out there with their own particular views.</li>
            <li>It is not meant to be a denture adhesive, it is more like doing your own soft reline.  </li>
            <li>but fortunately, I discovered they&#x27;re still available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I will let you have 3 unopened tubes for free.</li>
            <li>I have to say that this product has been the determining factor in achieving a measure of success in being able to wear the temporary dentures.</li>
            <li>Keeps the teeth in and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for having it available to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it isn&#x27;t an adhesive, per se, but it does help keep dentures in place by improving the precision of fit, and therefore, both suction and comfort.</li>
            <li>The more you know where and how much Cushion Grip to use on your denture&#x27;s, the better the fit and trouble-free chewing.</li>
            <li>Then cut the wax paper to fit inside your denture.</li>
            <li>but I had to inform them that it is no longer available since it&#x27;s not being made anymore.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great product BUT- only after some trial and error to see what fits your needs.  </li>
            <li>This product is fairly comfortable as a temporary liner for your dentures.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has a problem with dentures that don&#x27;t quite fit, try this.  </li>
            <li>I use it to fit bridges and so forth.  </li>
            <li>Sticks great to dentures but no help with keeping the low dentures any tighter in place.  </li>
            <li>Dentures fit to be&lt;</li>
            <li>This made the bottom dentures secure and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>then what I had before, but I am using the Cushion Grip on them to make them &#x27;snug&#x27; and comfortable, while I am learning to eat with them.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and is so nice when your mouth is sore.</li>
            <li>It is like a temporary reline and make the dentures fit my mouth again.</li>
            <li>Happy with the product but not the quantity only ordered 4 and was billed for 8</li>
            <li>They made her dentures fit so she can enjoy eating again.</li>
            <li>When you need to get dentures DO YOUR RESEARCH on who you may pick to make them and before the dentures are made (before you give them any $$$ or sign any paper) find out what the maker will do if the dentures don&#x27;t properly fit and get it in writing.</li>
            <li>Not from after procedure pain, but from trying to get comfortable with the immediate denture.  </li>
            <li>Thank Goodness for this product and may it always be available for me.</li>
            <li>If you want your dentures to fit without the goo feeling</li>
            <li>at night I soak them in cleaner, and love the next day when I pop them in and I&#x27;m good for another day!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take out the dentures, wash em good, and blow dry or towel dry real good.</li>
            <li>Keep stocking it, Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Very worth it.</li>
            <li>It is a great value because it last a long time and works great for me and my husband.</li>
            <li>I love the product and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>He uses his dentures all the time, he&#x27;s super happy with this adhesive and as a result he has gained back quite some weight.</li>
            <li>After they sat on a dry towel all night, they fit great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not on sale in this country ,my wife will only use this good product ,easy to apply ,.</li>
            <li>It takes a small amount to keep his dentures in place and works wonderfully well to prevent sore gums.</li>
            <li>When I had my original teeth removed the dentist had to grind a lot of my lower jaw bone</li>
            <li>A Stage-1 diabetic friend told me about the unique properties of Agave nectar and I will never buy another bag of sugar.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to make this purchase.</li>
            <li>Good for loose fitting dentures</li>
            <li>I guess most adults nowadays have their own teeth due to flouride in water systems and better dental care.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if that is the product or what I clean them with (soap &amp; water, once a week I soak in a denture tablet to remove stains.)</li>
            <li>And you will have no problem taking your teeth out to clean.</li>
            <li>Makes applying the product to your dentures much easier, and I seem to get a much better fit to my gums this way as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have all day to clean my dentures.</li>
            <li>Cushion Grip is NOT an adhesive, it&#x27;s more like a &#x27;&#x27;soft relign&#x27;&#x27;, so you can use your favorite adhesive over it if you need to..</li>
            <li>I soak my dentures in denture cleaner with the Cushion Grip on my dentures &amp; brush them clean with no problems.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if your dentures are  loose in any areas.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for years now and it is hands down the absolute best denture adhesive available.  </li>
            <li>For those of you with dentures that never seem to fit right or have gums that are never stay happy long, this stuff helps a LOT.</li>
            <li>From the \\&quot;die hard\\&quot; reviews pertaining this Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4) I truly believe this was going to be something exceptionally special</li>
            <li>Special Pack of 5</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful product hard to find .</li>
            <li>It once again reminds me that amazon does their customer a great service by haveing the reviews to help when buying an unknown product.  </li>
            <li>Great product but not really a paste.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem for most users or if it&#x27;s a rare occurrence, but for the first fifteen minutes or so the adhesive burned my gums and palate.</li>
            <li>stuff is really good, but only if used correctly.</li>
            <li>It takes some patience and paying attention but it really does work better than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I have ordered more.  </li>
            <li>Everyone who has a full denture knows that the gums and bones change over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be absolutely LOST without it &amp; wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear my dentures.</li>
            <li>So I really appreciate that I was able to find it online.</li>
            <li>so when I went to a full denture I tried it</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can just pop my dentures in and be ready to go.</li>
            <li>and I have to import it from USA because it is no longer available in Australia , but it is well worth it and the service from Amazon and MY US</li>
            <li>My mother had full uppers and lowers, never used adhesive and could eat corn on the cob, steak, peanuts, etc.</li>
            <li>I did that 24 hours after full mouth surgery, You can to..</li>
            <li>I have full dentures</li>
            <li>Enough said... just buy and use this if you have dentures... comfortable and it works better than most anything else.</li>
            <li>But getting the right amount in the denture to create a snug fit is hit &amp; miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use if directions are followed, and use HOT water.</li>
            <li>I love the product and would recommend it to every one, its clean helps in preventing damage or injury to gums serves as a smooth soft cushion between gums and denture plates</li>
            <li>Only neg is that it requires much more time and attention to using, but my feinds who use all the other more convenient adhesive products are always complaining because they don&#x27;t work, whereas this 100% DOES!!!</li>
            <li>If you have dentures and just need a little cushion here and there, or, if your dentures need more help than that, this is almost as good as a reline.  </li>
            <li>Using a mild toothpaste (with no pumice of course).Furthermore, I have no difficulty eating any foods that I choose, I.E. Steak, corn on the cob, sunflower seeds, beef jerky</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, thanks,Carol</li>
            <li>It is a quick fix.</li>
            <li>My order was quickly accepted and shipped</li>
            <li>It improves comfort and grip tremendously.</li>
            <li>You always send it quickly and it arrives with out damage and in the time stated.</li>
            <li>Takes a few minutes to warm before applying, but is effective.</li>
            <li>*Just a quick note:  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of heat generated by the product but it quickly passes.</li>
            <li>delivery was quick and on time.  </li>
            <li>Basically the best way to do it is to set the tube in a sink, run hot water over it for about 4 mins, dry it off and make sure your fingers are very dry, then smooth it around in dentures and place in mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually very effective and very durable (seems to last 3-4 days).</li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING product and is worth writing a review about for anyone needing help with denture adhesive, especially for the lower plate that doesn&#x27;t quite fit so well.</li>
            <li>Two weeks ago, I received my very first set of temporary dentures.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my lower plate for several years and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>though Rigident was made in Italy, can&#x27;t some resourceful investors and designers get the recipe that the company used, then reproduce the original ingredients and put it back on the market.  </li>
            <li>I estimate maybe 20-30 minutes of VERY hot water from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Improved the fit of my first set of dentures after the extractions.</li>
            <li>Use your finger to smear this funny stuff around and make it smooth as you can.</li>
            <li>At first, it felt really comfortable and snug.  </li>
            <li>The new bottom dentures are so much better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe it as more of a cushion than an adhesive, but since I&#x27;m new to the topic</li>
            <li>When I finally got the prep right and with a bit of adhesive, my dentures are now more comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li>My order was delivered very quickly and it is so much easier that searching from store to store (not all stores carry this product).</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I am learning to eat more things than I ever could with my natural teeth!</li>
            <li>For the first time in many months I can actually eat pain free!  </li>
            <li>Cushion Grip is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with their dentures staying tight and food getting under them.  </li>
            <li>After many years, I have finally found an excellent product that doesn&#x27;t ooze, is very easy to apply, and finally my lower denture is firmly in place.  </li>
            <li>new dentures fit very well, with no problem at all with the top denture.  </li>
            <li>This is great for loose dentures, and dentures that really hurt the lower gums.</li>
            <li>On the first try it was immediately comfortable 6 days post op, and still very much in the healing phase.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to have my teeth relines very often, and it keeps my teeth comfortable.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this available for my use.</li>
            <li>And I rarely have a reason to inform them of this fact.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>While this product does form a nice cushion for your gums, it does not actually seal the denture to your gums.</li>
            <li>your golden, put it where you need it, set dentures in, and wait like 1-2 minutes.    </li>
            <li>I am so glad you have it and shipped fast thanks</li>
            <li>it took a couple of trials before I learned how to apply the get for best comfort, but it sure beats the powder and gooey mess I have had with other products.</li>
            <li>It will bew WELL worth your time.</li>
            <li>**SMILE</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d have to rate the 1st application of Cushion Grip a success.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind I use,  I would recommend it to everybody, Never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li>Sill didn&#x27;t hold them in place for my 92 year old grand father.</li>
            <li>this is effectively an &#x27;mini-adjustment&#x27; until your next dental appointment.  </li>
            <li>Also, many seniors are living far under the poverty level, AS I AM ,and just keep trying to &#x27;make-do&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>After numerous trips to the dentist to get the denture to fit and stay in with ample denture adhesive, I was able to do it for myself when I discovered Cushion Grip.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on my 7th day without a fresh batch.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot to get your needs met and it definitely makes your dentures feel much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I found this product on line and decided it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I kept most of my natural teeth until this year.</li>
            <li>It allows for a better fit which helps his teeth stay put for a solid day +</li>
            <li>I accidentially found Cushion Grip on Amazon somehow and looked at some Youtube videos and decided it was worth a try for $20.00....</li>
            <li>but I love the soft cushion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy like most denture creams &amp; doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied for 4 days.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product on the market for false teeth...</li>
            <li>Grossly overpriced due to shortage as, I understand, production of this excellent product has stopped.</li>
            <li>The chances are good, that I have experienced the same obstacles, and subsequently surmounted them.</li>
            <li>I was able to eat fried chicken for the first time since losing my teeth and it tasted wonderful.</li>
            <li>A sharp knife is also good</li>
            <li>I use this on my bottom plate and it works really good, I recommed it to my other friends for thir denture&#x27;s it hold them in place.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have that much of lower gum to fit into dentures very much.</li>
            <li>Going back to conventional fixodent type product and hope for the best.</li>
            <li>, I read the instructions and went thru the motions so I could do it right and not have to remove the product, etc.</li>
            <li>It just peals right out.</li>
            <li>As one tube basically will be your test tube for getting the right amount.</li>
            <li>stuff takes some practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>yea right, their dreaming</li>
            <li>It took me about 2 weeks to get it right, and</li>
            <li>, Thank you for selling it and at the right price, daughter of Mildred Harp, Terrie Ross</li>
            <li>Dentures come right out.  </li>
            <li>It just peels right off in one piece.  </li>
            <li>an then moved to AZ, and they have never fight right.</li>
            <li>It goes right away.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to get it right</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Although I am busy running my own entirely unrelated business, and do not spend much time on line, I will be happy to offer any help that I can to personal messages.</li>
            <li>The only functional problem was that Cushion Grip added on top of the reliner material made my mouth feel so full</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll eventually get it down to a science and will be able to chew at about 90% efficiency or better.</li>
            <li>no trouble to clean out one tube lasts longer than a case of that gooy stuff!</li>
            <li>Great product with good hold; however, the tube contents only allows for approximately 4 applications which could be costly if you reapply every 4 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to rate my first attempt as a success.</li>
            <li>It can help you maintain a good fit for even lousy fitting dentures for days at a time.  </li>
            <li>I have chosen to recieve e-mails from this site with individual comments, so feel free to let me know about any problems you might have concerning this fine product.</li>
            <li>Since my dentures don&#x27;t fit and I can&#x27;t afford new ones, I had no choice but to buy it.</li>
            <li>I have new dentures and cushion grip has made it easier for me to eat, and to feel comfortable wearing them</li>
            <li>sure your denture is perfectly clean and absolutely DRY.</li>
            <li>I lost my dental insurance before I was able to get the correct dentures, but this works VERY well to cushion my old set</li>
            <li>Clean and dry the top</li>
            <li>,ALSO,IT CAME SUPER FAST IN THE MAIL.THANKS ,I WOULD SHOP HERE AGAIN.</li>
            <li>We were able to buy it for a few dollars per tube but now we pay 20 dollars or more per tube.</li>
            <li>but still the same, an awesome product to use for dentures, at least full sets.</li>
            <li>Very much appreciate the speedy delivery &amp; quality of product</li>
            <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>, I hope they bring this back holds dentures very securely.</li>
            <li>Myself, I bought this item to help my mother and her new dentures so they could fit better, therefore allowing her the possibility of conquering the initial trials denture wearers must endure.</li>
            <li>so I would be able to wear them comfortably, get them to stay in place and allow me to eat something other</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that you had some of this left.  </li>
            <li>Excellant product does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed.  </li>
            <li>Hot water aids in removing it, then go again.</li>
            <li>,hot drinks won&#x27;t dissolve it, and leaves no taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I test the first on</li>
            <li>IS SOAK THE DENTURE IN HOT WATER IN A CUP FOR 10 MINUTES</li>
            <li>Thanks a million times over Amazon.com!    </li>
            <li>the Cushion Grip at first or</li>
            <li>This is the only thing I can use in my dentures,have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Of course, like most things that actually work, they quit making it.  </li>
            <li>When you first get it the diagram tells you how to use and lets you know there is no taste</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll gladly do it twice a week if I continue to get the same results!  </li>
            <li>FIRST  </li>
            <li>From day to day you can run your teeth under hot water and then move the wax around with the end of your toothbrush again...</li>
            <li>Just plan on your first tube as your training tube.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re considering this product for the first time - you will not regret it.  </li>
            <li>With the price of gas these days - EVERY PENNY COUNTS - and you will save even more since you actually don&#x27;t have to use any adhesive.  </li>
            <li>The only problem was that it was applied on top of my reliner, which  was also my first attempt at relining.</li>
            <li>I learned that I must get the tube hot as hell before squeezing out the goop and applying it.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I have not finished the first tube yet.</li>
            <li>The second try was better and lasted 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m doing this, I have the tube of adhesive sitting in a container of hot water - which will permit an easier extraction from the tube.</li>
            <li>hope this helps people who have had problems using this product or are going to try it for the first time.</li>
            <li>hope this helps people who have had problems using this product or are going to try it for the first time.</li>
            <li>To remove, soak in hot water.  </li>
            <li>If they could only make it easier to get out of the tube and use I&#x27;d give it more stars.</li>
            <li>Tricky to apply at first</li>
            <li>when you spread it out wet your finggr with warm water.</li>
            <li>and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a learning process and a big adjustment, but for me, it&#x27;s better than the toothaches and abcesses.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and couldn&#x27;t find it locally any more so when I found it here</li>
            <li>To reline the teeth in SZ coast more then the teeth did back in Maine.  </li>
            <li>Reline can last me up to two weeks or more.</li>
            <li>What I do is soak it in hot water</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Using &#x27;&#x27;Cushion Grip&#x27;&#x27; has helped the daily adjustments to my gums and any &#x27;&#x27;sore spots&#x27;&#x27; that come up, making it much more bearable when your gums are healing...</li>
            <li>/&gt;4.Now, put your top plate in your mouth without anything on it.&lt;br /&gt;5.Open the tube and watch as a big glob of this goo pops up.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found an online place to purchase it since my local store doesn&#x27;t stock it anymore.</li>
            <li>Now that my mouth is completely healed they don&#x27;t fit correctly.  </li>
            <li>Cushion Grip does exactly as I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li>I have used cushion for a few years and find out it works good for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had my teeth missing for about a week so my gums are still kind of tender, and the temporary dentures I have are less than perfect.      </li>
            <li>I was unable to tolerate the denture pastes and the cushion grip is easy and works great.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve found that I get much better adhesion when I first gently clean the inside surface of the denture (upper) with mild bleach, such as household Clorox dabbed on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth a try if you have loose fitting dentures.  </li>
            <li>One click to Amazon found her ole favorite, ordering was simple enough, delivery was fast and dentures are secure!</li>
            <li>We were honest, and caring to each other.</li>
            <li>The only real problem I have with this product, is not the product itself, but more trying to get the stuff out of the tube.</li>
            <li>It desn&#x27;t stick on my palate and holds the denture firmly and comfortably for more than 4 days.    </li>
            <li>there wasn&#x27;t much room left for the food that had to be chewed to be shifted around for better positioning during chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But if she&#x27;s able to chew her food and it reduces her chances of choking I&#x27;ll keep putting up with the major chore of replacing new Cushion Grip every four days......</li>
            <li>the fact we keep coming back for more tells you we never found a better product  for temporary fixing loose dentures.</li>
            <li>Also I have some issues with the way mine fit as they are my tempory plates so some of the things I would have gone back to the dentist was cleared up with the right adesive.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay any attention to what the positive reveiws are.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I will in the long run since my gums have shrunk &amp; the Ins Co pays most of a reline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Cushion Grip for quite a long time and many places do not carry it</li>
            <li>Because this adhesive sticks to your dentures really well, I heat the denture in hot water for maybe 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>Many people of my generation have dentures but thankfully, not young people.</li>
            <li>The instructions are really not complete, like most instructions.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write product reviews, but this product is so good that I just had to make an exception.  </li>
            <li>When I went to my dentist for an adjustment, she had never seen this, but she liked it because when you bite down on the Cushion Grip, it forms the &#x27;&#x27;impressions&#x27;&#x27; of your gums and is softer for healing gums..</li>
            <li>This is a process and you are learning a new normal just like someone who looses any part of thier body so be forgiving of what is lacking in the early days, move forward confidently and don&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li>- I press the tissue into the denture area where the adhesive is to be applied to make sure the area is perfectly dry.</li>
            <li>The product is tacky/sticky until it sits.&lt;br /&gt;But, left overnight, it hardens and is really easy to use and wear.</li>
            <li>The trick (I have learned) is to get a good impression, and then leave your dentures out in the air for as long as possible.</li>
            <li>But when I have a cup of coffee or anything warm or hot, is looses its adhesiveness and it does not readhere or firm up again.</li>
            <li>Certainly something I do not want to repeat for fear of ruining my dentures.</li>
            <li>And will be certain to order again if need to.</li>
            <li>So many people depend on this product to eat, talk, and live in relative comfort with dentures...</li>
            <li>if you have loose dentures I would advise you to buy cushion grip as it is a lot better than the adhesive you have to use every day.</li>
            <li>The top dentures were loose and he did a temporary reline which helped but still needed to be adjusted to eliminate sore spots.  </li>
            <li>I have used Cushion Grip for over twenty years and my older son has also!  </li>
            <li>They are so comfortable and a tight fit.  </li>
            <li>Removing is a little work, but results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I have applied this product to my dentures without heating the tube first, and also after heating and I highly recommend that you heat the tube.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty far from knowing very much.</li>
            <li>I think the cushion effect is probably more comfortable than hard plastic.</li>
            <li>Last night, with these in, I was able to rip into some tough meat and the dentures stayed in place really good.</li>
            <li>It makes it possible to improve the fit so much that I can forget that I am wearing the denture.</li>
            <li>but it does take some experimentation with how much Cushion Grip to use and how to place it on the crown.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Very disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really a temporary denture relining material.</li>
            <li>a very malleable rubber like substance.</li>
            <li>I do realize the documentation says that you shouldn&#x27;t use it on dentures that don&#x27;t fit properly -</li>
            <li>thanks for having my item at a reasonable price and affordable shipping costs.</li>
            <li>AND THEN IT WILL COME OFF FAST.</li>
            <li>It sticks very well to the dentures.  </li>
            <li>If you want something to really glue your dentures into place for 4 days, this isn&#x27;t the product.  </li>
            <li>But I have already gone through a whole tube and</li>
            <li>I had a free adjustment contract for 60 days only.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having in stock too.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>it is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>This will really help protect the area.  </li>
            <li>I always use too much and have a curved pair of manicure sissors that I keep just for trimming the excess.    </li>
            <li>It does not take much to keep your dentures in place all day.</li>
            <li>Thanks A Million.</li>
            <li>how much adhesive I use.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work for me as an adhesive, but it&#x27;s worked absolute wonders as a temporary reline.  </li>
            <li>MUCH  EASIER  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>I am actually pain free.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for those of you who suggested this product</li>
            <li>It keeps  my dentures comfortable for several days  with each application.</li>
            <li>If I had to grade Amazon on its ethical practices I would give it zero stars.</li>
            <li>may think after reading this review that \\&quot;maybe she put to much into the denture\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>It was just way to much issue for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secure fixative totally rocks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Almost like it was when I had real</li>
            <li>For some reason - maybe because of the disinfectant properties of bleach - the Cushion Grip pad stays on much longer before peeling away.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the product and the service.   </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the manufacturer!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo</li>
            <li>and you find you&#x27;re using adhesive way too much</li>
            <li>You are now ready to start wearing the denture with the adhesive installed.</li>
            <li>You are now ready to start wearing the denture with the adhesive installed.</li>
            <li>Amazon just makes my shopping so much easier, what can I say?</li>
            <li>really didnt like this product it didnt hold like i thought it would</li>
            <li>it is much improved over the others.  </li>
            <li>Its doing the job  thanks</li>
            <li>He thanks you and so do I.</li>
            <li>and I dont really know why.  </li>
            <li>This product is a real money saver.</li>
            <li>All I was really hoping for was to get the dentures to stay in place without having to use a lot of denture adhesive.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really need to let it sit</li>
            <li>This product is really misnamed.</li>
            <li>It is not an adhesive so much as it is a comfort.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 30 years, primarily for the &amp;#34;cushion aspect&amp;#34; and was dismayed when it disappeared from the shelves locally.</li>
            <li>There is no smell or taste once it dries and is ready to wear.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this product and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>Was very expensivethough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m retired, and implants are way too much.</li>
            <li>How much?</li>
            <li>Let them sit and really cure over night.</li>
            <li>My plate is much tighter than it was before.  </li>
            <li>, I believe it holds better on the denture when they are totally pink.  </li>
            <li>this product is appreciated by my friend.  </li>
            <li>How much will that be?!?&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>he swelled so much his teeth came out of his mouth while he was sleeping.</li>
            <li>I received this in a very timely manner and do appreciate it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon rescued us from a real problem.  </li>
            <li>Get to much when putting in and it runs out when I put dentures in.</li>
            <li>I wish I had found this product much sooner than I did.  </li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s not so much for the grip</li>
            <li>Really does not hold them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Maybe the manufacturer will see some of the reviews and reconsider their decision to stop producing this much needed and desired product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s a surprising negative.</li>
            <li>Right now, these things are in so good, it may be tough getting them out, but</li>
            <li>perfect easy to use no more feeling that melting stuff in my mouth from those other other glue products I can drink hot coffee&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Each time you remove the denture to clean it, dunk it in a cup of generic Listerine (don&#x27;t pay for the real stuff; use the cheap generic).</li>
            <li>Since I had to find a way to wear these dentures, until the new ones were completed, I got the Cushion Grip with the hope that I could use it to get the first set of dentures to stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if they sold it to other stores they would make a lot more money and us that really need it can buy it</li>
            <li>and if your mouth is sensitive it may feel a little warm at first.</li>
            <li>I first read the many reviews, good and bad, then went for it.</li>
            <li>It will feel like you have your original teeth  back.</li>
            <li>I took some advice from other reviewers and I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works better then any other Denture adhesive I have ever used and its use lasted longer.</li>
            <li>Remember every situation is unique,  and requires adapting things to your personal needs.  </li>
            <li>I saw this quite by accident and thought I&#x27;d give it a try as I&#x27;d tried many other things that did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>Get Secure, which actually works more or less.</li>
            <li>I would love to surprise her with a couple of tubes, and I have looked everywhere, but apparently this stuff is liquid gold since it is priced as such.  </li>
            <li>I take a facial tissue and with the aid of a clean rat-tail comb (the handle area)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a total failure, but when done correctly it&#x27;s a miracle and the next best thing to having your real teeth.</li>
            <li>Used to always get it at Wal-Marts-and kind of panicked when no   more to be found-till found it online.  </li>
            <li>(yes, I have a full set of upper and lower).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt soft when I first put my dentures in my mouth.</li>
            <li>But with Cushion Grip I cut down my adhesive use by 75% and have a much better hold.</li>
            <li>down with top denture and hold.</li>
            <li>I went on line to research a better cushion product meanly because as my gums shrink, I would need something that I could apply myself and not go back to the dentist and pay more for adjustments.</li>
            <li>It works wonders and is much better than using other stuff!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like going for new dentures</li>
            <li>Previously I had bought the strips instead of the fixodent, and that was more money tossed away.</li>
            <li>It was easy to buy and was shipped to me quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li>Wash hands, dry them and then roll the Cushion Grip into a pencil shape, then lightly press into \\&quot;groove\\&quot; of appliance.</li>
            <li>fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;PRO\\&quot; to the product is,if need be you can just pop your denture in quickly, and if you plan on NOT eating the denture will somewhat stay put.</li>
            <li>I only use Polygrip on my bottom dentures - this product holds the top dentures SOLID.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You have a short working window as the stuff starts to cure in the denture, so get everything set up for quick access before you start.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that I have found that will last more than one day.</li>
            <li>Decent adhesion.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Price is way to high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and the work that it does.</li>
            <li>I put them in and bite down for several seconds looking to be sure the bite is right.  </li>
            <li>But, in the meantime, I had to go to a local CVS pharm here in Harrisburg to get some more of the goo stuff and low and behold, right beside that was the last 4 tubes of Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li>but it does cushion and fill in the gaps between gums and plate and provides a little more suction.</li>
            <li>but I think it is over priced a lot more people would buy it if it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li>There are easy directions in the packaging, follow those, then read all the reviews,  and use the helpful hints from other users on a try basis to see what works for you.  </li>
            <li>would not last one day or one hour, its hard to take off but the most important part is it does not stick to your dentures</li>
            <li>I clean my dentures and rinsed them off and dry them with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>With this product I dont have to worry about scraping the roof of my mouth trying to get the adhesive off, since I really cant put creams near the gaping holes where my teeth used to be.</li>
            <li>Clean and dry your plate.</li>
            <li>Smear it into the perfectly dry and clean denture troughs and let it sit for five minutes to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; before putting the dentures in your mouth.</li>
            <li>the drying phase - this adhesive turns light pink in color.</li>
            <li>the drying phase - this adhesive turns light pink in color.</li>
            <li>So far, they have been a real pain to keep in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra effort to use this product.</li>
            <li>I will say that it is the only thing on the market worth using.</li>
            <li>Many have complained about using alot of the tube when they first get it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll extend the life of the pad for a few more days</li>
            <li>a few days at the most.</li>
            <li>Love it and last a long time</li>
            <li>Anyone know of anything that keeps lower dentures in place for more then a few hours??????</li>
            <li>your normal teeth.</li>
            <li>dentist was very patient and adjusted different spots on dentures about every week for the first 2 months.</li>
            <li>Unlike most dental adhesive products Cushion Grip isn&#x27;t messy and doesn&#x27;t cling to your gums which requires brushing to remove.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it feels good on the gums, but alas it doesn&#x27;t hold dentures in place since there&#x27;s no \\&quot;stick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>very surprisingly large, whole pizza&#x27;s and for pies its unbelievable, no bending over to spill anything and easy to remove</li>
            <li>Better then what we were using on our upper  dentures, it last for about 3 days and no mess MaryAnn P.</li>
            <li>shipped the complete order quickly via regular shipping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order my next shipment right now...</li>
            <li>It molds like putty and forms a snug, air-tight seal that will last from 4 days to an entire week, then pulls away clean when you are ready to re-apply.</li>
            <li>I will eventually get an implant and new crown but at a cost of $3.000 vs. a tube of Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li>It is a gum saver when you are in between new dentures.</li>
            <li>She received her new supply of Cushion Grip before she ran out.</li>
            <li>Oh by the way I have brand new dentures....</li>
            <li>The new price &#x3D;</li>
            <li>gums have shrunken, can&#x27;t get new set but</li>
            <li>I am new to dentures.  </li>
            <li>is that anything new?</li>
            <li>Be sure that your bite is natural or where u want it and press them in firmly.</li>
            <li>used it on both upper &amp; lower, what I found was my dentures did not sit secure, and I looked noticeably different with this in my dentures.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really really like about this is that you can take your dentures off and on without renewing the adhesive and without all that adhesive stuck to your gums...that part is a real plus.</li>
            <li>I use a few little drops of fixodent on the bottom to keep them in even with the Cushion Grip, but it is much more comfortable using this product, and the uppers I don&#x27;t have to glue at all when I use this.</li>
            <li>Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive is as good or better than getting soft liners put in your dentures by a Denturist and much less expensive.  </li>
            <li>I FINALLY GOT THE ORDER - ON THE FIRST RESPONSE</li>
            <li>When I run out, I&#x27;ll re-order more from you as I have in the past.</li>
            <li>I just added some small balls of it on top of what I already have applied and pressed them together so they would not separate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the only denture adhesive that works for her as she has lost most of her bone due to a illness plus</li>
            <li>The thickness of the reline makes the teeth sit higher and further ahead in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The heating of the denture is imperative, and keeping the denture hot enough to remove the product, I had to keep plunging my denture into a bowl of heated water I had put in microwave.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>There is definitely a learning curve so don&#x27;t get discouraged if the first couple of times are failures.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never left the cushion grip in more than 2 days, because the longer it&#x27;s in the more difficult it is to get out.  </li>
            <li>It does NOT wash out and need reapplied daily like many other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does NOT wash out and need reapplied daily like many other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was my first order from Amazon, but will not be my last!</li>
            <li>hold better then it says, if you use small amounts the build up.</li>
            <li>Not sure I can do it now either, but I am eating more things than I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still was not able to eat anything but semi-solid  foods, but that was better</li>
            <li>The first time I applied it I followed the instructions and only kept them in my mouth for about 10 minutes before I removed them to \\&quot;dry/set-up\\&quot; overnight.  </li>
            <li>I am only in the first day of use</li>
            <li>It is a soft substance that molds to your gums, firms up &amp; stays put !  </li>
            <li>I opened the first box, got prepared, went outside to sit in the shade by my pool and started this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I take mine out once or twice a day to rinse and brush, then rinse with tap hot water to reform the stuff when you put it back in.</li>
            <li>&quot; my difficulty she informed me the product will NOT work on dentures with soft liner and may damage my plate!  </li>
            <li>Once you bite down on it, it \\&quot;re molds\\&quot; to your gums and denture, performing the seal that your dentures should have formed if they fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a new &#x27;&#x27;denture&#x27;&#x27; wearer, however during the initial period after getting my upper denture, my dentist has done several &#x27;&#x27;soft religns&#x27;&#x27;.. which works great for the first day or two, however as my gums are healing &amp; shrinking daily, the soft relign doesn&#x27;t last long..</li>
            <li>May take a little practice to apply exact amount needed, but well worth the practice.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 92 years young but unwilling to have new dentures made.</li>
            <li>This is just like putting a new soft liner in your denture.</li>
            <li>and then its like a denture that has been relined to fit like new again except its not hard plastic that causes the mouth to get sore if too much pressure from biting into hard foods ( and no added bulk ),</li>
            <li>For one thing I hadn&#x27;t heated the goop sufficiently to make it more pliable and stickey, hadn&#x27;t applied enough in the right places, and probably hadn&#x27;t pre-cleaned and dried the dentures properly.</li>
            <li>I filled the gum line about half way up, all the way around.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it recently became necessary to have the rest of my lowers extracted and get a full lower.</li>
            <li>I needed it for the time between getting my first set and having the swelling go down and waiting for the dentist to line my teeth for the first time.  </li>
            <li>They fit so tight I have to pry them out at night.</li>
            <li>She says, she loves that it has little to no taste and that the hold is fantastic;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was decided that the dentures were not able to be adjusted to fit correctly and a new mold was taken to start the process of making a new set of dentures.  </li>
            <li>My lower denture, right from the start, was too loose.</li>
            <li>But, I have had a hard time finding it in stores &amp; I am so glad that Amazon is supplying it to the customer..</li>
            <li>Although this is listed as an \\&quot;adhesive\\&quot;, after using it for a few days I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accurate description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep the trimmed edges as smooth as possible so as not to irritate your gums with rough edges.</li>
            <li>Used it 4 times and the last time, got very embarrassed.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$.</li>
            <li>Cases of Zinc Poisoning have been surfacing with use of the old products.]</li>
            <li>The whole ceremony of heating up the tube, applying, following all instructions did not seem to pay in the end.</li>
            <li>She was nearly out of it before letting me know she needed me to order it.</li>
            <li>However, I have developed a method of using it that enables me to leave it (untouched) for weeks at a time if I choose to.</li>
            <li>Suffice it to say, I even sleep with them in, and brush them as I would my natural teeth.</li>
            <li>I sing out loud in the chior, and play one brass, and two woodwind instruments.</li>
            <li>Thank God I used an old pair of dentures to test it out on.</li>
            <li>but my teeth were already sensitive and started to become brittle.</li>
            <li>I would like to get the package I ordered  early  February.</li>
            <li>It is a deffinite must have for me.&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive gums a blessing, sort of a shock absorber.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the product being left in the mail box because we told them that we&#x27;re not home a lot</li>
            <li>This stuff might have a stronger pucker factor when you set it up, but the benifits far out weigh the inconvience.  </li>
            <li>My grandmother is 93 and lives on a fixed income.  </li>
            <li>My gums were too sore and I was on soft foods like mashed potatoes, ice cream, etc.</li>
            <li>I soon developed Stage-2 diabetes.</li>
            <li>Being a portrait artist I strive for as much perfection as possible.</li>
            <li>This will cure the plastic and the liner will last much longer.</li>
            <li>You basically reline teeth with a soft thermoplastic which allows you to eat anything and since the liner is soft the food that might get under plate does not hurt your gum.  </li>
            <li>This product is the only one on the market that really works well to custom-fit the denture to the mouth over time.</li>
            <li>So far it has not met my expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only things that has really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>No complaints so far.  </li>
            <li>Until it completely sets, some of it will ooze over the edges.</li>
            <li>As far as its performance, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s workable, although it will never be a &#x27;natural&#x27; bite.</li>
            <li>Remember that Cushion Grip will NOT stick to a soft reline.</li>
            <li>The instructions that come with the product are helpful but not fully complete.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to recommend a product unless I&#x27;m completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
            <li>Ok-first, let me say, I am a 63 year old man.</li>
            <li>as the name says CUSHION GRIP ,it really had multiple functions for myself , I use to have to remove my bottoms to let tender places heal</li>
            <li>You have to pick and use tweezers to remove all the old thermoplastic.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the beast out there.</li>
            <li>The product holds the crown in place enough for me to eat soft foods with that tooth and of course it looks better than a missing tooth space.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff - I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.sive would push on out of your denture to the back and be wasted.</li>
            <li>You can eat or laugh and not have to worry about your denture slipping.</li>
            <li>I have been ordering this for a few months and they were only  $20.00 to $25.00, now the price has more than doubled</li>
            <li>This is much better than Fixodent or Polygrip where it is a daily routine and messy.</li>
            <li>I was/am new to dentures and my first set did and do not fit very well as my gumes are shrinking every day.</li>
            <li>The mess that it makes on them is a nightmare to clean up.  </li>
            <li>but they left a lot of goo in my mouth and that is not easy to get out without touching your already sore gums.</li>
            <li>This product was only introduced by word of mouth , my mother told me how great it was ,I would describe like a very thin piece of rubber once applied</li>
            <li>all documentation says that - if they fit properly, you wouldn&#x27;t need this (or any other) denture adhesive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>It seems to be the only product that does the job in keeping my husband&#x27;s dentures secure without all the oozing that the other brands seem to cause.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t heat the dentures with hot water because they must be perfectly dry for thegoo to stick.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find in any of the local stores but is very easy to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>Now only way to live with dentures is to get a soft liner installed!  </li>
            <li>I had a full upper and partial lower.</li>
            <li>One full upper and one partial lower.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fairly complicated at first, but much better after 3 practices.</li>
            <li>got the tube as hot as possible without boiling it, and the stuff is still almost solid.</li>
            <li>I have a crown on a back tooth that kept coming out due to a cracked tooth root and much of the supporting tooth gone.  </li>
            <li>No nasty&lt;br /&gt;taste as with other products and if done right</li>
            <li>In view of the high price I could only rate this three stars,totally.</li>
            <li>No one should be allowed to charge such ridiculously high prices.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that people take advantage of the fact that is in so high demand and is no longer manufactured...where I come from</li>
            <li>It is hard to find locally &amp; whether you have the store special order it for you or not,  the store price is much higher.  </li>
            <li>remove the old adhesive in order to apply a new coat, I do the following.</li>
            <li>remove the old adhesive in order to apply a new coat, I do the following.</li>
            <li>Then I take a clean rat-tail comb - the tail area that you hold, and slowly press the balls of adhesive down into the denture crevice and smooth out the adhesive.</li>
            <li>My wife has had problems getting her dentures to stay comfortable and eating a steak usually causes pain</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time was very grateful to have gotten it on line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products but nothing lasts as long or is as comfortable as this product.</li>
            <li>5 min apply several drops where I want them on the top and spread them around, the same on the bottom and let them set for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have used cushion grip on a new upper denture for over a year.</li>
            <li>I went out and was eating, talking and finally not worried about my new \\&quot;teeth\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new wearer, and was looking for some relief for my sore upper gums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts for at least three days.</li>
            <li>Normally very pliable but this seemed to be old as it was pretty hard.</li>
            <li>For many years I just had a partial denture and was limited to what types of adhesives I could use, which in turn limited the grip between your gums and your denture.</li>
            <li>helps soften &amp; disolve this product - a major help when cleaning dentures AFTER the bulk of the rubbery cushion is removed.</li>
            <li>My current application has lasted three weeks so far!</li>
            <li>worked very well for loose dentures</li>
            <li>I did the adjustments myself due to not being able to leave work everyday to go to the dentist to fix &amp;#34;sore spots&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The product is great, to bad Sherring Plough  is discontinuing it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Cushion Grip to make my dentures comfortable for at least 25 years.  </li>
            <li>I can now clearly speak words and chew some solid foods (I am re-learning how to chew with dentures.)</li>
            <li>It was the complete opposite.  </li>
            <li>I forgot to mention that I had already applied a soft reline some time back, and this went over that OK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the delivery was fast as I expected.</li>
            <li>I am a 67 year old female, so I&#x27;m no rocket scientist - but I will share my secrets with you, for using this product.</li>
            <li>It was going to take several weeks to complete this process and that is when I purchased &amp;#34;Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use too much as it will seep out, harden and will need to be trimmed.</li>
            <li>There is no ooze, no slipping and nothing to interfere with the taste of your food.</li>
            <li>-probably is good   anyway for at least 6 months past expiration date.</li>
            <li>Smear some goo thinly in both denture troughs and maybe some at the top of the uppers.</li>
            <li>this is the most worse product for dentures</li>
            <li>the thin layer keeps the dentures material from touching my gums.</li>
            <li>Now, here&#x27;s where the directions kind of fail to</li>
            <li>The instructions are a little intimidating as there is a process involved in getting the application of Cushion Grip right, but if you follow the instructions - warm the tube beforehand, you will have no problems - it takes a little time learning the right and wrong way to apply but...</li>
            <li>Slight burning sensation when first applied and used.</li>
            <li>A really simple and straightforward task requiring no more than five minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to remove, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>The product lasts for days, and even after it starts to lose it&#x27;s grip, I just add a very small amount of denture adhesive to compliment the fit.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know the proper way to bite so that the uppers were snug against the front of my gums, resulting in too much relining material atthe front and my upper lip protruding slightly too far, causing the front of my upper lip to protrude slightly too much from what I remember as my normal appearance.</li>
            <li>The Cushion Grip made it possible for me to continue to wear the ill fitting dentures until the new dentures arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I was not happy and tried to take it right back out of my plate.</li>
            <li>I have been using the soft reliner stuff, but that takes so much adjusting because it oozes everywhere</li>
            <li>The instructions recommend placing the tube in hot water to heat it, which does help melt the product and makes it a little easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next time I intend to use a hair dryer set on medium-hot, not super hot or you run the risk of damaging the acrylic and ruin your denture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>then I just a small amount (1/4 inch (more if my denture are really loose)) and roll it out to a strip and press it into the DRY denture.  </li>
            <li>we c an no long buy it...</li>
            <li>heated the tube by immersing in a sink of really hot water for a few minutes, then removed the cap and used it immediately.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all about others perception of any thing, some advice you can use, others, some are simply not in the game, it&#x27;s a wonderful product, but, the wonder of it all is your persistence to hang in there and learn, or you will fail...</li>
            <li>Trim the excess and then add a new blob of Cushion Grip in the center of the denture.</li>
            <li>but in the end it dried out and turned like an alien substance on top of everything else.</li>
            <li>I have read the instructions that come with Cushion Grip, since I had a lot of trouble by taking short cuts, although, once I did exactly what the instructions said to do, I have had no problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re getting a new soft liner every few days.</li>
            <li>Its like getting a new soft reline every few weeks.</li>
            <li>With a little practice, and a few pointers from a veteran (like myself), one can easily appear, to others, not to be wearing dentures at all.</li>
            <li>I removed it easily by working one small area loose and methodically peeling the rest of it away dry.</li>
            <li>In my opinion Cushion Grip can take the place of a reliner at far less expense once you learn how to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having removed both the reliner and the cushion grip, I set about the 2nd application of  Cushion Grip, but this time applied it directly to the surface of the denture acrylic.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to learn how much and where you need it, once you get the hang of it CG works wonders.</li>

            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I have experienced difficulty using Cushion Grip adhesive...</li>
            <li> Cushion grip is great</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> Apparently it is very popular.</li>
            <li> If you are patient and take the time to prepare and apply this product properly, it&#x27;s very effective for relining a denture.</li>
            <li> I found this product the best of the many that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price - get it in the 4 pack and PRIME - of course FREE SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li> , you had the better price, and was even cheaper than what she was paying at the wal-mart store, she is very happy knowing she can still get this item</li>
            <li> I am going to stock up on Cushion Grip to make sure I am never without it because it is the greatest thing made for denture wearers.  </li>
            <li> and though it doesn&#x27;t have a great taste it keeps my gums and bones in good shape.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing i have found for my dentures it is by far the best thing i have found for my problem dentures</li>
            <li> The given instructions are good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is this product is superior to pastes and goo.</li>
            <li> THE POWDER DON&#x27;T COME OFF REALLY GOOD.  </li>
            <li> I have dentures that fit wonderfully well</li>
            <li> it is a really good deal.</li>
            <li> The concept sounded so good and so reassuring.</li>
            <li> The product is good quality.</li>
            <li> Good to go for 4-8 days.</li>
            <li> Not as good of an adhesive as I was led to believe but when combined with poly grip or fixodent</li>
            <li> Then, pop in your dentures with a bit of Poligrip and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m then good for the day,</li>
            <li> I needed a good product that lines my dentures and keeps them in place and this does that.</li>
            <li> WHAT GOOD IS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it works, and is a good product but,&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has been using this any length of time knows they are&lt;br /&gt;Beening</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is without a doubt the best product available ( I&#x27;ve tried lots of them )</li>
            <li> After a good amount of weight loss I looked around and bought this for him.</li>
            <li> well, good price.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> yes it is good.</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m trying to find something that works as good with no luck</li>
            <li> /&gt;The texture of the adhesive felt good.</li>
            <li> Cushion grip works good for me, it takes some practice putting it on though.  </li>
            <li> Great product - I&#x27;ve always liked it.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product and it is one of a kind.  </li>
            <li> Good product ripoff on price  </li>
            <li> He loved it and it worked well for him.  </li>
            <li> For me, not so good.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased using the product.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Mom is so happy we were able to find it on the Internet.</li>
            <li> Much better prices on Amazon and great shipping services.  </li>
            <li> very satisfied with price, product and follow up and would never hesitate in ordering another product.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the most helpful reviews of folks that use this product,and offered great tips,I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> They would develop a profitable business and make so many people happy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A  great product which i hve used for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have dentures and this product is excellent for making them fit better , i would recommend this product for any one who  has dentures .</li>
            <li> It took a couple of tries for me to get the perfect amount for the best hold.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I hesitated at first to try this out because I had never heard of it, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give it a try - and I&#x27;m telling you - the best decision I have made since I decided to go with dentures.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> I understand why many people think it&#x27;s a hassle to use, my advice is don&#x27;t follow the instructions in the box!  </li>
            <li> I ordered four tubes and will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> stuff is great, but becoming too costly for my income.</li>
            <li> love this product will buy it on line always!</li>
            <li> So glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> this was a perfect way to get a supply mailed straight to his room!</li>
            <li> Best by far!!!!</li>
            <li> But it DOES pad any gaps between your gums and the denture form and makes wearing dentures a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> But it DOES pad any gaps between your gums and the denture form and makes wearing dentures a much more pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> but this makes it easy so everyone is happy</li>
            <li> It is a thermoplastic that molds easily into you dentures and molds to the contours of your gums creating a great cushion and suction grip.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; works great to add a lining to my denture.</li>
            <li> the hold is amazing</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Glad to have access to a good item</li>
            <li> Would be nice if this stuff was still being made.  </li>
            <li> I do have a sesitive mouth but the warm feeling lasts all of 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no nasty taste, thats a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Warm your tube.</li>
            <li> And to the person who posted this awesome solution thank you so much...</li>
            <li> Yes, warm it up to make it easier to work with, but</li>
            <li> Nice price -- As advertised – Prompt shipment –  Recommended</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Fixodent.</li>
            <li> I followed Echoscream&#x27;s instructions and I&#x27;m very happy with the results (thanks Echoscream).  </li>
            <li> They say this has the best hold and really keeps food out.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely thrilled to receive my Cushion Grip.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t eat that stuff with my own teeth.</li>
            <li> I did have good luck using the Cushion Grip on the bottom dentures, by applying more of the  product</li>
            <li> Using this for years -- absolutely the best dental product.</li>
            <li> It is okay, not as good as I thought it should be for that price</li>
            <li> (soak in warm water if needed to soften it for removal).  </li>
            <li> he&#x27;s thrilled.  </li>
            <li> and of course I kind of messed them up.  </li>
            <li> I WISH I would have found this stuff before I did all my own adjustments...</li>
            <li> and......if you are contemplating doing you own adjustments get it shipped overnight before you take a dremmell to your plate...........</li>
            <li> This product worked nicely.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found for its purpose / product lasts much longer than the box states - 4 days</li>
            <li> BUT LIKE MOST GOOD PRODUCTS THEY QUIT CARRYING IT</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford a new pair of dentures, so this product is wonderful to use.  </li>
            <li> He is SO happy he tried CUSHION GRIP and will be a forever user, this coming from someone who believes &amp;#34;It&#x27;s too good to be true!&amp;#34;, this stuff really is.  </li>
            <li> You can shape it and work with it very easily.</li>
            <li> The seller was very promt in sending it and it arrived in very good conditon, so that is why I have rated the seller with 5 stars</li>
            <li> It stays soft and conforms perfectly to your gums.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the greatest by far.</li>
            <li> All-in-all my dentures now fit and feel really good.</li>
            <li> It is even more effective then cushion grip or anything else I have found.</li>
            <li> By far the best denture product on the market</li>
            <li> My dentures fit so good now.  </li>
            <li> It gives you temporary, soft relines, at best.</li>
            <li> Made my 80 year old Mother so happy!</li>
            <li> Just being comfortable for the first time in a week is priceless.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for many years and with my new dentures it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> As a liner to fit it cannot be beat and once set ( a day or so) and clean with a good adhesive , you are good to mouth at will.  </li>
            <li> love love love!</li>
            <li> He was thrilled to find it and will recommend it to many more patients.</li>
            <li> This is great for people with dentures that do not fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I believe the most important part of the denture for holding turns out to be along the gum line, and it does a good job there.</li>
            <li> on top of it to make a very strong seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping is very fast, Great stuff to reline your teeth with, I can&#x27;t eat with out it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> : \\&quot;What exactly are they doing that I am not doing myself and why, supposedly, works so great for others but not for us?\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> It gives a very secure feeling.</li>
            <li> It makes dentures very comfortable for 5-6 days without changing.</li>
            <li> It works well and is very comfortable to use..</li>
            <li> was very important</li>
            <li> any of them--so each is one of a kind custom made----and is unbelievably easy to use</li>
            <li> I would be more than glad to send what remains of this product to one of the happy customers that prompted me to purchase it in the first place.</li>
            <li> nothing better</li>
            <li> It aslo has no after taste and is firmer than most products of this type which prevents that squishy oozing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately many of the chain drug stores stopped carrying this</li>
            <li> I have had dentures for MANY years.</li>
            <li> My dentist warned me that there is more of a problem keeping the lowers in.</li>
            <li> but I have had it hold up 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am perfectly satisfied   except for my latest order and it looked like it had expired on June 2009-however am using and seems to be ok</li>
            <li> This product is not a miracle cure, that is for sure.</li>
            <li> Now I love to find a \\&quot;die hard\\&quot; of this product and give them the 3 plus tubes.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> However I haven&#x27;t used it on my top plate, just the lower.</li>
            <li> I use it for the cushion effect, not for gripping.</li>
            <li> Myself, I&#x27;m well pleased with the product for my use.</li>
            <li> WE love it.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I am able to order bulk quanity @</li>
            <li> It holds better than anything I have ever tried.    </li>
            <li> Takes practice to use it but seems ok.</li>
            <li> There was a time, many moons ago, when I was often selfconscious about my dentures.</li>
            <li> I imagine it&#x27;s the next best thing to having my dentures relined.</li>
            <li> See more below.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE CUSHION GRIP.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years..  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s kind that I&#x27;ve been comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I Love Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> She said in that case, she is going to order about 12 more tubes just for her store.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t \\&quot;overheat\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have found that using a blow dryer when the Cushion Grip is \\&quot;setting up\\&quot; helps the Cushion Grip adhere to the dentures better.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to by it in our drug store but have not been able to find it for awhile till now.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, which allows user to eat all foods.</li>
            <li> It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> i love this product.....</li>
            <li> Just wish I had bought more when I had the chance.</li>
            <li> I am however pleased I can still purchase it through you at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Only the greatest pain to remove off of the denture.</li>
            <li> The price was over $2.50 a tube more than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> As for the product he is satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> On his top denture it has lasted almost 2 months, on the bottom a week.</li>
            <li> LOVE  </li>
            <li> This can fill in the gaps that the dentist couldn&#x27;t even fix and it holds for 4 or more days before needing to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I love Cushion Grip Thermoplastic...</li>
            <li> No nasty lingering taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure will take more than one tube.</li>
            <li> I followed one of the most well written reviews on this product, and did just as she wrote.</li>
            <li> It took me 20 minutes or better just for one denture.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did not give up on Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> Overall - a great product!  </li>
            <li> I decided that for cosmetic reasons and to see if I could return to eating some of my favorite foods again I decided to try Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> i will defiantly order more thsnks alot</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything better</li>
            <li> Also, when the Cushion Grip seeps over the top edges of your denture, do not trim it away.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for many years&lt;</li>
            <li> It is the perfect alternative to the more traditional brands like Poligrip and Fixodent.</li>
            <li> But as most of you know it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love how this product works.</li>
            <li> When this supply runs out I will order more.</li>
            <li> Works well to hold improper fitting dentures.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I think this works great as a temporary fix until you can get to your dentist for a real adjustment.  </li>
            <li> in mind this product is not an adhesive, it&#x27;s purpose is to tighten the denture so the adhesive works better.  </li>
            <li> When the denture starts to be able to slip (for me about 45-60 minutes after putting them in)</li>
            <li> I prefer replacing it every day or two rather than spend and hour or more trying to peel it off.</li>
            <li> I realize we will be told to get to the dentist and get better fitting teeth, but that doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> Although it is supposed to be a denture adhesive that lasts four days, for me it is a reliner that lasts more than a week or two.  </li>
            <li> I still use a denture adhesive with it, but it fits so much better than it ever did before.    </li>
            <li> Then I remove the denture and trim off any excess that might bleed up over the top ridge of the denture.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.</li>
            <li> I make sure I always keep some on hand.</li>
            <li> I found this to be the best longest lasting adhesive of any I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it  </li>
            <li> Will be definabely ordering some more  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT..</li>
            <li> LOVE IT..</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it on my bottom dentures yet,</li>
            <li> Bought it many times over the years</li>
            <li> I find that four hours would be more acturate..  </li>
            <li> felt good on my gums to have fresh Cushion Grip on my dentures.</li>
            <li> Will get more, if not this brand, or others</li>
            <li> but now she uses Cushion Grip and it makes it much better for her , plus she chews a pack of gum almost every day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect denture adhesive, look no further.  </li>
            <li> It works better than my expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my parents, they can&#x27;t seem to find this anymore, but I was able to find it here.  </li>
            <li> have been using cushion grip for many years.</li>
            <li> A OK can,t beat this item</li>
            <li> Eating is much better than with just adhesive.</li>
            <li> and I love the way the product works.</li>
            <li> It works better than all the name brand products on the store shelves..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> Order this thinking it would help keep my lower dentures in place better.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the product in the stores it is better by a factor of 10 magnitude.</li>
            <li> Better than the off the shelf brands.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to eat with them.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the timing they suggest, but also make sure you moisten the finger you use to press the Cushion Grip in place</li>
            <li> By using more Cushion Grip</li>
            <li> I was able to make the bottom dentures level.  </li>
            <li> then I had been able to do before.  </li>
            <li> I get blisters from the dentures since I have allergies to the material they are made of, with cushion grip after three years of not being able to wear my teeth</li>
            <li> and I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as I&#x27;m sure you can tell the process of applying it can be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way better than any of the creams and strips.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am confident that my denture will stay in place when I have this applied.</li>
            <li> Much better than using an adhesive, no sticky residue to have to try to wash off every night.</li>
            <li> more can I say to use up the 15 words</li>
            <li> I have found nothing that works better.</li>
            <li> I can bite with it which I had not been able to do before.</li>
            <li> *!, you signed the paper after the wax denture fitting</li>
            <li> the pain in my gums was outstanding</li>
            <li> No nasty taste like most products, and works like a charm.</li>

            <li> Cushion Gip worked okay</li>
            <li> Been using it for years &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom, she can&#x27;t find it in stores any more.</li>
            <li> It cushions when I bite, it fits fine, and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> People live longer nowadays----I am almost 83----basically healthy and intelligent, so don&#x27;t we deserve  a better quality of life ???????</li>
            <li> The next day the tops felt wonderful but the bottoms hurt so I easily removed the Cushion Grip and re-applied it.  </li>
            <li> Putting the denture in your mouth quickly before it cools,is imperative,or you will not get a good fit.</li>
            <li> and I just fell in love with it, and had to have one, very easy clean up, and so handy&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I am actually pretty good at that.</li>
            <li> My first try was not so good but lasted 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I always find it on Amazon for a pretty good deal.  </li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll still probably have to use a denture bonding agent because Denture Cream works by improving fit for better suction and comfort, Some say it works</li>
            <li> It makes my dentures fit better.</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip has been a lifesaver for me in that I am able to actually enjoy a meal without pain and a flopping denture.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good way to temporarily keep a badly fitting denture going until you can make the time to have a new one made or to have them relined.</li>

            <li> , strong hold...</li>
            <li> Thanks again, Craig Smalley, a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> this product did provide a cushion for me but didn&#x27;t provide any kind of adhesive and when I tried to take it off of my dentures the first night wearing cushion grip it took two of us 45 minutes to get it off of my dentures.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean off and if it would give me some kind of seal then I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, and a great find since it is so hard to locate in local stores.</li>
            <li> For some reason I cannot find this product in the area where I live and was delighted to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> works just fine for me</li>
            <li> But I grinned and beared it (pardon the pun) and all was fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and secure to gums.</li>
            <li> It does feel good at first but slides right off.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to but the results are excellent.  </li>
            <li> Very good experience arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> This unique thermoplastic formula is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I do realize that in the new world of dentures and denture users there if a fair amount of people out there with their own particular views.</li>
            <li> It is not meant to be a denture adhesive, it is more like doing your own soft reline.  </li>
            <li> but fortunately, I discovered they&#x27;re still available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I will let you have 3 unopened tubes for free.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product has been the determining factor in achieving a measure of success in being able to wear the temporary dentures.</li>
            <li> Keeps the teeth in and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for having it available to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it isn&#x27;t an adhesive, per se, but it does help keep dentures in place by improving the precision of fit, and therefore, both suction and comfort.</li>
            <li> The more you know where and how much Cushion Grip to use on your denture&#x27;s, the better the fit and trouble-free chewing.</li>
            <li> Then cut the wax paper to fit inside your denture.</li>
            <li> but I had to inform them that it is no longer available since it&#x27;s not being made anymore.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great product BUT- only after some trial and error to see what fits your needs.  </li>
            <li> This product is fairly comfortable as a temporary liner for your dentures.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has a problem with dentures that don&#x27;t quite fit, try this.  </li>
            <li> I use it to fit bridges and so forth.  </li>
            <li> Sticks great to dentures but no help with keeping the low dentures any tighter in place.  </li>
            <li> Dentures fit to be&lt;</li>
            <li> This made the bottom dentures secure and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> then what I had before, but I am using the Cushion Grip on them to make them &#x27;snug&#x27; and comfortable, while I am learning to eat with them.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and is so nice when your mouth is sore.</li>
            <li> It is like a temporary reline and make the dentures fit my mouth again.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product but not the quantity only ordered 4 and was billed for 8</li>
            <li> They made her dentures fit so she can enjoy eating again.</li>
            <li> When you need to get dentures DO YOUR RESEARCH on who you may pick to make them and before the dentures are made (before you give them any $$$ or sign any paper) find out what the maker will do if the dentures don&#x27;t properly fit and get it in writing.</li>
            <li> Not from after procedure pain, but from trying to get comfortable with the immediate denture.  </li>
            <li> Thank Goodness for this product and may it always be available for me.</li>
            <li> If you want your dentures to fit without the goo feeling</li>
            <li> at night I soak them in cleaner, and love the next day when I pop them in and I&#x27;m good for another day!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take out the dentures, wash em good, and blow dry or towel dry real good.</li>
            <li> Keep stocking it, Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Very worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a great value because it last a long time and works great for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> I love the product and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> He uses his dentures all the time, he&#x27;s super happy with this adhesive and as a result he has gained back quite some weight.</li>
            <li> After they sat on a dry towel all night, they fit great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not on sale in this country ,my wife will only use this good product ,easy to apply ,.</li>
            <li> It takes a small amount to keep his dentures in place and works wonderfully well to prevent sore gums.</li>
            <li> When I had my original teeth removed the dentist had to grind a lot of my lower jaw bone</li>
            <li> A Stage-1 diabetic friend told me about the unique properties of Agave nectar and I will never buy another bag of sugar.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> Good for loose fitting dentures</li>
            <li> I guess most adults nowadays have their own teeth due to flouride in water systems and better dental care.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if that is the product or what I clean them with (soap &amp; water, once a week I soak in a denture tablet to remove stains.)</li>
            <li> And you will have no problem taking your teeth out to clean.</li>
            <li> Makes applying the product to your dentures much easier, and I seem to get a much better fit to my gums this way as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have all day to clean my dentures.</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is NOT an adhesive, it&#x27;s more like a &#x27;&#x27;soft relign&#x27;&#x27;, so you can use your favorite adhesive over it if you need to..</li>
            <li> I soak my dentures in denture cleaner with the Cushion Grip on my dentures &amp; brush them clean with no problems.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product if your dentures are  loose in any areas.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years now and it is hands down the absolute best denture adhesive available.  </li>
            <li> For those of you with dentures that never seem to fit right or have gums that are never stay happy long, this stuff helps a LOT.</li>
            <li> From the \\&quot;die hard\\&quot; reviews pertaining this Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4) I truly believe this was going to be something exceptionally special</li>
            <li> Special Pack of 5</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product hard to find .</li>
            <li> It once again reminds me that amazon does their customer a great service by haveing the reviews to help when buying an unknown product.  </li>
            <li> Great product but not really a paste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem for most users or if it&#x27;s a rare occurrence, but for the first fifteen minutes or so the adhesive burned my gums and palate.</li>
            <li> stuff is really good, but only if used correctly.</li>
            <li> It takes some patience and paying attention but it really does work better than anything else.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much that I have ordered more.  </li>
            <li> Everyone who has a full denture knows that the gums and bones change over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be absolutely LOST without it &amp; wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear my dentures.</li>
            <li> So I really appreciate that I was able to find it online.</li>
            <li> so when I went to a full denture I tried it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about it.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can just pop my dentures in and be ready to go.</li>
            <li> and I have to import it from USA because it is no longer available in Australia , but it is well worth it and the service from Amazon and MY US</li>
            <li> My mother had full uppers and lowers, never used adhesive and could eat corn on the cob, steak, peanuts, etc.</li>
            <li> I did that 24 hours after full mouth surgery, You can to..</li>
            <li> I have full dentures</li>
            <li> Enough said... just buy and use this if you have dentures... comfortable and it works better than most anything else.</li>
            <li> But getting the right amount in the denture to create a snug fit is hit &amp; miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use if directions are followed, and use HOT water.</li>
            <li> I love the product and would recommend it to every one, its clean helps in preventing damage or injury to gums serves as a smooth soft cushion between gums and denture plates</li>
            <li> Only neg is that it requires much more time and attention to using, but my feinds who use all the other more convenient adhesive products are always complaining because they don&#x27;t work, whereas this 100% DOES!!!</li>
            <li> If you have dentures and just need a little cushion here and there, or, if your dentures need more help than that, this is almost as good as a reline.  </li>
            <li> Using a mild toothpaste (with no pumice of course).Furthermore, I have no difficulty eating any foods that I choose, I.E. Steak, corn on the cob, sunflower seeds, beef jerky</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, thanks,Carol</li>
            <li> It is a quick fix.</li>
            <li> My order was quickly accepted and shipped</li>
            <li> It improves comfort and grip tremendously.</li>
            <li> You always send it quickly and it arrives with out damage and in the time stated.</li>
            <li> Takes a few minutes to warm before applying, but is effective.</li>
            <li> *Just a quick note:  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of heat generated by the product but it quickly passes.</li>
            <li> delivery was quick and on time.  </li>
            <li> Basically the best way to do it is to set the tube in a sink, run hot water over it for about 4 mins, dry it off and make sure your fingers are very dry, then smooth it around in dentures and place in mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually very effective and very durable (seems to last 3-4 days).</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING product and is worth writing a review about for anyone needing help with denture adhesive, especially for the lower plate that doesn&#x27;t quite fit so well.</li>
            <li> Two weeks ago, I received my very first set of temporary dentures.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my lower plate for several years and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> though Rigident was made in Italy, can&#x27;t some resourceful investors and designers get the recipe that the company used, then reproduce the original ingredients and put it back on the market.  </li>
            <li> I estimate maybe 20-30 minutes of VERY hot water from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Improved the fit of my first set of dentures after the extractions.</li>
            <li> Use your finger to smear this funny stuff around and make it smooth as you can.</li>
            <li> At first, it felt really comfortable and snug.  </li>
            <li> The new bottom dentures are so much better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe it as more of a cushion than an adhesive, but since I&#x27;m new to the topic</li>
            <li> When I finally got the prep right and with a bit of adhesive, my dentures are now more comfortable and secure.</li>
            <li> My order was delivered very quickly and it is so much easier that searching from store to store (not all stores carry this product).</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I am learning to eat more things than I ever could with my natural teeth!</li>
            <li> For the first time in many months I can actually eat pain free!  </li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with their dentures staying tight and food getting under them.  </li>
            <li> After many years, I have finally found an excellent product that doesn&#x27;t ooze, is very easy to apply, and finally my lower denture is firmly in place.  </li>
            <li> new dentures fit very well, with no problem at all with the top denture.  </li>
            <li> This is great for loose dentures, and dentures that really hurt the lower gums.</li>
            <li> On the first try it was immediately comfortable 6 days post op, and still very much in the healing phase.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to have my teeth relines very often, and it keeps my teeth comfortable.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this available for my use.</li>
            <li> And I rarely have a reason to inform them of this fact.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> While this product does form a nice cushion for your gums, it does not actually seal the denture to your gums.</li>
            <li> your golden, put it where you need it, set dentures in, and wait like 1-2 minutes.    </li>
            <li> I am so glad you have it and shipped fast thanks</li>
            <li> it took a couple of trials before I learned how to apply the get for best comfort, but it sure beats the powder and gooey mess I have had with other products.</li>
            <li> It will bew WELL worth your time.</li>
            <li> **SMILE</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d have to rate the 1st application of Cushion Grip a success.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind I use,  I would recommend it to everybody, Never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Sill didn&#x27;t hold them in place for my 92 year old grand father.</li>
            <li> this is effectively an &#x27;mini-adjustment&#x27; until your next dental appointment.  </li>
            <li> Also, many seniors are living far under the poverty level, AS I AM ,and just keep trying to &#x27;make-do&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> After numerous trips to the dentist to get the denture to fit and stay in with ample denture adhesive, I was able to do it for myself when I discovered Cushion Grip.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on my 7th day without a fresh batch.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot to get your needs met and it definitely makes your dentures feel much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I found this product on line and decided it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li> I kept most of my natural teeth until this year.</li>
            <li> It allows for a better fit which helps his teeth stay put for a solid day +</li>
            <li> I accidentially found Cushion Grip on Amazon somehow and looked at some Youtube videos and decided it was worth a try for $20.00....</li>
            <li> but I love the soft cushion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy like most denture creams &amp; doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied for 4 days.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for false teeth...</li>
            <li> Grossly overpriced due to shortage as, I understand, production of this excellent product has stopped.</li>
            <li> The chances are good, that I have experienced the same obstacles, and subsequently surmounted them.</li>
            <li> I was able to eat fried chicken for the first time since losing my teeth and it tasted wonderful.</li>
            <li> A sharp knife is also good</li>
            <li> I use this on my bottom plate and it works really good, I recommed it to my other friends for thir denture&#x27;s it hold them in place.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have that much of lower gum to fit into dentures very much.</li>
            <li> Going back to conventional fixodent type product and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> , I read the instructions and went thru the motions so I could do it right and not have to remove the product, etc.</li>
            <li> It just peals right out.</li>
            <li> As one tube basically will be your test tube for getting the right amount.</li>
            <li> stuff takes some practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> yea right, their dreaming</li>
            <li> It took me about 2 weeks to get it right, and</li>
            <li> , Thank you for selling it and at the right price, daughter of Mildred Harp, Terrie Ross</li>
            <li> Dentures come right out.  </li>
            <li> It just peels right off in one piece.  </li>
            <li> an then moved to AZ, and they have never fight right.</li>
            <li> It goes right away.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get it right</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Although I am busy running my own entirely unrelated business, and do not spend much time on line, I will be happy to offer any help that I can to personal messages.</li>
            <li> The only functional problem was that Cushion Grip added on top of the reliner material made my mouth feel so full</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll eventually get it down to a science and will be able to chew at about 90% efficiency or better.</li>
            <li> no trouble to clean out one tube lasts longer than a case of that gooy stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product with good hold; however, the tube contents only allows for approximately 4 applications which could be costly if you reapply every 4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to rate my first attempt as a success.</li>
            <li> It can help you maintain a good fit for even lousy fitting dentures for days at a time.  </li>
            <li> I have chosen to recieve e-mails from this site with individual comments, so feel free to let me know about any problems you might have concerning this fine product.</li>
            <li> Since my dentures don&#x27;t fit and I can&#x27;t afford new ones, I had no choice but to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have new dentures and cushion grip has made it easier for me to eat, and to feel comfortable wearing them</li>
            <li> sure your denture is perfectly clean and absolutely DRY.</li>
            <li> I lost my dental insurance before I was able to get the correct dentures, but this works VERY well to cushion my old set</li>
            <li> Clean and dry the top</li>
            <li> ,ALSO,IT CAME SUPER FAST IN THE MAIL.THANKS ,I WOULD SHOP HERE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> We were able to buy it for a few dollars per tube but now we pay 20 dollars or more per tube.</li>
            <li> but still the same, an awesome product to use for dentures, at least full sets.</li>
            <li> Very much appreciate the speedy delivery &amp; quality of product</li>
            <li> THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> , I hope they bring this back holds dentures very securely.</li>
            <li> Myself, I bought this item to help my mother and her new dentures so they could fit better, therefore allowing her the possibility of conquering the initial trials denture wearers must endure.</li>
            <li> so I would be able to wear them comfortably, get them to stay in place and allow me to eat something other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that you had some of this left.  </li>
            <li> Excellant product does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.  </li>
            <li> Hot water aids in removing it, then go again.</li>
            <li> ,hot drinks won&#x27;t dissolve it, and leaves no taste in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I test the first on</li>
            <li> IS SOAK THE DENTURE IN HOT WATER IN A CUP FOR 10 MINUTES</li>
            <li> Thanks a million times over Amazon.com!    </li>
            <li> the Cushion Grip at first or</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I can use in my dentures,have used it for many years.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Of course, like most things that actually work, they quit making it.  </li>
            <li> When you first get it the diagram tells you how to use and lets you know there is no taste</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll gladly do it twice a week if I continue to get the same results!  </li>
            <li> FIRST  </li>
            <li> From day to day you can run your teeth under hot water and then move the wax around with the end of your toothbrush again...</li>
            <li> Just plan on your first tube as your training tube.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering this product for the first time - you will not regret it.  </li>
            <li> With the price of gas these days - EVERY PENNY COUNTS - and you will save even more since you actually don&#x27;t have to use any adhesive.  </li>
            <li> The only problem was that it was applied on top of my reliner, which  was also my first attempt at relining.</li>
            <li> I learned that I must get the tube hot as hell before squeezing out the goop and applying it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I have not finished the first tube yet.</li>
            <li> The second try was better and lasted 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m doing this, I have the tube of adhesive sitting in a container of hot water - which will permit an easier extraction from the tube.</li>
            <li> hope this helps people who have had problems using this product or are going to try it for the first time.</li>
            <li> hope this helps people who have had problems using this product or are going to try it for the first time.</li>
            <li> To remove, soak in hot water.  </li>
            <li> If they could only make it easier to get out of the tube and use I&#x27;d give it more stars.</li>
            <li> Tricky to apply at first</li>
            <li> when you spread it out wet your finggr with warm water.</li>
            <li> and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a learning process and a big adjustment, but for me, it&#x27;s better than the toothaches and abcesses.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and couldn&#x27;t find it locally any more so when I found it here</li>
            <li> To reline the teeth in SZ coast more then the teeth did back in Maine.  </li>
            <li> Reline can last me up to two weeks or more.</li>
            <li> What I do is soak it in hot water</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Using &#x27;&#x27;Cushion Grip&#x27;&#x27; has helped the daily adjustments to my gums and any &#x27;&#x27;sore spots&#x27;&#x27; that come up, making it much more bearable when your gums are healing...</li>
            <li> /&gt;4.Now, put your top plate in your mouth without anything on it.&lt;br /&gt;5.Open the tube and watch as a big glob of this goo pops up.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found an online place to purchase it since my local store doesn&#x27;t stock it anymore.</li>
            <li> Now that my mouth is completely healed they don&#x27;t fit correctly.  </li>
            <li> Cushion Grip does exactly as I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li> I have used cushion for a few years and find out it works good for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my teeth missing for about a week so my gums are still kind of tender, and the temporary dentures I have are less than perfect.      </li>
            <li> I was unable to tolerate the denture pastes and the cushion grip is easy and works great.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve found that I get much better adhesion when I first gently clean the inside surface of the denture (upper) with mild bleach, such as household Clorox dabbed on a paper towel.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth a try if you have loose fitting dentures.  </li>
            <li> One click to Amazon found her ole favorite, ordering was simple enough, delivery was fast and dentures are secure!</li>
            <li> We were honest, and caring to each other.</li>
            <li> The only real problem I have with this product, is not the product itself, but more trying to get the stuff out of the tube.</li>
            <li> It desn&#x27;t stick on my palate and holds the denture firmly and comfortably for more than 4 days.    </li>
            <li> there wasn&#x27;t much room left for the food that had to be chewed to be shifted around for better positioning during chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But if she&#x27;s able to chew her food and it reduces her chances of choking I&#x27;ll keep putting up with the major chore of replacing new Cushion Grip every four days......</li>
            <li> the fact we keep coming back for more tells you we never found a better product  for temporary fixing loose dentures.</li>
            <li> Also I have some issues with the way mine fit as they are my tempory plates so some of the things I would have gone back to the dentist was cleared up with the right adesive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay any attention to what the positive reveiws are.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I will in the long run since my gums have shrunk &amp; the Ins Co pays most of a reline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for quite a long time and many places do not carry it</li>
            <li> Because this adhesive sticks to your dentures really well, I heat the denture in hot water for maybe 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Because this adhesive sticks to your dentures really well, I heat the denture in hot water for maybe 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Many people of my generation have dentures but thankfully, not young people.</li>
            <li> The instructions are really not complete, like most instructions.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write product reviews, but this product is so good that I just had to make an exception.  </li>
            <li> When I went to my dentist for an adjustment, she had never seen this, but she liked it because when you bite down on the Cushion Grip, it forms the &#x27;&#x27;impressions&#x27;&#x27; of your gums and is softer for healing gums..</li>
            <li> This is a process and you are learning a new normal just like someone who looses any part of thier body so be forgiving of what is lacking in the early days, move forward confidently and don&#x27;t give up.  </li>
            <li> - I press the tissue into the denture area where the adhesive is to be applied to make sure the area is perfectly dry.</li>
            <li> The product is tacky/sticky until it sits.&lt;br /&gt;But, left overnight, it hardens and is really easy to use and wear.</li>
            <li> The trick (I have learned) is to get a good impression, and then leave your dentures out in the air for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> But when I have a cup of coffee or anything warm or hot, is looses its adhesiveness and it does not readhere or firm up again.</li>
            <li> Certainly something I do not want to repeat for fear of ruining my dentures.</li>
            <li> And will be certain to order again if need to.</li>
            <li> So many people depend on this product to eat, talk, and live in relative comfort with dentures...</li>
            <li> if you have loose dentures I would advise you to buy cushion grip as it is a lot better than the adhesive you have to use every day.</li>
            <li> The top dentures were loose and he did a temporary reline which helped but still needed to be adjusted to eliminate sore spots.  </li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for over twenty years and my older son has also!  </li>
            <li> They are so comfortable and a tight fit.  </li>
            <li> Removing is a little work, but results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I have applied this product to my dentures without heating the tube first, and also after heating and I highly recommend that you heat the tube.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty far from knowing very much.</li>
            <li> I think the cushion effect is probably more comfortable than hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Last night, with these in, I was able to rip into some tough meat and the dentures stayed in place really good.</li>
            <li> It makes it possible to improve the fit so much that I can forget that I am wearing the denture.</li>
            <li> but it does take some experimentation with how much Cushion Grip to use and how to place it on the crown.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is really a temporary denture relining material.</li>
            <li> a very malleable rubber like substance.</li>
            <li> I do realize the documentation says that you shouldn&#x27;t use it on dentures that don&#x27;t fit properly -</li>
            <li> thanks for having my item at a reasonable price and affordable shipping costs.</li>
            <li> AND THEN IT WILL COME OFF FAST.</li>
            <li> It sticks very well to the dentures.  </li>
            <li> If you want something to really glue your dentures into place for 4 days, this isn&#x27;t the product.  </li>
            <li> But I have already gone through a whole tube and</li>
            <li> I had a free adjustment contract for 60 days only.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having in stock too.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> it is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> This will really help protect the area.  </li>
            <li> I always use too much and have a curved pair of manicure sissors that I keep just for trimming the excess.    </li>
            <li> It does not take much to keep your dentures in place all day.</li>
            <li> Thanks A Million.</li>
            <li> how much adhesive I use.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me as an adhesive, but it&#x27;s worked absolute wonders as a temporary reline.  </li>
            <li> MUCH  EASIER  </li>
            <li> Thanks again for the speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I am actually pain free.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for those of you who suggested this product</li>
            <li> It keeps  my dentures comfortable for several days  with each application.</li>
            <li> If I had to grade Amazon on its ethical practices I would give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> may think after reading this review that \\&quot;maybe she put to much into the denture\\&quot;..</li>
            <li> It was just way to much issue for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Secure fixative totally rocks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Almost like it was when I had real</li>
            <li> For some reason - maybe because of the disinfectant properties of bleach - the Cushion Grip pad stays on much longer before peeling away.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the product and the service.   </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the manufacturer!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo</li>
            <li> and you find you&#x27;re using adhesive way too much</li>
            <li> You are now ready to start wearing the denture with the adhesive installed.</li>
            <li> You are now ready to start wearing the denture with the adhesive installed.</li>
            <li> Amazon just makes my shopping so much easier, what can I say?</li>
            <li> really didnt like this product it didnt hold like i thought it would</li>
            <li> it is much improved over the others.  </li>
            <li> Its doing the job  thanks</li>
            <li> He thanks you and so do I.</li>
            <li> and I dont really know why.  </li>
            <li> This product is a real money saver.</li>
            <li> All I was really hoping for was to get the dentures to stay in place without having to use a lot of denture adhesive.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really need to let it sit</li>
            <li> This product is really misnamed.</li>
            <li> It is not an adhesive so much as it is a comfort.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years, primarily for the &amp;#34;cushion aspect&amp;#34; and was dismayed when it disappeared from the shelves locally.</li>
            <li> There is no smell or taste once it dries and is ready to wear.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> Was very expensivethough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m retired, and implants are way too much.</li>
            <li> How much?</li>
            <li> Let them sit and really cure over night.</li>
            <li> My plate is much tighter than it was before.  </li>
            <li> , I believe it holds better on the denture when they are totally pink.  </li>
            <li> this product is appreciated by my friend.  </li>
            <li> How much will that be?!?&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> he swelled so much his teeth came out of his mouth while he was sleeping.</li>
            <li> I received this in a very timely manner and do appreciate it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon rescued us from a real problem.  </li>
            <li> Get to much when putting in and it runs out when I put dentures in.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product much sooner than I did.  </li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s not so much for the grip</li>
            <li> Really does not hold them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe the manufacturer will see some of the reviews and reconsider their decision to stop producing this much needed and desired product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s a surprising negative.</li>
            <li> Right now, these things are in so good, it may be tough getting them out, but</li>
            <li> perfect easy to use no more feeling that melting stuff in my mouth from those other other glue products I can drink hot coffee&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Each time you remove the denture to clean it, dunk it in a cup of generic Listerine (don&#x27;t pay for the real stuff; use the cheap generic).</li>
            <li> Since I had to find a way to wear these dentures, until the new ones were completed, I got the Cushion Grip with the hope that I could use it to get the first set of dentures to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if they sold it to other stores they would make a lot more money and us that really need it can buy it</li>
            <li> and if your mouth is sensitive it may feel a little warm at first.</li>
            <li> I first read the many reviews, good and bad, then went for it.</li>
            <li> It will feel like you have your original teeth  back.</li>
            <li> I took some advice from other reviewers and I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works better then any other Denture adhesive I have ever used and its use lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Remember every situation is unique,  and requires adapting things to your personal needs.  </li>
            <li> I saw this quite by accident and thought I&#x27;d give it a try as I&#x27;d tried many other things that did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> Get Secure, which actually works more or less.</li>
            <li> I would love to surprise her with a couple of tubes, and I have looked everywhere, but apparently this stuff is liquid gold since it is priced as such.  </li>
            <li> I take a facial tissue and with the aid of a clean rat-tail comb (the handle area)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a total failure, but when done correctly it&#x27;s a miracle and the next best thing to having your real teeth.</li>
            <li> Used to always get it at Wal-Marts-and kind of panicked when no   more to be found-till found it online.  </li>
            <li> (yes, I have a full set of upper and lower).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt soft when I first put my dentures in my mouth.</li>
            <li> But with Cushion Grip I cut down my adhesive use by 75% and have a much better hold.</li>
            <li> down with top denture and hold.</li>
            <li> I went on line to research a better cushion product meanly because as my gums shrink, I would need something that I could apply myself and not go back to the dentist and pay more for adjustments.</li>
            <li> It works wonders and is much better than using other stuff!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like going for new dentures</li>
            <li> Previously I had bought the strips instead of the fixodent, and that was more money tossed away.</li>
            <li> It was easy to buy and was shipped to me quicker than I expected.</li>
            <li> Wash hands, dry them and then roll the Cushion Grip into a pencil shape, then lightly press into \\&quot;groove\\&quot; of appliance.</li>
            <li> fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;PRO\\&quot; to the product is,if need be you can just pop your denture in quickly, and if you plan on NOT eating the denture will somewhat stay put.</li>
            <li> I only use Polygrip on my bottom dentures - this product holds the top dentures SOLID.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You have a short working window as the stuff starts to cure in the denture, so get everything set up for quick access before you start.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found that will last more than one day.</li>
            <li> Decent adhesion.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Price is way to high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and the work that it does.</li>
            <li> I put them in and bite down for several seconds looking to be sure the bite is right.  </li>
            <li> But, in the meantime, I had to go to a local CVS pharm here in Harrisburg to get some more of the goo stuff and low and behold, right beside that was the last 4 tubes of Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> but it does cushion and fill in the gaps between gums and plate and provides a little more suction.</li>
            <li> but I think it is over priced a lot more people would buy it if it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> There are easy directions in the packaging, follow those, then read all the reviews,  and use the helpful hints from other users on a try basis to see what works for you.  </li>
            <li> would not last one day or one hour, its hard to take off but the most important part is it does not stick to your dentures</li>
            <li> I clean my dentures and rinsed them off and dry them with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> With this product I dont have to worry about scraping the roof of my mouth trying to get the adhesive off, since I really cant put creams near the gaping holes where my teeth used to be.</li>
            <li> Clean and dry your plate.</li>
            <li> Smear it into the perfectly dry and clean denture troughs and let it sit for five minutes to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; before putting the dentures in your mouth.</li>
            <li> the drying phase - this adhesive turns light pink in color.</li>
            <li> the drying phase - this adhesive turns light pink in color.</li>
            <li> So far, they have been a real pain to keep in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra effort to use this product.</li>
            <li> I will say that it is the only thing on the market worth using.</li>
            <li> Many have complained about using alot of the tube when they first get it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll extend the life of the pad for a few more days</li>
            <li> a few days at the most.</li>
            <li> Love it and last a long time</li>
            <li> Anyone know of anything that keeps lower dentures in place for more then a few hours??????</li>
            <li> your normal teeth.</li>
            <li> dentist was very patient and adjusted different spots on dentures about every week for the first 2 months.</li>
            <li> Unlike most dental adhesive products Cushion Grip isn&#x27;t messy and doesn&#x27;t cling to your gums which requires brushing to remove.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it feels good on the gums, but alas it doesn&#x27;t hold dentures in place since there&#x27;s no \\&quot;stick.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> very surprisingly large, whole pizza&#x27;s and for pies its unbelievable, no bending over to spill anything and easy to remove</li>
            <li> Better then what we were using on our upper  dentures, it last for about 3 days and no mess MaryAnn P.</li>
            <li> shipped the complete order quickly via regular shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order my next shipment right now...</li>
            <li> It molds like putty and forms a snug, air-tight seal that will last from 4 days to an entire week, then pulls away clean when you are ready to re-apply.</li>
            <li> I will eventually get an implant and new crown but at a cost of $3.000 vs. a tube of Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> It is a gum saver when you are in between new dentures.</li>
            <li> She received her new supply of Cushion Grip before she ran out.</li>
            <li> Oh by the way I have brand new dentures....</li>
            <li> The new price &#x3D;</li>
            <li> gums have shrunken, can&#x27;t get new set but</li>
            <li> I am new to dentures.  </li>
            <li> is that anything new?</li>
            <li> Be sure that your bite is natural or where u want it and press them in firmly.</li>
            <li> used it on both upper &amp; lower, what I found was my dentures did not sit secure, and I looked noticeably different with this in my dentures.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really really like about this is that you can take your dentures off and on without renewing the adhesive and without all that adhesive stuck to your gums...that part is a real plus.</li>
            <li> I use a few little drops of fixodent on the bottom to keep them in even with the Cushion Grip, but it is much more comfortable using this product, and the uppers I don&#x27;t have to glue at all when I use this.</li>
            <li> Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive is as good or better than getting soft liners put in your dentures by a Denturist and much less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I FINALLY GOT THE ORDER - ON THE FIRST RESPONSE</li>
            <li> When I run out, I&#x27;ll re-order more from you as I have in the past.</li>
            <li> I just added some small balls of it on top of what I already have applied and pressed them together so they would not separate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the only denture adhesive that works for her as she has lost most of her bone due to a illness plus</li>
            <li> The thickness of the reline makes the teeth sit higher and further ahead in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The heating of the denture is imperative, and keeping the denture hot enough to remove the product, I had to keep plunging my denture into a bowl of heated water I had put in microwave.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve so don&#x27;t get discouraged if the first couple of times are failures.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never left the cushion grip in more than 2 days, because the longer it&#x27;s in the more difficult it is to get out.  </li>
            <li> It does NOT wash out and need reapplied daily like many other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does NOT wash out and need reapplied daily like many other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was my first order from Amazon, but will not be my last!</li>
            <li> hold better then it says, if you use small amounts the build up.</li>
            <li> Not sure I can do it now either, but I am eating more things than I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still was not able to eat anything but semi-solid  foods, but that was better</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it I followed the instructions and only kept them in my mouth for about 10 minutes before I removed them to \\&quot;dry/set-up\\&quot; overnight.  </li>
            <li> I am only in the first day of use</li>
            <li> It is a soft substance that molds to your gums, firms up &amp; stays put !  </li>
            <li> I opened the first box, got prepared, went outside to sit in the shade by my pool and started this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I take mine out once or twice a day to rinse and brush, then rinse with tap hot water to reform the stuff when you put it back in.</li>
            <li> &quot; my difficulty she informed me the product will NOT work on dentures with soft liner and may damage my plate!  </li>
            <li> Once you bite down on it, it \\&quot;re molds\\&quot; to your gums and denture, performing the seal that your dentures should have formed if they fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a new &#x27;&#x27;denture&#x27;&#x27; wearer, however during the initial period after getting my upper denture, my dentist has done several &#x27;&#x27;soft religns&#x27;&#x27;.. which works great for the first day or two, however as my gums are healing &amp; shrinking daily, the soft relign doesn&#x27;t last long..</li>
            <li> May take a little practice to apply exact amount needed, but well worth the practice.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 92 years young but unwilling to have new dentures made.</li>
            <li> This is just like putting a new soft liner in your denture.</li>
            <li> and then its like a denture that has been relined to fit like new again except its not hard plastic that causes the mouth to get sore if too much pressure from biting into hard foods ( and no added bulk ),</li>
            <li> For one thing I hadn&#x27;t heated the goop sufficiently to make it more pliable and stickey, hadn&#x27;t applied enough in the right places, and probably hadn&#x27;t pre-cleaned and dried the dentures properly.</li>
            <li> I filled the gum line about half way up, all the way around.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it recently became necessary to have the rest of my lowers extracted and get a full lower.</li>
            <li> I needed it for the time between getting my first set and having the swelling go down and waiting for the dentist to line my teeth for the first time.  </li>
            <li> They fit so tight I have to pry them out at night.</li>
            <li> She says, she loves that it has little to no taste and that the hold is fantastic;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was decided that the dentures were not able to be adjusted to fit correctly and a new mold was taken to start the process of making a new set of dentures.  </li>
            <li> My lower denture, right from the start, was too loose.</li>
            <li> But, I have had a hard time finding it in stores &amp; I am so glad that Amazon is supplying it to the customer..</li>
            <li> Although this is listed as an \\&quot;adhesive\\&quot;, after using it for a few days I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accurate description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep the trimmed edges as smooth as possible so as not to irritate your gums with rough edges.</li>
            <li> Used it 4 times and the last time, got very embarrassed.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$.</li>
            <li> Cases of Zinc Poisoning have been surfacing with use of the old products.]</li>
            <li> The whole ceremony of heating up the tube, applying, following all instructions did not seem to pay in the end.</li>
            <li> She was nearly out of it before letting me know she needed me to order it.</li>
            <li> However, I have developed a method of using it that enables me to leave it (untouched) for weeks at a time if I choose to.</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, I even sleep with them in, and brush them as I would my natural teeth.</li>
            <li> I sing out loud in the chior, and play one brass, and two woodwind instruments.</li>
            <li> Thank God I used an old pair of dentures to test it out on.</li>
            <li> but my teeth were already sensitive and started to become brittle.</li>
            <li> I would like to get the package I ordered  early  February.</li>
            <li> It is a deffinite must have for me.&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive gums a blessing, sort of a shock absorber.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the product being left in the mail box because we told them that we&#x27;re not home a lot</li>
            <li> This stuff might have a stronger pucker factor when you set it up, but the benifits far out weigh the inconvience.  </li>
            <li> My grandmother is 93 and lives on a fixed income.  </li>
            <li> My gums were too sore and I was on soft foods like mashed potatoes, ice cream, etc.</li>
            <li> I soon developed Stage-2 diabetes.</li>
            <li> Being a portrait artist I strive for as much perfection as possible.</li>
            <li> This will cure the plastic and the liner will last much longer.</li>
            <li> You basically reline teeth with a soft thermoplastic which allows you to eat anything and since the liner is soft the food that might get under plate does not hurt your gum.  </li>
            <li> This product is the only one on the market that really works well to custom-fit the denture to the mouth over time.</li>
            <li> So far it has not met my expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only things that has really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> No complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> Until it completely sets, some of it will ooze over the edges.</li>
            <li> As far as its performance, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s workable, although it will never be a &#x27;natural&#x27; bite.</li>
            <li> Remember that Cushion Grip will NOT stick to a soft reline.</li>
            <li> The instructions that come with the product are helpful but not fully complete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to recommend a product unless I&#x27;m completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
            <li> Ok-first, let me say, I am a 63 year old man.</li>
            <li> as the name says CUSHION GRIP ,it really had multiple functions for myself , I use to have to remove my bottoms to let tender places heal</li>
            <li> You have to pick and use tweezers to remove all the old thermoplastic.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the beast out there.</li>
            <li> The product holds the crown in place enough for me to eat soft foods with that tooth and of course it looks better than a missing tooth space.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff - I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.sive would push on out of your denture to the back and be wasted.</li>
            <li> You can eat or laugh and not have to worry about your denture slipping.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this for a few months and they were only  $20.00 to $25.00, now the price has more than doubled</li>
            <li> This is much better than Fixodent or Polygrip where it is a daily routine and messy.</li>
            <li> I was/am new to dentures and my first set did and do not fit very well as my gumes are shrinking every day.</li>
            <li> The mess that it makes on them is a nightmare to clean up.  </li>
            <li> but they left a lot of goo in my mouth and that is not easy to get out without touching your already sore gums.</li>
            <li> This product was only introduced by word of mouth , my mother told me how great it was ,I would describe like a very thin piece of rubber once applied</li>
            <li> all documentation says that - if they fit properly, you wouldn&#x27;t need this (or any other) denture adhesive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> It seems to be the only product that does the job in keeping my husband&#x27;s dentures secure without all the oozing that the other brands seem to cause.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t heat the dentures with hot water because they must be perfectly dry for thegoo to stick.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in any of the local stores but is very easy to order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> Now only way to live with dentures is to get a soft liner installed!  </li>
            <li> I had a full upper and partial lower.</li>
            <li> One full upper and one partial lower.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fairly complicated at first, but much better after 3 practices.</li>
            <li> got the tube as hot as possible without boiling it, and the stuff is still almost solid.</li>
            <li> I have a crown on a back tooth that kept coming out due to a cracked tooth root and much of the supporting tooth gone.  </li>
            <li> No nasty&lt;br /&gt;taste as with other products and if done right</li>
            <li> In view of the high price I could only rate this three stars,totally.</li>
            <li> No one should be allowed to charge such ridiculously high prices.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that people take advantage of the fact that is in so high demand and is no longer manufactured...where I come from</li>
            <li> It is hard to find locally &amp; whether you have the store special order it for you or not,  the store price is much higher.  </li>
            <li> remove the old adhesive in order to apply a new coat, I do the following.</li>
            <li> remove the old adhesive in order to apply a new coat, I do the following.</li>
            <li> Then I take a clean rat-tail comb - the tail area that you hold, and slowly press the balls of adhesive down into the denture crevice and smooth out the adhesive.</li>
            <li> My wife has had problems getting her dentures to stay comfortable and eating a steak usually causes pain</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time was very grateful to have gotten it on line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but nothing lasts as long or is as comfortable as this product.</li>
            <li> 5 min apply several drops where I want them on the top and spread them around, the same on the bottom and let them set for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have used cushion grip on a new upper denture for over a year.</li>
            <li> I went out and was eating, talking and finally not worried about my new \\&quot;teeth\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new wearer, and was looking for some relief for my sore upper gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts for at least three days.</li>
            <li> Normally very pliable but this seemed to be old as it was pretty hard.</li>
            <li> For many years I just had a partial denture and was limited to what types of adhesives I could use, which in turn limited the grip between your gums and your denture.</li>
            <li> helps soften &amp; disolve this product - a major help when cleaning dentures AFTER the bulk of the rubbery cushion is removed.</li>
            <li> My current application has lasted three weeks so far!</li>
            <li> worked very well for loose dentures</li>
            <li> I did the adjustments myself due to not being able to leave work everyday to go to the dentist to fix &amp;#34;sore spots&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product is great, to bad Sherring Plough  is discontinuing it.  </li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip to make my dentures comfortable for at least 25 years.  </li>
            <li> I can now clearly speak words and chew some solid foods (I am re-learning how to chew with dentures.)</li>
            <li> It was the complete opposite.  </li>
            <li> I forgot to mention that I had already applied a soft reline some time back, and this went over that OK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the delivery was fast as I expected.</li>
            <li> I am a 67 year old female, so I&#x27;m no rocket scientist - but I will share my secrets with you, for using this product.</li>
            <li> It was going to take several weeks to complete this process and that is when I purchased &amp;#34;Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to use too much as it will seep out, harden and will need to be trimmed.</li>
            <li> There is no ooze, no slipping and nothing to interfere with the taste of your food.</li>
            <li> -probably is good   anyway for at least 6 months past expiration date.</li>
            <li> Smear some goo thinly in both denture troughs and maybe some at the top of the uppers.</li>
            <li> this is the most worse product for dentures</li>
            <li> the thin layer keeps the dentures material from touching my gums.</li>
            <li> Now, here&#x27;s where the directions kind of fail to</li>
            <li> The instructions are a little intimidating as there is a process involved in getting the application of Cushion Grip right, but if you follow the instructions - warm the tube beforehand, you will have no problems - it takes a little time learning the right and wrong way to apply but...</li>
            <li> Slight burning sensation when first applied and used.</li>
            <li> A really simple and straightforward task requiring no more than five minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to remove, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> The product lasts for days, and even after it starts to lose it&#x27;s grip, I just add a very small amount of denture adhesive to compliment the fit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know the proper way to bite so that the uppers were snug against the front of my gums, resulting in too much relining material atthe front and my upper lip protruding slightly too far, causing the front of my upper lip to protrude slightly too much from what I remember as my normal appearance.</li>
            <li> The Cushion Grip made it possible for me to continue to wear the ill fitting dentures until the new dentures arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I was not happy and tried to take it right back out of my plate.</li>
            <li> I have been using the soft reliner stuff, but that takes so much adjusting because it oozes everywhere</li>
            <li> The instructions recommend placing the tube in hot water to heat it, which does help melt the product and makes it a little easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next time I intend to use a hair dryer set on medium-hot, not super hot or you run the risk of damaging the acrylic and ruin your denture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I just a small amount (1/4 inch (more if my denture are really loose)) and roll it out to a strip and press it into the DRY denture.  </li>
            <li> we c an no long buy it...</li>
            <li> heated the tube by immersing in a sink of really hot water for a few minutes, then removed the cap and used it immediately.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all about others perception of any thing, some advice you can use, others, some are simply not in the game, it&#x27;s a wonderful product, but, the wonder of it all is your persistence to hang in there and learn, or you will fail...</li>
            <li> Trim the excess and then add a new blob of Cushion Grip in the center of the denture.</li>
            <li> but in the end it dried out and turned like an alien substance on top of everything else.</li>
            <li> I have read the instructions that come with Cushion Grip, since I had a lot of trouble by taking short cuts, although, once I did exactly what the instructions said to do, I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re getting a new soft liner every few days.</li>
            <li> Its like getting a new soft reline every few weeks.</li>
            <li> With a little practice, and a few pointers from a veteran (like myself), one can easily appear, to others, not to be wearing dentures at all.</li>
            <li> I removed it easily by working one small area loose and methodically peeling the rest of it away dry.</li>
            <li> In my opinion Cushion Grip can take the place of a reliner at far less expense once you learn how to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having removed both the reliner and the cushion grip, I set about the 2nd application of  Cushion Grip, but this time applied it directly to the surface of the denture acrylic.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to learn how much and where you need it, once you get the hang of it CG works wonders.</li>
            <li> Get a big glass-fill it with water, and heat in microwave,not boiling,but hot.&lt;br /&gt;2.Put tube, closed, in water, head first, cap down.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the four pack and when I get down to the last tube I reorder it through you.</li>
            <li> Very hard to clean off the dentures.</li>
            <li> It is not messy to use like other products and lasts several days.</li>
            <li> I am less than one week out of extensive dental surgery and new dentures.  </li>
            <li> the tube has been heated sufficiently, I remove the cap and squeeze out 3 small balls of the adhesive - about the size of a large garden pea into the deep channel towards the front of my denture.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to press out a large amount all at once, only a small amount, the size of a pea...</li>
            <li> The taste is a little funky but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for secure dentures.</li>
            <li> I have completely abandoned all other forms of adhesives.</li>
            <li> I had a full mouth teeth removal (24 teeth and broken roots removed) about four months ago and immediate upper and lower dentures made in the same day.</li>
            <li> My first tube appears to be lasting at least a month.</li>
            <li> But, don&#x27;t leave it in for too long as it hardens and is more difficult to take out to replace.  </li>
            <li> As I said following the heating of the water, and letting the denture sit long enough, still did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Ialso found that it WILL ruin your reline of your denture, as it will pull up and make your reline almost pitted.</li>
            <li> have enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The directions on this product indicate that it will last for, approximately, four full days.</li>
            <li> (had it last up to 2-3 weeks depending on amount of heavy chewing - solid - semi solid - soft foods I intake.</li>
            <li> As my gums have changed with time, making my current dentures not fit as well, I used this product for a while until I made the step to get a re-line or new dentures --</li>
            <li> Holds very well with small amount of polygrip adhessive.</li>
            <li> Long story short: Went to Costa Rica 6 weeks ago and had 26 teeth extracted and immediate dentures fitted.  </li>
            <li> I should also mention that when I do use Polygrip with this product, I only use a tiny drop on the back corners and one drop in the front center -</li>
            <li> long enough to affect my health.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t last too long...</li>
            <li> flat out don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> have new dentures, have went back,still does not fit.</li>
            <li> The bottom denture (a partial plate with two anchor teeth was even more difficult to deal with).  </li>
            <li> Not so much the top, but the bottom is just stupid, the way it moves when I try eating.</li>
            <li> I had worn a partial denture for several years but recently acquired a full-lower denture.</li>
            <li> I received my package today (earlier than expected thank you Mr. Medical)</li>
            <li> Do both the uppers and lowers at the same time and hold a normal moderately-firm bite for at least ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Put them both in and bite down as you would when your mouth was closed when you had your natural teeth, firmly, but not excessively, hold it for about ten minutes, and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I experimented with several loose crown repair kits and Cushion Grip</li>
            <li> If your dentures become too loose to stay in your mouth, go back to the dentist for a reline or try one of the at-home</li>
            <li> Then on following days I put a couple of very small \\&quot;dobs\\&quot; of the Fixodent on each side to make them absolutely \\&quot;stick\\&quot; in.</li>
            <li> It last ten times longer that other products  </li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is the answer to dentures that are getting older and not fitting well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to soften it by immersing the tightly sealed tube in hot water for a few minutes before using.</li>
            <li> I have to wait 5 more months before I can return to Costa Rica to get the permenant dentures made, so I was desperate for a temporary fix when I tried Cushion Grip.  </li>
            <li> A fantastic product and I&#x27;m sorry to hear it is discontinued.  </li>
            <li> As a long time user I can reccommend this product to anyone who wears dentures.</li>
            <li> it cheaper in the long run</li>
            <li> I would not be without it as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> That feeling has, long since, passed.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve put off seeing my dentist too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all of that, I only had to trim off minimal excess of it.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this long ago.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase it through you as long as you carry it.</li>
            <li> It might be considered a temporary soft re-liner you can re-do over and over again yourself every few days or weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The order came with no problems and came earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> let stand out all night long, can be use for weeks at a time without having to replace</li>
            <li> it takes to long</li>
            <li> Nothing the dentist could do helped for long.  </li>
            <li> but it does help decrease the minor burning feel when you wear the adhesive.  </li>
            <li> None of the pharmacies do, which is strange.</li>
            <li> Take a 10 minute break-now, go back and carefully place the lower denture in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I gave this product several tries</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> think IF I were to continue using (which I will not) getting the product into a thin rope like appearance will do better than the small \\&quot;pea\\&quot; size would be easier for beginners.</li>
            <li> If I had any complaints it was that it didnt last as long as I expected it to, and I had to use it two or three times a day as well as an adhesive.</li>
            <li> I tried Cushion Grip and after several times trying, finally got it down</li>
            <li> Just hard to work with and didn&#x27;t stay in the liner very long.. it really isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;cushion grip&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34;, you do need to learn to eat differently if you are a new denture wearer, or at least I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers on this product, finding it at your local store might be a problem, but with the interent, as long as you have money you can get just about anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ingredients are completely different from ALL other adhesives.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to get out of the tube even after the required time of soaking in hot water.</li>
            <li> Most denture adhesives leave a bad taste in your mouth or simply feel yucky.</li>
            <li> When my mom tried to leave the denture overnight for the adhesive to dry and then put it in, it would not hold in place at all.</li>
            <li> After they set in my mouth for 5 minutes, I took them out and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> Rinse thoroughly and dry.</li>
            <li> I take them out, dry them off with a tissue, and apply adhesive.  </li>
            <li> , let your denture to sit and air dry -</li>
            <li> , let your denture to sit and air dry -</li>
            <li> After letting them dry overnight when I put them in  my mouth I was in heaven.  </li>
            <li> I used a hair dryer to dry them, as it also warms them up, which makes this goo easier to apply.(fill sink with water, so if you drop them, they won&#x27;t break.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It last four days,  and can easily last a few days longer.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not recommend it hey total waste of time</li>
            <li> My grandmother absolutely loves this product and I find it appalling that people would jack the price of a five dollar tube of denture cream to almost 300 dollars.  </li>
            <li> I chip a tooth into two small pieces when I ate a piece of soft bread.</li>
            <li> I wrote to merck directly and gave them a small piece of my mind.  </li>
            <li> but once I used this I never had any issues ever again ,if it did I just removed the old CUSHION liner and reapply another application of this product and instantly no more tender spots .Its</li>
            <li> My husband is a TRUE skeptic and has a difficult time trying &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> I can chew gum, eat an apple, crushed ice or anything that I want as long as I have Cushion Grip on my lower denture.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you leave it on too long it&#x27;s even harder to get off.  </li>
            <li> It has been a nightmare, with lots of adjusting, resulting in the lower being quite loose and</li>
            <li> If you have dentures that are loose, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> When we tried the package instruction the denture got loose after about an hour.</li>
            <li> It does not adhere to my dentures and immediately comes loose.</li>
            <li> When your dentures get loose</li>
            <li> Well,how loose is your lower denture?</li>
            <li> If you have any fragments get loose in your mouth while pressing down in the impression phase, simply spit them out or remove them with a tissue.</li>
            <li> If you have any fragments get loose in your mouth while pressing down in the impression phase, simply spit them out or remove them with a tissue.</li>
            <li> When the balls of adhesive are applied to the front portion of the denture, as you press down, any excess will push to the back areas, along the gum channel.</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is the ONLY denture adhesive that I have ever found that holds my lower plate down.  </li>
            <li> This 2nd attempt was a total failure, and I can see why some people rate it with only one star.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll only need once the tube gets less than half full as it becomes difficult to compress the aluminum container enough to squeeze out the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Using too much will make the product seep out from under dentures when biting down hard...</li>
            <li> If you can smell the bleach, rinse and dry it again!</li>
            <li> Less than 5 minutes later I then ordered the 4 tube pack from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Then, less than 2 hours later my bottoms fell out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using Cushion Grip on the upper dentures not only held them in place, it also made them comfortable(it eliminated the sore spots I usually got).</li>
            <li> and  I only got  half the order.</li>
            <li> besure to follow the directions completly and one app will last a week,no mess in your mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found a blast of cold water and carefully using tweezers is an easy way to remove it (Again, contrary to the directions</li>
            <li> If you applied them to the back areas, as you press down, the adhesive would push on out of your denture to the back and be wasted.</li>
            <li> Mine is metal on the palate of the mouth, and the cushion grip does not hold tight on the back edges of my denture.  </li>
            <li> When I would push down on one side of the bottom dentures, the other side would lift up and the same thing would happen if I reversed the procedure.</li>
            <li> He applies a little bit of PoliGrip for extra hold - just on the lowers.  </li>
            <li> It has now cured, and may sting a little on the gums, but, it&#x27;s no big deal.</li>
            <li> fantastic product,first try was a little scary but the product does what it&#x27;s says it does.</li>
            <li> First, you can hardly find it; second, it&#x27;s no good anyway, so</li>
            <li> (And I need to wait at least 6 months to do a soft reline).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long each application will last (it says 4 days)</li>
            <li> This is getting harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> , it did not perform as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Too much money spent in such a silly way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very sticky at all.</li>
            <li> The package was crushed and therefor the product got damaged.</li>
            <li> Will not go back to the gummy, messy alternatives.</li>
            <li> This product is a minus 1 star</li>
            <li> But for me it was just to much time involved,and a poor experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> This time I left them in my mouth for a few hours before taking them out to \\&quot;dry.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> and it just is not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Been useing for years pity</li>
            <li> Could not get this product to stick to my partial.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for partial wearers.  </li>
            <li> It fills in the gaps so the partial doesn&#x27;t slip when you&#x27;re eating.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure you do not put too much on or it seeps out after putting your dentures in and taste awful.</li>
            <li> My parents both have false teeth, that really need to be remade.</li>
            <li> It did not fit as well as I had expected and other products which were supposed to hole it in place seemed to dissolve instantly when I began eating.</li>
            <li> Lost money, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple, just fell out.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;tube lasts a long time four lasts a lot longer!!!!</li>
            <li> I also found an inexpensive pair of small needle-nose pliers helps enormously.</li>
            <li> I thanked her endlessly for that favor.</li>
            <li> I found it totally useless and it melts if your food is too hot.</li>
            <li> Extremely Pricy.  </li>
            <li> if your dentures are not fitting properly this product will help you until you can get into the dentist to get a permanant fix.</li>
            <li> I TRIED OTHER  THINGS  </li>
            <li> I lost part of my lower teeth due to an auto accident, tried implants</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna do with the other 3 tubes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the drug stores have it and other times they don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Take the phone off the hook and throw the cat into the other room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re only talking fractions of an inch, but these small differences are what distinguishe one person&#x27;s face from another.</li>
            <li> It will sting slightly due to its chemistry, After removing them trim the exess overflow with manicure scissors.</li>
            <li> It explains the extremely inflated price.</li>
            <li> I like it and am disappointed that they are not producing any more.</li>
            <li> Does hold them in like i read on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother because her dentures were not fitting properly after she lost weight</li>
            <li> She won&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> My wife and I followed the advice of other reviewers and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because I have the not got the final pair as my gums are still healing.  </li>
            <li> There is no taste and it lasts longer then any other product out there.</li>
            <li> Over priced due to shortage of the product.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to work with, never actually becoming anything then a difficulty worked semi plastic, even after extended periods in very hot water.</li>
            <li> After a few hours I had trouble removing the upper plate</li>
            <li> My mother was forced to try other products when the local store discontinued carrying Poly-Grip.</li>
            <li> Suddenly, it has become hard to find in my location.  </li>
            <li> We have been having a hard time locating it in local pharmacies.  </li>
            <li> The only food you&#x27;re likely to have trouble with is biting tough steak with your front teeth.</li>
            <li> Removal can be a bit tedious, as this stuff sticks really well sometimes.</li>
            <li> Not being afraid to smile or talk lifts your spirits and gets you on the road to recovery.  </li>
            <li> But, I used it and can say, it really does work, but is not perfect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with a lot of false hope, boy was I surprised</li>
            <li> and the swelling has gone down and</li>
            <li> I watched the raving YouTube reviews about this stuff and immediately went down to my pharmacy and bought a tube to try out.</li>
            <li> Then don&#x27;t eat or drink or bite down for about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> and I was jumping up &amp; down with excitement.  </li>
            <li> Bite down.</li>
            <li> As time passes, food and water may slightly soften the adhesive.</li>
            <li> As time passes, food and water may slightly soften the adhesive.</li>
            <li> but each application lasts me about a week and a half to two weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slight chem burn, nothing to worry about-lol&lt;br /&gt;Bite</li>
            <li> hope it will be availeable in the future only a little less expensive...</li>
            <li> We put a little on and push it down with the end of our toothbrush...</li>
            <li> Put them in and bite down a little and then take them out</li>
            <li> I have not found an adhesive that works as well as it does without any oozing or mess.</li>
            <li> It is not a true adhesive --it</li>
            <li> Keeps dentures in place without sticky mess in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> did he mess them up.  </li>
            <li> I did apply a small amount of Fixodent, but not much.</li>
            <li> , I place the denture into my mouth and press down firmly with both hands, so as to allow my gum line to imprint a form on the adhesive.</li>
            <li> , I would not bother with it if my dentures held tight.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s little to no gaps for stray food particles to get in, and no need for plucking out remaining adhesive residue from your gums after removing your dentures - no gooey mess.</li>
            <li> I am getting a little weary of \\&quot;die hards\\</li>
            <li> While it takes a little effort to change it, this product lasts for days.  </li>
            <li> Follow the instructions, then add a little of your preferred adhesive.</li>
            <li> it works---puts little gel pillows and pads where you need them---soft not hard--does not dissolve like creams and leave you w/</li>
            <li> So I had to painstakingly use tweezers to remove little by little out of the denture.</li>
            <li> I went with the \\&quot;Pack of 4\\&quot; just to save a little money.  </li>
            <li> When they get a little lose I add a layer of cushion grip.</li>
            <li> Someone could make a fortune making and selling at $6.99 a tube if they just did a little marketing.  </li>
            <li> see why in a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As time goes along, some of the adhesive may stretch a little and ride up to the denture ridge,</li>
            <li> It does smell a little coming out of the tube, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive.</li>

            <li> It does smell a little coming out of the tube, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive.</li>
            <li> I tried using a little and then a lot.</li>
            <li> I use a little adhesive (one line)  </li>
            <li> I asked my mother how she could eat all of those things and still keep her dentures in, her reply was &amp;#34;You learn to control them.&amp;#34; After trying a multitude of products (which help a little), I think what she said is the truth - that one needs to learn to &#x27;control&#x27; the denture with cheek muscles, tongue, lips, etc.</li>
            <li> I could see the price went up a little but almost 200%.</li>
            <li> Trim  excess with small sharp scissors to edges of plates.</li>
            <li> For those persons who find this product difficult or impossible to use and see no benefits, I offer my own tips which also incorporates the instructions you get with the adhesive.</li>
            <li> Although it is very hard to find in rural Neb.</li>
            <li> When I say add I do mean add a layer to the old because removing the old is very difficult.</li>
            <li> once you have it down you won&#x27;t use anything else!  </li>
            <li> It works, I don&#x27;t use it all the time as it&#x27;s hard to apply and harder to get off.  </li>
            <li> Works if you can find s few tubes.</li>
            <li> I over fill mine and then trim off the excess after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Sounds harsh, but it works.</li>
            <li> five minutes bite firmly.</li>
            <li> Those who have trouble getting it out are not waiting until it is cured.</li>
            <li> This will let you scrub away the Poligrip without destroying the liner.</li>
            <li> Let it soak for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Over a few days, the Cushion Grip will \\&quot;migrate\\&quot; outwards.</li>
            <li> i have used it for a few years now and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> After it is applied and dried somewhat on the denture, I sense no smell or taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After it is applied and dried somewhat on the denture, I sense no smell or taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried it a few times, but it is easier to use an adhesive cream rather than working with cushion grip.</li>
            <li> When it does set, its texture is sort of like a firm yet pliable rubber.  </li>
            <li> and if she cant find it she is crying to me to find it.  </li>
            <li> The Cushion Grip showed up in a few days</li>
            <li> /&gt;Place a few drops and spread them cover the underside, then let it sit for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> and I had trouble talking and</li>
            <li> this product did not work as advertised I waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Fills in those gaps that make dentures not fit well as your gums continue to shrink.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> a crying shame</li>
            <li> You will still have to reapply every few days, and use denture adhesive along with Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> I was overconfident, in too big of a hurry, and was too sloppy.</li>
            <li> I had to have my teeth pulled in November 2010 and the oral surgeon highly recommended one place to have my dentures made and (like a total idiot)</li>
            <li> Not easily removed from denture.</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to use.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that in one day it went from the shelves at the local pharmacy at $6.00 a tube to impossible to afford.</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery, but very expensive</li>
            <li> little difficult to use but after reading several reviews i figured it out .</li>
            <li> Too expensive due to limited supply now that the manufacturer had discontinued production of the product.</li>
            <li> Not real good for metal dentures</li>
            <li> Does not last very long and very expensive now.  </li>
            <li> Usually I apply it, put the denture in to \\&quot;fit\\&quot; it and leave it in the rest of the day with no problem.</li>
            <li> So the aids are to small and one whistles, because of this.  </li>
            <li> This is a crying shame!</li>
            <li> My denture should be relined but I&#x27;m not sure I want to.</li>
            <li> I usually squeeze out 3 balls, placing one at the front teeth area and one to each side of that.</li>
            <li> I usually hold this in place for a count of 10.</li>
            <li> usually overnight (out of your mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then, I use a thin blade paring knife and tweezers to pry the adhesive up and out of my denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have encountered no bad smell or bad taste using this adhesive.</li>

            <li> Not sure if I will use it.</li>
            <li> I have to pry it off with a small knife, I wear gloves and it takes awhile to do.</li>
            <li> It usual works for 3 days before i have to reline my lower plate</li>
            <li> I usually order her the 4 pack about 4 or 5 times a year.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.</li>
            <li> It usually lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> As a new denture wearer I&#x27;ve been very frustrated with the initial process.</li>
            <li> One family-owned drugstore in town occasionally has it with an outrageous high price.  </li>
            <li> Once this tacky hard to get out of container</li>
            <li> Eventually, it gets too hard for comfort, for me</li>
            <li> It is, however, hard to find.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a hard reliner kit.</li>
            <li> but it is so hard to find now a days</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that even adhesives would have a hard time sticking to a reline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A product that all denture wearer use and now hardly cannot afford.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in a store because of the cost it is pilfered so stores just don&#x27;t carry it and</li>
            <li> nothing negative.</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for at least 12 years to keep rub areas from staying sore.    </li>
            <li> but the posts failed, I received my partial denture two weeks ago and have been hurting non stop even with adjustments by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> Fold it over at least 4 times.</li>
            <li> I had no suction in the least and the denture makers said I&#x27;d have to use Fixadent to keep them in.  </li>
            <li> have used it for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have always bought mine at Walmart, but since they built the new store they no longer carry it. :(.</li>
            <li> Difficult, tedious and not rewarding enough.</li>
            <li> I mean, brittle.</li>
            <li> And it was also difficult to roll out of the tube even with the key(provided) due to the density.  </li>
            <li> No more denture goo from the drug store ever !  </li>
            <li> Very difficult to calculate or apply in such an even way to where it might be helpful.</li>
            <li> I have had constant pain with my lower denture and the dentist advised very expensive implants that I could not afford.  </li>
            <li> Its hard enough to try to get adhesive off the roof omy mouth cant imagine how bad it would be if got into a socket.    </li>
            <li> Paying these prices is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I will have to apply adhesive if I expect to do some serious</li>
            <li> Every time I tried, food would get under the back of the bottom dentures, causing pain and making it impossible to eat wearing the bottom</li>
            <li> It is ridiculous how the price jumped.</li>
            <li> and it no longer being produced, merchants are charging ridiculous prices.</li>
            <li> I seriously have tried every adhesive I could find and</li>
            <li> Was less expensive than the stores</li>
            <li> price gouged really bad by the sellers.&lt;br /&gt;Cvs carried this for 7.99 a tube until the company discontinued it earlier this year.</li>
            <li> Not good at all I like to return them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a good contract, I must say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new denture wearer and trying to adjust to the worst situation - the lower denture with very little bone ridge to hold the denture in.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Well, I have had one problem after another and the dental lab said, \\&quot;tough sh</li>
            <li> As usual,  Amazon comes thru!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do, but hard to get off dentures - takes a lot of time - unless I am doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> teeth abcesses, broken, discolored),</li>
            <li> If someone gave it a poor review, it&#x27;s probably because they didn&#x27;t take the time to read and follow the instructions correctly.  </li>
            <li> The cream- types  are  still worse for me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this before, 5 tubes for approximately 27.00.</li>
            <li> This held broken teeth in my mouth before i had extractions.</li>
            <li> I am not happy about that.</li>
            <li> It is too bad, however, that due to the shortage of cushion grip</li>
            <li> All the denture adhesives etc, that I&#x27;ve found resemble a sloppy flour paste that squeezes out from under ill-fitting dentures.  </li>
            <li> This product was almost set up when it came-I was very disappointed as it must have been old.</li>
            <li> desperately wanted to believe that my dentures would stay in at least all of 1 day, but they came out even quicker than with Fixodent or Poligrip.  </li>
            <li> My dad had been resisting using his dentures for a LONG time because he hated it.</li>
            <li> Sorry for delay in response    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did  not work for her.</li>
            <li> 2 of the tubes were mashed and useless.</li>
            <li> Man, oh man.&lt;br /&gt;I bought all 4 and then told the sales clerk that this stuff is incredibly difficult to find in a store.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive this product.  </li>
            <li> So sad the manufacturer has stopped production of this product.</li>
            <li> How sad to take advantage of the elderly population.  </li>
            <li> When its done wrong</li>
            <li> For years I had battled with the insecure feeling of dentures that seemed to be wobbly, and I was using globs of Poligrip.</li>
            <li> Sorry..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, who has had dentures for years, and because they&#x27;re rather expensive, has not had her dentures replaced for years.    </li>
            <li> Too difficult to remove from dentures.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a temporary denture reline that help ill fitttng denture.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I will use now, nothing works like it, so sad.</li>
            <li> I get this for my sister and she loves it and is unable to find it when needed</li>
            <li> Was expensive on here compared to CVS 8 dollars</li>
            <li> and she was unable to eat well with them.  </li>
            <li> I tried every paste on the market all failed.</li>
            <li> This is outrageous for those of us who depend on a product such as this, and there is NOTHING else on the market that even comes close.</li>
            <li> expensive mistake since I bought 3 tubes.</li>
            <li> Hate that it&#x27;s not available.</li>
            <li> prices are ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> Cold water hardens the material making it easier to extract &amp;</li>
            <li> Things like corn chips and fried chicken will be a breeze.</li>
            <li> When they loosen up as the Poligrip degrades, remove and rinse with COLD water.</li>
            <li> but it is way to inconvenient when I can do it at home in 15 mins.</li>
            <li> but, I found this product very difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> And, this stuff is very difficult to get off your dentures.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to spread on the dentures, and a fifteen-minute job to get it OFF the dentures.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist but was impossible to find on store shelves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find in retail stores, so I thank God for Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Too bad the manufacturer has discontinued the product.</li>
            <li> Bad Bad Bad ....</li>
            <li> too bad they stopped manufacturing it..</li>
            <li> Its too bad.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with the results and returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> It is really annoying and painful and I cannot wait til I can get my permanent set.</li>
            <li> I used to get this for $5 a tube through my pharmacy till they couldn&#x27;t get it any longer. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m real sorry that its not made anymore.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I noticed the ever-so-slight tingling others have mentioned, as the goo cured, but it was in no way annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate to shop.</li>
            <li> I hate to have to try relining again</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The price was outrageous..</li>
            <li> In a word, I was miserable.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years..nothing better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that you had some of this left.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when thats gone!!</li>
            <li> Cushion grip works well for my needs and is something I stay ahead on as I would prefer not to go without it.  Amazon had the best price as always.</li>
            <li> As a long time user I can reccommend this product to anyone who wears dentures. It gives a very secure feeling.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased using the product.  I have used it for many years and with my new dentures it worked perfectly.  The dentist was amazed.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hope mfg continue produce this item.</li>
            <li> This is getting harder to find in stores. DH says he does not know why. It takes a small amount to keep his dentures in place and works wonderfully well to prevent sore gums. It aslo has no after taste and is firmer than most products of this type which prevents that squishy oozing.</li>
            <li> I do not buy this stuff for its grip, only for the cush😬 without it, i&#x27;d be in constant pain. Too bad the manufacturer has discontinued the product. Paying these prices is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is the only denture adhesive my grandmother uses.  Unfortunately many of the chain drug stores stopped carrying this but fortunately, I discovered they&#x27;re still available on Amazon.  Now my grandma&#x27;s very happy that she doesn&#x27;t have to resort to the \\&quot;other\\&quot; brands.</li>
            <li> If you have tried Poly-Grip, you have become a user of Poly-Grip. My mother was forced to try other products when the local store discontinued carrying Poly-Grip. These products made her gums so sore she had great difficulty wearing her dentures. One click to Amazon found her ole favorite, ordering was simple enough, delivery was fast and dentures are secure!</li>
            <li> Excellant product does exactly what it is supposed to do. Relines and holds in place my dentures in all aspects. Even to the point of eating corn on the cob. A-1 in my book.</li>
            <li> I have a crown on a back tooth that kept coming out due to a cracked tooth root and much of the supporting tooth gone.  The dentist cemented it back twice but it only lasted days.  I experimented with several loose crown repair kits and Cushion Grip is the only thing that works.  The product holds the crown in place enough for me to eat soft foods with that tooth and of course it looks better than a missing tooth space.  I replace the adhesive every four days as the directions suggest.  I do not heat the product as the directions say but it does take some experimentation with how much Cushion Grip to use and how to place it on the crown.  When placed in the mouth the Cushion Grip seems to mold itself around the adjoining teeth to provide support then it hardens somewhat.  I will eventually get an implant and new crown but at a cost of $3.000 vs. a tube of Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 tubes of this reading the reviews. Tried it and it will not hold anything at all. Used it 4 times and the last time, got very embarrassed. Don&#x27;t pay any attention to what the positive reveiws are. I will let you have 3 unopened tubes for free. DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this product by my dental technician and i found it not to be what I anticipated, it did not perform as I had expected. It also must have alot of alchohol in it but no where on the packaging does it give you an ingrediant. I would never recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Thank you.    Sorry for delay in response    Very much appreciate the speedy delivery &amp; quality of product</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have had dentures for MANY years. As my gums have changed with time, making my current dentures not fit as well, I used this product for a while until I made the step to get a re-line or new dentures -- maybe every 10 years or so. I had a full upper and partial lower. Never in that time was it necessary to wear any type of \\&quot;stick it in\\&quot; stuff. HOWEVER, it recently became necessary to have the rest of my lowers extracted and get a full lower. My dentist warned me that there is more of a problem keeping the lowers in. It has been a nightmare, with lots of adjusting, resulting in the lower being quite loose and no hope of keeping it in. I needed \\&quot;gobs\\&quot; of Fixodent and that didn&#x27;t really totally help. (And I need to wait at least 6 months to do a soft reline). Then I remembered the Cushion Grip. I got it out, used it and problem solved. Usually I apply it, put the denture in to \\&quot;fit\\&quot; it and leave it in the rest of the day with no problem. Then on following days I put a couple of very small \\&quot;dobs\\&quot; of the Fixodent on each side to make them absolutely \\&quot;stick\\&quot; in. They fit so tight I have to pry them out at night. As others have said, instructions say it lasts 4 days but I have had it hold up 2 weeks or more. Hot water aids in removing it, then go again. [Note: folks, be sure to choose the ZINC FREE versions when purchasing Denture Adhesives. Cases of Zinc Poisoning have been surfacing with use of the old products.]</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mom after our local well known discount store stopped stocking it.  Mom was in a panic, but I assured her I could probably find it online.  Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Sabrina T. Wilson</li>
            <li> I FINALLY GOT THE ORDER - ON THE FIRST RESPONSE I SAID IT HADN&#x27;T GOTTEN HERE YET  order # 103&#x3D;9130542-49671003 THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH</li>
            <li> Was so happy to find Cushion Grip could be ordered on line.   Used to always get it at Wal-Marts-and kind of panicked when no   more to be found-till found it online.  I am perfectly satisfied   except for my latest order and it looked like it had expired on June 2009-however am using and seems to be ok-probably is good   anyway for at least 6 months past expiration date. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Lost money, plain and simple. What this product basically do is become solid in the surface of the dentures in which it is applied. Very difficult to calculate or apply in such an even way to where it might be helpful. The whole ceremony of heating up the tube, applying, following all instructions did not seem to pay in the end. Difficult, tedious and not rewarding enough. I do realize that in the new world of dentures and denture users there if a fair amount of people out there with their own particular views. Myself, I bought this item to help my mother and her new dentures so they could fit better, therefore allowing her the possibility of conquering the initial trials denture wearers must endure. Previously I had bought the strips instead of the fixodent, and that was more money tossed away. From the \\&quot;die hard\\&quot; reviews pertaining this Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4) I truly believe this was going to be something exceptionally special and it is not. We had no problems heating the product so it can be dispensed and applying it but in the end it dried out and turned like an alien substance on top of everything else. I am getting a little weary of \\&quot;die hards\\&quot; that all they do is praise, praise, praise and always one to give others the benefit of the doubt, I still can not help but to ask myself: \\&quot;What exactly are they doing that I am not doing myself and why, supposedly, works so great for others but not for us?\\&quot;.  I would be more than glad to send what remains of this product to one of the happy customers that prompted me to purchase it in the first place. No, it is not that I am a dummy and have no understanding on how to read and follow instructions. I am actually pretty good at that. This product is not a miracle cure, that is for sure. Going back to conventional fixodent type product and hope for the best. Too much money spent in such a silly way. Now I love to find a \\&quot;die hard\\&quot; of this product and give them the 3 plus tubes. Removing the solution is another fun time on its own. 2 Stars for the wonderful Thermoplastic blah blah blah!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years. It is the best to hold bottom dentures in place without denture sores or oozing. But, I have had a hard time finding it in stores &amp; I am so glad that Amazon is supplying it to the customer.. Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> Have been using Cushion grip for 6 or 7 years.  It is the only way to go for denture wearers....doesn&#x27;t need to be applied several times a day (lasts 3-4 DAYS)-making it cheaper in the long run,hot drinks won&#x27;t dissolve it, and leaves no taste in your mouth.  May take a little practice to apply exact amount needed, but well worth the practice.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love Cushion Grip. It is a gum saver when you are in between new dentures.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, and a great find since it is so hard to locate in local stores.</li>
            <li> Bring this product BACK!!!!! Works if you can find s few tubes. I&#x27;d give it 7 of 5 stars they&#x27;d make it again to the same formula.</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for apx. 9-10 years and it&#x27;s the best I have used. I&#x27;ve used powders, strips, pastes, and pads over the years but this product fits and feels the best. When I had my original teeth removed the dentist had to grind a lot of my lower jaw bone so I don&#x27;t have that much of lower gum to fit into dentures very much. Without the gum, my lower plate would rub, scrap, and slide around causing pain and ulcers. This product makes a very good cushion that will mold onto my plate and well, it cushions. It cushions when I bite, it fits fine, and it is very easy to use. However I haven&#x27;t used it on my top plate, just the lower. I use it for the cushion effect, not for gripping. The store where I used to buy the product quit carrying it, then I found it on Amazon.com and ordered 8 tubes of it. It was easy to buy and was shipped to me quicker than I expected. Myself, I&#x27;m well pleased with the product for my use.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law introduced my husband &amp; myself to this product 5 yrs ago...WE love it. Although it is very hard to find in rural Neb. I am so pleased that I am able to order bulk quanity @ Amazon.com..Thank you for stocking this product. J</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dentist but was impossible to find on store shelves. Apparently it is very popular. It makes dentures very comfortable for 5-6 days without changing. I would not be without it as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works as promised.</li>
            <li> My mother uses Cushion Grip and cannot get it at any of the stores in her city. She said it is the best denture grip that she has ever used and cannot understand why the stores in her city are not carring it any longer.  She was nearly out of it before letting me know she needed me to order it. AmericaRX shipped the complete order quickly via regular shipping.  She received her new supply of Cushion Grip before she ran out. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Too expensive due to limited supply now that the manufacturer had discontinued production of the product.Very disappointing!&lt;br /&gt;Bob</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip for dentures is the greatest.  It holds better than anything I have ever tried.    Buying in on line was great too!  My order was delivered very quickly and it is so much easier that searching from store to store (not all stores carry this product). I would recommend this product to anyone who needs an adhesive for their dentures.</li>
            <li> Does not last very long and very expensive now.  The price has tripled over the year.. Takes practice to use it but seems ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra effort to use this product.With a little practice, and a few pointers from a veteran (like myself), one can easily appear, to others, not to be wearing dentures at all.The directions on this product indicate that it will last for, approximately, four full days.However, I have developed a method of using it that enables me to leave it (untouched) for weeks at a time if I choose to.Suffice it to say, I even sleep with them in, and brush them as I would my natural teeth.Using a mild toothpaste (with no pumice of course).Furthermore, I have no difficulty eating any foods that I choose, I.E. Steak, corn on the cob, sunflower seeds, beef jerky etc.etc...I sing out loud in the chior, and play one brass, and two woodwind instruments. I bite thread and twine, chew gum, and sometimes...my fingernails. People who don&#x27;t know me, do not know that I wear dentures unless I tell them.And I rarely have a reason to inform them of this fact.There was a time, many moons ago, when I was often selfconscious about my dentures.That feeling has, long since, passed.It passed around the same time I discovered \\&quot;Cushion Grip\\&quot;, and that&#x27;s no coincidence.  I have chosen to recieve e-mails from this site with individual comments, so feel free to let me know about any problems you might have concerning this fine product.The chances are good, that I have experienced the same obstacles, and subsequently surmounted them.Although I am busy running my own entirely unrelated business, and do not spend much time on line, I will be happy to offer any help that I can to personal messages.</li>
            <li> this product did provide a cushion for me but didn&#x27;t provide any kind of adhesive and when I tried to take it off of my dentures the first night wearing cushion grip it took two of us 45 minutes to get it off of my dentures. Certainly something I do not want to repeat for fear of ruining my dentures.</li>
            <li> I heard great reviews of this product and wanted my mom to try it. Unfortunately it did  not work for her. The seller was very promt in sending it and it arrived in very good conditon, so that is why I have rated the seller with 5 stars even tho the product did not work for my Mom.</li>
            <li> I bought the cushion grip denture liner from Amazon, and they were realy prompt in sending the order.   I will buy from Amazon again when i need to order something in the future.</li>
            <li> As a new denture wearer I&#x27;ve been very frustrated with the initial process. I&#x27;m only two months into it so I expect improvement. I have to say that this product has been the determining factor in achieving a measure of success in being able to wear the temporary dentures. Cushion Grip provided enough cushion that provided enough relief to wear the dentures all day. I look forward to permanent dentures and will be stocking up on Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> Glad to have access to a good item</li>
            <li> goodstuffitworkhelpwhenyouaresenitif</li>
            <li> Although this is listed as an \\&quot;adhesive\\&quot;, after using it for a few days I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an accurate description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a temporary denture relining material. It&#x27;s not very sticky at all. When you squeeze it from the tube you&#x27;ll find that what you have a is a very malleable rubber like substance. You can shape it and work with it very easily. Once you bite down on it, it \\&quot;re molds\\&quot; to your gums and denture, performing the seal that your dentures should have formed if they fit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(While I do realize the documentation says that you shouldn&#x27;t use it on dentures that don&#x27;t fit properly - all documentation says that - if they fit properly, you wouldn&#x27;t need this (or any other) denture adhesive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once this product \\&quot;sets up\\&quot;, it goes from being a transparent rubber like substance to a more opaque light orange rubber like plastic. It&#x27;s actually very effective and very durable (seems to last 3-4 days). You can use products like [[ASIN:B001FWXSAG Fixodent Denture Adhesive Cream Plus Scope, Adhesive With Control Tip, 2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)]] on top of it to make a very strong seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good way to temporarily keep a badly fitting denture going until you can make the time to have a new one made or to have them relined.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff made for denture wearers.  It stays soft and conforms perfectly to your gums. I over fill mine and then trim off the excess after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not good at all I like to return them.&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know how to return I test the first on there are 3 untouch</li>
            <li> I love the product and delivery was very fast. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I found this product the best of the many that I&#x27;ve tried. I imagine it&#x27;s the next best thing to having my dentures relined. It&#x27;s easy to apply but not so easy to remove. See more below. Experience taught me to use sparingly. Using too much will make the product seep out from under dentures when biting down hard... messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a surprising negative. This product works so well, I&#x27;ve put off seeing my dentist too long. In the process, my dentures have worn improperly. My jawline has shifted and my bite no longer aligns properly. Lesson learned: Use as a short-term fix. Visit the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the cushion can be a task, especially where my dentures have deep grooves. The given instructions are good but I also discovered isopropyl alcohol (90%) helps soften &amp; disolve this product - a major help when cleaning dentures AFTER the bulk of the rubbery cushion is removed. I also found an inexpensive pair of small needle-nose pliers helps enormously. Sounds harsh, but it works. Cold water hardens the material making it easier to extract &amp; manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is this product is superior to pastes and goo. It can make ill-fitting dentures manageable but brings on different problems in cleaning and long-term effects.</li>
            <li> works just fine for me</li>
            <li> Mom is so happy we were able to find it on the Internet. Couldn&#x27;t eat without it! Arrived quickly, thanks,Carol</li>
            <li> If you have dentures that are loose, this is the product for you. I love it. Works great. The name says it all.</li>
            <li> Very good experience arrived sooner than expected</li>
            <li> While it takes a little effort to change it, this product lasts for days.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Great, my wife uses this product for years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Used it for years for dentures.  Suddenly, it has become hard to find in my location.  Walmart carried it for years. Now they do not. One family-owned drugstore in town occasionally has it with an outrageous high price.  Much better prices on Amazon and great shipping services.  When I run out, I&#x27;ll re-order more from you as I have in the past. thanks for having my item at a reasonable price and affordable shipping costs.</li>
            <li> The best glue yet! besure to follow the directions completly and one app will last a week,no mess in your mouth no trouble to clean out one tube lasts longer than a case of that gooy stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product with good hold; however, the tube contents only allows for approximately 4 applications which could be costly if you reapply every 4 days.</li>
            <li> This adhesive is the best we have found. Tried powders, creams, etc. This stuff is the greatest by far. Easy to use if directions are followed, and use HOT water. I have had times the cushion lasted 7 days. I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE CUSHION GRIP. IT WORKS GREAT FOR ME.  I USED TO USE IT UNTIL WALMART TOOK IT OFF THE SHELF.  THEN I HAD TO USE THE POWDER.  THE POWDER DON&#x27;T COME OFF REALLY GOOD.  THE WAY YOU TAKE THE CUSHION GRIP OFF IS SOAK THE DENTURE IN HOT WATER IN A CUP FOR 10 MINUTES AND THEN IT WILL COME OFF FAST.</li>
            <li> This stuff advertises as an \\&quot;adhesive\\&quot;.  How the company gets away with that I&#x27;ll never know. This is basically a temporary liner to help get the suction needed to hold your dentures in place.  It has almost ZERO adhesive properties to your gums. It sticks very well to the dentures.  The mess that it makes on them is a nightmare to clean up.  If you want something to really glue your dentures into place for 4 days, this isn&#x27;t the product.  Thank God I used an old pair of dentures to test it out on.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have used this for several years. I do have a problem with the way the package was shipped. 2 of the tubes were mashed and useless. The package was crushed and therefor the product got damaged. I don&#x27;t think I will order this way again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years..  Each applicacion lasts about a week and it&#x27;s the only product of it&#x27;s kind that I&#x27;ve been comfortable with.</li>
            <li> I Love Cushion Grip. It&#x27;s the best thing for my Gums; feels so good that I sleep in my dentures all the time.  If it wasn&#x27;t for this product, I don&#x27;t know what I would do.  When the store (Walmart) stop selling it I was at a lost until I found it here on Amazon.com. Thanks a million times over Amazon.com!    PS: There aren&#x27;t any cons to this product just pros.</li>
            <li> Hello All, I need help. I bought cushion grip for my mom and we tried to follow the package instruction as well as the instructions in one of the reviews here, but no luck. When my mom tried to leave the denture overnight for the adhesive to dry and then put it in, it would not hold in place at all. When we tried the package instruction the denture got loose after about an hour. Is my mom supposed to use additional denture glue (like pollygrip or such)? If the adhesive dries, how does it \\&quot;stick\\&quot; in your mouth?  Thank you for any comments on my issue.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this product to stick in my mouth! It feels great and prevents any rubbing but I have tried and tried and just can&#x27;t get it to keep my dentures in my mouth. It is very easy to clean off and if it would give me some kind of seal then I would recommend it highly. But I have already gone through a whole tube and nothing I tried worked.</li>
            <li> Alert to all of the masses that have dentures, etc. This product is awesome. Two weeks ago, I received my very first set of temporary dentures. One full upper and one partial lower. I knew that my gums would be sore for several days because they were used to having teeth in them but my teeth were already sensitive and started to become brittle. I mean, brittle. I chip a tooth into two small pieces when I ate a piece of soft bread. Can you beat that one?. Anyway, I have tried all kinds of cushions, adhesives, etc but they left a lot of goo in my mouth and that is not easy to get out without touching your already sore gums. I went on line to research a better cushion product meanly because as my gums shrink, I would need something that I could apply myself and not go back to the dentist and pay more for adjustments. I had a free adjustment contract for 60 days only. I will have my dentures for the rest of my life. Not a good contract, I must say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Cushion Grip at Amazon and read all 90 some reviews. That made up my mind. I ordered a set of 4 and will be getting them soon. But, in the meantime, I had to go to a local CVS pharm here in Harrisburg to get some more of the goo stuff and low and behold, right beside that was the last 4 tubes of Cushion Grip. Man, oh man.&lt;br /&gt;I bought all 4 and then told the sales clerk that this stuff is incredibly difficult to find in a store. She said in that case, she is going to order about 12 more tubes just for her store. I thanked her endlessly for that favor. That is great customer service, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, I read the instructions and went thru the motions so I could do it right and not have to remove the product, etc. I clean my dentures and rinsed them off and dry them with a paper towel. I heated up the tube like it said in the instructions and applied it, etc. After they set in my mouth for 5 minutes, I took them out and let them air dry. I just had to re-press some areas because gravitywill allow the cushion to fall back onto itself but no matter. I just added some small balls of it on top of what I already have applied and pressed them together so they would not separate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of that, I only had to trim off minimal excess of it. I applied some Anbesol of my sore gums and reinserted my dentures. I could not believe the instant comfort and strenght of it. I did not even need to apply any of that goo stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Thanks for having in stock too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my husband. It takes a little getting use to but the results are excellent.  Will not go back to the gummy, messy alternatives.</li>
            <li> Makes my dentures so comfy I get spoiled.  Make sure you don&#x27;t \\&quot;overheat\\&quot; the Cushion Grip at first or it will be gooey. Wash hands, dry them and then roll the Cushion Grip into a pencil shape, then lightly press into \\&quot;groove\\&quot; of appliance. I have found that using a blow dryer when the Cushion Grip is \\&quot;setting up\\&quot; helps the Cushion Grip adhere to the dentures better. Only issue is that the Cushion Grip looses it&#x27;s adhesiveness and squishes out eventually. I know it says only for a few weeks usage, blah blah blah, but mine lasts for much longer. Don&#x27;t know if that is the product or what I clean them with (soap &amp; water, once a week I soak in a denture tablet to remove stains.) Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  No mess.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I can use in my dentures,have used it for many years.Used to be able to by it in our drug store but have not been able to find it for awhile till now.I have tried everything on the market &amp; nothing worked.So happy I found Cushion Grip again.</li>
            <li> I can eat again!  Outstanding product, which allows user to eat all foods. Follow the instructions, then add a little of your preferred adhesive. It will feel like you have your original teeth  back. Removing is a little work, but results are amazing. Thank you, Cushion Grip</li>
            <li> I reviewed this long ago. First, you can hardly find it; second, it&#x27;s no good anyway, so no need to find it. Yeah, it feels good on the gums, but alas it doesn&#x27;t hold dentures in place since there&#x27;s no \\&quot;stick.\\&quot; I found it totally useless and it melts if your food is too hot. Get Secure, which actually works more or less. It works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.</li>
            <li> this was a very good transaction. nothing negative. to report. ive been trying to find this for a while..good deal</li>
            <li> Love it...don&#x27;t want to do without it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> cushion grip does the job real good. will buy it again. Used to buy it at Walmarts they didn&#x27;t seem to have it the last time we went to purchase it.</li>
            <li> it has been discontinued, and I panicked.  I wrote to merck directly and gave them a small piece of my mind.  I ordered 300 tubes on e-bay</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well. But, not as well as advertised. Not easily removed from denture. It is only functional as a re-liner, not an adhesive. I will say that it is the only thing on the market worth using.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Keeps the teeth in and comfortable.  Says that it will last 4 days but actually will stay in 4 weeks - even with soaking 1-2 times/day. Getting it out at replacement time takes a lot of patience but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for providing this product.  We have been having a hard time locating it in local pharmacies.  It seems to be the only product that does the job in keeping my husband&#x27;s dentures secure without all the oozing that the other brands seem to cause.</li>
            <li> While this product does form a nice cushion for your gums, it does not actually seal the denture to your gums. It is difficult to work with, never actually becoming anything then a difficulty worked semi plastic, even after extended periods in very hot water.</li>
            <li> THe product came to my home in record time. I would not hesitate to purchse  from this merchant again.  Joe from Allentown PA</li>
            <li> I got on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try lots of denture adhesive. This is best one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comfort, strong hold...it is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> Extremely Pricy.  But when a product is discontinued, what is one to do if there is no substitute.  I call the manufacture&#x27;s marketing Dept.  and expressed my thoughts on a &amp;#34;Dumb Move&amp;#34; on their part, especially when they held the lions share of the market.</li>
            <li> This is great product. I have used this product for over 35 years and have never found anything that comes close to its equal. It is not messy to use like other products and lasts several days. I don&#x27;t know what I Would do if I could no longer purchace this  product.</li>
            <li> i love this product..... i cant find it in the  stores anywhere and i had  overheard a denture wearer  rave about this item so i  gave it a try and its the best ever....i hightly recommend it to denture wearers......</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for at least 12 years to keep rub areas from staying sore.    When I line my dentures with Cushion Grip it usually last 3-4 days.  I have dentures that fit wonderfully well but occasionally I will have a tomato see or pop corn husk that will cause a hurt.  This will really help protect the area.  I always use too much and have a curved pair of manicure sissors that I keep just for trimming the excess.    For some reason I cannot find this product in the area where I live and was delighted to find it on Amazon.  I can&#x27;t imagine not having it on hand.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for a friend and they say its great. They use it for dentures.</li>
            <li> my wife loves the stuff</li>
            <li> They shipped it to my street address my USPS they dont&#x27;n deliever to it only to my PO Box .. American Wholesale said they would reship it. I have not recieved it. It was orignally ship on May 27 2010 Richard</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my mom all the time. It is the only denture adhesive that works for her as she has lost most of her bone due to a illness plus it is a really good deal. Her only issue is getting it off the dentures when she cleans them</li>
            <li> Would be nice if this stuff was still being made.  Of course, like most things that actually work, they quit making it.  Just wish I had bought more when I had the chance.</li>
            <li> I recently had my teeth removed(bad teeth abcesses, broken, discolored), so I went with the denture route. I&#x27;ve only had my teeth missing for about a week so my gums are still kind of tender, and the temporary dentures I have are less than perfect.      With this product I dont have to worry about scraping the roof of my mouth trying to get the adhesive off, since I really cant put creams near the gaping holes where my teeth used to be. Its hard enough to try to get adhesive off the roof omy mouth cant imagine how bad it would be if got into a socket.    The only real problem I have with this product, is not the product itself, but more trying to get the stuff out of the tube. Might want to try getting one of those key things you use to get toothpaste out of tubes, that helps a lot. Once you can get it out of the tube then your golden, put it where you need it, set dentures in, and wait like 1-2 minutes.    The Cushsion Grip is great because is molds well and you can take your dentures out if need be, and place them back in with no problems.    Like other reviewers on this product, finding it at your local store might be a problem, but with the interent, as long as you have money you can get just about anything.</li>
            <li> The Product sent was retail store Quality, Cheapest Price on the internet at the time I ordered it &amp; was delivered Very Quickly.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not receive this product.  BP  e-mailed that they would send another order out, but have not received.  I have used this product for years, and it is the greatest.  I would like to get the package I ordered  early  February.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 2003. I like the comfort it gives me. I am not happy that it&#x27;s no longer available through Walmart. I am however pleased I can still purchase it through you at Amazon. I don&#x27;t mind waiting for it to arrive in the mail. I will continue to purchase it through you as long as you carry it. I normally buy the four pack and when I get down to the last tube I reorder it through you. Thank you for having it available to me.</li>
            <li> if your dentures are not fitting properly this product will help you until you can get into the dentist to get a permanant fix. You can use it with denture adhisive if needed</li>
            <li> I have dentures and this product is excellent for making them fit better , i would recommend this product for any one who  has dentures .</li>
            <li> This is the best centure adhesive I&#x27;ve tried.  It desn&#x27;t stick on my palate and holds the denture firmly and comfortably for more than 4 days.    I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Do not spend your money on this product, I was so embarrassed and dissapointed with this product. Cushion Grip   The concept sounded so good and so reassuring. It was the complete opposite.  Once this tacky hard to get out of container gooo hardens it does NOTHING!!!  I now have a way different view on who the heck makes these stars review.  This product is a minus 1 star and I am bringing it back in disgust. Oh by the way I have brand new dentures.... Bad Bad Bad ....</li>
            <li> As always, this product helps with denture looseness. However, the last time I purchased it was $6 a tube....not $20.....what happened?</li>
            <li> it works---puts little gel pillows and pads where you need them---soft not hard--does not dissolve like creams and leave you w/ nothing does not slip around like paper liners ----IT MOLDS TO THE SHAPE OF YOUR MOUTH AND YOUR DENTAL APPLIANCE any of them--so each is one of a kind custom made----and is unbelievably easy to use</li>
            <li> Not the greatest. Only the greatest pain to remove off of the denture. I will stick with Polydent or Fixodent.</li>
            <li> It is a fix for change of weight loss effect on dentures, no visit to dentist for a six month fix. It is a deffinite must have for me.&lt;br /&gt;For sensitive gums a blessing, sort of a shock absorber. It is a quick fix.</li>
            <li> I guess I won&#x27;t be buying anymore.  The price has gone thru the roof!  Not for folks like me ever again.</li>
            <li> I have tried every denture adhesive out there and this is the best. It is all they say it is. It does not take much to keep your dentures in place all day. When you first get it the diagram tells you how to use and lets you know there is no taste and if your mouth is sensitive it may feel a little warm at first. I do have a sesitive mouth but the warm feeling lasts all of 30 seconds. Also I have some issues with the way mine fit as they are my tempory plates so some of the things I would have gone back to the dentist was cleared up with the right adesive. And you will have no problem taking your teeth out to clean. It once again reminds me that amazon does their customer a great service by haveing the reviews to help when buying an unknown product.  thank you  kb</li>
            <li> A friend of ours recommended this for my husband&#x27;s dentures.  We can not afford a reline at this time.  The only store was a CVS in a town we seldom shop in, then it is not always in stock.  The price was over $2.50 a tube more than Amazon.  So buying 4 @ a time here makes sense.  As for the product he is satisfied with it.  On his top denture it has lasted almost 2 months, on the bottom a week. He didn&#x27;t want to go with the permanent reline kits because of the possible toxic ingredients.  Your gums absorb, that&#x27;s why drug users rub their drugs on their gums.  I use it for a different reason.  I wear hearing aids and recently lost 50 lbs. So the aids are to small and one whistles, because of this.  It would cost a lot of money to have it re sized.  I took it to my audiologist who put some Cushion Grip on it and placed it back in my ear.  After a week from body heat it whistled again. So instead of driving back and forth I am using the cushion grip to re size the hearing aid myself.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product hard to find . I am so glad you have it and shipped fast thanks patty[[ASIN[[ASIN:B001EJOPQG Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]:B001EJOPQG]</li>
            <li> My Dad said thank you for keeping this product on the market. The product is good quality. The product discribed was as indicated in the remarks. I will buy from this seller again in the future. Thanks A Million.</li>
            <li> Long story short: Went to Costa Rica 6 weeks ago and had 26 teeth extracted and immediate dentures fitted.  It&#x27;s now 6 weeks out and the swelling has gone down and the dentures just won&#x27;t stay put no matter how much adhesive I use.  I have to wait 5 more months before I can return to Costa Rica to get the permenant dentures made, so I was desperate for a temporary fix when I tried Cushion Grip.  It didn&#x27;t work for me as an adhesive, but it&#x27;s worked absolute wonders as a temporary reline.  Now I only need to use a tiny bit of adhesive (I use Fixodent Control)and I can now eat just about anything, in fact I&#x27;m going to try steak tonight!    It has also helped with the &#x27;sunken&#x27; look that I&#x27;ve had around my lips and cheeks.  The thickness of the reline makes the teeth sit higher and further ahead in my mouth.  I&#x27;m not sure how long each application will last (it says 4 days) but I&#x27;ll gladly do it twice a week if I continue to get the same results!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> The best adhesive I ever used for loose fitting dentures .  there is no ooze like regular paste and no taste.  It last ten times longer that other products  I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is the best denture adhesive on the market.  I will never change to another.</li>
            <li> it took a couple of trials before I learned how to apply the get for best comfort, but it sure beats the powder and gooey mess I have had with other products.</li>
            <li> I  HAVE  BEEN  USING  THIS  FOR  YRS...I TRIED OTHER  THINGS  WHEN  I  FIRST  GOT  MY  DENTURES...SO  ONE  DAY  IN THE  DRUG STORE  I  SEEN THIS  AND  READ  IT  AND  BOUGHT  IT  AND  TRIED  IT...I  COULD  NOT  BELIEVE  HOW  WELL  MY  DENTURES  FELT  ON  MY  GUMS  ...SO  MUCH  EASIER  TO  EAT  WTH  CUSHION  GRIP......LOVE  IT  AND  A  LIFETIME  USER...THANK  YOU  FOR  THIS  PRODUCT...ELLEN RECTOR</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS,  i USED TO PAY $6.00 FOR A TUBE  DON&#x27;T KNOW WHY IT IS NOW $24.00&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS FOR  LOWER PARTIALS</li>
            <li> very satisfied with price, product and follow up and would never hesitate in ordering another product. I appreciated the product being left in the mail box because we told them that we&#x27;re not home a lot and it turned out very good in receiving my goods. Thanks again for the speedy delivery. It came in without any hickups and is working perfect. Thanks again, Craig Smalley, a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> been using it for years...hope it will be availeable in the future only a little less expensive...</li>
            <li> So sad the manufacturer has stopped production of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a crying shame! The product works well but I refuse to pay over $80 a tube! Disgraceful, and shame on all involved in this price gauge!</li>
            <li> This is the best denture cushion product I have come across.  This can fill in the gaps that the dentist couldn&#x27;t even fix and it holds for 4 or more days before needing to be replaced.  This may not be a permanent fix, but it is a life saver for short-term corrections.</li>
            <li> I lost part of my lower teeth due to an auto accident, tried implants but the posts failed, I received my partial denture two weeks ago and have been hurting non stop even with adjustments by my dentist.  This stuff might have a stronger pucker factor when you set it up, but the benifits far out weigh the inconvience.  I am actually pain free.  Thank you so much for those of you who suggested this product, It has been a wonderful, wonderful product to use.</li>
            <li> I watched the raving YouTube reviews about this stuff and immediately went down to my pharmacy and bought a tube to try out. Followed the instructions, put in my bottom teeth and the stuff worked perfectly. Less than 5 minutes later I then ordered the 4 tube pack from Amazon. Then, less than 2 hours later my bottoms fell out. Plain and simple, just fell out. Redid them over and over 6 or 8 times and still the same results. This stuff does not work as described. No way 4 days. Not possible. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m gonna do with the other 3 tubes. Probably eventually going to throw them away or use for sticking paper to the wall. Very disappointing. Luckily for me it was very easy to remove from the dentures. It just peals right out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  WORKS WONDERS &amp; SAVES HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. SAFE, DOESN&#x27;T FEEL LIKE SLIME &amp; EASILY USED.</li>
            <li> Cushion grip adhesive is an excellent product. I have not found an adhesive that works as well as it does without any oozing or mess. It is quick to use and very easy to apply.[[ASIN:B001EJOPQG Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]. It is the best in my opinion. And I think it is great that Amazon.com carries it. The availability and the ease in which they made the purchase was great.</li>
            <li> This is the best product on the market for false teeth... You can use it for a day or in our case about a week... We put a little on and push it down with the end of our toothbrush... From day to day you can run your teeth under hot water and then move the wax around with the end of your toothbrush again... We use scissors to cut off any overlapping pieces... It is easier to buy it by the case and have it on hand for whenever you need it...</li>
            <li> I cannot get the Cosion Grip to work for me. It does not adhere to my dentures and immediately comes loose. Followed instructions carefolly.</li>
            <li> I love Cushion Grip Thermoplastic...&lt;br /&gt;sad we c an no long buy it... 😢</li>
            <li> did what is meant to do</li>
            <li> Sometimes the drug stores have it and other times they don&#x27;t. I can aways depend on Amazon to have it. GOOD JOB!. Thank you!.  PJP.</li>
            <li> For those of you with dentures that never seem to fit right or have gums that are never stay happy long, this stuff helps a LOT. Used some powered mix I used to could get from Walmart, here in TX but they all seemed to stop carrying it about 5yrs ago. Found this in a Walgreens or CVC I think, and been buying in bulk from amazon since. No nasty lingering taste. Basically the best way to do it is to set the tube in a sink, run hot water over it for about 4 mins, dry it off and make sure your fingers are very dry, then smooth it around in dentures and place in mouth. Be sure that your bite is natural or where u want it and press them in firmly. I think the box says like 3 days. I leave mine in for weeks. Eventually, it gets too hard for comfort, for me and I remove and replace. Removal can be a bit tedious, as this stuff sticks really well sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years  and find it absolutely essential. It keeps  my dentures comfortable for several days  with each application. LOVE IT!  It is, however, hard to find. As usual,  Amazon comes thru!!</li>
            <li> My grandmother absolutely loves this product and I find it appalling that people would jack the price of a five dollar tube of denture cream to almost 300 dollars.  How sad to take advantage of the elderly population.  My grandmother is 93 and lives on a fixed income.  She was so upset when she learned that this item had been discontinued.  I would love to surprise her with a couple of tubes, and I have looked everywhere, but apparently this stuff is liquid gold since it is priced as such.  The five stars is for the product only.  If I had to grade Amazon on its ethical practices I would give it zero stars.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Price is way to high.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the most helpful reviews of folks that use this product,and offered great tips,I decided to try this product. Getting it in the denture with practice I&#x27;m sure will take more than one tube.So if your ordering,you may want to order 2 tubes. As one tube basically will be your test tube for getting the right amount.Alot will be wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think IF I were to continue using (which I will not) getting the product into a thin rope like appearance will do better than the small \\&quot;pea\\&quot; size would be easier for beginners. That way you can lay the product into the denture. Putting the denture in your mouth quickly before it cools,is imperative,or you will not get a good fit. So get your stuff together before you start.&lt;br /&gt;There is no nasty taste, thats a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Now the problems I had:&lt;br /&gt;I used it on both upper &amp; lower, what I found was my dentures did not sit secure, and I looked noticeably different with this in my dentures. The dentures just did not seat correctly, and I even talked differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the product was the deal breaker for me. I followed one of the most well written reviews on this product, and did just as she wrote. The heating of the denture is imperative, and keeping the denture hot enough to remove the product, I had to keep plunging my denture into a bowl of heated water I had put in microwave.&lt;br /&gt;You may think after reading this review that \\&quot;maybe she put to much into the denture\\&quot;.. I assure you if anything I did not have enough in the denture, as a matter of fact I applied only to the areas on the denture that the one review suggested, as the product does spread out. So I had to painstakingly use tweezers to remove little by little out of the denture. It was just way to much issue for me.&lt;br /&gt; It took me 20 minutes or better just for one denture. It DOES not come out in one piece. As I said following the heating of the water, and letting the denture sit long enough, still did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Ialso found that it WILL ruin your reline of your denture, as it will pull up and make your reline almost pitted. And this is the issue, as an ill fitting denture is no fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;PRO\\&quot; to the product is,if need be you can just pop your denture in quickly, and if you plan on NOT eating the denture will somewhat stay put. But getting the right amount in the denture to create a snug fit is hit &amp; miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you are planning on eating diner,or going out for the evening,I suggest still an adhesive. I only use \\&quot;Secure\\&quot; fixative, which I purchase here on Amazon. I will not ever use over the counter fixative ever. Secure fixative totally rocks!&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps,as I said I tried it,thought it would really make a difference after reading the good reviews. But for me it was just to much time involved,and a poor experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck~</li>
            <li> My husband is a TRUE skeptic and has a difficult time trying &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; products.  The instructions are a little intimidating as there is a process involved in getting the application of Cushion Grip right, but if you follow the instructions - warm the tube beforehand, you will have no problems - it takes a little time learning the right and wrong way to apply but... once you have it down you won&#x27;t use anything else!  If someone gave it a poor review, it&#x27;s probably because they didn&#x27;t take the time to read and follow the instructions correctly.  He applies a little bit of PoliGrip for extra hold - just on the lowers.  He is SO happy he tried CUSHION GRIP and will be a forever user, this coming from someone who believes &amp;#34;It&#x27;s too good to be true!&amp;#34;, this stuff really is.  Amazon had the best price - get it in the 4 pack and PRIME - of course FREE SHIPPING!  This is an AMAZING product and is worth writing a review about for anyone needing help with denture adhesive, especially for the lower plate that doesn&#x27;t quite fit so well.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did not give up on Cushion Grip. The first time I tried it I was not happy and tried to take it right back out of my plate. It was still gooey and I thought it would never come out. I gave it a second and third try and by then had worked the bugs out, now I couldn&#x27;t get along without it. Clean and dry your plate. Warm your tube. Put a rolled \\&quot;worm&#x27; in the channel.Wait five minutes bite firmly. I leave my plate in all night. Don&#x27;t fuss or tug it back out, don&#x27;t eat either, just let the plastic\\&quot;set up\\&quot;. Presto. Good to go for 4-8 days. Those who have trouble getting it out are not waiting until it is cured. When it has set it will peel out easily. I use it as a custom temp lining, I still use just a dab of paste. But with Cushion Grip I cut down my adhesive use by 75% and have a much better hold. Many have complained about using alot of the tube when they first get it. Just plan on your first tube as your training tube. Hey it takes a while to get the hang of eyeliner and masscara too, but we don&#x27;t give up. Give youself some time with the product. It will bew WELL worth your time.</li>
            <li> Not as good of an adhesive as I was led to believe but when combined with poly grip or fixodent the hold is amazing</li>
            <li> Yeah - I said it!  This is a great product and I wish I had known about it years ago!  I hesitated at first to try this out because I had never heard of it, but after reading the reviews, I thought I would give it a try - and I&#x27;m telling you - the best decision I have made since I decided to go with dentures.  The manufacturer says that this product will last you about four days per application, but I&#x27;m finding that it lasts me about 8 to 10 days.  I have applied this product to my dentures without heating the tube first, and also after heating and I highly recommend that you heat the tube.  Makes applying the product to your dentures much easier, and I seem to get a much better fit to my gums this way as well.  If you&#x27;re considering this product for the first time - you will not regret it.  I went with the \\&quot;Pack of 4\\&quot; just to save a little money.  With the price of gas these days - EVERY PENNY COUNTS - and you will save even more since you actually don&#x27;t have to use any adhesive.  Now, I do use Polygrip with this product, but only because I talk a lot on the job and having the Polygrip just helps me ensure that the dentures are going to stay in my mouth.  I only use Polygrip on my bottom dentures - this product holds the top dentures SOLID.  I should also mention that when I do use Polygrip with this product, I only use a tiny drop on the back corners and one drop in the front center - each drop about the size of a BB.  Overall - a great product!  I usually don&#x27;t write product reviews, but this product is so good that I just had to make an exception.  Give it a try - you won&#x27;t regret it (but your moma might)!  ***SMILE***</li>
            <li> I had a full mouth teeth removal (24 teeth and broken roots removed) about four months ago and immediate upper and lower dentures made in the same day. Although I was told to start wearing them immediately, and sleep with them in if possible, there was no way it was going to happen. My gums were too sore and I was on soft foods like mashed potatoes, ice cream, etc. long enough to affect my health. I soon developed Stage-2 diabetes. I have since corrected it with protean and no potato or white-flour products. A Stage-1 diabetic friend told me about the unique properties of Agave nectar and I will never buy another bag of sugar. I also stay away from processed foods, especially those containing corn syrup or white refined flour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never knew gums could become \\&quot;calloused\\&quot; until I read it on the net. After mine healed and became calloused I could eat about 60% of the foods I used to eat, but still couldn&#x27;t do steaks, corn chips, etc. I decided that for cosmetic reasons and to see if I could return to eating some of my favorite foods again I decided to try Cushion Grip. I first read the many reviews, good and bad, then went for it. Here&#x27;s what I discovered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it isn&#x27;t an adhesive, per se, but it does help keep dentures in place by improving the precision of fit, and therefore, both suction and comfort. It might be considered a temporary soft re-liner you can re-do over and over again yourself every few days or weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heated goo that squeezes out of the tube has about the consistency of soft bubble gum, a partially chewed gummy-bear, or putty. I couldn&#x27;t use the key on the tube bottom until I had squeezed some out with my fingers so the tube bottom could fold a bit. The goo must be applied immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed another reviewer&#x27;s advice and did both uppers and lowers at the same time. I didn&#x27;t heat the dentures but probably should have. Don&#x27;t heat the dentures with hot water because they must be perfectly dry for thegoo to stick. Next time I intend to use a hair dryer set on medium-hot, not super hot or you run the risk of damaging the acrylic and ruin your denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have a short working window as the stuff starts to cure in the denture, so get everything set up for quick access before you start. Take the phone off the hook and throw the cat into the other room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heated the tube by immersing in a sink of really hot water for a few minutes, then removed the cap and used it immediately. This isn&#x27;t rocket science and precision isn&#x27;t necessary. Smear some goo thinly in both denture troughs and maybe some at the top of the uppers. Let them \\&quot;cure\\&quot; for five minutes. Put them both in and bite down as you would when your mouth was closed when you had your natural teeth, firmly, but not excessively, hold it for about ten minutes, and you&#x27;re done. I noticed the ever-so-slight tingling others have mentioned, as the goo cured, but it was in no way annoying. I didn&#x27;t have to do any trimming of excess. All-in-all my dentures now fit and feel really good. Almost like it was when I had real teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this with five stars because it is very good for what it does. I forgot to mention that I had already applied a soft reline some time back, and this went over that OK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some people this might be sufficient with no adhesive. I will have to apply adhesive if I expect to do some serious chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if something else develops&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** UPDATE ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff takes some practice to get it right. When its done wrong it&#x27;s a total failure, but when done correctly it&#x27;s a miracle and the next best thing to having your real teeth. I&#x27;d have to rate my first attempt as a success. The only problem was that it was applied on top of my reliner, which  was also my first attempt at relining. I didn&#x27;t know the proper way to bite so that the uppers were snug against the front of my gums, resulting in too much relining material atthe front and my upper lip protruding slightly too far, causing the front of my upper lip to protrude slightly too much from what I remember as my normal appearance. We&#x27;re only talking fractions of an inch, but these small differences are what distinguishe one person&#x27;s face from another. Being a portrait artist I strive for as much perfection as possible. So I&#x27;d have to rate the 1st application of Cushion Grip a success. The dentures fit perfectly, were comfortable, and actually had to be  removed with difficulty. I was able to eat fried chicken for the first time since losing my teeth and it tasted wonderful. The only functional problem was that Cushion Grip added on top of the reliner material made my mouth feel so full there wasn&#x27;t much room left for the food that had to be chewed to be shifted around for better positioning during chewing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to remove both the Cushion Grip and the reliner and go with just the Cushion Grip. Cushion Grip actually IS a reliner of sorts, and as it was being removed looked, felt, and acted just like the reliner, with the same appearance and structural consistency. In my opinion Cushion Grip can take the place of a reliner at far less expense once you learn how to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having removed both the reliner and the cushion grip, I set about the 2nd application of  Cushion Grip, but this time applied it directly to the surface of the denture acrylic. This 2nd attempt was a total failure, and I can see why some people rate it with only one star. The fault was mine. For one thing I hadn&#x27;t heated the goop sufficiently to make it more pliable and stickey, hadn&#x27;t applied enough in the right places, and probably hadn&#x27;t pre-cleaned and dried the dentures properly. I was overconfident, in too big of a hurry, and was too sloppy. After church today I intend to remove the 2nd application and go for the 3rd. I&#x27;m learning. Think of your reliner as the mattress on your denture box springs, and Cushion Grip as the final toppadding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing the Denture Cream i can see why some people might leave it in for a month or two as a reliner. I removed it easily by working one small area loose and methodically peeling the rest of it away dry. A really simple and straightforward task requiring no more than five minutes. One last thing; after you have applied it and let it cure, use manicure cuticle scissors to trim the excess Denture Cream overflow off the acrylic. Keep the trimmed edges as smooth as possible so as not to irritate your gums with rough edges. A sharp knife is also good but it isn&#x27;t enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is really good, but only if used correctly. I learned that I must get the tube hot as hell before squeezing out the goop and applying it. Smear it into the perfectly dry and clean denture troughs and let it sit for five minutes to \\&quot;cure\\&quot; before putting the dentures in your mouth. Do both the uppers and lowers at the same time and hold a normal moderately-firm bite for at least ten minutes. It will sting slightly due to its chemistry, After removing them trim the exess overflow with manicure scissors. There is definitely a learning curve so don&#x27;t get discouraged if the first couple of times are failures. You&#x27;ll eventually get it down to a science and will be able to chew at about 90% efficiency or better. Things like corn chips and fried chicken will be a breeze. The only food you&#x27;re likely to have trouble with is biting tough steak with your front teeth. You&#x27;ll still probably have to use a denture bonding agent because Denture Cream works by improving fit for better suction and comfort, Some say it works so well they no longer have to use a bonding agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing i have found for my dentures it is by far the best thing i have found for my problem dentures i will defiantly order more thsnks alot</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work that well, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything better</li>
            <li> The only product that I ever used, that says what it does to hold your dentures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60-year-old semi-professional singer. For years I had battled with the insecure feeling of dentures that seemed to be wobbly, and I was using globs of Poligrip. No longer! Cushion Grip has been a lifesaver. This stuff really works! The trick (I have learned) is to get a good impression, and then leave your dentures out in the air for as long as possible. This will cure the plastic and the liner will last much longer. Then, pop in your dentures with a bit of Poligrip and you&#x27;re good to go. When they loosen up as the Poligrip degrades, remove and rinse with COLD water. This will let you scrub away the Poligrip without destroying the liner. Also, when the Cushion Grip seeps over the top edges of your denture, do not trim it away. If possible, leave it in place. This will make the seal - and the Cushion Grip liner - stay in place longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tips: 1 - I&#x27;ve found that I get much better adhesion when I first gently clean the inside surface of the denture (upper) with mild bleach, such as household Clorox dabbed on a paper towel. Rinse thoroughly and dry. If you can smell the bleach, rinse and dry it again! Then apply Cushion Grip according to directions. For some reason - maybe because of the disinfectant properties of bleach - the Cushion Grip pad stays on much longer before peeling away. 2 - Each time you remove the denture to clean it, dunk it in a cup of generic Listerine (don&#x27;t pay for the real stuff; use the cheap generic). Let it soak for a few minutes. 3 - Over a few days, the Cushion Grip will \\&quot;migrate\\&quot; outwards. Trim the excess and then add a new blob of Cushion Grip in the center of the denture. You&#x27;ll extend the life of the pad for a few more days</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my Mother who brought it to her dentist. He was thrilled to find it and will recommend it to many more patients. The order came with no problems and came earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind I use,  I would recommend it to everybody, Never had a problem with it. Thank You.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for many years&lt;br /&gt;this is the best on the market buy it off of amazon&lt;br /&gt;and save 2.26 off store prices if you can find it</li>
            <li> I order this product online because I tried once but my pharmacy is not carrying this product anymore. It is a perfect solution for me.   the delivery was fast as I expected. No complains.  I am very please with the product and the service.   Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used cushion grip on a new upper denture for over a year. I have not finished the first tube yet. My denture should be relined but I&#x27;m not sure I want to. I think the cushion effect is probably more comfortable than hard plastic. When they get a little lose I add a layer of cushion grip. When I say add I do mean add a layer to the old because removing the old is very difficult. Perhaps I will in the long run since my gums have shrunk &amp; the Ins Co pays most of a reline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/1/17 Still have 2 1/2 tubes.  The new price &#x3D; yea right, their dreaming</li>
            <li> Anyone who wears dentures needs to know about this product. This unique thermoplastic formula is so easy to apply. It molds like putty and forms a snug, air-tight seal that will last from 4 days to an entire week, then pulls away clean when you are ready to re-apply. It is the perfect alternative to the more traditional brands like Poligrip and Fixodent. There&#x27;s little to no gaps for stray food particles to get in, and no need for plucking out remaining adhesive residue from your gums after removing your dentures - no gooey mess. The more you know where and how much Cushion Grip to use on your denture&#x27;s, the better the fit and trouble-free chewing. Don&#x27;t forget to soften it by immersing the tightly sealed tube in hot water for a few minutes before using. I&#x27;m about to order my next shipment right now...cheerio.</li>
            <li> After many years, I have finally found an excellent product that doesn&#x27;t ooze, is very easy to apply, and finally my lower denture is firmly in place.  Thanks to the manufacturer!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leo</li>
            <li> its the best product on the market for loose fitting dentures. i have used it for a few years now and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Cushion grip is an awesome product. But as most of you know it has been discontinued. Here is a trick I learned here on Amazon. Since cushion grip is no longer being made I had to find another solution. Get a piece of wax paper. Fold it over at least 4 times. Then cut the wax paper to fit inside your denture. The wax on the paper hold your teeth in place. It is even more effective then cushion grip or anything else I have found. And to the person who posted this awesome solution thank you so much...</li>
            <li> I love how this product works. It makes my dentures fit better. It&#x27;s a bit hard to remove, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive is as good or better than getting soft liners put in your dentures by a Denturist and much less expensive.  I have used it on my lower plate for several years and am very satisfied with it. When this supply runs out I will order more.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before good product. Works well to hold improper fitting dentures. It will hold for a couple days, would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sill didn&#x27;t hold them in place for my 92 year old grand father.</li>
            <li> It takes some patience and paying attention but it really does work better than anything else.  My first try was not so good but lasted 2 days.  The second try was better and lasted 2 weeks.  I like it so much that I have ordered more.  My first tube appears to be lasting at least a month.</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for quite a long time and many places do not carry it so I chose to search Amazon and ordered.  My order was quickly accepted and shipped and I received it in just two days.  Cushion Grip is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who has a problem with their dentures staying tight and food getting under them.  Great product.</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the market to compare with Cushion Grip.  You basically reline teeth with a soft thermoplastic which allows you to eat anything and since the liner is soft the food that might get under plate does not hurt your gum.  I introduced a couple of dentist to it and they were amazed, wanted details to pass onto their patients but I had to inform them that it is no longer available since it&#x27;s not being made anymore.  Someone could make a fortune making and selling at $6.99 a tube if they just did a little marketing.  I can chew gum, eat an apple, crushed ice or anything that I want as long as I have Cushion Grip on my lower denture.  You only change it after about 4-5 days.  A tube will last about a month or longer.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! 5 Stars!!! :) Best denture adhesive I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used them all!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  Been using for years!  I change it once every 1 to 2 weeks,  Stays clean and secure!</li>
            <li> I think this works great as a temporary fix until you can get to your dentist for a real adjustment.  When your dentures get loose and you find you&#x27;re using adhesive way too much this is effectively an &#x27;mini-adjustment&#x27; until your next dental appointment.  I understand why many people think it&#x27;s a hassle to use, my advice is don&#x27;t follow the instructions in the box!  Yes, warm it up to make it easier to work with, but then I just a small amount (1/4 inch (more if my denture are really loose)) and roll it out to a strip and press it into the DRY denture.  I put them in and bite down for several seconds looking to be sure the bite is right.  Then don&#x27;t eat or drink or bite down for about 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this product is not an adhesive, it&#x27;s purpose is to tighten the denture so the adhesive works better.  When the denture starts to be able to slip (for me about 45-60 minutes after putting them in) I take them out, dry them off with a tissue, and apply adhesive.  I&#x27;m then good for the day, at night I soak them in cleaner, and love the next day when I pop them in and I&#x27;m good for another day!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never left the cushion grip in more than 2 days, because the longer it&#x27;s in the more difficult it is to get out.  I prefer replacing it every day or two rather than spend and hour or more trying to peel it off. I&#x27;ve also found a blast of cold water and carefully using tweezers is an easy way to remove it (Again, contrary to the directions provided).&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, it&#x27;s a great product BUT- only after some trial and error to see what fits your needs.  That&#x27;s probably why some don&#x27;t like it.  It took me about 2 weeks to get it right, and now after 6+ months of using.</li>
            <li> gums have shrunken, can&#x27;t get new set but this&lt;br /&gt;product seems to make it possible to eat almost&lt;br /&gt;anything and teeth don&#x27;t flop around.  No nasty&lt;br /&gt;taste as with other products and if done right&lt;br /&gt;it lasts several days.</li>
            <li> SENIOR CITIZENS  who have denture problems are just ignored!!!  All the denture adhesives etc, that I&#x27;ve found resemble a sloppy flour paste that squeezes out from under ill-fitting dentures.  The cream- types  are  still worse for me.  Slime also squeezes out and the mint taste changes the food flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t some of these denture businesses get with it and bring the best-ever powder, called Rigident, back to us. It&#x27;s ingredients are completely different from ALL other adhesives.  I&#x27;ve consulted several wearers and they have preferred this product over all  !!!!!!  My pharmacist can&#x27;t even come up with any advice.  I realize we will be told to get to the dentist and get better fitting teeth, but that doesn&#x27;t work either. Also, many seniors are living far under the poverty level, AS I AM ,and just keep trying to &#x27;make-do&#x27;.  I&#x27;m almost to the point of pulverizing my food and drinking it !!!!!!  How degrading that we oldsters have to exist in such a way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BY THE WAY, the company that produced Rigident is Church and Dwight.&lt;br /&gt;Even  though Rigident was made in Italy, can&#x27;t some resourceful investors and designers get the recipe that the company used, then reproduce the original ingredients and put it back on the market.  They would develop a profitable business and make so many people happy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; People live longer nowadays----I am almost 83----basically healthy and intelligent, so don&#x27;t we deserve  a better quality of life ???????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE HELP US  TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF OUR LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE</li>
            <li> Just hard to work with and didn&#x27;t stay in the liner very long.. it really isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;cushion grip&amp;#34;. Sorry..</li>
            <li> This product is fairly comfortable as a temporary liner for your dentures.  I needed it for the time between getting my first set and having the swelling go down and waiting for the dentist to line my teeth for the first time.  If I had any complaints it was that it didnt last as long as I expected it to, and I had to use it two or three times a day as well as an adhesive. And it was also difficult to roll out of the tube even with the key(provided) due to the density.  But I would recommend it as the best temporary liner out there.  And will be certain to order again if need to.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I have found that will last more than one day. I don&#x27;t believe I could wear my bottom denture without it! I have always bought mine at Walmart, but since they built the new store they no longer carry it. :(. Thank the lord I found it on Amazon!!! I ordered four tubes and will be ordering more! Please keep it in stock!!!  Thank You,  Erma</li>
            <li> all ever use it is great</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip has been a lifesaver for me in that I am able to actually enjoy a meal without pain and a flopping denture.  After numerous trips to the dentist to get the denture to fit and stay in with ample denture adhesive, I was able to do it for myself when I discovered Cushion Grip.      Although it is supposed to be a denture adhesive that lasts four days, for me it is a reliner that lasts more than a week or two.  I still use a denture adhesive with it, but it fits so much better than it ever did before.    If anyone has a problem with dentures that don&#x27;t quite fit, try this.  You should be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, who has had dentures for years, and because they&#x27;re rather expensive, has not had her dentures replaced for years.    Everyone who has a full denture knows that the gums and bones change over time. This product is the only one on the market that really works well to custom-fit the denture to the mouth over time.</li>
            <li> A  great product which i hve used for many years.  I do not know why they arennot going to have it for sale anymore.  I am quite dissappointed  in this It works well and is very comfortable to use..</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for over twenty years and my older son has also!  the fact we keep coming back for more tells you we never found a better product  for temporary fixing loose dentures. and this is the only place to buy it! D.P.</li>
            <li> For those persons who find this product difficult or impossible to use and see no benefits, I offer my own tips which also incorporates the instructions you get with the adhesive. I am a 67 year old female, so I&#x27;m no rocket scientist - but I will share my secrets with you, for using this product. Over time, I have come to use these techniques and they work quite well for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your denture is perfectly clean and absolutely DRY. I take a facial tissue and with the aid of a clean rat-tail comb (the handle area) - I press the tissue into the denture area where the adhesive is to be applied to make sure the area is perfectly dry. While I&#x27;m doing this, I have the tube of adhesive sitting in a container of hot water - which will permit an easier extraction from the tube. I estimate maybe 20-30 minutes of VERY hot water from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tube has been heated sufficiently, I remove the cap and squeeze out 3 small balls of the adhesive - about the size of a large garden pea into the deep channel towards the front of my denture. I usually squeeze out 3 balls, placing one at the front teeth area and one to each side of that. Then I take a clean rat-tail comb - the tail area that you hold, and slowly press the balls of adhesive down into the denture crevice and smooth out the adhesive. I apply these balls to the front portion of the denture - I don&#x27;t apply ANY to the back areas on either side -you&#x27;ll see why in a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I place the denture into my mouth and press down firmly with both hands, so as to allow my gum line to imprint a form on the adhesive. I usually hold this in place for a count of 10. Then I remove the denture and trim off any excess that might bleed up over the top ridge of the denture. When the balls of adhesive are applied to the front portion of the denture, as you press down, any excess will push to the back areas, along the gum channel. If you applied them to the back areas, as you press down, the adhesive would push on out of your denture to the back and be wasted. If you have any fragments get loose in your mouth while pressing down in the impression phase, simply spit them out or remove them with a tissue. No big deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, let your denture to sit and air dry - usually overnight (out of your mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the drying phase - this adhesive turns light pink in color. You are now ready to start wearing the denture with the adhesive installed. As time passes, food and water may slightly soften the adhesive. The product says it should last 4 days. Well, as an experienced user, I can say - it lasts me for weeks and weeks. As time goes along, some of the adhesive may stretch a little and ride up to the denture ridge, when it does that, I simply trim off the excess with a pair of scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove the old adhesive in order to apply a new coat, I do the following. Because this adhesive sticks to your dentures really well, I heat the denture in hot water for maybe 30 minutes. This will soften the adhesive. Then, I use a thin blade paring knife and tweezers to pry the adhesive up and out of my denture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have encountered no bad smell or bad taste using this adhesive. It does smell a little coming out of the tube, but I don&#x27;t find it offensive. After it is applied and dried somewhat on the denture, I sense no smell or taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will NOT prevent food particles from working under your denture. But it DOES pad any gaps between your gums and the denture form and makes wearing dentures a much more pleasant experience. It does NOT wash out and need reapplied daily like many other brands on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps people who have had problems using this product or are going to try it for the first time. I love this stuff - I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.sive would push on out of your denture to the back and be wasted.

            <li> My mom use to get this item at Wal-Mart but they don&#x27;t sell it any longer even though it was a propular item, the rest of the town doesn&#x27;t have it either and she asked me to find it for her, you had the better price, and was even cheaper than what she was paying at the wal-mart store, she is very happy knowing she can still get this item, Thank you for selling it and at the right price, daughter of Mildred Harp, Terrie Ross</li>
            <li> I was so very pleased with the product; from the description/indormation before I ordered, to the speedy shipping, ease of ordering and with my experience all the way around!  It was my first order from Amazon, but will not be my last!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I use it in conjunction with a hard reliner kit. It improves comfort and grip tremendously. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have dentures and dental implants. I lost my dental insurance before I was able to get the correct dentures, but this works VERY well to cushion my old set so I can wear them. I&#x27;d be absolutely LOST without it &amp; wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear my dentures. I almost panicked when I could no longer find it locally. So I really appreciate that I was able to find it online. I guess most adults nowadays have their own teeth due to flouride in water systems and better dental care. I grew up with well water and before flouride was even put into the water. When we did go to the dentist, they chose to pull the tooth rather than try to heal and repair. Many people of my generation have dentures but thankfully, not young people.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I would be lost without this product.  Don&#x27;t really like going for new dentures so Cushion Grip helps me out.</li>
            <li> So far it has not met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to remove from dentures.  I stopped using it for fear of damaging my dentures.</li>
            <li> If you have dentures and just need a little cushion here and there, or, if your dentures need more help than that, this is almost as good as a reline.  But, don&#x27;t leave it in for too long as it hardens and is more difficult to take out to replace.  To remove, soak in hot water.  I make sure I always keep some on hand.</li>
            <li> i have used this stuff for servel years -but where i got it quit handleing .You folks was the only place i could find it -Thank you</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to use. Not sure if I will use it. I have tried it a few times, but it is easier to use an adhesive cream rather than working with cushion grip. It does work as described.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, great deal too, my Grandfather needed this and it works great for him!&lt;br /&gt;everything is as described. have enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product as long as it is available. I use this product on my lower denture, as it makes it much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Nice price -- As advertised – Prompt shipment –  Recommended ****</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me but, I found this product very difficult to work with. Very hard to get out of the tube even after the required time of soaking in hot water. Which is also a pain...when you are in a hurry to have to wait for it to soften before using it. You have to make sure you do not put too much on or it seeps out after putting your dentures in and taste awful. The only thing I really really like about this is that you can take your dentures off and on without renewing the adhesive and without all that adhesive stuck to your gums...that part is a real plus. If they could only make it easier to get out of the tube and use I&#x27;d give it more stars.</li>
            <li> I found this to be the best longest lasting adhesive of any I have ever tried. There is no oozing out and fear of swallowing as with all others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I needed a good product that lines my dentures and keeps them in place and this does that. Great value as well.</li>
            <li> Amazon just makes my shopping so much easier, what can I say? I hate to shop. They do all the work and all I have to do is click. I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only things that has really worked for me.  There is no taste and no odor.  I really love it.</li>
            <li> i could not do without it.  It works great.</li>
            <li> have new dentures, have went back,still does not fit. cushion grip works.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and great price  Absolutely love it  Will be definabely ordering some more  Thank you thank you thank you</li>
            <li> worked very well for loose dentures</li>
            <li> I use it to fit bridges and so forth.  Normally very pliable but this seemed to be old as it was pretty hard.</li>
            <li> I have read the instructions that come with Cushion Grip, since I had a lot of trouble by taking short cuts, although, once I did exactly what the instructions said to do, I have had no problems. I took some advice from other reviewers and I am totally satisfied. Thank you!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend swears by this stuff..&lt;br /&gt;works great for her..&lt;br /&gt;tube lasts a long time four lasts a lot longer!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product but not really a paste. It&#x27;s a temporary denture reline that help ill fitttng denture. Holds very well with small amount of polygrip adhessive. Tricky to apply at first but once you get the hang of it really simple to spread out. when you spread it out wet your finggr with warm water.</li>
            <li> It is for my Mom and we could get it no place so I decided to try Amazon. She is very happy!</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip does NOT GRIP!  Dentures come right out.  As they say, it only sticks to the denture, but NOT to  your gums.&lt;br /&gt;So I ask you:  WHAT GOOD IS IT?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I desperately wanted to believe that my dentures would stay in at least all of 1 day, but they came out even quicker than with Fixodent or Poligrip.  WHY ?  Because they do not stick to your GUMS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that the testimonials cannot be relied upon.  I do wish it were otherwise, and stand to be corrected by the manufacturer.  I&#x27;d call them to discuss it, before posting this, but see no contact information.  Maybe they will contact me.....I hope.  LJ</li>
            <li> Better then what we were using on our upper  dentures, it last for about 3 days and no mess MaryAnn P.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT-USED THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 35 YEARS AND WORKS AS INTENDED</li>
            <li> Takes time to apply and remove but works as advertised. Improved the fit of my first set of dentures after the extractions.</li>
            <li> Not getting the results and using as directed.</li>
            <li> By far the best denture product on the market</li>
            <li> fantastic product,first try was a little scary but the product does what it&#x27;s says it does. I&#x27;m going on my 7th day without a fresh batch. That includes cleaning twice a day.. LOVE IT..LOVE IT..</li>
            <li> For many years I just had a partial denture and was limited to what types of adhesives I could use, which in turn limited the grip between your gums and your denture. My husband used this product for years so when I went to a full denture I tried it and I was plesantly suprised. I have no sores the cushion grip helps prevent that.I can now eat corn on the cob.. I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for loose dentures, and dentures that really hurt the lower gums. I use it a lot. It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t last too long...a few days at the most.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the price.  I purchased this before, 5 tubes for approximately 27.00. the price was almost tripled.  Since my dentures don&#x27;t fit and I can&#x27;t afford new ones, I had no choice but to buy it.</li>
            <li> hold better then it says, if you use small amounts the build up. let stand out all night long, can be use for weeks at a time without having to replace</li>
            <li> if you have loose dentures I would advise you to buy cushion grip as it is a lot better than the adhesive you have to use every day.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this stuff. My in laws pointed it out to me. I haven&#x27;t been able to use it on my bottom dentures yet, (yes, I have a full set of upper and lower). The package says it will last up to four days but each application lasts me about a week and a half to two weeks. You don&#x27;t need a lot to get your needs met and it definitely makes your dentures feel much more comfortable. Very worth it. I wish i could find it locally but still the same, an awesome product to use for dentures, at least full sets.</li>
            <li> I buy this in bulk for my mom, and it&#x27;s the best price and product I&#x27;ve found. She says, she loves that it has little to no taste and that the hold is fantastic; no food getting underneath.....For me as her caregiver, I have a problem with removing the adhesive for her after she&#x27;s worn the her dentures for four days. I have to pry it off with a small knife, I wear gloves and it takes awhile to do. But if she&#x27;s able to chew her food and it reduces her chances of choking I&#x27;ll keep putting up with the major chore of replacing new Cushion Grip every four days......</li>
            <li> I tried using a little and then a lot. Neither amount would hold my bottom denture in place. I followed the instructions to the letter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Bought it many times over the years and it does exactly what it says. I can recommend for anyone with dentures especially lower dentures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it works, and is a good product but,&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who has been using this any length of time knows they are&lt;br /&gt;Beening price gouged really bad by the sellers.&lt;br /&gt;Cvs carried this for 7.99 a tube until the company discontinued it earlier this year.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and the price was wonderful.  This product is very hard to find in stores so I was excited to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Wife uses it all the time.  Can&#x27;t say enough good about it. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> really didnt like this product it didnt hold like i thought it would so i will just use something else</li>
            <li> Not as effective as Fixodent.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Holds well and can last for days.</li>
            <li> I t5hink it is much improved over the others.  However I do not understand your statements that it last four days..  I find that four hours would be more acturate..  It may be what you consider holds.</li>
            <li> Its doing the job  thanks</li>
            <li> felt good on my gums to have fresh Cushion Grip on my dentures.</li>
            <li> I have used cushion for a few years and find out it works good for me. It usual works for 3 days before i have to reline my lower plate any one with denture should try it.</li>
            <li> Give it grandma and she loves it.  Easy to use.  No complaints so far.  Will get more, if not this brand, or others</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses it and loves it. You always send it quickly and it arrives with out damage and in the time stated. He thanks you and so do I.</li>
            <li> Finally found it cheaper at Fred Myers locally, I did not like it, did not work as well as they claimed</li>
            <li> My wife has had problems getting her dentures to stay comfortable and eating a steak usually causes pain but now she uses Cushion Grip and it makes it much better for her , plus she chews a pack of gum almost every day.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the perfect denture adhesive, look no further.  It takes a bit of trial and error but once you have it mastered, Cushion Grip is an excellent product. It took a couple of tries for me to get the perfect amount for the best hold. It works better than my expectations. There are a couple of things you should be prepared for. I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem for most users or if it&#x27;s a rare occurrence, but for the first fifteen minutes or so the adhesive burned my gums and palate. It&#x27;s definitely not unbearable but it did worry me that perhaps I was allergic to it. But I grinned and beared it (pardon the pun) and all was fine. No permanent injury.  Until it completely sets, some of it will ooze over the edges. I use a pair of manicure scissors to trim it until it sets. When it does set, its texture is sort of like a firm yet pliable rubber.  As far as its performance, I couldn&#x27;t be happier. When used properly it will fit perfectly to your gums and palate. It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re getting a new soft liner every few days. I used the same application for four days, which is the maximum the company recommends. I soaked it every night which didn&#x27;t cause any deterioration in its holding ability. It holds so well that it takes quite a bit of effort to remove the denture. Removing the product from the denture is a breeze. It just peels right off in one piece.  I have completely abandoned all other forms of adhesives. Goodbye pastes, strips, powders and wafers. I love the fact that I can just pop my dentures in and be ready to go. If I want a midnight snack I no longer decide against it because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of applying an adhesive. I guess I&#x27;ll be putting on some pounds!</li>
            <li> A fantastic product and I&#x27;m sorry to hear it is discontinued.  I don&#x27;t know what I will use now, nothing works like it, so sad.</li>
            <li> Grossly overpriced due to shortage as, I understand, production of this excellent product has stopped.</li>
            <li> Has anyone else noticed a bit of a price increase on this item lately?&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great, but becoming too costly for my income.</li>
            <li> The stars are enough.</li>
            <li> I followed Echoscream&#x27;s instructions and I&#x27;m very happy with the results (thanks Echoscream).  I&#x27;ve had it stay put for weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my parents, they can&#x27;t seem to find this anymore, but I was able to find it here.  They say this has the best hold and really keeps food out.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s a great product and I will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> little difficult to use but after reading several reviews i figured it out . it helps make a better fit temporaily</li>
            <li> have been using cushion grip for many years. It is a great product for those needing a liner for their dentures.</li>
            <li> did like it at all it did not hold even when following instrution it was too rubber it takes to long</li>
            <li> the best product for dentures, I hope they bring this back holds dentures very securely.</li>
            <li> this is the most worse product for dentures</li>
            <li> Why is when something that works is on the market it is taken off.. This product beats any tooth adhesive product by 400%. No taste no residue lasts about 4 days Stays where you put it  You can eat anything.  I have been using this for about 20 years.  now it is gone  I did by 4 tubes for 79.00 only because  I hope they start manufacturing it again.  If not maybe I will die before the I use the 4 tubes up  Walmart used to sell it for 3.98 a tube.  Until they quit CVS was the only place I could by it  Maybe if they sold it to other stores they would make a lot more money and us that really need it can buy it</li>
            <li> Love it and last a long time</li>
            <li> A OK can,t beat this item</li>
            <li> Bought for wife best damn denture sticky ever made according to her last for days easy to apply easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is without a doubt the best product available ( I&#x27;ve tried lots of them ) The only problem is it is quite a bit more expensive than it used to be and I have to import it from USA because it is no longer available in Australia , but it is well worth it and the service from Amazon and MY US combined is excellent</li>
            <li> This held broken teeth in my mouth before i had extractions. Now using it -i cannot use it as an adhesive by itself. It stays on well!but doesn&#x27;t adhere to my gums. i then use denture adhesive on top of this to keep them firmly in place-at least until i eat-then they still give problems.</li>
            <li> I am new to dentures.  This product works.  It is not a true adhesive --it doesn&#x27;t stick to gums-- but it does cushion and fill in the gaps between gums and plate and provides a little more suction. I use a little adhesive (one line)  and I can go all day.  Eating is much better than with just adhesive. CVS pharmacy carries it for around $7.00 a tube.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely thrilled to receive my Cushion Grip.  This is a wonderful product that does what it says it will do.  The stores in this area no longer carry it and I was so trilled to find that Amazon did carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is the only product my mother in law loves to use for her dentures.  she has tried them all and always comes back to this one and if she cant find it she is crying to me to find it.  I usually order her the 4 pack about 4 or 5 times a year.  I always find it on Amazon for a pretty good deal.  We used to get it all the time in Walmart but it is so hard to find now a days and I dont really know why.  My motherinlaw says it is the only thing that holds her dentures into place all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new denture wearer and trying to adjust to the worst situation - the lower denture with very little bone ridge to hold the denture in. I tried Cushion Grip and after several times trying, finally got it down and I love the way the product works. My lower denture, right from the start, was too loose. My dentist is reluctant to do a reline until I became accustomed to the denture, but I will definitely be asking for a reline soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One has to remember that Cushion Grip is NOT an adhesive - it is a &#x27;cushion&#x27; which makes my dentures fit more snugly. I have to replace the Cushion Grip every four days and I do use denture adhesive with the denture. It&#x27;s workable, although it will never be a &#x27;natural&#x27; bite. I am learning to eat more things than I ever could with my natural teeth! My mother had full uppers and lowers, never used adhesive and could eat corn on the cob, steak, peanuts, etc. I was amazed! I couldn&#x27;t eat that stuff with my own teeth. Not sure I can do it now either, but I am eating more things than I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Keep practicing with the Cushion Grip. Remember that it is NOT an adhesive - it is a &#x27;cushion.&#x27; Remember that Cushion Grip will NOT stick to a soft reline. My dentist told me that even adhesives would have a hard time sticking to a reline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I asked my mother how she could eat all of those things and still keep her dentures in, her reply was &amp;#34;You learn to control them.&amp;#34; After trying a multitude of products (which help a little), I think what she said is the truth - that one needs to learn to &#x27;control&#x27; the denture with cheek muscles, tongue, lips, etc. If your dentures become too loose to stay in your mouth, go back to the dentist for a reline or try one of the at-home reliners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a learning process and a big adjustment, but for me, it&#x27;s better than the toothaches and abcesses.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wear my dentures without it.</li>
            <li> I used 1 1/2 tubes of Cushion Grip trying to get it to work and not only did it not work for 4 days. it did not work for even 1 hour. I was extremely disappointed with the results and returned it for a refund. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> The product is great, to bad Sherring Plough  is discontinuing it.  It explains the extremely inflated price. I paid over sixteen dollars a tube for the same product I paid 7.98 a tube at the neighborhood drug store.&lt;br /&gt;I  give the product five stars as well as delivery. In view of the high price I could only rate this three stars,totally.</li>
            <li> This product help  hold my dentures in place. I have been using this for years. Please don&#x27;t ever stop offering it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for any loose fitting denture or plate.</li>
            <li> Very good product . I would highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> does not work at all would not last one day or one hour, its hard to take off but the most important part is it does not stick to your dentures it just comes off instantly , following all the instructions it does not work,</li>
            <li> There is nothing else like it on the market!!!  It works better than all the name brand products on the store shelves.. Why don&#x27;t the stores carry it?  It&#x27;s ok ,,,,,,I can always get it at Amazon</li>
            <li> Order this thinking it would help keep my lower dentures in place better.  Sticks great to dentures but no help with keeping the low dentures any tighter in place.  Anyone know of anything that keeps lower dentures in place for more then a few hours??????</li>
            <li> Great price. This adhesive acts like a reline, and last 3-4 days before needing reapplication. Takes a few minutes to warm before applying, but is effective.</li>
            <li> This product is a real money saver. My wife uses it and we save big each month. She can apply this product and use it over and over. Compared to the product in the stores it is better by a factor of 10 magnitude. # tubes can last 6 months or so. Saving 140.00$ over 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past. I knew beforehand it would work</li>
            <li> I use Cushion Grip all the time to help keep my hearing aids in place and prevent feed back. It is the only produce I have found  that can do this. Great product and at a great price on amazon.com.[[ASIN:B003LZZZXS Special Pack of 5 SCHERING-PLOUGH NO POST CUSHION GRIP ADHESIVE 1 oz]]</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is the best product for temporary relining dentures. Easy to apply and secure to gums. Dentures fit to be&lt;br /&gt;like your normal teeth.</li>
            <li> Product is great, have been using it for over 15 years.  I had been paying $5.65 for a tube and then our local store quit handing it.  Product is now selling for over $12 a tube.  Like to buy at a cheaper price as we are on a set income.</li>
            <li> Best for dentures! Better than the off the shelf brands.</li>
            <li> CVS carries it and its only $600 for a 1oz tube.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for over 15 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;Your prices are ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> I get this for my sister and she loves it and is unable to find it when needed but this makes it easy so everyone is happy</li>
            <li> The best product ever AAA +</li>
            <li> I had seen Cushion Grip recommended by several denture wearers and made a note of it for later use.  I had my teeth removed in the fall. I ran into a lot of difficulty trying to adjust the dentures so I would be able to wear them comfortably, get them to stay in place and allow me to eat something other then liquid foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist was very patient and adjusted different spots on dentures about every week for the first 2 months. The top dentures were loose and he did a temporary reline which helped but still needed to be adjusted to eliminate sore spots.  The bottom denture (a partial plate with two anchor teeth was even more difficult to deal with).  Even after adjustments they seemed to &#x27;float&#x27; in the back. I wasn&#x27;t able to eat with them.  Every time I tried, food would get under the back of the bottom dentures, causing pain and making it impossible to eat wearing the bottom dentures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was decided that the dentures were not able to be adjusted to fit correctly and a new mold was taken to start the process of making a new set of dentures.  It was going to take several weeks to complete this process and that is when I purchased &amp;#34;Cushion Grip. Since I had to find a way to wear these dentures, until the new ones were completed, I got the Cushion Grip with the hope that I could use it to get the first set of dentures to stay in place.  All I was really hoping for was to get the dentures to stay in place without having to use a lot of denture adhesive.  The Cushion Grip showed up in a few days and I started the process of seeing what I could or could not do with this produce.  The instructions that come with the product are helpful but not fully complete. Make sure you follow the timing they suggest, but also make sure you moisten the finger you use to press the Cushion Grip in place (this will keep it from sticking to your finger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Cushion Grip on the upper dentures not only held them in place, it also made them comfortable(it eliminated the sore spots I usually got). I have read some of the comments about this product and have found some who complain that it does not &#x27;adhere to the gums&#x27;.  It is not meant to be a denture adhesive, it is more like doing your own soft reline.  It makes the dentures snug to the gum line, which is why adhesives are seldom needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom dentures were more difficult to work with, as anyone who wears bottom dentures will know.  I did have good luck using the Cushion Grip on the bottom dentures, by applying more of the  product then one would think necessary. When I would push down on one side of the bottom dentures, the other side would lift up and the same thing would happen if I reversed the procedure. By using more Cushion Grip I was able to make the bottom dentures level.  This made the bottom dentures secure and comfortable.  I still was not able to eat anything but semi-solid  foods, but that was better then I had been able to do before.  The Cushion Grip made it possible for me to continue to wear the ill fitting dentures until the new dentures arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new dentures fit very well, with no problem at all with the top denture.  I am still figuring out what might need to be done with the bottom dentures.  The new bottom dentures are so much better then what I had before, but I am using the Cushion Grip on them to make them &#x27;snug&#x27; and comfortable, while I am learning to eat with them.  And &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34;, you do need to learn to eat differently if you are a new denture wearer, or at least I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Cushion Grip the highest rating.  It exceeded my expectation and frankly I think I saved my sanity while I was trying to adjust to &#x27;store bought teeth&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gladys&lt;br /&gt;Maine</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is a life saver! It works wonders and is much better than using other stuff! I love it!!</li>
            <li> Works very well and is so nice when your mouth is sore. Was expensive on here compared to CVS 8 dollars a tube there and almost 17 on here</li>
            <li> THIS HAS JUST BEEN DISCONTINUED!! Nowhere to be found anymore....don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do. So many people depend on this product to eat, talk, and live in relative comfort with dentures...this is a tragedy for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and couldn&#x27;t find it locally any more so when I found it here I snapped it up! It is a great value because it last a long time and works great for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> I get blisters from the dentures since I have allergies to the material they are made of, with cushion grip after three years of not being able to wear my teeth I can now and I do not use any other glue or powers they stay in wonderful and the thin layer keeps the dentures material from touching my gums.</li>
            <li> It is ridiculous how the price jumped. A product that all denture wearer use and now hardly cannot afford. I could see the price went up a little but almost 200%. I only ordered the four pack because this is the only product I can wear with my dentures. I am trying to find something that is comparable with this product, since it will not be on the market when supplies run out. This is a very good product. I rated it one star because of the price not the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with my lower dentures from the start.  Nothing the dentist could do helped for long.  I tried all of the goopy adhesives and all they did was make me gag. A woman I worked with suggested Cushion Grip and I fell in love.  It&#x27;s impossible to find in retail stores, so I thank God for Amazon.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts for at least three days.</li>
            <li> I used this to remedy the problem I was having with &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; spots. It is easy to use and forms a cushion between the denture and the gums.</li>
            <li> only  adhesive that works</li>
            <li> Works better then any other Denture adhesive I have ever used and its use lasted longer.</li>
            <li> The adhesive comes in an aluminum tooth paste container with a metal split pin that you&#x27;ll need to squeeze it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pin you&#x27;ll only need once the tube gets less than half full as it becomes difficult to compress the aluminum container enough to squeeze out the adhesive. The instructions recommend placing the tube in hot water to heat it, which does help melt the product and makes it a little easier to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as I&#x27;m sure you can tell the process of applying it can be a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Place a few drops and spread them cover the underside, then let it sit for a couple minutes. You don&#x27;t really need to let it sit but it does help decrease the minor burning feel when you wear the adhesive.  But this goes away after five minutes or so either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the grip, its superb. After trying this you&#x27;ll never go back to the pastes. It last four days,  and can easily last a few days longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a re-lining. My current application has lasted three weeks so far! Great product! Even my dentist never heard of it - needs publicity!</li>
            <li> Great product for teeth that won&#x27;t stay put</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cushion Grip since 1971. I was in my mid 20&#x27; when I had upper and lowers removed.  I can&#x27;t stand powder or paste. As my gums have shrunk,  this makes up for the difference and you don&#x27;t have to change it every day. I leave it in and add as needed for a week or so. Unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find in stores so I order it online.  I&#x27;m not one to recommend a product unless I&#x27;m completely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Bob P.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!! Way better than any of the creams and strips. Cant believe someone else isnt making something similar, shame they stopped making it</li>
            <li> I like it and am disappointed that they are not producing any more.</li>
            <li> Does hold them in like i read on other reviews. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The product was correct as described.</li>
            <li> This product is really misnamed. It is not an adhesive so much as it is a comfort. I was/am new to dentures and my first set did and do not fit very well as my gumes are shrinking every day. It is really annoying and painful and I cannot wait til I can get my permanent set. Until then, I will be using this product faithfully. It is like a temporary reline and make the dentures fit my mouth again. I love the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know I could go back and have a reline done at the dentist office but it is way to inconvenient when I can do it at home in 15 mins. Also, to work as well, I would have to go to the dentist once a week. With this stuff, I can have perfectly fitting teeth all the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years, primarily for the &amp;#34;cushion aspect&amp;#34; and was dismayed when it disappeared from the shelves locally. Unlike most dental adhesive products Cushion Grip isn&#x27;t messy and doesn&#x27;t cling to your gums which requires brushing to remove. It is advertised to last 4 days which it does and at times even longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found to keep plates from slipping. Figures the company would discontinue it.</li>
            <li> the best stuff...too bad they stopped manufacturing it..haventbeen able to find anything else too martch this</li>
            <li> I am saddened by all the greed from people and companies about this product.  What happened to this country of ours. We were honest, and caring to each other. I remember. Now all I can see is the downfall of being human. America is now all about money, and more money. This no longer the greatest country in the world. Its too bad.</li>
            <li> Will not use it again. After using it once I thru the rest of it away. Very hard to clean off the dentures. I don&#x27;t have all day to clean my dentures.</li>
            <li> My dad had been resisting using his dentures for a LONG time because he hated it. He got some adhesives including Fixodent and that didn&#x27;t make a difference either. After a good amount of weight loss I looked around and bought this for him. And it has worked wonders !! He uses his dentures all the time, he&#x27;s super happy with this adhesive and as a result he has gained back quite some weight. Based on his experience I would recommend this to anyone who needs one.</li>
            <li> I purchased my teeth in the State of Maine an then moved to AZ, and they have never fight right. To reline the teeth in SZ coast more then the teeth did back in Maine.  Cushion Grip works great.</li>
            <li> I love it but its discontinued.</li>
            <li> my mom wont use anything but this stuff she swears by it</li>
            <li> Best reline for the money. Decent adhesion. Reline can last me up to two weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Could not find this locally anymore and found it on here. Was so happy. This is the only thing I can use that works....</li>
            <li> It works, I don&#x27;t use it all the time as it&#x27;s hard to apply and harder to get off.  It does last a while, but not that sanitary I don&#x27;t think after a while even if I soak them in cleaner.  So I only use it occasionally.  Also, if you leave it on too long it&#x27;s even harder to get off.  What I do is soak it in hot water 5 min apply several drops where I want them on the top and spread them around, the same on the bottom and let them set for a few minutes.  Put them in and bite down a little and then take them out I think it says this on the instructions and let them sit about 5 minutes before putting back in.  I use a few little drops of fixodent on the bottom to keep them in even with the Cushion Grip, but it is much more comfortable using this product, and the uppers I don&#x27;t have to glue at all when I use this.</li>
            <li> why did i chose this online is cheaper to get them the store. love this product will buy it on line always!</li>
            <li> Works great nut price keeps going up, use to get it for $4.00 a tube.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that my dad likes. He said it not only hold but also acts as a filler.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product but not the quantity only ordered 4 and was billed for 8</li>
            <li> It is better that Fixident.</li>
            <li> Great product-sadly though it is being discontinued by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product more than 5 stars. Anyone who wears dentures should try this product. It is amazing. I am confident that my denture will stay in place when I have this applied. You can eat or laugh and not have to worry about your denture slipping. There is no smell or taste once it dries and is ready to wear. It usually lasts for weeks. I never have to use any adhesive to help hold my denture when I use this. Much better than using an adhesive, no sticky residue to have to try to wash off every night. It is hard to find in any of the local stores but is very easy to order from Amazon. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I buy this for a friend who just loves it-he used to buy it in the drugstore but can&#x27;t find it there anymore. Keep stocking it, Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This product is the only one of it&#x27;s type that works for me. It is unique and when used as directed is very comfortable</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time was very grateful to have gotten it on line. stores don&#x27;t carry it any longer</li>
            <li> cushion grip is the only thing that works on my dentures , holds for days and i can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my mother because her dentures were not fitting properly after she lost weight and she was unable to eat well with them.  They made her dentures fit so she can enjoy eating again. She&#x27;s 92 years young but unwilling to have new dentures made. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I cant firgure why you cant buy it in the store like we use to and now it is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  I was unable to tolerate the denture pastes and the cushion grip is easy and works great.</li>
            <li> Very good product, as advertised. Words well, good price.&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say to use up the 15 words</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and absolutely loves it.  This is our second order of the product and he has been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> Best product for cushion comfort. I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> It is very good, but I still have to take the lower plate out because I cant eat with it.  That is the dentists&#x27; fault.  I need to have them redone but I cannot afford it.</li>
            <li> yes it is good. a shame it is discontinued</li>
            <li> a necessity if you have dentures</li>
            <li> This has always been an excellent product for bottom dentures. It is too bad, however, that due to the shortage of cushion grip and it no longer being produced, merchants are charging ridiculous prices. I can understand a price increase but not an increase so big that is unattainable for people like me can&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Product as advertised. Was very expensivethough.</li>
            <li> I have found nothing that works better. The only problem I have is that in one day it went from the shelves at the local pharmacy at $6.00 a tube to impossible to afford. Why is it that everything that works and is affordable never stays that way?</li>
            <li> the best denture adhesive then I find out they went out of business now I&#x27;m trying to find something that works as good with no luck</li>
            <li> I had worn a partial denture for several years but recently acquired a full-lower denture. It did not fit as well as I had expected and other products which were supposed to hole it in place seemed to dissolve instantly when I began eating. I found this product on line and decided it was worth trying.  So glad I did! It makes it possible to improve the fit so much that I can forget that I am wearing the denture. I can bite with it which I had not been able to do before. Yes, the denture can still float out of place when drinking and food can occasionally get underneath it but compared to what I went through without it, this is  a great improvement.</li>
            <li> Oh, my, where do I start to tell you how Cushion Grip is a gift from god.  I had to have my teeth pulled in November 2010 and the oral surgeon highly recommended one place to have my dentures made and (like a total idiot) that&#x27;s where I went.  Well, I have had one problem after another and the dental lab said, \\&quot;tough sh*!, you signed the paper after the wax denture fitting so it&#x27;s your problem.\\&quot;  The dentures I got were not the same as the wax molding, the dentures were way too big.  I had no suction in the least and the denture makers said I&#x27;d have to use Fixadent to keep them in.  So for over 2 years that is what I did. I could not chew, eat any solid food and I had trouble talking and the pain in my gums was outstanding (I stayed home a lot.) I was at the end of my rope so I bought Cushion Grip and read all the reviews.  The first time I applied it I followed the instructions and only kept them in my mouth for about 10 minutes before I removed them to \\&quot;dry/set-up\\&quot; overnight.  The next day the tops felt wonderful but the bottoms hurt so I easily removed the Cushion Grip and re-applied it.  This time I left them in my mouth for a few hours before taking them out to \\&quot;dry.\\&quot;  After a few hours I had trouble removing the upper plate (wonderful suction) and I was jumping up &amp; down with excitement.  After letting them dry overnight when I put them in  my mouth I was in heaven.  They are so comfortable and a tight fit.  I can now clearly speak words and chew some solid foods (I am re-learning how to chew with dentures.) I am going to stock up on Cushion Grip to make sure I am never without it because it is the greatest thing made for denture wearers.  ***Just a quick note:  When you need to get dentures DO YOUR RESEARCH on who you may pick to make them and before the dentures are made (before you give them any $$$ or sign any paper) find out what the maker will do if the dentures don&#x27;t properly fit and get it in writing.</li>
            <li> this product did not work as advertised I waste of time and money I definitely would not recommend it hey total waste of time</li>
            <li> Keeps dentures in place without sticky mess in my mouth.  Easy to apply.  Prevents sore mouth and gums.  Stays in place, even after brushing and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Stumbled upon it on youtube, and had to try it. No nasty taste like most products, and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery, but very expensive, I suppose because the product is being  phased out??</li>
            <li> Using this for years -- absolutely the best dental product. Only neg is that it requires much more time and attention to using, but my feinds who use all the other more convenient adhesive products are always complaining because they don&#x27;t work, whereas this 100% DOES!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, used it for years. Don&#x27;t understand the price increase. I used to get this for $5 a tube through my pharmacy till they couldn&#x27;t get it any longer. :(</li>
            <li> It is okay, not as good as I thought it should be for that price</li>
            <li> This is the only product I like. It really works! Hope they start producing it again.</li>
            <li> I used two tubes and never got it to hold dentures in place.&lt;br /&gt;It felt soft when I first put my dentures in my mouth. The product burned some but that was tolerable.  Just would not grip to gum and hold dentures in place.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the adhesive felt good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  I had my dentures relined by a local dentist and man did he mess them up.  I had sores appearing everywhere.  I started using this and the sores started healing and my bottom denture stays in place.  I hate to have to try relining again, I think I&#x27;ll just stick with Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> Love it ..... Need more</li>
            <li> This is great for people with dentures that do not fit perfectly. I keep a supply on hand all the time.</li>
            <li> The  person I work for has one and I just fell in love with it, and had to have one, very easy clean up, and so handy&lt;br /&gt;and very surprisingly large, whole pizza&#x27;s and for pies its unbelievable, no bending over to spill anything and easy to remove</li>
            <li> any body else have any?</li>
            <li> Works great.  I only need a tiny amount of reg. adhesive.  It says it lasts 4 days but one application lasts me for weeks.  Its like getting a new soft reline every few weeks. love love love!</li>
            <li> The price was outrageous..What a rip off.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied, just wish the company would continue making the product.</li>
            <li> For temporary fixes. It lasts about 2 days for me. Provides a cushion and better fit. GREAT product for my dentures!</li>
            <li> I am less than one week out of extensive dental surgery and new dentures.  In a word, I was miserable.  Not from after procedure pain, but from trying to get comfortable with the immediate denture.  I tried every paste on the market all failed. Then on a search for alternatives found this.  On the first try it was immediately comfortable 6 days post op, and still very much in the healing phase.  There are easy directions in the packaging, follow those, then read all the reviews,  and use the helpful hints from other users on a try basis to see what works for you.  Remember every situation is unique,  and requires adapting things to your personal needs.  I am only in the first day of use so I will update in a week with how it worked out after day one.  Just being comfortable for the first time in a week is priceless.  I am sure there will be additional benefits.  Not being afraid to smile or talk lifts your spirits and gets you on the road to recovery.  This is a process and you are learning a new normal just like someone who looses any part of thier body so be forgiving of what is lacking in the early days, move forward confidently and don&#x27;t give up.  I still work so being able to return to work confidently was very important I did that 24 hours after full mouth surgery, You can to.. I hope this will encourage you I know what you are feeling.</li>
            <li> for I have read all 225 reviews, study others experiences with cushion grip....For me, get you a cat-tail comb, spread around the cushion grip...you don&#x27;t have to press out a large amount all at once, only a small amount, the size of a pea...it&#x27;s all about others perception of any thing, some advice you can use, others, some are simply not in the game, it&#x27;s a wonderful product, but, the wonder of it all is your persistence to hang in there and learn, or you will fail...is that anything new?</li>
            <li> I am a new &#x27;&#x27;denture&#x27;&#x27; wearer, however during the initial period after getting my upper denture, my dentist has done several &#x27;&#x27;soft religns&#x27;&#x27;.. which works great for the first day or two, however as my gums are healing &amp; shrinking daily, the soft relign doesn&#x27;t last long.. Using &#x27;&#x27;Cushion Grip&#x27;&#x27; has helped the daily adjustments to my gums and any &#x27;&#x27;sore spots&#x27;&#x27; that come up, making it much more bearable when your gums are healing... It&#x27;s easy to apply...just follow the instructions... When I went to my dentist for an adjustment, she had never seen this, but she liked it because when you bite down on the Cushion Grip, it forms the &#x27;&#x27;impressions&#x27;&#x27; of your gums and is softer for healing gums.. Cushion Grip is NOT an adhesive, it&#x27;s more like a &#x27;&#x27;soft relign&#x27;&#x27;, so you can use your favorite adhesive over it if you need to..the adhesive sticks to Cushion Grip and NOT the roof of my mouth when I take them out at night...</li>
            <li> flat out don&#x27;t work. save your money..  I try it, I trusted the reviews, so it  was cheaper to buy 4 then one, now am stuck with 3 unopened  tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you are going to try, only buy one tube, it may work for you......</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Fills in those gaps that make dentures not fit well as your gums continue to shrink.  I cannot afford a new pair of dentures, so this product is wonderful to use.  It is a soft substance that molds to your gums, firms up &amp; stays put !  Easy to remove when it is time to replace.  (soak in warm water if needed to soften it for removal).  I soak my dentures in denture cleaner with the Cushion Grip on my dentures &amp; brush them clean with no problems.  It stays put.  No more denture goo from the drug store ever !  I hope this product will be available for many years to come.  I know it has been around for decades.  It is hard to find locally &amp; whether you have the store special order it for you or not,  the store price is much higher.  Packed with care.  I will keep buying it at Amazon for sure.</li>
            <li> Ok-first, let me say, I am a 63 year old man. I kept most of my natural teeth until this year.Finally, like everyone, I had to decide on what to do about teeth that needed replacing. I&#x27;m retired, and implants are way too much. So, I went with dentures, and have had them in for a month now. So far, they have been a real pain to keep in. Not so much the top, but the bottom is just stupid, the way it moves when I try eating. I have been regretting getting the lower teeth replaced, until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, I found this stuff at Fred Meyers store. For Washington State residents, you know them. Their the big chain here. They carry it! None of the pharmacies do, which is strange. But, I used it and can say, it really does work, but is not perfect. Here&#x27;s how I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed both, the instructions, and peoples tips on here, which is the best way to apply this.The instructions are really not complete, like most instructions. Here is the steps I did. I tried it a couple times, and finally figured it out. Do this, and it will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Get a big glass-fill it with water, and heat in microwave,not boiling,but hot.&lt;br /&gt;2.Put tube, closed, in water, head first, cap down. Let sit for 5-10 min.&lt;br /&gt;3. Take out the dentures, wash em good, and blow dry or towel dry real good. I used a hair dryer to dry them, as it also warms them up, which makes this goo easier to apply.(fill sink with water, so if you drop them, they won&#x27;t break.)&lt;br /&gt;4.Now, put your top plate in your mouth without anything on it.&lt;br /&gt;5.Open the tube and watch as a big glob of this goo pops up. Smear it on the gum line of the lower denture. Work it around the denture. Apply more goo until it is all the way around. How much? Well,how loose is your lower denture? I used quit a bit. I filled the gum line about half way up, all the way around. Use your finger to smear this funny stuff around and make it smooth as you can. Takes maybe 5 minutes to do.&lt;br /&gt;6. Take a 10 minute break-now, go back and carefully place the lower denture in your mouth. It has now cured, and may sting a little on the gums, but, it&#x27;s no big deal. It goes right away. It&#x27;s a slight chem burn, nothing to worry about-lol&lt;br /&gt;Bite down with top denture and hold. Count to twenty. Release your jaw. Take out upper-leave in lower.Clean and dry the top again.&lt;br /&gt;7.Warm the water and goo, again. Apply to top denture. Bite down. Now, here&#x27;s where the directions kind of fail to mention.&lt;br /&gt;8.After an hour or so, take out both dentures and trim off excess goop. Now, don&#x27;t put in water. Let them sit and really cure over night. The product is tacky/sticky until it sits.&lt;br /&gt;But, left overnight, it hardens and is really easy to use and wear. Last night, with these in, I was able to rip into some tough meat and the dentures stayed in place really good. After they sat on a dry towel all night, they fit great. I did apply a small amount of Fixodent, but not much. Right now, these things are in so good, it may be tough getting them out, but wow,what a difference.I went out and was eating, talking and finally not worried about my new \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; jumping up and taking off. Get this stuff-$6.00-a steal!</li>
            <li> this product has been a friend to me for over 25 years. I highly recommend it and the work that it does. I can feel confident for many weeks using Cushion Grip with comfort and security.I&#x27;ve tried other products but nothing lasts as long or is as comfortable as this product. It is hard to find in a store because of the cost it is pilfered so stores just don&#x27;t carry it and the products they do are inferior. Thank Goodness for this product and may it always be available for me. Joan Mahan</li>
            <li> Cushion grip works good for me, it takes some practice putting it on though.  My plate is much tighter than it was before.  Good for loose fitting dentures, I would not bother with it if my dentures held tight.  Not real good for metal dentures, I believe it holds better on the denture when they are totally pink.  Mine is metal on the palate of the mouth, and the cushion grip does not hold tight on the back edges of my denture.  Certainly worth a try if you have loose fitting dentures.  I believe the most important part of the denture for holding turns out to be along the gum line, and it does a good job there.</li>
            <li> Have used it for many years and will continue.  A great product.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad to compensate for some space between his denture and gum (upper)...he&#x27;s thrilled.  It allows for a better fit which helps his teeth stay put for a solid day +</li>
            <li> this product is appreciated by my friend.  she is able to obtain it&lt;br /&gt;locally, so i have not re-ordered for her</li>
            <li> This HAS to be the work of the dental industry!  Now only way to live with dentures is to get a soft liner installed!  How much will that be?!?&lt;br /&gt;Product works well, nothing like it out there..</li>
            <li> dont buy this product it is out of date and wont work like its suppose too.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Received as expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> he swelled so much his teeth came out of his mouth while he was sleeping.This product caused mt honey to swell on his gums and lips after using for 2 days.</li>
            <li> If you are patient and take the time to prepare and apply this product properly, it&#x27;s very effective for relining a denture. It took me a while to get it right and my temp dentures are a bit big. When I finally got the prep right and with a bit of adhesive, my dentures are now more comfortable and secure. There&#x27;s a bit of heat generated by the product but it quickly passes. Be careful not to use too much as it will seep out, harden and will need to be trimmed. The taste is a little funky but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for secure dentures. All the positives outweigh any negatives. try it, give it a chance, be patient and you&#x27;ll be happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  I gave this product several tries and it just is not what I expected.  At first, it felt really comfortable and snug.  But when I have a cup of coffee or anything warm or hot, is looses its adhesiveness and it does not readhere or firm up again.</li>
            <li> Great product - I&#x27;ve always liked it.  Glad to have found an online place to purchase it since my local store doesn&#x27;t stock it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if your dentures are  loose in any areas. I t also helps with sore gum areas.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do, but hard to get off dentures - takes a lot of time - unless I am doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Very good for the job it was made for.</li>
            <li> Bought this as an adhesive. Its not. Its a  cushion. It does feel good at first but slides right off.</li>
            <li> If you want your dentures to fit without the goo feeling this is it.  My mouth is never sticky.</li>
            <li> this adhesive is truly the best on the market it holds for days</li>
            <li> Did not do a thing for me so I through it all away. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I received my package today (earlier than expected thank you Mr. Medical) I opened the first box, got prepared, went outside to sit in the shade by my pool and started this process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had my lower denture done I did the adjustments myself due to not being able to leave work everyday to go to the dentist to fix &amp;#34;sore spots&amp;#34; and of course I kind of messed them up.  Now that my mouth is completely healed they don&#x27;t fit correctly.  I have been using the soft reliner stuff, but that takes so much adjusting because it oozes everywhere etc.  I accidentially found Cushion Grip on Amazon somehow and looked at some Youtube videos and decided it was worth a try for $20.00....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it today and took me about 15 minutes to get both plates done and IT IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!  My dentures fit so good now.  Still have to use some polygrip on the botton just because they are floating but my top plate is NOT  going anywhere and there is nothing but the Cushion Grip on it.  I WISH I would have found this stuff before I did all my own adjustments...lol  oh well lesson learned.  Anyway I would recommend that you get this stuff if you are having issues with either plate. and......if you are contemplating doing you own adjustments get it shipped overnight before you take a dremmell to your plate...........</li>
            <li> Another product I cannot find local and use all the time. As a liner to fit it cannot be beat and once set ( a day or so) and clean with a good adhesive , you are good to mouth at will.  Trim  excess with small sharp scissors to edges of plates. Slight burning sensation when first applied and used.</li>
            <li> buy it for my mother-in-law. She swears by it. She won&#x27;t use any other product. It doesn&#x27;t leave any after taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new wearer, and was looking for some relief for my sore upper gums. This product worked nicely. Easy to follow instructions and the product worked as advertised. I&#x27;d describe it as more of a cushion than an adhesive, but since I&#x27;m new to the topic I&#x27;m pretty far from knowing very much.</li>
            <li> It works does what its suppose to holds your dentures have used it for years will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love the product and would recommend it to every one, its clean helps in preventing damage or injury to gums serves as a smooth soft cushion between gums and denture plates no matter what condition your gums may be in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Ray</li>
            <li> This product was almost set up when it came-I was very disappointed as it must have been old.I use it stillbut purchase it at a retailer.</li>
            <li> Simply the best product out there!&lt;br /&gt;Supply &amp; demand is one thing. No one should be allowed to charge such ridiculously high prices. The manufacture does not make this product anymore. I bought a few months ago for 4 for $99.00 which was too much money. Now it&#x27;s a couple hundred for one.</li>
            <li> Brother is in a nursing home and needs help with his teeth for healthier eating...this was a perfect way to get a supply mailed straight to his room!</li>
            <li> Been useing for years pity it&#x27;s not on sale in this country ,my wife will only use this good product ,easy to apply ,.</li>
            <li> ITS JUST WHAT I WANTED,ALSO,IT CAME SUPER FAST IN THE MAIL.THANKS ,I WOULD SHOP HERE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> this is the best stuff to keep dentures in. says it works for 4 days, and it does. it&#x27;s fairly complicated at first, but much better after 3 practices. it doesn&#x27;t come off with cleaning tablets. I take mine out once or twice a day to rinse and brush, then rinse with tap hot water to reform the stuff when you put it back in. it reshapes to your mouth. sure hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years now and it is hands down the absolute best denture adhesive available.  It can help you maintain a good fit for even lousy fitting dentures for days at a time.  I have full dentures and I can eat anything when using this adhesive.  It is a thermoplastic that molds easily into you dentures and molds to the contours of your gums creating a great cushion and suction grip.  Best by far!!!!</li>
            <li> Best product I have found for its purpose / product lasts much longer than the box states - 4 days (had it last up to 2-3 weeks depending on amount of heavy chewing - solid - semi solid - soft foods I intake.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> This adhesive was purchased for my mother and she swears by its effectiveness!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with cushion grip its self,it is very comfortable and helps keep my dentures tight . I have been using cushion grip for 3 years and I feel it is the best there is.  I just didn&#x27;t get what I ordered..I ordered a pack of 4 and I only got 2 for $70.00..I have been ordering this for a few months and they were only  $20.00 to $25.00, now the price has more than doubled and  I only got  half the order.I am not happy about that.</li>
            <li> I received this in a very timely manner and do appreciate it.  I can&#x27;t seem to find this product anywhere so I&#x27;ll order it on line from now on.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is the ONLY denture adhesive that I have ever found that holds my lower plate down.  I seriously have tried every adhesive I could find and Cushion Grip is the only one that does what it says it will do.  If you have never tried it - DO IT !!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great product and it is one of a kind.  I hope I will always be able to find it.</li>
            <li> This product was only introduced by word of mouth , my mother told me how great it was ,I would describe like a very thin piece of rubber once applied and then its like a denture that has been relined to fit like new again except its not hard plastic that causes the mouth to get sore if too much pressure from biting into hard foods ( and no added bulk ),as the name says CUSHION GRIP ,it really had multiple functions for myself , I use to have to remove my bottoms to let tender places heal but once I used this I never had any issues ever again ,if it did I just removed the old CUSHION liner and reapply another application of this product and instantly no more tender spots .Its a crying shame they do not make it any longer .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 yrs. and though it doesn&#x27;t have a great taste it keeps my gums and bones in good shape. I don&#x27;t have to have my teeth relines very often, and it keeps my teeth comfortable.</li>
            <li> I would like to know why this product has reached astronomical pricing structure.  This is outrageous for those of us who depend on a product such as this, and there is NOTHING else on the market that even comes close.</li>
            <li> This is NOT an adhesive. It gives you temporary, soft relines, at best. You will still have to reapply every few days, and use denture adhesive along with Cushion Grip. And, this stuff is very difficult to get off your dentures. You have to pick and use tweezers to remove all the old thermoplastic.</li>
            <li> I USED TO BUY THIS AT WALMART BUT LIKE MOST GOOD PRODUCTS THEY QUIT CARRYING IT AND UNTIL I FOUND IT HERE I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE.</li>
            <li> Read all the great reviews. Just got it. Used it followed instructions to the letter. Had an espresso from my beautiful Nespresso&lt;br /&gt;machine. Dentures came out, five minutes later. Poligrip lasts about 6 hours, while eating and drinking, Cushion Grip 5 mins.</li>
            <li> My wife and I followed the advice of other reviewers and nothing worked.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned this is a waste of money.  Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I love cushion Grip it is the one that works the best for me. It keeps everything out from under your gums and on here it was a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with a lot of false hope, boy was I surprised, it works great, just follow the instructions and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you change 1st a week.</li>
            <li> perfect easy to use no more feeling that melting stuff in my mouth from those other other glue products I can drink hot coffee&lt;br /&gt;and no melting so glad I found this product</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip to make my dentures comfortable for at least 25 years.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> This is the best adhesive I have ever used. The only problem was the drugstore price of $7.99. By buying 4 tubes at a time, I am saving 35% off the drugstore price. I have been using this product for 6 months and it is almost like a temporary reline that they say lasts 4 days. (Mine lasts almost a week) before I need to reapply. This is much better than Fixodent or Polygrip where it is a daily routine and messy.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product always.  He tried another product when this wasn&#x27;t available locally and was not happy.  Amazon rescued us from a real problem.  Thank goodness it is now back on the shelf here now, but we know where to turn if the problem happens again.</li>
            <li> Could not get this product to stick to my partial. I tried all the tips and tricks listed on this site.&lt;br /&gt;An expensive mistake since I bought 3 tubes.</li>
            <li> My parents both have false teeth, that really need to be remade. Could not find this stuff locally, and where i could have ordered it off line from a store....It was cheaper here.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years I love it. Hate that it&#x27;s not available.</li>
            <li> Best denture adhesive I&#x27;ve tried. They have taken it off market, get it while you can!!</li>
            <li> Made my 80 year old Mother so happy!</li>
            <li> Watch the expiration dates.  i got this product 4 to a box.  They were dated 2012.  I still tried it but it was all sticky so I ended up making a trip to CVS for some.  Will not buy online again.</li>
            <li> Cushion Gip worked okay but like smaller hole on end of the tube. Get to much when putting in and it runs out when I put dentures in. Would not recommened would try to stay neutral.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years &amp; love it. Easy to use &amp; works great to add a lining to my denture.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product much sooner than I did.  I have had constant pain with my lower denture and the dentist advised very expensive implants that I could not afford.  I saw this quite by accident and thought I&#x27;d give it a try as I&#x27;d tried many other things that did not work for me.  This is just like putting a new soft liner in your denture. And it&#x27;s easy to do.  For the first time in many months I can actually eat pain free!  For me it&#x27;s not so much for the grip but I love the soft cushion and you don&#x27;t have to replace it every day.  I have left it on for up to a week with no problems.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Good product ripoff on price  company took off market because it works now priced a big ripoff</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom, she can&#x27;t find it in stores any more. Was less expensive than the stores and she said this pack would last her months. She swears by Cushion Grip and won&#x27;t use anything else!!!</li>
            <li> Enough said... just buy and use this if you have dentures... comfortable and it works better than most anything else.</li>
            <li> I use this on my bottom plate and it works really good, I recommed it to my other friends for thir denture&#x27;s it hold them in place. Judy</li>
            <li> Shipping is very fast, Great stuff to reline your teeth with, I can&#x27;t eat with out it.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is just Great,I keep this at all times lastes just like it said.</li>
            <li> This is a must have product for partial wearers.  It fills in the gaps so the partial doesn&#x27;t slip when you&#x27;re eating.  It&#x27;s not messy like most denture creams &amp; doesn&#x27;t have to be reapplied for 4 days.  Hope they never stop making this product.</li>
            <li> The product is great. The only problem is that people take advantage of the fact that is in so high demand and is no longer manufactured...where I come from that&#x27;s called putting it to your neighbor. We were able to buy it for a few dollars per tube but now we pay 20 dollars or more per tube.</li>
            <li> delivery was quick and on time.  The product quality is as expected...great.</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip is the answer to dentures that are getting older and not fitting well. The product lasts for days, and even after it starts to lose it&#x27;s grip, I just add a very small amount of denture adhesive to compliment the fit. It takes a little practice to learn how much and where you need it, once you get the hang of it CG works wonders. Plenty of YouTube videos out there as well to help with instructions.</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip Thermoplastic Denture Adhesive, 1-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)&lt;br /&gt;You have to be kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the tube as hot as possible without boiling it, and the stuff is still almost solid. Very difficult to spread on the dentures, and a fifteen-minute job to get it OFF the dentures. Really does not hold them anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Back to Fixodent.&lt;br /&gt;Into the trash with this stuff. .</li>
            <li> This is the best denture adhesive out there.</li>
            <li> Bring this product back</li>
            <li> It works very well and is not available in this area.  Thanks for making this available for my use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I have been using for years. I&#x27;m real sorry that its not made anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my brother used it.  He loved it and it worked well for him.  For me, not so good.  It did not last and my teeth would not stay in.  I am not sure if it is because I have the not got the final pair as my gums are still healing.  Once I get the final pair I will try this again.  At this time I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have experienced difficulty using Cushion Grip adhesive...it will NOT adhere to my lower plate.  I tried every suggestion offered on Amazon.com.reviewers.  4 try&#x27;s later I contacted Merck Cushion Grip&#x27;s manufacturer.  I talked with CSR named Chelsa who researched my problem and after she \\&quot;researched\\&quot; my difficulty she informed me the product will NOT work on dentures with soft liner and may damage my plate!  Just wanted to post this comment in case someone else experiences the same problem.</li>
            <li> Cushion Grip does exactly as I wanted it to do.  Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> Cushion grip is great but I think it is over priced a lot more people would buy it if it was a little cheaper I have a lot of friends that like it but they said they were going to see if they can find something else out there because this is to exspensive for them</li>
            <li> I have new dentures and cushion grip has made it easier for me to eat, and to feel comfortable wearing them</li>
            <li> Most denture adhesives leave a bad taste in your mouth or simply feel yucky. This product is by far the beast out there. There is no taste and it lasts longer then any other product out there. There is no ooze, no slipping and nothing to interfere with the taste of your food.</li>
            <li> Over priced due to shortage of the product.  Its a shame that people who need this product can no longer afford it.  Maybe the manufacturer will see some of the reviews and reconsider their decision to stop producing this much needed and desired product.</li>
