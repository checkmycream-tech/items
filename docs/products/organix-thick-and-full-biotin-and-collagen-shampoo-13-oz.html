            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Afterwards my hair was more manageable and looked fuller!</li>
            <li>It smells like candy and best of all its never tested on animals and sells for under $6.00 at walmart ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>OGX gives me that lift my spirits, pampered situation with every use and the entoxicating fragrance, in a good way, is so delightful too, all at an inspiring, totally reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li>fragrance and consistency is nice</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, consistency and suds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this shampoo &amp; conditioner because I have thinner hair around my crown area and it made that area seem thicker.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if the smell stayed in my hair throughout the day like Pantene ProV or Herbal Essence does.</li>
            <li>good product, washes well, healthy</li>
            <li>Best shampoo i have ever had, very volumizing , thicker, healthy hairs.</li>
            <li>The biotin and keratin organix shampoos definitely smell the best and they&#x27;re both supposed to be good for growing out hair and making it thicker.</li>
            <li>But it cleans fine and smells good.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo by far for me.</li>
            <li>This biotin one is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Right now I use this shampoo with their Coconut milk conditioner, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I have very fine fly-away hair  and using OGX makes it fuller and more manageable.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great, makes my fine hair feel fuller, and came quickly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional thickness but it is ok as affordable shampoo goes.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and leaves my hair silky</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>but I noticed the weight/greasy factor more.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>..makes my hair so healthy..</li>
            <li>love all the products in this line.</li>
            <li>I experienced so much breakage with this product</li>
            <li>and it just looks and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, the head was found plus smooth.</li>
            <li>I really love this line...</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>and my hair seems to have a lot more life</li>
            <li>This product gave me the best results and I recommend it for anyone, especially if your suffering from hair loss.</li>
            <li>I was actually able to bend my hair and shape it more than ever before.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and conditioners that claim to add volume and body.</li>
            <li>love my Amazon</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s also sulfate and paraben free!</li>
            <li>Love it, it works well for me.</li>
            <li>For a company who uses ok ingredients supposedly fragrance is NOT &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; healthy CHEMICAL.</li>
            <li>I do seem to have more body and shine while using this shampoo, so I am going to keep buying it unless I find something better.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but Nexxus VitaTress Biotin Shampoo gives me better results.</li>
            <li>The coconut milk one indeed has a much better smell than the biotin one.</li>
            <li>Try it you will be amazed how sonething so inexpensive works better than some of those over priced hair products.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, great cust.</li>
            <li>For the most part I love Organix products.</li>
            <li>I love OGX shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent out of all the shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li>but this works better than all of them.</li>
            <li>I didnt really have great or noticible results with that one.</li>
            <li>Honestly I love the way this shampoo cleans my hair</li>
            <li>, i wish it smelled better</li>
            <li>fomular is better than biotin conditioner ,but doesnt work for oily hair like most shampoo do ,hair gets oliy after 1 day ,in a unnatural way</li>
            <li>Love the smell and</li>
            <li>I like the results of this better than any of their keratin lines for strait hair days.</li>
            <li>I noted the brand from a girlfriend...and her hair is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>My hair feels and look healthy.</li>
            <li>Good for a fresh conditioner for every day.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it smells and how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I choose this rating because I love it</li>
            <li>The smell of this is interesting.  </li>
            <li>This gave it a the best possible results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent shampoo when you want to make your hair silky, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>To provide some background, I have very fine hair that breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>My hair and fine... very fine..  </li>
            <li>I am able to style my hair much more easily and get the look I want.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after first purchasing the Organix Amplifying lotion which I also loved.</li>
            <li>Amazing, I think I have found a hair regimen that is making my hair grow back, and this is a great cover up shampoo in the meantime.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is nice and mild, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>I bought this because i have really fine hair and really love the look and idea of having thicker hair...</li>
            <li>The Biotin and Collagen conditioner was good, the shampoo not so much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo!</li>
            <li>After rinsing throughly, my hair is easy to comb without conditioner.</li>
            <li>I develop dandruff easy but with this one I seem to have no problems.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it smells sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>But my hair is fine</li>
            <li>would recommend to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I gives my hair volume, shines and leaves my hair smooth, easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and I purchased this shampoo (and conditioner) hoping it would lift up my hair and give it some volume.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it&#x27;s shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is tangle free and fuller after I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the shampoo and switched to my kids allergen free organic type shampoo and</li>
            <li>Thus, I went on a search for another fabulous product to help strengthen my baby-fine, breakage-prone hair.  </li>
            <li>As an alopecia totalis sufferer I enjoy OGX.</li>
            <li>although I saw this product is available at Walmart now</li>
            <li>how smooth my hair is after using this.</li>
            <li>I like it, it makes my hair smell good, and soft</li>
            <li>My hair tangles easily as well, so i still have to use some sort of detangler after showering just to be able to comb it, and even after using these and the root boosting spray, my hair doesn&#x27;t really look any fuller.</li>
            <li>Today was the first time I used this Shampoo and conditioner since they came in today :-)</li>
            <li>after about 2 uses, I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>With naturally fine straight hair, hormonal changes have caused these flaws to be even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a greasy feeling but my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely scent to it that lingers just enough to remind you that your hair smells amazing, and it does legitimately work.</li>
            <li>The smell was wonderful, but there was absolutely no noticeable difference in my hair after finishing the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>They told me they don&#x27;t honor complimentary coupons to their customers (when they can EASILY print one from their computers).</li>
            <li>clean and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s cheaper at amazon than my local drug store, and with amazon prime free shipping, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>So far I love&#x27;ve ALL the products this brand makes!</li>
            <li>It is wonderful and makes my hair feel clean but not heavy or dry.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this stuff and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>and i am glad so much.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does exactly what it says, smells good and with continued use, leaves your hair soft and full of volume.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone - they are also good-sized and a true bargain.  </li>
            <li>I bought this type of shampoo from my local drug store because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I was so embarrassed to pull my hair back after having lost a good amount of it after giving birth.</li>
            <li>Ok so I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>Love the smell, and REALLY cleans hair, but it dries out the hair as well.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It lathers very well, and my hair feels very clean.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products including expensive salon product but this along with the lotion is the best I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I have the Organix Moroccan oil hair mask and have to use that whenever I use this in order for my hair not to look super damaged, which it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I, like most probably, had high expectations for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, so I decide to purchase the OGX conditioner as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always seen this line at the drugstore and thought it was another one of those pretty looking shampoos that dont really work.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many products on my hair to make it fuller/thicker/stronger.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it made my hair fall out!</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful addition to my long hair treatment collection!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe the smell exactly, but it is clean.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine straight hair and this formula gives my hair body without drying it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and moisturizing and smells awesome!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really hoped this shampoo would fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Personally I think it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>But, is it still worth buying?</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the natural products for hair but nothing works for me.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with super fine hair even if its short just to give it more volume.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair and not a lot of it, I would highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li>Comb runs right through it.</li>
            <li>May be right for someone else, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine oily hair and wash it every day to look a little better.</li>
            <li>However, it has seemed to become a bit stronger, which is good for a person who loses hair easily.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean and rich, feels better than washing with other generic stuff for sure.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp hair that falls out easily, and decided to give this</li>
            <li>; It makes my fine, stringy hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Some shampoos that I have tried cause more breakage than others, which results in my hair looking thinner overall.  </li>
            <li>Just received these and just did my first wash with them...</li>
            <li>will definitely be purchasing some more of these soon</li>
            <li>, amazingly enough it seemed to give me even more volume than the lotion alone.</li>
            <li>My hair turns to be soft and light after using it.</li>
            <li>I wanted more volume but definitely not at the price of hair loss.</li>
            <li>It even makes the curl hold longer when I use a curling iron or hot rollers.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for the first time about a year ago at meijers.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo about a week ago and after using it for the first time my scalp began to get irritated.</li>
            <li>Other over the counter products are much better!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will only use organix after years of searching for my favorite brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>I will gladly purchase from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo...and bonus; it is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>This Shampoo makes my hair feel and look so much healthier!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been switching this with the new Tsubaki line from OGX and holy mother of twinkies, that stuff also smells amazing and gives instant results.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with that because it looks much nicer after only 4 days.</li>
            <li>And if Amazon happens to increase the price or stop carrying it, you can pick it up cheaply at the major discount stores.</li>
            <li>I will be using this until I stumble on something better.</li>
            <li>This works great for my coarse fine hair whether i want to blow dry, air dry, curl or brush</li>
            <li>Super soft, manageable hair that just feels...</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair, this product definitely made my hair feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li>This shampoo gets my hair very clean without leaving it feeling stripped or overly dry.</li>
            <li>I purchased a couple of different shampoo&#x27;s after seeing the Prograin I used before was no longer available at a affordable price.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it really meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I like this, but sometimes I am unsure if it is really cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>Gentle and does add body to my very baby fine,thin hair..</li>
            <li>This works it really works.</li>
            <li>I hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I used it for 3 days straight</li>
            <li>This is the second bottle I bought, I also use their  conditioner which smells fantastic but use sparingly</li>
            <li>Before using this, my hair just literally stuck straight out, no matter how much I tried shaping it.</li>
            <li>Plus, I really don&#x27;t care much for gender norms</li>
            <li>But in terms of body and volume, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>I started using this with it&#x27;s conditioner and amplifying lotion about a month ago and after about a week I started to notice that my hair was much fuller.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair so much thicker.</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair really well</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stuff really dries out my hair and makes it straw</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>My wife loves it, Her hairdresser highly recommended it!</li>
            <li>The conditioner was also very runny.</li>
            <li>but this product really does give the appearance of thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been mitigating the buildup by using a clarifying shampoo once or twice a week when my hair starts to feel too oily, and that&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li>Nothing made much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen the real color for ages).</li>
            <li>My hair is almost to my waist, and the weight of it precludes much volume at the crown.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the Organix shampoos and conditioners and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still flat and still fine looking.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other of their shampoos because I love this one so much</li>
            <li>makes my hair very soft and straight!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine straight hair that almost reaches to mid-back.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a lot better than some of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I usually use the brazilian straight shampoo and conditioner so this is a nice change.</li>
            <li>I have long light brown hair</li>
            <li>Not fresh and appealing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 40s and have extremely thin, fine hair - to the point the top of my head gets sunburned.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised with the results especially considering how relatively cheap it is at $5.74 a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an older product since I take forever to go through conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo to one whos hair is thining.</li>
            <li>My hair does seem to be a little more greasy by the end of the day</li>
            <li>I just had to get a bunch of hair cut off to make it feel normal again.</li>
            <li>Smells good and makes my thin hair appear shiny and fuller.</li>
            <li>With it being baby fine and long, it is pretty flat.</li>
            <li>As with most volumizing products, it&#x27;s not intensely moisturizing but not super drying either, so if you have hair that needs a lot of moisture you should alternate this one with something that gives more nourishment.</li>
            <li>I purchased the OGX Shampoo, Thick &amp; Full Biotin based on Amazon reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine blonde hair that is very long, colored, and moderately damaged, and it made my hair look full, lively, and shiny after one use.</li>
            <li>Also The OGX is a new name for Organix Company.</li>
            <li>It can be used for a long time, i expect more benefits in the long time.</li>
            <li>My hair feels fuller and very soft.</li>
            <li>I buy this shampoo at our local department store all the time and like it very much.</li>
            <li>Made my fine, slightly wavy hair feel straw-like and fly-away.</li>
            <li>The last time I went to my stylist the first thing she said was &amp;#34;Okay</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and after one shampoo, my hair felt healthier and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my 3rd bottle using this shampoo, but my first time ordering it online.  </li>
            <li>just wow!</li>
            <li>It use to be really fine and limp.</li>
            <li>so far i see a difference in the thickness and fullness.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old, color my hair and my hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair seem thicker and still is soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally shiny and soft</li>
            <li>I have thick, straight beautiful asian hair but had an excessive hair shedding problem.</li>
            <li>hair soft and silky</li>
            <li>The smell is like an old grandma&#x27;s stinky perfume.</li>
            <li>at least it smelled more than it does</li>
            <li>Not heavy, waxy, oily, or stripping.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural (salt and pepper) color, and it has been SLOOOOOW going.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- fades color (not so much of a con for me, except it&#x27;s turning a bit orange, but might be a con for those who actually want to keep coloring their hair)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>I was positively surprised with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>love the Organix line of products, it softens my white hair without leaving it limp, I also use the conditioner</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle of Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>&quot; My hair is really thin and it just kinda stands on its own.</li>
            <li>hope I get long long long hair soon :-)</li>
            <li>I came across this shampoo and noticed the product description said nothing of sulfate (which I was excited about because we all know how harsh Sulfate is) and it also contained biotin and collagen and all these proteins which is so beneficial to hair.</li>
            <li>I have less hair than when I was younger and it  is baby fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, natural AA hair that I flatiron to get straight twice a month.</li>
            <li>Normally, I am always buying different shampoos ranging in all types of prices.</li>
            <li>However, when I started using this conditioner in conjunction with the conditioner every other wash and a shampoo brush, my hair is lovely and never feels stripped or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, poker straight hair.</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo as I have fine and thin hair and really wanted something to perk it up.</li>
            <li>My nephew has thinning hair, and now he prefers OGX Thick and Full too!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use either of the shampoos for very long to get really noticeable results</li>
            <li>I started using OGX Thick and Full shampoo a few months ago and was surprised by its rich lather and scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different expensive salon type shampoos and I am actually more satisfied with this than any of the other shampoos I have used.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it said it gives hair the APPEARANCE of being thick and full which seems less deceiving than a shampoo that claims to actually MAKE your hair thick and full.</li>
            <li>Switching back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>but the second day it would look greasy and not fluffy anymore.</li>
            <li>i just dont like conditioner feel of it! :O</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own if I use the wrong shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have used everything from salon expensive products, to highly popular drugstore products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>BUT my hair feels softer and much cleaner as oppose to big marketed shampoos like Pantene that just make my hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li>no less than 4 friends have the same issues with them.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is seems this line is no longer available in stores I shop.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything different.</li>
            <li>I have never seen so many broken ends left in the tub after washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>So guys, I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner pairing if you have thin hair that loves to do its own thing, I have Asian-esque straight thin hair that just kinda stands up on</li>
            <li>Again I do not feel I am giving it a fair trial due to the extremely cold climate I live.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily comb through my hair with the shampoo in it which is almost impossible with other shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and none of them worked for me, and when I started washing my hair with this shampoo I started to see my hair growing thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- much less breakage (not seeing as much hair in my brush or</li>
            <li>I love this brand, I have had issues with my hair thinning the past few years.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, with certain conditions, we can forget to pamper ourselves, just even a little.</li>
            <li>Literally after ONE use of this shampoo and the [[ASIN:B00ADR6M2U Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Conditioner, 13 Ounce]] of the same type, my hair was definitely thicker and a lot easier to style and manage.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that is very thin where you can easily see my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I used to buy it  from my local HEB because the price was good even though the smell is bad.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Afterwards my hair was more manageable and looked fuller!</li>
            <li> It smells like candy and best of all its never tested on animals and sells for under $6.00 at walmart ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> OGX gives me that lift my spirits, pampered situation with every use and the entoxicating fragrance, in a good way, is so delightful too, all at an inspiring, totally reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice scent to it as well.</li>
            <li> fragrance and consistency is nice</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, consistency and suds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked this shampoo &amp; conditioner because I have thinner hair around my crown area and it made that area seem thicker.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if the smell stayed in my hair throughout the day like Pantene ProV or Herbal Essence does.</li>
            <li> good product, washes well, healthy</li>
            <li> Best shampoo i have ever had, very volumizing , thicker, healthy hairs.</li>
            <li> The biotin and keratin organix shampoos definitely smell the best and they&#x27;re both supposed to be good for growing out hair and making it thicker.</li>
            <li> But it cleans fine and smells good.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo by far for me.</li>
            <li> This biotin one is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> Right now I use this shampoo with their Coconut milk conditioner, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine fly-away hair  and using OGX makes it fuller and more manageable.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, makes my fine hair feel fuller, and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional thickness but it is ok as affordable shampoo goes.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and leaves my hair silky</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> but I noticed the weight/greasy factor more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> ..makes my hair so healthy..</li>
            <li> love all the products in this line.</li>
            <li> I experienced so much breakage with this product</li>
            <li> and it just looks and feels so much better.  </li>
            <li> I liked it, the head was found plus smooth.</li>
            <li> I really love this line...</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> and my hair seems to have a lot more life</li>
            <li> This product gave me the best results and I recommend it for anyone, especially if your suffering from hair loss.</li>
            <li> I was actually able to bend my hair and shape it more than ever before.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and conditioners that claim to add volume and body.</li>
            <li> love my Amazon</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s also sulfate and paraben free!</li>
            <li> Love it, it works well for me.</li>
            <li> For a company who uses ok ingredients supposedly fragrance is NOT &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; healthy CHEMICAL.</li>
            <li> I do seem to have more body and shine while using this shampoo, so I am going to keep buying it unless I find something better.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but Nexxus VitaTress Biotin Shampoo gives me better results.</li>
            <li> The coconut milk one indeed has a much better smell than the biotin one.</li>
            <li> Try it you will be amazed how sonething so inexpensive works better than some of those over priced hair products.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, great cust.</li>
            <li> For the most part I love Organix products.</li>
            <li> I love OGX shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent out of all the shampoos I have tried.</li>
            <li> but this works better than all of them.</li>
            <li> I didnt really have great or noticible results with that one.</li>
            <li> Honestly I love the way this shampoo cleans my hair</li>
            <li> , i wish it smelled better</li>
            <li> fomular is better than biotin conditioner ,but doesnt work for oily hair like most shampoo do ,hair gets oliy after 1 day ,in a unnatural way</li>
            <li> Love the smell and</li>
            <li> I like the results of this better than any of their keratin lines for strait hair days.</li>
            <li> I noted the brand from a girlfriend...and her hair is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love it .</li>
            <li> My hair feels and look healthy.</li>
            <li> Good for a fresh conditioner for every day.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it smells and how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I love it</li>
            <li> The smell of this is interesting.  </li>
            <li> This gave it a the best possible results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent shampoo when you want to make your hair silky, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li> To provide some background, I have very fine hair that breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> My hair and fine... very fine..  </li>
            <li> I am able to style my hair much more easily and get the look I want.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after first purchasing the Organix Amplifying lotion which I also loved.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I think I have found a hair regimen that is making my hair grow back, and this is a great cover up shampoo in the meantime.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is nice and mild, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have really fine hair and really love the look and idea of having thicker hair...</li>
            <li> The Biotin and Collagen conditioner was good, the shampoo not so much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo!</li>
            <li> After rinsing throughly, my hair is easy to comb without conditioner.</li>
            <li> I develop dandruff easy but with this one I seem to have no problems.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it smells sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> But my hair is fine</li>
            <li> would recommend to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I gives my hair volume, shines and leaves my hair smooth, easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and I purchased this shampoo (and conditioner) hoping it would lift up my hair and give it some volume.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it&#x27;s shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is tangle free and fuller after I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the shampoo and switched to my kids allergen free organic type shampoo and</li>
            <li> Thus, I went on a search for another fabulous product to help strengthen my baby-fine, breakage-prone hair.  </li>
            <li> As an alopecia totalis sufferer I enjoy OGX.</li>
            <li> although I saw this product is available at Walmart now</li>
            <li> how smooth my hair is after using this.</li>
            <li> I like it, it makes my hair smell good, and soft</li>
            <li> My hair tangles easily as well, so i still have to use some sort of detangler after showering just to be able to comb it, and even after using these and the root boosting spray, my hair doesn&#x27;t really look any fuller.</li>
            <li> Today was the first time I used this Shampoo and conditioner since they came in today :-)</li>
            <li> after about 2 uses, I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> With naturally fine straight hair, hormonal changes have caused these flaws to be even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a greasy feeling but my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely scent to it that lingers just enough to remind you that your hair smells amazing, and it does legitimately work.</li>
            <li> The smell was wonderful, but there was absolutely no noticeable difference in my hair after finishing the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> They told me they don&#x27;t honor complimentary coupons to their customers (when they can EASILY print one from their computers).</li>
            <li> clean and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s cheaper at amazon than my local drug store, and with amazon prime free shipping, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> So far I love&#x27;ve ALL the products this brand makes!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and makes my hair feel clean but not heavy or dry.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this stuff and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> and i am glad so much.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does exactly what it says, smells good and with continued use, leaves your hair soft and full of volume.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone - they are also good-sized and a true bargain.  </li>
            <li> I bought this type of shampoo from my local drug store because of all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I was so embarrassed to pull my hair back after having lost a good amount of it after giving birth.</li>
            <li> Ok so I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and REALLY cleans hair, but it dries out the hair as well.</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It lathers very well, and my hair feels very clean.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products including expensive salon product but this along with the lotion is the best I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I have the Organix Moroccan oil hair mask and have to use that whenever I use this in order for my hair not to look super damaged, which it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I, like most probably, had high expectations for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, so I decide to purchase the OGX conditioner as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always seen this line at the drugstore and thought it was another one of those pretty looking shampoos that dont really work.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many products on my hair to make it fuller/thicker/stronger.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it made my hair fall out!</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful addition to my long hair treatment collection!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe the smell exactly, but it is clean.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine straight hair and this formula gives my hair body without drying it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and moisturizing and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really hoped this shampoo would fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Personally I think it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> But, is it still worth buying?</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the natural products for hair but nothing works for me.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with super fine hair even if its short just to give it more volume.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair and not a lot of it, I would highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> Comb runs right through it.</li>
            <li> May be right for someone else, but not for me.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine oily hair and wash it every day to look a little better.</li>
            <li> However, it has seemed to become a bit stronger, which is good for a person who loses hair easily.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair clean and rich, feels better than washing with other generic stuff for sure.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair that falls out easily, and decided to give this</li>
            <li> ; It makes my fine, stringy hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Some shampoos that I have tried cause more breakage than others, which results in my hair looking thinner overall.  </li>
            <li> Just received these and just did my first wash with them...</li>
            <li> will definitely be purchasing some more of these soon</li>
            <li> , amazingly enough it seemed to give me even more volume than the lotion alone.</li>
            <li> My hair turns to be soft and light after using it.</li>
            <li> I wanted more volume but definitely not at the price of hair loss.</li>
            <li> It even makes the curl hold longer when I use a curling iron or hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for the first time about a year ago at meijers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo about a week ago and after using it for the first time my scalp began to get irritated.</li>
            <li> Other over the counter products are much better!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I will only use organix after years of searching for my favorite brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> I will gladly purchase from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo...and bonus; it is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> This Shampoo makes my hair feel and look so much healthier!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching this with the new Tsubaki line from OGX and holy mother of twinkies, that stuff also smells amazing and gives instant results.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ok with that because it looks much nicer after only 4 days.</li>
            <li> And if Amazon happens to increase the price or stop carrying it, you can pick it up cheaply at the major discount stores.</li>
            <li> I will be using this until I stumble on something better.</li>
            <li> This works great for my coarse fine hair whether i want to blow dry, air dry, curl or brush</li>
            <li> Super soft, manageable hair that just feels...</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair, this product definitely made my hair feel and look thicker.</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets my hair very clean without leaving it feeling stripped or overly dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple of different shampoo&#x27;s after seeing the Prograin I used before was no longer available at a affordable price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it really meets my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I like this, but sometimes I am unsure if it is really cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li> Gentle and does add body to my very baby fine,thin hair..</li>
            <li> This works it really works.</li>
            <li> I hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 days straight</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I bought, I also use their  conditioner which smells fantastic but use sparingly</li>
            <li> Before using this, my hair just literally stuck straight out, no matter how much I tried shaping it.</li>
            <li> Plus, I really don&#x27;t care much for gender norms</li>
            <li> But in terms of body and volume, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> I started using this with it&#x27;s conditioner and amplifying lotion about a month ago and after about a week I started to notice that my hair was much fuller.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair so much thicker.</li>
            <li> It cleans my hair really well</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stuff really dries out my hair and makes it straw</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, Her hairdresser highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> The conditioner was also very runny.</li>
            <li> but this product really does give the appearance of thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been mitigating the buildup by using a clarifying shampoo once or twice a week when my hair starts to feel too oily, and that&#x27;s really helped.</li>
            <li> Nothing made much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen the real color for ages).</li>
            <li> My hair is almost to my waist, and the weight of it precludes much volume at the crown.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Organix shampoos and conditioners and this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still flat and still fine looking.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other of their shampoos because I love this one so much</li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft and straight!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine straight hair that almost reaches to mid-back.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a lot better than some of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I usually use the brazilian straight shampoo and conditioner so this is a nice change.</li>
            <li> I have long light brown hair</li>
            <li> Not fresh and appealing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s and have extremely thin, fine hair - to the point the top of my head gets sunburned.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised with the results especially considering how relatively cheap it is at $5.74 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older product since I take forever to go through conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shampoo to one whos hair is thining.</li>
            <li> My hair does seem to be a little more greasy by the end of the day</li>
            <li> I just had to get a bunch of hair cut off to make it feel normal again.</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes my thin hair appear shiny and fuller.</li>
            <li> With it being baby fine and long, it is pretty flat.</li>
            <li> As with most volumizing products, it&#x27;s not intensely moisturizing but not super drying either, so if you have hair that needs a lot of moisture you should alternate this one with something that gives more nourishment.</li>
            <li> I purchased the OGX Shampoo, Thick &amp; Full Biotin based on Amazon reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine blonde hair that is very long, colored, and moderately damaged, and it made my hair look full, lively, and shiny after one use.</li>
            <li> Also The OGX is a new name for Organix Company.</li>
            <li> It can be used for a long time, i expect more benefits in the long time.</li>
            <li> My hair feels fuller and very soft.</li>
            <li> I buy this shampoo at our local department store all the time and like it very much.</li>
            <li> Made my fine, slightly wavy hair feel straw-like and fly-away.</li>
            <li> The last time I went to my stylist the first thing she said was &amp;#34;Okay</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and after one shampoo, my hair felt healthier and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my 3rd bottle using this shampoo, but my first time ordering it online.  </li>
            <li> just wow!</li>
            <li> It use to be really fine and limp.</li>
            <li> so far i see a difference in the thickness and fullness.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old, color my hair and my hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair seem thicker and still is soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally shiny and soft</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight beautiful asian hair but had an excessive hair shedding problem.</li>
            <li> hair soft and silky</li>
            <li> The smell is like an old grandma&#x27;s stinky perfume.</li>
            <li> at least it smelled more than it does</li>
            <li> Not heavy, waxy, oily, or stripping.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural (salt and pepper) color, and it has been SLOOOOOW going.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- fades color (not so much of a con for me, except it&#x27;s turning a bit orange, but might be a con for those who actually want to keep coloring their hair)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> I was positively surprised with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> love the Organix line of products, it softens my white hair without leaving it limp, I also use the conditioner</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> &quot; My hair is really thin and it just kinda stands on its own.</li>
            <li> hope I get long long long hair soon :-)</li>
            <li> I came across this shampoo and noticed the product description said nothing of sulfate (which I was excited about because we all know how harsh Sulfate is) and it also contained biotin and collagen and all these proteins which is so beneficial to hair.</li>
            <li> I have less hair than when I was younger and it  is baby fine.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, natural AA hair that I flatiron to get straight twice a month.</li>
            <li> Normally, I am always buying different shampoos ranging in all types of prices.</li>
            <li> However, when I started using this conditioner in conjunction with the conditioner every other wash and a shampoo brush, my hair is lovely and never feels stripped or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, poker straight hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo as I have fine and thin hair and really wanted something to perk it up.</li>
            <li> My nephew has thinning hair, and now he prefers OGX Thick and Full too!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use either of the shampoos for very long to get really noticeable results</li>
            <li> I started using OGX Thick and Full shampoo a few months ago and was surprised by its rich lather and scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different expensive salon type shampoos and I am actually more satisfied with this than any of the other shampoos I have used.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, it said it gives hair the APPEARANCE of being thick and full which seems less deceiving than a shampoo that claims to actually MAKE your hair thick and full.</li>
            <li> Switching back to my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> but the second day it would look greasy and not fluffy anymore.</li>
            <li> i just dont like conditioner feel of it! :O</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own if I use the wrong shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used everything from salon expensive products, to highly popular drugstore products.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> BUT my hair feels softer and much cleaner as oppose to big marketed shampoos like Pantene that just make my hair brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> no less than 4 friends have the same issues with them.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is seems this line is no longer available in stores I shop.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything different.</li>
            <li> I have never seen so many broken ends left in the tub after washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> So guys, I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner pairing if you have thin hair that loves to do its own thing, I have Asian-esque straight thin hair that just kinda stands up on</li>
            <li> Again I do not feel I am giving it a fair trial due to the extremely cold climate I live.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily comb through my hair with the shampoo in it which is almost impossible with other shampoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and none of them worked for me, and when I started washing my hair with this shampoo I started to see my hair growing thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- much less breakage (not seeing as much hair in my brush or</li>
            <li> I love this brand, I have had issues with my hair thinning the past few years.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, with certain conditions, we can forget to pamper ourselves, just even a little.</li>
            <li> Literally after ONE use of this shampoo and the [[ASIN:B00ADR6M2U Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Conditioner, 13 Ounce]] of the same type, my hair was definitely thicker and a lot easier to style and manage.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is very thin where you can easily see my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy it  from my local HEB because the price was good even though the smell is bad.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, strait, very soft, hair that is slightly oily.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all (which I find fine, but those of you who like scented hair products may be disappointed) and both the shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel like straw, even when wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick right now.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find products that really provide softness and fullness without weighting it down too much.  </li>
            <li> Really dissapointed especially for such a small bottle at a $6+ price tag.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair flat every time I&#x27;ve tried this brand</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s turned into a disaster with flat greasy hair, I&#x27;m done with organix they do not work for my hair or</li>
            <li> After my first wash my hair was really thick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my thin hair feels greasy and oily quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-late 20&#x27;s, fine, long hair that has been thinning noticibely (to me at least) for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might use this on my dog instead as it&#x27;s been too long since I&#x27;ve bought it to return it.</li>
            <li> I started going bald long before I started using this</li>
            <li> i regret polluting my head with sulfates for so long</li>
            <li> (well, it&#x27;s probably a lot grey</li>
            <li> I feel like this makes the damage less apparent.</li>
            <li> When I came back with dry hair it was thick and soft!</li>
            <li> My hair is no different than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> So I have also been using Lipogaine Big 3 when every other day, and using this on the off days.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo - doesn&#x27;t leave that overly dry feeling that lots of others do.</li>
            <li> I just wash it and don&#x27;t even have to blow dry it</li>
            <li> Also, it does dry my hair out</li>
            <li> After a while I realized my hair was brittle &amp; dry</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo, Kaaral Purify Volume, has become nearly impossible to find in the liter-sized bottle and since the 8 ounce bottle is only about $3 less, I won&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> I previously had braids in my hair, so I&#x27;m back to washing my hair every week.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it&#x27;s pretty flat and without volume, but it&#x27;s also on the dry side</li>
            <li> was very dry.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping for more &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; but unfortunately, for me this made my hair very limp.</li>
            <li> Tossing it--and the conditioner--after two tries.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amaaaazing when my hair is wet out of the shower, but once it dries the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> , I bought the keratin oil (pink bottle) shampoo and conditioner as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and have had mixed results.</li>
            <li> Nice, thick lather but not too crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down nor does it dry it out, but by the end of the week, my hair definitely needs a little conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I even went through the phase where I believed horse shampoo (AKA Mane&#x27;n&#x27;Tail) could actually make my hair grow long and thick.</li>
            <li> All of the OGX shampoo contain no SLS, so I immediately gave it a try when i found this product while still using a conditioner from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottles look small but  last long&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use conditioners, but I am tempted to try the companion conditioner next.</li>
            <li> I have lots of damage due to bleaching and heat styling.  </li>
            <li> After switching to another product with no breakage I realized that biotin should be ingested and not applied topically (for me at least).</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the dealio: I&#x27;m a 20 year old dude with very straight,thin hair who was being constantly disappointed when my barber kept telling me \\&quot;I can&#x27;t give you that style with your hair</li>
            <li> and I felt it weighed my hair down....</li>
            <li> Anything I have put on it weighs it down...</li>
            <li> do not like, leaves hair weighed down, not what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> It came half empty!!</li>
            <li> cause i curl it once half a year.</li>
            <li> I was going to try the men&#x27;s version of this formula(same brand) but it listed less ingredients than this one.</li>
            <li> Hair feels healthier and less frizzy</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week of using it, the amount of my hair shedding was substantially less than before.</li>
            <li> and I feel like less hair falls out while using this.</li>
            <li> As a soldier, my hair spends 95% of its life wrapped tightly in a bun.</li>
            <li> the consistency is thick, so a little  goes a long way......</li>
            <li> Seems to be less harsh as well.</li>
            <li> I have used biotin pills which helped a little</li>
            <li> shampoo is awful, made my head itch all the next day, and I have thin flat hair, this made it worse the next day, very oily too, the only time my hair looks good is the day I wash my hair, but after that, looks really bad!!</li>
            <li> My hair was limp and would not even hold the style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo exclusively for a few months and my hair is noticeably thicker and shinier.</li>
            <li> , it makes it fluffy, it has lots of body and volume, doesn&#x27;t fade my color.</li>
            <li> (conditioner is too heavy for my hair), and I condition before I shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I threw both bottles out, then contacted Organix to ask them to send me out a replacement coupon/product after all the trouble I went through.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing faster, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any thicker, and I get a LOT of product buildup after a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I began using one or the other with a different product when in the shower to help get rid of that weird straw like feeling.</li>
            <li> my hair is already long just thin</li>
            <li> Hair becomes thick and fluffy feeling，great experience！</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for the past 4 months or so</li>
            <li> and I can go longer between washes without my hair getting limp!</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to be heavily perfumed which I thought might be the cause or at least one of them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soooo very heavily perfumed</li>
            <li> Prior to using this my hair looked thin, lifeless, and unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser commented how thick my hair was.</li>
            <li> Does make hair feel thick</li>
            <li> Which means it&#x27;s suppose to grow out your hair not damage it pretty bad!</li>
            <li> It weighed my hair down and made my follicles very thin looking.</li>
            <li> The product itself left my hair damaged really bad.</li>
            <li> This stuff is no good.</li>
            <li> As long as you buy this company&#x27;s bad products and give them your money, they have no desire for customer service.</li>
            <li> I mean it says biotin!</li>
            <li> My hairs medium thin</li>
            <li> I just was never happy, until I try this shampoo.</li>
            <li> so I can get past this awkward transition.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is very poor and not good!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t this weird?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have color treated hair, and this shampoo/conditioner combo left a terrible residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair unmanageable and unable to be styled.</li>
            <li> I have expensive formulas in my arsenal</li>
            <li> It has a weird texture....</li>
            <li> Plus my hair has been breaking at the spot where the color ends, so I have these random stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, but when I use this shampoo my hair feels a lot thicker and is easier to style.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid that this shampoo/conditioner would take some time to kick in.</li>
            <li> My hair tangles bad when roller setting.</li>
            <li> STUNK bad</li>
            <li> They smell bad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this shampoo is one of the worst I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> drove me crazy!  </li>
            <li> It was a very bad experience for me</li>
            <li> Am really very disappointed it is no longer being made...</li>
            <li> it was horrible.</li>
            <li> My hair was horribly damaged and I&#x27;d had to hack a bunch of it off to get rid of damaged ends.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any additional thickness but it is ok as affordable shampoo goes.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and leaves my hair silky</li>
            <li> Hair becomes thick and fluffy feeling，great experience！</li>
            <li> My hair and fine... very fine..  so I was hoping for that miracle volumizing shampoo ...  Still haven&#x27;t found it!  But it cleans fine and smells good.</li>
            <li> I like it, it makes my hair smell good, and soft and it nourishes my scalp</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo - doesn&#x27;t leave that overly dry feeling that lots of others do.</li>
            <li> To provide some background, I have very fine hair that breaks easily.  Some shampoos that I have tried cause more breakage than others, which results in my hair looking thinner overall.  I am always on the lookout for a shampoo that promises thicker, healthier hair.  Unfortunately, this shampoo is one of the worst I have ever tried.  I have never seen so many broken ends left in the tub after washing my hair.  On top of that, it smells sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, I have had issues with my hair thinning the past few years. So anything that would give me volume, I would try. I have been using this shampoo for the past 4 months or so and I wouldn&#x27;t change it. It smells amazing! And I can definitely see the difference. My hair feels fuller and very soft. Right now I use this shampoo with their Coconut milk conditioner, and it works great. I haven&#x27;t tried any other of their shampoos because I love this one so much but they have a lot of different options for different types of hair.</li>
            <li> I was having oily hair issues for quite some time. However, when I started using this conditioner in conjunction with the conditioner every other wash and a shampoo brush, my hair is lovely and never feels stripped or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. I have fine, thin, poker straight hair. Was hoping for more &amp;#34;fullness&amp;#34; but unfortunately, for me this made my hair very limp. I used this shampoo and conditioner, and then styled as I always do with the product I&#x27;ve always used. My hair was limp and would not even hold the style. Switching back to my old shampoo. This did not work for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. But my hair is fine and I felt it weighed my hair down.... Made it kinda greasy faster, instead of giving it body. Maybe it did give it body? but I noticed the weight/greasy factor more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. ..makes my hair so healthy.. it&#x27;s growing like a weed.</li>
            <li> love all the products in this line. so far i see a difference in the thickness and fullness. would recommend to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I, like most probably, had high expectations for this shampoo. It smells perfumey but not in an offensive way. The product itself left my hair damaged really bad. I have fine, thin, natural AA hair that I flatiron to get straight twice a month. I experienced so much breakage with this product it was horrible. I tried again and again b/c I was in denial about this being the culprit. After switching to another product with no breakage I realized that biotin should be ingested and not applied topically (for me at least).</li>
            <li> This is a very good shampoo but it does not make your hair thicker.  It gives the appearance of being thicker which is what it states on the back of the label.</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely did not do me well!! The first time I used it it made my hair fall out! Like a big chunk of it!! So I said maybe it&#x27;s an accident and maybe the shampoo has nothing to do with it so I gave it another shot and the same thing happened! It made my hair fall out a lot in the shower!! I did not seem to have any hair fall out problems before using it! Isn&#x27;t this weird? I mean it says biotin! Which means it&#x27;s suppose to grow out your hair not damage it pretty bad! Also the smell is very poor and not good! It was a very bad experience for me I&#x27;m just gonna throw out the bottle in the garbage!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo by far for me. It also works well with the conditioner. I would highly recommend this shampoo to one whos hair is thining.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and makes my hair feel clean but not heavy or dry.  Seems to be less harsh as well.</li>
            <li> Have been using Oxo biotin shampoo for about a month now and am extremely happy with the results.  I have tried several different expensive salon type shampoos and I am actually more satisfied with this than any of the other shampoos I have used.  I am 58 years old, color my hair and my hair was very dry.  This shampoo combined with their Keratin conditioner makes my hair shiny silky and it just looks and feels so much better.  I was surprised with the results especially considering how relatively cheap it is at $5.74 a bottle.  And if Amazon happens to increase the price or stop carrying it, you can pick it up cheaply at the major discount stores.</li>
            <li> Great volume and hair appears thicker!</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple of different shampoo&#x27;s after seeing the Prograin I used before was no longer available at a affordable price.This was the best of the 3....nice lavender smell also.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it really meets my expectations.  It makes my hair look thicker and fuller after each wash.</li>
            <li> I liked it, the head was found plus smooth.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo i have ever had, very volumizing , thicker, healthy hairs. Use with conditioner. I bought 3 quantity and i am glad so much.</li>
            <li> I like this, but sometimes I am unsure if it is really cleaning my hair. Sometimes my hair feels straw-like after and sometimes it&#x27;s shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! I always used salon products, I have tried so so many of those and nothing made my hair feel as good as this stuff! Highly recommend for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick right now. This product truly does what it says. This product along with my Shima Oil go great together.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does exactly what it says, smells good and with continued use, leaves your hair soft and full of volume.  Quite a generous amount in the bottle, and the consistency is thick, so a little  goes a long way......Cindy T Antioch Ca</li>
            <li> love the Organix line of products, it softens my white hair without leaving it limp, I also use the conditioner</li>
            <li> Leaves a film on my hair. Hair did appear noticeably thicker but that change in texture of my hair was not something I could tolerate. It wasn&#x27;t a greasy feeling but my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> I believe these two products are making my hair healthier and thicker.  I would recommend to anyone - they are also good-sized and a true bargain.  Very good buy!</li>
            <li> My second review for the Oxg Biotin,collagen line.... To me Biotin,collagen is a wonderful addition for any Hair,products... My only complaint is seems this line is no longer available in stores I shop. Am really very disappointed it is no longer being made... Also to add I have tried to contact the Company and no replies for my questions... I really love this line... Shampoo is wonderful.. Gentle and does add body to my very baby fine,thin hair..</li>
            <li> This shampoo gets my hair very clean without leaving it feeling stripped or overly dry.</li>
            <li> Made my fine, slightly wavy hair feel straw-like and fly-away. Tossing it--and the conditioner--after two tries. Smells like talcum powder, too. Not fresh and appealing.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive biotin conditioner, I use it with my Regenepure products.  I love the way it makes my hair feel.  Especially after using a Ketoconazole product</li>
            <li> Smells good, I think its working! I&#x27;ve been using this line for about two months and have noticed my hair thickening!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for me. After my first wash my hair was really thick. I previously had braids in my hair, so I&#x27;m back to washing my hair every week. I wash my hair with this shampoo and I condition my hair with the coconut milk made by the same company. My hair has body and volume. I clip my ends and watch my hair grow.</li>
            <li> Just received these and just did my first wash with them... they are amazing and leave your hair feeling great.. 2 thumbs up! will definitely be purchasing some more of these soon</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have really fine hair and really love the look and idea of having thicker hair...my hair is already long just thin so I&#x27;ve tried adding extensions in my hair just for the fullness and also tried the horse shampoo (mane and tail) which by the way does not work anyways to get to the point this stuff works which will now be my permanent shampoo i also use the conditioner so not only did I notice the fullness of my hair but when i went to work I was asked if I had weave in my hair so I 100% would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two years now. I can&#x27;t say that I have seen results from it, but I do like the way it leaves my hair, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using products that my wife no longer uses. It does a good job, and it does not smell like flowers.. I can&#x27;t describe the smell exactly, but it is clean.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Shampoo.  I am very pleased.  It makes my hair seem thicker and still is soft.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair and not a lot of it, I would highly recommend you try this. I just wash it and don&#x27;t even have to blow dry it and my hair seems to have a lot more life and I can go longer between washes without my hair getting limp!</li>
            <li> Today was the first time I used this Shampoo and conditioner since they came in today :-) Smells good, hope I get long long long hair soon :-)</li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair that falls out easily, and decided to give this and it&#x27;s conditioner counterpart a try. It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent at all (which I find fine, but those of you who like scented hair products may be disappointed) and both the shampoo and conditioner make my hair feel like straw, even when wet. My hair tangles easily as well, so i still have to use some sort of detangler after showering just to be able to comb it, and even after using these and the root boosting spray, my hair doesn&#x27;t really look any fuller. However, it has seemed to become a bit stronger, which is good for a person who loses hair easily. I began using one or the other with a different product when in the shower to help get rid of that weird straw like feeling.</li>
            <li> this brand is amazing! after about 2 uses, I noticed a significant difference. My hair felt fuller and thicker which I hadn&#x27;t had since in awile and I was afraid that this shampoo/conditioner would take some time to kick in. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt my hair color and has seemed to  make my hair feel thicker. So inexpensive compared to the Wen I have been using!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this type of shampoo from my local drug store because of all the good reviews. .&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is awful, made my head itch all the next day, and I have thin flat hair, this made it worse the next day, very oily too, the only time my hair looks good is the day I wash my hair, but after that, looks really bad!! I stopped useing it, going back to. Mane and tail that&#x27;s really good stuff</li>
            <li> This works it really works. My hair is tangle free and fuller after I use this shampoo. I had thinning hair and this shampoo works and makes my hair feel healthier and fuller.</li>
            <li> I have less hair than when I was younger and it  is baby fine.  Anything I have put on it weighs it down...drove me crazy!  I bought this on sale at Ulta along with the root booster.  It works well and my daughter notices the difference.  I would suggest spending the money and trying it to judge for yourself.  It&#x27;s not that expensive.  I hope you like it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair, and this shampoo/conditioner combo left a terrible residue in my hair. I used it for 3 days straight and it messed my hair up. I just had to get a bunch of hair cut off to make it feel normal again. However my sister uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thicker and healthier looking after every use now.  I use this about twice a week along with the conditioner.  Prior to using this my hair looked thin, lifeless, and unhealthy.  I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> makes my hair very soft and straight!</li>
            <li> I have very fine oily hair and wash it every day to look a little better. This shampoo makes it look fuller but i have to wash it every day to get a good result , There is something in it that makes my hair shiny but the second day it would look greasy and not fluffy anymore. This is the second bottle I bought, I also use their  conditioner which smells fantastic but use sparingly</li>
            <li> As a soldier, my hair spends 95% of its life wrapped tightly in a bun. My hair was horribly damaged and I&#x27;d had to hack a bunch of it off to get rid of damaged ends. This shampoo in combination with the conditioner has done WONDERS for my hair! And it smells incredible too!</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes hair thicker by leaving a bunch of build up.  I used the shampoo and conditioner together.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely excellent! I recommend this shampoo for hair loss. I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos and none of them worked for me, and when I started washing my hair with this shampoo I started to see my hair growing thick and healthy. This product gave me the best results and I recommend it for anyone, especially if your suffering from hair loss.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after first purchasing the Organix Amplifying lotion which I also loved. I figured if the lotion worked so well I should try the shampoo and I am very glad I did, amazingly enough it seemed to give me even more volume than the lotion alone. I have fine straight hair, this product definitely made my hair feel and look thicker. I am able to style my hair much more easily and get the look I want. I have tried many products including expensive salon product but this along with the lotion is the best I have ever found.</li>
            <li> Some of the best shampoo ever !!</li>
            <li> Perfect! It&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought. My hair turns to be soft and light after using it. It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Nice, thick lather but not too crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> When i apply it on my hair, it cause numerious foam. After rinsing throughly, my hair is easy to comb without conditioner. It can be used for a long time, i expect more benefits in the long time. My hair is damaged cause i curl it once half a year.</li>
            <li> good shampoo will buy again</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the dealio: I&#x27;m a 20 year old dude with very straight,thin hair who was being constantly disappointed when my barber kept telling me \\&quot;I can&#x27;t give you that style with your hair type.\\&quot; My hair is really thin and it just kinda stands on its own. Literally after ONE use of this shampoo and the [[ASIN:B00ADR6M2U Organix Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen Conditioner, 13 Ounce]] of the same type, my hair was definitely thicker and a lot easier to style and manage. I was actually able to bend my hair and shape it more than ever before. Before using this, my hair just literally stuck straight out, no matter how much I tried shaping it. I was floored with the results. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price of this thing. Buy it for $5 at Walmart. The conditioner costs the same as well. I was going to try the men&#x27;s version of this formula(same brand) but it listed less ingredients than this one. Plus, I really don&#x27;t care much for gender norms so smelling \\&quot;girly\\&quot; is not a big deal for me at all. The smell is very pleasant. So guys, I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner pairing if you have thin hair that loves to do its own thing, I have Asian-esque straight thin hair that just kinda stands up on it&#x27;s own if I use the wrong shampoo. Make it stop with this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is no good. My hair is no different than any other shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. Does not make my hair feel thicker or look fuller. But it does look frizzy. Try the Nexus biotin shampoo. That stuff is awesom</li>
            <li> It causes hair loss for me. I wanted more volume but definitely not at the price of hair loss. I wanted to give a one, but maybe it&#x27;s only me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It has a lovely scent to it that lingers just enough to remind you that your hair smells amazing, and it does legitimately work. I have baby fine blonde hair that is very long, colored, and moderately damaged, and it made my hair look full, lively, and shiny after one use. As with most volumizing products, it&#x27;s not intensely moisturizing but not super drying either, so if you have hair that needs a lot of moisture you should alternate this one with something that gives more nourishment. I&#x27;ve been switching this with the new Tsubaki line from OGX and holy mother of twinkies, that stuff also smells amazing and gives instant results. Super soft, manageable hair that just feels... happy! I can&#x27;t recommend these products enough. They&#x27;re inexpensive too so you can buy 2 or 3 sets to address whatever your hair feels like it needs on any given day.</li>
            <li> It does thicken the hair and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Great, would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I&#x27;ve noticed my thin hair feels greasy and oily quick. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair greasy feeling. I don&#x27;t ever use a cream rinse on my hair and this felt like a greasy cream rinse. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine straight hair that almost reaches to mid-back. With it being baby fine and long, it is pretty flat. I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and conditioners that claim to add volume and body. I even went through the phase where I believed horse shampoo (AKA Mane&#x27;n&#x27;Tail) could actually make my hair grow long and thick. None of it worked. I came across this shampoo and noticed the product description said nothing of sulfate (which I was excited about because we all know how harsh Sulfate is) and it also contained biotin and collagen and all these proteins which is so beneficial to hair. On top of that, it said it gives hair the APPEARANCE of being thick and full which seems less deceiving than a shampoo that claims to actually MAKE your hair thick and full. So I gave it try. Now, I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, but I didn&#x27;t notice anything different. My hair is still flat and still fine looking. BUT my hair feels softer and much cleaner as oppose to big marketed shampoos like Pantene that just make my hair brittle and dry. This shampoo has a nice scent to it as well. It&#x27;s an excellent shampoo when you want to make your hair silky, soft, and clean. But in terms of body and volume, it didn&#x27;t really do much for me. But, is it still worth buying? i think so.</li>
            <li> delivery and price was great  love my Amazon</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shampoo! I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo exclusively for a few months and my hair is noticeably thicker and shinier. The last time I went to my stylist the first thing she said was &amp;#34;Okay, what are you doing because your hair looks amazing!&amp;#34; It makes my fine, stringy hair soft and manageable. I can go longer between shampoos and have stopped using product which has improved the health of my hair also. It even makes the curl hold longer when I use a curling iron or hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I didnt buy from this seller. I bought this shampoo for the first time about a year ago at meijers. My hairs medium thin so I&#x27;m always looking for something to grow my hair longer and thicker. It felt thicker while I was using it but, the smell was probably the best part. The biotin and keratin organix shampoos definitely smell the best and they&#x27;re both supposed to be good for growing out hair and making it thicker. I didn&#x27;t use either of the shampoos for very long to get really noticeable results but, it may have worked.</li>
            <li> I started using this with it&#x27;s conditioner and amplifying lotion about a month ago and after about a week I started to notice that my hair was much fuller. My hair is naturally shiny and soft so I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in that respect but it definitely does as advertised and I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with super fine hair even if its short just to give it more volume.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair so much thicker. Even my hairdresser commented how thick my hair was. It use to be really fine and limp.</li>
            <li> i give it 3stars because it leaves my hair feeling like if its conditioner and i dont like that feeling, After am done with this bottle i will go back to my regular biotin shampoo. It smells good, cleans good i just dont like conditioner feel of it! :O(</li>
            <li> WOW! What can I say. I have done a lot of research on hair loss, potential cures, root causes, and cover ups. This is the best thickening shampoo I have ever used, BAR NONE. I used it one time, put in my minoxidil (Rogain foam) and then walked away. When I came back with dry hair it was thick and soft! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I have progressing male pattern baldness. So I have also been using Lipogaine Big 3 when every other day, and using this on the off days. Amazing, I think I have found a hair regimen that is making my hair grow back, and this is a great cover up shampoo in the meantime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of growing my hair out, and ordered this on a whim. I&#x27;ve been taking biotin orally and thought that the biotin shampoo/conditioner would be a great addition. I love it! It&#x27;s very thick and moisturizing and smells awesome! I love that it&#x27;s also sulfate and paraben free! Such a wonderful addition to my long hair treatment collection!</li>
            <li> Great product! don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Smells good and makes my thin hair appear shiny and fuller.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I was so embarrassed to pull my hair back after having lost a good amount of it after giving birth. I didn&#x27;t hear about it, I just saw it on the shelf at the store thinking, &amp;#34;ok it&#x27;s just another one I&#x27;m going to try. &amp;#34;  best decision I&#x27;ve ever made. Recommend to everyone! After just one day I noticed a difference. And after one week I saw regrowth. Now I can wear a ponytail with confidence again. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It cleans my hair really well, it makes it fluffy, it has lots of body and volume, doesn&#x27;t fade my color. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it, it works well for me. I gives my hair volume, shines and leaves my hair smooth, easy to manage. My hair tangles bad when roller setting. Comb runs right through it. When I read the reviews, I was reluctant about whether or not it is for relaxed hair or african American hair and yes it is. If you have severe thinking in your hair, I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it would help you. The only thing I would pay amazon price. It&#x27;s cheaper elsewhere, simply Google it.</li>
            <li> Does make hair feel thick</li>
            <li> STUNK bad it&#x27;s soooo very heavily perfumed it&#x27;s nauseating and it made my hair flat every time I&#x27;ve tried this brand it&#x27;s turned into a disaster with flat greasy hair, I&#x27;m done with organix they do not work for my hair or anyone I know&#x27;s hair for that matter no less than 4 friends have the same issues with them. They smell bad I can&#x27;t understand how anyone can use any of these. For a company who uses ok ingredients supposedly fragrance is NOT &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; healthy CHEMICAL. I don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the OGX Shampoo, Thick &amp; Full Biotin based on Amazon reviews and was not disappointed. I have fine hair and after one shampoo, my hair felt healthier and less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance and consistency is nice, it lathers well and it&#x27;s non-irritating. I really like this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice fragrance, consistency and suds.&lt;br /&gt;- Hair feels healthier and less frizzy&lt;br /&gt;- Reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- None</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo a lot.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so different products will work differently on each person.  I have fine, thin, strait, very soft, hair that is slightly oily.  I only condition once a week (conditioner is too heavy for my hair), and I condition before I shampoo.  I shampoo every 1-2 days depending whether it&#x27;s Summer or Winter (Summer every day, Winter every 2 days or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd bottle using this shampoo, but my first time ordering it online.  It works great with my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down nor does it dry it out, but by the end of the week, my hair definitely needs a little conditioner.  I haven&#x27;t tried OGX&#x27;s conditioner yet, I&#x27;ve been using an older product since I take forever to go through conditioner.  I do seem to have more body and shine while using this shampoo, so I am going to keep buying it unless I find something better.  But for now, it&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> I like it, but Nexxus VitaTress Biotin Shampoo gives me better results.</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight beautiful asian hair but had an excessive hair shedding problem. I have tried many of the natural products for hair but nothing works for me. I finally did some research about the components used in hair products and learned that one of the possible causes of hair shedding is the SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate). All of the OGX shampoo contain no SLS, so I immediately gave it a try when i found this product while still using a conditioner from other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of using it, the amount of my hair shedding was substantially less than before. It lathers very well, and my hair feels very clean.  Now that it&#x27;s been about a month, I definitely feel that my hair is thicker and fuller (I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s because my hair doesn&#x27;t shed as much or the biotin makes my hair grow quicker?!?) Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, so I decide to purchase the OGX conditioner as well (coconut milk one). The coconut milk one indeed has a much better smell than the biotin one. I would definitely try the OGX coconut milk shampoo next time.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I have been using it for just about one year and will not try another shampoo. Normally, I am always buying different shampoos ranging in all types of prices. I just was never happy, until I try this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Try it you will be amazed how sonething so inexpensive works better than some of those over priced hair products.</li>
            <li> As I wrote in my review on the matching conditioner, I do not feel this product is moisturizing enough for me. Again I do not feel I am giving it a fair trial due to the extremely cold climate I live. I will try this again in the spring/summer.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, makes my fine hair feel fuller, and came quickly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!</li>
            <li> do not like, leaves hair weighed down, not what I wanted.  May be right for someone else, but not for me.  Shipped fast, great cust. serv.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo about a week ago and after using it for the first time my scalp began to get irritated. By the 3rd day it felt like it was on fire. I stopped using the shampoo and switched to my kids allergen free organic type shampoo and 3 days later my scalp still burns especially in the shower. This shampoo seems to be heavily perfumed which I thought might be the cause or at least one of them. Really dissapointed especially for such a small bottle at a $6+ price tag.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It leaves your hair unmanageable and unable to be styled. It does not appear to add any volume to your hair. Other over the counter products are much better!</li>
            <li> For the most part I love Organix products. The Biotin and Collagen conditioner was good, the shampoo not so much. The stuff really dries out my hair and makes it straw like. I have the Organix Moroccan oil hair mask and have to use that whenever I use this in order for my hair not to look super damaged, which it isn&#x27;t. I might use this on my dog instead as it&#x27;s been too long since I&#x27;ve bought it to return it.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo, Kaaral Purify Volume, has become nearly impossible to find in the liter-sized bottle and since the 8 ounce bottle is only about $3 less, I won&#x27;t buy it.  Thus, I went on a search for another fabulous product to help strengthen my baby-fine, breakage-prone hair.  I&#x27;d really hoped this shampoo would fit the bill.  It didn&#x27;t.  The smell was wonderful, but there was absolutely no noticeable difference in my hair after finishing the whole bottle.  The search continues.  ::sigh::</li>
            <li> I liked this shampoo &amp; conditioner because I have thinner hair around my crown area and it made that area seem thicker. Also, it does dry my hair out so I use Redken Anti-Snap as a leave-on treatment. This stuff smells amaaaazing when my hair is wet out of the shower, but once it dries the smell goes away. It would have been nice if the smell stayed in my hair throughout the day like Pantene ProV or Herbal Essence does.</li>
            <li> Omg this does not feel like shampoo....it actually felt like my hair was being moisturized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delightful. As an alopecia totalis sufferer I enjoy OGX. Sometimes, with certain conditions, we can forget to pamper ourselves, just even a little. I&#x27;ve suffered with alopecia my entire life. Since having totalis, I often think there is no need just to feel pampered. OGX gives me that lift my spirits, pampered situation with every use and the entoxicating fragrance, in a good way, is so delightful too, all at an inspiring, totally reasonable cost. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love OGX shampoos and conditioners. I have baby fine straight hair and this formula gives my hair body without drying it out. It lathers well and smells GREAT!! This is my favorite scent out of all the shampoos I have tried. I have expensive formulas in my arsenal but this works better than all of them. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! I started using OGX Thick and Full shampoo a few months ago and was surprised by its rich lather and scent. I have very fine fly-away hair  and using OGX makes it fuller and more manageable. I&#x27;ve tried similar shampoos, but none of them worked as well as this one. My nephew has thinning hair, and now he prefers OGX Thick and Full too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-late 20&#x27;s, fine, long hair that has been thinning noticibely (to me at least) for the past year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always seen this line at the drugstore and thought it was another one of those pretty looking shampoos that dont really work.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried so many products on my hair to make it fuller/thicker/stronger. Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo doesnt promise to make your hair regrow or anything like that. it just promises to make it APPEAR thicker/fuller-- which it ABSOLUTELY DOES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice and mild, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft and silky&lt;br /&gt;When hair dries you can noticibly see that it appears to be fuller and thicker&lt;br /&gt;Bottles look small but  last long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair a bit frizzy (I guess thats from the volume that it&#x27;s adding or a side effect of sorts from the fulling effect?&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely recommed this product as well as the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**FYI** - BUY AT WALMART FOR UNDER $6!&lt;br /&gt;Just thought I should mention, I bought the keratin oil (pink bottle) shampoo and conditioner as well because I noticed my hair was breaking when I combed it. I didnt really have great or noticible results with that one. Maybe each product in the line yields different results?</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, Her hairdresser highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product Great Seller</li>
            <li> my girlfriend brought this home because I needed a shampoo that didn&#x27;t make my hair oily. Honestly I love the way this shampoo cleans my hair and I feel like less hair falls out while using this. Smells really good in my opinion as well.</li>
            <li> The smell is like an old grandma&#x27;s stinky perfume. Also The OGX is a new name for Organix Company. Their shampoos and conditioners do contain sulfates and chemicals. Research it before buying it! I used to buy it  from my local HEB because the price was good even though the smell is bad. I thought i was using an organic product... So misleading!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and I purchased this shampoo (and conditioner) hoping it would lift up my hair and give it some volume. It did the total opposite. It weighed my hair down and made my follicles very thin looking. The conditioner was also very runny. I threw both bottles out, then contacted Organix to ask them to send me out a replacement coupon/product after all the trouble I went through. They told me they don&#x27;t honor complimentary coupons to their customers (when they can EASILY print one from their computers). As long as you buy this company&#x27;s bad products and give them your money, they have no desire for customer service.</li>
            <li> Is this a joke? It came half empty!!</li>
            <li> I will only use organix after years of searching for my favorite brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner. Organix is it.  This biotin one is the best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> good product, washes well, healthy&lt;br /&gt;no smell, i wish it smelled better&lt;br /&gt;or at least it smelled more than it does</li>
            <li> Definitely made my hair thicker and longer although I saw this product is available at Walmart now so I will probably continue buying it there.</li>
            <li> I buy this shampoo at our local department store all the time and like it very much. I have very thin hair, but when I use this shampoo my hair feels a lot thicker and is easier to style. Another reason for me to buy this product is that it says on the bottle that it was not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I started going bald long before I started using this but it helped my hair feel cleaner and stronger than it ever has. i regret polluting my head with sulfates for so long</li>
            <li> fomular is better than biotin conditioner ,but doesnt work for oily hair like most shampoo do ,hair gets oliy after 1 day ,in a unnatural way</li>
            <li> amazing product! Love the smell and how smooth my hair is after using this. Not heavy, waxy, oily, or stripping. This works great for my coarse fine hair whether i want to blow dry, air dry, curl or brush strait. I like the results of this better than any of their keratin lines for strait hair days. clean and well packaged. Sender was prompt. no issues during transaction. I will gladly purchase from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo as I have fine and thin hair and really wanted something to perk it up. This shampoo is great - smells good and feels nice. I don&#x27;t usually use conditioners, but I am tempted to try the companion conditioner next.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is very thin where you can easily see my scalp.  I have used biotin pills which helped a little but this product really does give the appearance of thicker hair.  Personally I think it smells amazing.  My hair does feel heavier....because it&#x27;s thicker.  It has a weird texture....because it&#x27;s thicker.  My hair does seem to be a little more greasy by the end of the day but I&#x27;m ok with that because it looks much nicer after only 4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out my hair to it&#x27;s natural (salt and pepper) color, and it has been SLOOOOOW going. Plus my hair has been breaking at the spot where the color ends, so I have these random stray hairs. I was hoping this shampoo would help give me some volume and speed the growth of my hair so I can get past this awkward transition. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and have had mixed results. My hair is growing faster, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any thicker, and I get a LOT of product buildup after a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- hair is definitely growing faster&lt;br /&gt;- much less breakage (not seeing as much hair in my brush or comb)&lt;br /&gt;- smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- fades color (not so much of a con for me, except it&#x27;s turning a bit orange, but might be a con for those who actually want to keep coloring their hair)&lt;br /&gt;- leaves build-up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been mitigating the buildup by using a clarifying shampoo once or twice a week when my hair starts to feel too oily, and that&#x27;s really helped. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with this stuff and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> With naturally fine straight hair, hormonal changes have caused these flaws to be even more noticeable.  I have used everything from salon expensive products, to highly popular drugstore products.  Nothing made much of a difference.  Until I found this OGX Shampoo.  I bought it on a whim.  I noted the brand from a girlfriend...and her hair is lovely.  So I tried it.  So very glad I did.  I now have one in my shower and another in my permanently packed travel bag.  I love this shampoo...and bonus; it is relatively inexpensive.  I will be using this until I stumble on something better.</li>
            <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
            <li> I love it . My hair feels and look healthy.</li>
            <li> Makes hair thicker and fuller, but drying.  Need conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long light brown hair (well, it&#x27;s probably a lot grey but I haven&#x27;t seen the real color for ages). My hair is almost to my waist, and the weight of it precludes much volume at the crown. I think this shampoo and conditioner actually does make seem thicker and fuller. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper at amazon than my local drug store, and with amazon prime free shipping, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good for a fresh conditioner for every day.</li>
            <li> Ok so I really like this shampoo &amp; I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now! One thing you should know is that this shampoo has sulfate &amp; alcohol in it! I though I was doing my hair a favor because I assumed the product was organic because of the name ! But it&#x27;s not!!!! After a while I realized my hair was brittle &amp; dry so I read the shampoo bottle because organic shampoo won&#x27;t damage hair but this one does in time</li>
            <li> My hair is still falling out but I love the way it smells and how it makes my hair feel. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s actually doing anything for me but it&#x27;s a lot better than some of the other stuff I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m going to try something else to see if my hair stops dropping but I will finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and lathers better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I was able to easily comb through my hair with the shampoo in it which is almost impossible with other shampoo! Afterwards my hair was more manageable and looked fuller! I used this shampoo with the Organix Maroccan oil conditioner and had great results!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because I love it I like that it was shipped on time an this is a great product as well I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and REALLY cleans hair, but it dries out the hair as well. However, it DOES make my hair LOOK thicker</li>
            <li> I havent noticed my hair any thicker.  The smell of this is interesting.  I usually use the brazilian straight shampoo and conditioner so this is a nice change.</li>
            <li> Great smell and it seems to work!</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel great</li>
            <li> This Shampoo makes my hair feel and look so much healthier!  I have lots of damage due to bleaching and heat styling.  I feel like this makes the damage less apparent.</li>
            <li> So far I love&#x27;ve ALL the products this brand makes! Wow...just wow! You can feel your hair change while rinsing this out. It smells like candy and best of all its never tested on animals and sells for under $6.00 at walmart ;)</li>
            <li> I wanted to get this product to help with post partum hairloss. It didn&#x27;t help at all. I used it with the conditioner too and it only made my hair oily.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo. I have added a caffeine boost to the shampoo. This gave it a the best possible results. I used the caffeine energy drink.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Organix shampoos and conditioners and this one is by far my favorite.  I&#x27;m in my 40s and have extremely thin, fine hair - to the point the top of my head gets sunburned.  Needless to say it&#x27;s pretty flat and without volume, but it&#x27;s also on the dry side and it&#x27;s hard to find products that really provide softness and fullness without weighting it down too much.  This biotin shampoo delivers!  I noticed a significant difference the very first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I was positively surprised with this shampoo. Leaves my hair clean and rich, feels better than washing with other generic stuff for sure. As with any shampoo, it is a personal preference, depending on hair type and use. I develop dandruff easy but with this one I seem to have no problems. Gives enough moisture and no irritation.</li>
            <li> Smells great but takes a while to rinse out. No faster-than-normal hair growth noted. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
