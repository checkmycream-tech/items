            <li>I was going to buy Proactiv, but I wanted something more natural.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>As for my body, when I first started using it</li>
            <li>I was pretty discouraged.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my back, because for some reason I have breakouts there.</li>
            <li>First review I have ever written.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that the soap was over rated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for fading scars, stretch marks and for tightening loose skin - especially when used in conjunction with an MSM spray.</li>
            <li>Lovely soap,last long,and makes my facial skin feel soft  and healthy..lost brown spots..love this soap!!!</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for a month and realized how much it affected my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin clears up and I feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>It hekps keep your skin extra clean and makes your complexion even toned.</li>
            <li>I read someplace that sulfur helps, so I tried this soap in combination with Nelson’s Pure &amp; Clear sulfur tablets</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the way you can feel the difference in your skin even after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li>The whole entire day was hot and I was sweating.</li>

            <li>Skin not left very moisturized either.</li>
            <li>Along with no longer eating dairy, this soap and dietary changes completely healed my eczema.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s worked better for me than the Raw African Black Soap, which was too harsh.</li>

            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all (small bar that goes fast) and for the price it is just too expensive to keep up use of it.</li>
            <li> and it was too harsh.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews and did some research and took the chance with this soap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used about 10 bars in a row and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin. Skin not left very moisturized either. It does have a nice orangy smell and lathers well but it doesn&#x27;t last long at all (small bar that goes fast) and for the price it is just too expensive to keep up use of it.</li>
            <li> Has completely stopped my breakouts that I get from having sensitive skin, I would recommend this soap to anyone (especially people with skin allergies)</li>
            <li> This soap has ruined me forever in a GREAT way.  I love the scent and the way you can feel the difference in your skin even after just a few uses.  I now feel grimy using non-natural soap... I am a customer for life now!</li>
            <li> This soap bar is amazing! It hekps keep your skin extra clean and makes your complexion even toned. Also good for acne. I suffer from acne and this is a quick remedy, just take a shower with it before you sleep and when you wake up, ALL GONE! Will be a permanent customer, Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this soap make your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Best Soap Ever!!  No more itchy, welts on my little girls skin!!</li>
            <li> my skin has never looked sooo pretty!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for over a year and I feel it has tightened and made my skin tone more even and youthful looking. I want to continue using it forever. I am almost 34 and I get carded all the time.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this soap about 4 days ago. I don’t usually write reviews, but I was so impressed with this product I had to say something. I have recently been struggling with an acne breakout unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.  I’ve had minor breakouts before, especially during my cycle, but the last year has been unbearable. I tried everything…ProActive, all of the over-the-counter acne meds, prescribed antibiotics and nothing worked. I read someplace that sulfur helps, so I tried this soap in combination with Nelson’s Pure &amp; Clear sulfur tablets and I can’t believe the results.  The rapidness of how this stuff is working is amazing &amp; I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. I would recommend it to anyone who has eczema like me. Along with no longer eating dairy, this soap and dietary changes completely healed my eczema. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Lovely soap,last long,and makes my facial skin feel soft  and healthy..lost brown spots..love this soap!!!</li>
            <li> I like the lather and smell is nice too. Does not seem to make skin totally clear of blemishes but for anyone with sensitive skin it has not caused any itching or redness.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping that I could use it for my face, but I have sensitive skin and it was too harsh. As for my body, when I first started using it I was pretty discouraged. I broke out in these tiny bumps everywhere fore several weeks. I thought maybe it wouldn&#x27;t work for me.  I use it mostly for my back, because for some reason I have breakouts there. My back still breaks out occasionally, but most importantly my scars are fading slowly. As for my eczema it did not help, but I love this soap. It&#x27;s worked better for me than the Raw African Black Soap, which was too harsh. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Amazing and mild. Good for scars and acne. Low odor, smooth and long lasting. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the items I&#x27;ve seen in commercials (e.g. soaps, ointments, acne pads). I was going to buy Proactiv, but I wanted something more natural. I read a few reviews and did some research and took the chance with this soap.  My daughter has been having acne problems since she became an adolescent. Since she started using this soap, her skin cleared dramatically and now has the occasional (time of the month) zit. I use it as well and my skin is clear all month long, even during that time... I&#x27;m very pleased and will definitely continue purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting my entire life for this soap!!!!!  Thank you!  Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;My 57 year old skin looks 30.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like Benjamin Button!!!!  LOL</li>
            <li> My skin always feels soft and moisturized after I use it. This bar soap does not dry out in the shower like other soaps. I purchased this pack of 7 bc I never want to run out! I also believe it has played a part in diminishing my stretch marks I have on the bicep of both of my arms. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for that purpose as well as the acne scars I have on my chest.</li>
            <li> So I heard about MSM Sulfur soap on youtube and I wanted to check it out.  I must say, this soap has contributed to my clearer complexion and more even skin tone.  Its also helped me with my minor blemishes.  My skin doesn&#x27;t seem to act up &amp;#34;as much&amp;#34; anymore.&lt;br /&gt; Additional info on my skin:  African American Female, AGe: early 30&#x27;s, Acne prone/sensitive skin, medium dark brown skin tone(Mac Makeup Color NW45), Oily skin.  I would recommend you to try it and give it a shot.  I liked it enough to buy 7 more boxes because I haven&#x27;t found a soap that compares to this!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helped someone.</li>
            <li> First review I have ever written. At first I thought that the soap was over rated. I stopped using it for a month and realized how much it affected my skin. I&#x27;m 52, Spanish and greasy. This stuff did wonders. My skin clears up and I feel so much cleaner. It&#x27;s exspensive but I think it&#x27;s worth every penny. Going to buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! So i dont use deodorant because of the aluminum and so I tried this soap and I showered and then I left some on under my under arms.The whole entire day was hot and I was sweating. Night timd came and i had no bad smell. Amazing I love this stuff!!! I would so recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This soap does wonders for your skin if you use it on a regular basis.  It&#x27;s great for fading scars, stretch marks and for tightening loose skin - especially when used in conjunction with an MSM spray. I would warn you to use it on the body, but not the face as it does sting the eyes.  It leaves your skin really smooth with sort of a matte finish - so use a good lotion or moisturizer after for optimal results.</li>
