            <li>They have been using it for nearly a month and the results are remarkable.  </li>
            <li>People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?!</li>
            <li>This soap has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>

            <li>I have a few family  members that suffer with skin ailments and it works wonderfully for them.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a soap like this that leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean AND silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It keeps the scalp flake free and clean.</li>
            <li>my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>I love it, because I&#x27;m not embarrassed to show some skin for the first summer since ....</li>
            <li>I originally bought this soap for my face.  </li>
            <li>The up-side to that is you can see where you need to clean.</li>
            <li>You know when you use this soap, you are truly clean after bathing.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t make my skin feel clean anymore.</li>
            <li>Listen, all I have to say is if you want to experience clean use Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean, leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaves me with a clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel really clean after I use it.  </li>
            <li>This soap will leave your body feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Works great on oily faces, eczema, and dry skin all in 1 bar of soap!</li>
            <li>I had a special need though, but it never ended up mattering with this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t affect tile or basins color wise but if not rinsed properly, you may have a slippery surface.     </li>
            <li>The smell when taking a shower is fresh and fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is pretty strong</li>
            <li>It appears that the newer soap received from this listing has more Shea butter compared to the older version.</li>
            <li>Also, the delivery was really quick</li>
            <li>It also ships and arrives quickly</li>
            <li>ordered it from Amazon and received it quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick ship, as described.  </li>
            <li>This is a very strong soap that will dry your skin out, but it will help your teenagers acne better than anything else that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I get many coompliments on my complexion and would highly recomment this&lt;br /&gt;soap</li>
            <li>I used to use Dove soap, but after switching to this baby, I can feel an improvement in my own skin, and that is not something you can say about many other soaps.</li>
            <li>I had a huge problem finding out how many unnatural and abrasive ingredients were in the soap I was using in the shower to clean my body daily.</li>
            <li>The soap does have its downfall because it disintegrates quickly, but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly after all this time the formula and the box it came in is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural pine tar soap at a great price, and found this soap, all natural though at first smelled a tad too perfumey but after use the smell died down, and the soap works great.  </li>
            <li>soap is all natural, and includes wonderful ingredients like honey, shea butter, aloe vera, and many other good-for-you natural oils and ashes.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li>I am a burn survivor that has struggled many, many years with dry, cracking, and flaking skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what other great comments to say about this because of all the other great reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the raw black soap, but it is a very good quality of soap.  </li>
            <li>Sore skin was so worth this.</li>
            <li>I went to a big lot store and got the inexpensive pack of a nice brown...</li>
            <li>No product I could find was ever able to fully clear my neckline of the cysts I had.</li>
            <li>I will say it is powerful.</li>
            <li>It works great for my body but my facial skin is too sensitive and this stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I feel that this is worth a try for any skin condition.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really as good as the other users are saying</li>
            <li>I had eczema on my right hand for a while.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have major skin problems, but I trust the many other reviewers when they say it&#x27;s good for helping skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to clean, you just have to clean more to make your shower look white.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve reached advanced age all kinds of new things show up.  </li>
            <li>Dudu Osun Black Soap has made my skin smooth, vibrant, clear and great smelling.</li>
            <li>It also leaves you feeling very clean and fresh, without the feeling of any left over</li>
            <li>I first purchased one bar of this soap at a community festval that was going on.</li>
            <li>There are several reasons why I love this soap:  </li>
            <li>The first time I</li>
            <li>and I actually look BETTER.  </li>
            <li>~ brown flaky ~ are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Would buy again, and I did get compliments when I first started using</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African and know about the product and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back soon and get some more.</li>
            <li>Ounce for ounce it is better to buy in bulk than individually.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month followed by shea butter which I also researched pretty thoroughly based on reviews.</li>
            <li>I got a great deal buying in bulk here on Amazon but the soap does not last long.  </li>
            <li>If you wonder how I know this... the first time I used it after I turned off the shower and went to wipe the excess water off my arm</li>
            <li>EXACTLY.</li>
            <li>I like this soap because of its natural ingredients and light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews I read said that the soap burned the first couple of times they used it.</li>
            <li>I moisturize often, so I&#x27;m ok overall.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it to wash my hair</li>
            <li>Love this product, my second time buying it.  </li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned caucasian with dry skin (though not super sensitive) and I LOVE this soap!</li>
            <li>Natural moisturizing soaps leave the skin moisturized but don&#x27;t have that clean feel.</li>
            <li>After looking in the mirror my face was so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Dudu-Osun works MUCH better than either of these products, is simple to use, and is very inexpensive when purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Anyway I have been on so many different medications which did not help much.  </li>
            <li>I had bought another type of black soap but this brand is so much more yummy!  </li>
            <li>My advice to first time users of any kind of black soap is to do your homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pure, clean and natural soap that doesn&#x27;t leave a soap residue on the body, and it conditions to skin as well as your hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to clean my little dogs and their coat comes out phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about for a facial wash, but my skin always feels super clean every single time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I have found it also heals minor wounds and sores better than products like Neosporin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I recommend this soap to anyone with sensitive skin, or anyone that just wants to feel clean after a shower.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly as many soaps do</li>
            <li>It great, my face feel good,the dark spots disappeared, I look younger!!</li>
            <li>The vendor had pure Shea Butter that I was purchasing.</li>
            <li>yea great soap only thing is it&#x27;s black</li>
            <li>I even use it for my face, feels super clean, but using on the face too much makes it feel dry.</li>
            <li>Be ready to reorder it if you try it.</li>
            <li>Now this is the real surprise.  </li>
            <li>I want the whole world to try this soap.  </li>
            <li>As for a shampoo, lathers up real well.  </li>
            <li>Whatever you do, DON&#x27;T use with white or light colored wash clothes, it stains the fabric and leaves a dingy unclean look (even with Clorox).</li>
            <li>I use the soap in the morning and  night all over my whole body.  </li>
            <li>As it removes dirt from my skin, the all natural ingredients soften and tone it while leaving it smelling like a rain forest (it literally smells like fresh flowers).</li>
            <li>This soap turned my body&#x27;s skin into fantastic skin within 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li>so it’s really a matter of preference.  </li>
            <li>It has helped me out so much with the skin problems I have been having.  </li>
            <li>when i refrain from scrubbing to much, not drying at all.</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and with out any issues.</li>
            <li>Also, the cost per bar is so reasonable compared to the others I bought.</li>
            <li>It gives off a fairly subtle, but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This is the cheapest price that I have seen so far!!!</li>
            <li>No more razor burn of any kind, not even on the more sensitive area of the inner thigh or bikini area!</li>
            <li>Has a natural, herbal smell; gives you tons of lather; makes your skin not only clean, but also very soft; and can be used as a shampoo for short or fine hair!</li>
            <li>But in general, compared to traditional bath soaps, this soap leaves my skin more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Please, let me tell you, this soap in conjunction with my regimen of moisturizer (coconut oil) and fair and white bleaching creme, I have almost got rid of all of my dark marks.  </li>
            <li>You can work up a rich lather with this soap without using a lot - one bar will last longer than normal soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap to wash my face for the past 3 months, and it&#x27;s been a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>The smell is different, but not bad.  </li>
            <li>Not only did it clear my neckline COMPLETELY, this soap leaves my body fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>As a result, the smell is a little milder and more fragrant, and the lather is not the deep, dark violet color like the older soap, which is good because it used to stain our shower tile and grout.</li>
            <li>My husband has new hair growth on his balding head!</li>
            <li>Since I started shampooing my hair with this same black soap, the breakage has stopped and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m seeing and feeling my own natural hair for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dudu-Osun Black Soap for a while now and love how it cleans and leaves your skin.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating properties are also still there, but unlike the older one, you have to use the soap for a 2-3 days for the (roughness) to come out.    </li>
            <li>I think applying shea butter afterwards has been the main component with helping his skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using this soap at least 6 years and we absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>it is 100% natural, and it not only improved my acne, butmade my 37 year old facial skin as great as my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s facial skin.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous to order this soap after reading some of the 1-star reviews but decided to try it anyway since there were so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li>When I first compared this to the older version, the older version seemed stronger, with more exfoliating properties, and less of a commercial soap smell.    </li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and have VERY oily skin.</li>
            <li>THE SOAP REALLY LEAVES THE SKIN SOFT.  </li>
            <li>So I guess it really is not a negative after all.</li>
            <li>and it does WAY better as an antibacterial and deodorant soap, without using all those harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have finally tried African Black Soap!  </li>
            <li>I do concur with other reviewers that you don&#x27;t want to use light colored washcloths.  </li>
            <li>At first, my face felt really dry after washing it, but as long as you moisturize your face, you&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li>New in the box, arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face, but I can wash my face with this with no problems.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, and every time since, my skin felt different.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks, I can really notice the results and my skin actually feels smoother, cleaner, and tighter (if that makes any sense), than when I used the older formula.</li>
            <li>It is great as a shampoo also; if your hair tends to be limp, it supplies a body to it that lifts your roots, but you must use your usual creme rinse as hair will be tangled otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really needed to use much lotion since I started using it although I tend to have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone who suffers from skin ailments or just enjoys having moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>I used to also get a very itchy back from my old soap</li>
            <li>, it is all-natural, and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>the soap is natural, cleans, lathers, rinses off with no residue after use been using DuDu soap over a year now and will continue to make this soap my staple.</li>
            <li>soaps\\&quot;, it has a natural smell of the ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It prompted me to try out natural soap.  </li>
            <li>I gave a bar to my 88 yr old mother</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all natural product for my body</li>
            <li>This soap is made with all natural Vitamin A. Vitamin A, when formulated for skincare, has the ability to rapidly exfoliate and cleanse skin cells.</li>
            <li>I needed a natural soap for my body acne and this WAS IT.</li>
            <li>This soap is all natural.</li>
            <li>I am in my late 70&#x27;s and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>and even he says this is the only soap he wants to use.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that the ingredients are simple and straight to the point</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sensitive skinned</li>
            <li>I use it from head to toe!!!It is naturally made (water based)</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews had me worried as I have a sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>how it cleans my skin, and keeps it soft also.  </li>
            <li>He used to use Dove because he has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>to name a few of the top prescribed topical treatments for acne.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeliing clean amd moisturize instead of tight and dry as most other soaps do.  </li>
            <li>You skin is soft not tight.</li>
            <li>I mean I had was developing droopy eyelids and more signs of aging.  </li>
            <li>American and European made soaps, you need to shop around to find the brand of black soap that works best for you, since the formulas vary a little  in the different African countries.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Black soap is BROWN in color, not black.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Black soap is BROWN in color, not black.  </li>
            <li>Both appeared the same as far as the packaging, etc., but this is a new formula.</li>
            <li>It it is not black when lathering, and you get so much lather, one bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It fragrances the bathroom and surrounding rooms, not strong but just a pleasing clean smell.</li>
            <li>I live with a hairstylist and he was amazed when I told him I used only this bar of soap on my hair.</li>
            <li>It is gentle  on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my oily skin without leaving it too dry like some benzoyl or sulphur soaps.</li>
            <li>This black soap is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure, buy a couple of different bars and at least give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure, buy a couple of different bars and at least give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, after using what appears to be a newer formula for a couple of weeks, I see this soap is comparable to the original we have used for years (if not better).</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about two years, and I believe it has played a major role in the clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been having major problems with my skin.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try the Dudu-Osun Black soap and within two weeks my right hand cleared up and has been that way ever since.</li>
            <li>It has really changed a life long fight with my skin and facial break outs.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that cured my acne before I discovered Dudu-Osun were AcneFree three step system (very costly and time consuming) or Cetaphyl Antibacterial soap (harsh chemicals and twice as much cost as Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin A in this soap comes from COMPLETELY natural sources, all of which are listed on the back of every box (there may be 6 or 7 ingredients in the soap all together).</li>
            <li>When wet, it really creates a lot of suds.</li>
            <li>I believe lime and possibly lemon are the soap, both of which are natural lightners.</li>
            <li>I am a 39 yr old male.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thick hair and this soap leaves it manageable and light.</li>
            <li>I bought a few bars and gave one to my other family members and they keep coming back to ask me for more.</li>
            <li>I am changing my original negative review of this product.</li>
            <li>This soap actually removes old cells and wherever there is a scar it actually lightens the scar in about two weeks;</li>
            <li>I have been battling acne (a 34 year old African American Woman with severe acne and hyper pigmentation).  </li>
            <li>This newer version still does eventually leave a burgundy/brown colored lather, but not nearly as intense as the older version.    </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin in the winter months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful that the manufacturer is not putting black dye in the product in an attempt to duplicate the true African product which is very simple and natural.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful that the manufacturer is not putting black dye in the product in an attempt to duplicate the true African product which is very simple and natural.  </li>
            <li>My first choice is the Ghana made black soap, but Dudu-Osun comes in at a close second</li>
            <li>The doctors kept saying it was eczema, which I have been told is a general term for skin problems when they cannot pin point the specific cause.  </li>
            <li>I was told by the derms that because I am of color it will take a long time for the skin tone to return to its natural state.  </li>
            <li>Slowly but surely the color is evening out due to some of the ingredients in the soap.  </li>
            <li>works for my dry, sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin (which is naturally dry) is soft after using.</li>
            <li>The flakiness and black patches from eczema has transitioned into normal skin, and my younger son had real issues with black heads on his nose...</li>

            <li> This is a very strong soap that will dry your skin out, but it will help your teenagers acne better than anything else that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I get many coompliments on my complexion and would highly recomment this&lt;br /&gt;soap</li>
            <li> I used to use Dove soap, but after switching to this baby, I can feel an improvement in my own skin, and that is not something you can say about many other soaps.</li>
            <li> I had a huge problem finding out how many unnatural and abrasive ingredients were in the soap I was using in the shower to clean my body daily.</li>
            <li> The soap does have its downfall because it disintegrates quickly, but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly after all this time the formula and the box it came in is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural pine tar soap at a great price, and found this soap, all natural though at first smelled a tad too perfumey but after use the smell died down, and the soap works great.  </li>
            <li> soap is all natural, and includes wonderful ingredients like honey, shea butter, aloe vera, and many other good-for-you natural oils and ashes.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> I am a burn survivor that has struggled many, many years with dry, cracking, and flaking skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what other great comments to say about this because of all the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the raw black soap, but it is a very good quality of soap.  </li>
            <li> Sore skin was so worth this.</li>
            <li> I went to a big lot store and got the inexpensive pack of a nice brown...</li>
            <li> No product I could find was ever able to fully clear my neckline of the cysts I had.</li>
            <li> I will say it is powerful.</li>
            <li> It works great for my body but my facial skin is too sensitive and this stuff is powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I feel that this is worth a try for any skin condition.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is natural and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really as good as the other users are saying</li>
            <li> I had eczema on my right hand for a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have major skin problems, but I trust the many other reviewers when they say it&#x27;s good for helping skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard to clean, you just have to clean more to make your shower look white.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve reached advanced age all kinds of new things show up.  </li>
            <li> Dudu Osun Black Soap has made my skin smooth, vibrant, clear and great smelling.</li>
            <li> It also leaves you feeling very clean and fresh, without the feeling of any left over</li>
            <li> I first purchased one bar of this soap at a community festval that was going on.</li>
            <li> There are several reasons why I love this soap:  </li>
            <li> The first time I</li>
            <li> and I actually look BETTER.  </li>
            <li> ~ brown flaky ~ are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again, and I did get compliments when I first started using</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African and know about the product and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back soon and get some more.</li>
            <li> Ounce for ounce it is better to buy in bulk than individually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month followed by shea butter which I also researched pretty thoroughly based on reviews.</li>
            <li> I got a great deal buying in bulk here on Amazon but the soap does not last long.  </li>
            <li> If you wonder how I know this... the first time I used it after I turned off the shower and went to wipe the excess water off my arm</li>
            <li> EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> I like this soap because of its natural ingredients and light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews I read said that the soap burned the first couple of times they used it.</li>
            <li> I moisturize often, so I&#x27;m ok overall.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it to wash my hair</li>
            <li> Love this product, my second time buying it.  </li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned caucasian with dry skin (though not super sensitive) and I LOVE this soap!</li>
            <li> Natural moisturizing soaps leave the skin moisturized but don&#x27;t have that clean feel.</li>
            <li> After looking in the mirror my face was so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun works MUCH better than either of these products, is simple to use, and is very inexpensive when purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Anyway I have been on so many different medications which did not help much.  </li>
            <li> I had bought another type of black soap but this brand is so much more yummy!  </li>
            <li> My advice to first time users of any kind of black soap is to do your homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pure, clean and natural soap that doesn&#x27;t leave a soap residue on the body, and it conditions to skin as well as your hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to clean my little dogs and their coat comes out phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about for a facial wash, but my skin always feels super clean every single time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I have found it also heals minor wounds and sores better than products like Neosporin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I recommend this soap to anyone with sensitive skin, or anyone that just wants to feel clean after a shower.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly as many soaps do</li>
            <li> It great, my face feel good,the dark spots disappeared, I look younger!!</li>
            <li> The vendor had pure Shea Butter that I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> yea great soap only thing is it&#x27;s black</li>
            <li> I even use it for my face, feels super clean, but using on the face too much makes it feel dry.</li>
            <li> Be ready to reorder it if you try it.</li>
            <li> Now this is the real surprise.  </li>
            <li> I want the whole world to try this soap.  </li>
            <li> As for a shampoo, lathers up real well.  </li>
            <li> Whatever you do, DON&#x27;T use with white or light colored wash clothes, it stains the fabric and leaves a dingy unclean look (even with Clorox).</li>
            <li> I use the soap in the morning and  night all over my whole body.  </li>
            <li> As it removes dirt from my skin, the all natural ingredients soften and tone it while leaving it smelling like a rain forest (it literally smells like fresh flowers).</li>
            <li> This soap turned my body&#x27;s skin into fantastic skin within 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> so it’s really a matter of preference.  </li>
            <li> It has helped me out so much with the skin problems I have been having.  </li>
            <li> when i refrain from scrubbing to much, not drying at all.</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and with out any issues.</li>
            <li> Also, the cost per bar is so reasonable compared to the others I bought.</li>
            <li> It gives off a fairly subtle, but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest price that I have seen so far!!!</li>
            <li> No more razor burn of any kind, not even on the more sensitive area of the inner thigh or bikini area!</li>
            <li> Has a natural, herbal smell; gives you tons of lather; makes your skin not only clean, but also very soft; and can be used as a shampoo for short or fine hair!</li>
            <li> But in general, compared to traditional bath soaps, this soap leaves my skin more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Please, let me tell you, this soap in conjunction with my regimen of moisturizer (coconut oil) and fair and white bleaching creme, I have almost got rid of all of my dark marks.  </li>
            <li> You can work up a rich lather with this soap without using a lot - one bar will last longer than normal soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap to wash my face for the past 3 months, and it&#x27;s been a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li> The smell is different, but not bad.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it clear my neckline COMPLETELY, this soap leaves my body fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> As a result, the smell is a little milder and more fragrant, and the lather is not the deep, dark violet color like the older soap, which is good because it used to stain our shower tile and grout.</li>
            <li> My husband has new hair growth on his balding head!</li>
            <li> Since I started shampooing my hair with this same black soap, the breakage has stopped and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m seeing and feeling my own natural hair for the first time in years!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dudu-Osun Black Soap for a while now and love how it cleans and leaves your skin.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating properties are also still there, but unlike the older one, you have to use the soap for a 2-3 days for the (roughness) to come out.    </li>
            <li> I think applying shea butter afterwards has been the main component with helping his skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this soap at least 6 years and we absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> it is 100% natural, and it not only improved my acne, butmade my 37 year old facial skin as great as my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s facial skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to order this soap after reading some of the 1-star reviews but decided to try it anyway since there were so many rave reviews.</li>
            <li> When I first compared this to the older version, the older version seemed stronger, with more exfoliating properties, and less of a commercial soap smell.    </li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and have VERY oily skin.</li>
            <li> THE SOAP REALLY LEAVES THE SKIN SOFT.  </li>
            <li> So I guess it really is not a negative after all.</li>
            <li> and it does WAY better as an antibacterial and deodorant soap, without using all those harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have finally tried African Black Soap!  </li>
            <li> I do concur with other reviewers that you don&#x27;t want to use light colored washcloths.  </li>
            <li> At first, my face felt really dry after washing it, but as long as you moisturize your face, you&#x27;re fine.  </li>
            <li> New in the box, arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face, but I can wash my face with this with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, and every time since, my skin felt different.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks, I can really notice the results and my skin actually feels smoother, cleaner, and tighter (if that makes any sense), than when I used the older formula.</li>
            <li> It is great as a shampoo also; if your hair tends to be limp, it supplies a body to it that lifts your roots, but you must use your usual creme rinse as hair will be tangled otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really needed to use much lotion since I started using it although I tend to have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who suffers from skin ailments or just enjoys having moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> I used to also get a very itchy back from my old soap</li>
            <li> , it is all-natural, and it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> the soap is natural, cleans, lathers, rinses off with no residue after use been using DuDu soap over a year now and will continue to make this soap my staple.</li>
            <li> soaps\\&quot;, it has a natural smell of the ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It prompted me to try out natural soap.  </li>
            <li> I gave a bar to my 88 yr old mother</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural product for my body</li>
            <li> This soap is made with all natural Vitamin A. Vitamin A, when formulated for skincare, has the ability to rapidly exfoliate and cleanse skin cells.</li>
            <li> I needed a natural soap for my body acne and this WAS IT.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 70&#x27;s and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> and even he says this is the only soap he wants to use.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the ingredients are simple and straight to the point</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sensitive skinned</li>
            <li> I use it from head to toe!!!It is naturally made (water based)</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews had me worried as I have a sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> how it cleans my skin, and keeps it soft also.  </li>
            <li> He used to use Dove because he has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> to name a few of the top prescribed topical treatments for acne.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeliing clean amd moisturize instead of tight and dry as most other soaps do.  </li>
            <li> You skin is soft not tight.</li>
            <li> I mean I had was developing droopy eyelids and more signs of aging.  </li>
            <li> American and European made soaps, you need to shop around to find the brand of black soap that works best for you, since the formulas vary a little  in the different African countries.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Black soap is BROWN in color, not black.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Black soap is BROWN in color, not black.  </li>
            <li> Both appeared the same as far as the packaging, etc., but this is a new formula.</li>
            <li> It it is not black when lathering, and you get so much lather, one bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It fragrances the bathroom and surrounding rooms, not strong but just a pleasing clean smell.</li>
            <li> I live with a hairstylist and he was amazed when I told him I used only this bar of soap on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is gentle  on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my oily skin without leaving it too dry like some benzoyl or sulphur soaps.</li>
            <li> This black soap is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure, buy a couple of different bars and at least give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure, buy a couple of different bars and at least give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, after using what appears to be a newer formula for a couple of weeks, I see this soap is comparable to the original we have used for years (if not better).</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two years, and I believe it has played a major role in the clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been having major problems with my skin.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try the Dudu-Osun Black soap and within two weeks my right hand cleared up and has been that way ever since.</li>
            <li> It has really changed a life long fight with my skin and facial break outs.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that cured my acne before I discovered Dudu-Osun were AcneFree three step system (very costly and time consuming) or Cetaphyl Antibacterial soap (harsh chemicals and twice as much cost as Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin A in this soap comes from COMPLETELY natural sources, all of which are listed on the back of every box (there may be 6 or 7 ingredients in the soap all together).</li>
            <li> When wet, it really creates a lot of suds.</li>
            <li> I believe lime and possibly lemon are the soap, both of which are natural lightners.</li>
            <li> I am a 39 yr old male.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick hair and this soap leaves it manageable and light.</li>
            <li> I bought a few bars and gave one to my other family members and they keep coming back to ask me for more.</li>
            <li> I am changing my original negative review of this product.</li>
            <li> This soap actually removes old cells and wherever there is a scar it actually lightens the scar in about two weeks;</li>
            <li> I have been battling acne (a 34 year old African American Woman with severe acne and hyper pigmentation).  </li>
            <li> This newer version still does eventually leave a burgundy/brown colored lather, but not nearly as intense as the older version.    </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful that the manufacturer is not putting black dye in the product in an attempt to duplicate the true African product which is very simple and natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful that the manufacturer is not putting black dye in the product in an attempt to duplicate the true African product which is very simple and natural.  </li>
            <li> My first choice is the Ghana made black soap, but Dudu-Osun comes in at a close second</li>
            <li> The doctors kept saying it was eczema, which I have been told is a general term for skin problems when they cannot pin point the specific cause.  </li>
            <li> I was told by the derms that because I am of color it will take a long time for the skin tone to return to its natural state.  </li>
            <li> Slowly but surely the color is evening out due to some of the ingredients in the soap.  </li>
            <li> works for my dry, sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin (which is naturally dry) is soft after using.</li>
            <li> The flakiness and black patches from eczema has transitioned into normal skin, and my younger son had real issues with black heads on his nose...</li>
            <li> After my shower I feel squeaky clean with no residue or film like other soaps of the past.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing about the soap is the brown color it leaves on my wash cloth, but it rinses right out.</li>
            <li> old son who has bouts with acne will not use any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not black up your shower, the bar lasts long as long as you keep it dry.</li>
            <li> Also, I had major discoloration on my legs, arms, and back due to the eczema.  </li>
            <li> Since using this soap, I use less deodorant, because the soap is active, and it really cleans deep in your pores.</li>
            <li> My daughter had dark scars from acne on her face and they have lightened considerably.  </li>
            <li> make sure it&#x27;s real AFRICAN Black Soap and not a westernized version being made by a manufacturer trying to get in on a new trend, but cutting corners and adding a bunch of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> make sure it&#x27;s real AFRICAN Black Soap and not a westernized version being made by a manufacturer trying to get in on a new trend, but cutting corners and adding a bunch of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Overall, this new formula (compared to the one we purchased 6+ years ago) works equally as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with skin issues such as dry skin, eczema...etc.</li>
            <li> Put soap back in dry place and wash body while staying out of the water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural so the long term affects may take longer to see than the average technology infused items on today&#x27;s market.     </li>
            <li> I began using the soap late last year and it seems to have calm down the itchiness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t recommend this soap strongly enough, especially to someone who has struggled with acne or any other skin ailment.</li>
            <li> I never feel like I&#x27;m suffocating in soap residue, I finally feel clean.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to this soap about three years ago through my fiance&#x60; because he does not use any processed perfumed soaps and he has the clearest skin that I have seen naturally; no blemishes whatsoever.</li>
            <li> One bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying, but the benefits out weigh that minor effect because I keep my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It appears slightly milder at first, but it works just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> but I would prefer to use other facial scrubs, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have skin problems but a lot of bar soap makes you feel dry.  </li>
            <li> &quot; soaps dry out my skin and leave a film.</li>
            <li> i use it for washing my hair often but also use shampoo sometimes as the soap alone can dry it out.</li>
            <li> Rub soap once thru hair and put in a dry place.</li>
            <li> We all benefit from using it whether just dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> I started our children on it too and we no longer have any issues with dry skin or eczema.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t slide down, my hand stopped suddenly</li>
            <li> Reduces pores on me and my dry skin bumps on backs of arms are gone!</li>
            <li> Heals dry skin!</li>
            <li> Even though they have different issues with their skin Dudu Osun black soap has worked wonders,  </li>
            <li> Over all, African Black soap is a &amp;</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s African Black soap from now</li>
            <li> I used the Dudu-Osun Black Soap only for my face.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the brown mess it makes.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun still provides the same burning sensation as regular soap which makes me skeptical about its natural properties when lather contacts the eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful to look at the ingredients</li>
            <li> Get in shower and wet hair.</li>
            <li> Wet a wash cloth and rub soap on once or twice.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s African Black soap from now on!</li>
            <li> Before it was pretty bad, almost cystic at times, and now I only get the occasional small red bump.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t disappointed just got better results from other products, i.e. St.</li>
            <li> I can feel the difference and other soaps</li>
            <li> The smell is not like other \\&quot;perfumed</li>
            <li> It seems that with soaps it&#x27;s either one or the other.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a facial scrub once a week by taking a small piece of the soap and dipping it into sugar for an exfoliating sugar scrub.  </li>
            <li> When I run out and have to use other soaps, I never feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my little boy who has had extremely dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> spent a lot of time researching the different brands of black soap before making my purchases and made my choices based on the information provided and the reviews (Coastal Scents Black Soap with Shea Butter and Black Soap with Cocoa Butter; Dudu-Osun Black Soap).  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is black and the soap dish looks awful most of the time, but it smells terrific and seems to help.</li>
            <li> It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance.</li>
            <li> Never mind that it leaves a ring, or that it lathers up dark on your wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try it on my face for some blemishes and dark spots.</li>
            <li> and if it includes a bunch of chemicals and fragrances, then it&#x27;s not authentic but a westernized version, and those chemicals will probably cancel the simplicity and benefits of the black soap in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not authentic but a westernized version, and those chemicals will probably cancel the simplicity and benefits of the black soap in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one down side, is the soap leaves brown marks wherever you lay it down, so expect that.</li>

            <li> I have been using this brand black soap for some years now and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> and now you will have all this black soap residue in your soap dish, sink, and tub.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>

            <li> The hair comes out clean and surprisingly not too badly tangled or not at all depending.</li>
            <li> Combine this with raw Shea butter as a moisturizer  </li>
            <li> I personally can say that the chemicals in the different shampoos had caused my hair to break badly</li>
            <li> no more.  </li>
            <li> No more bumpy face or breakouts of acne at all.</li>
            <li> I gave it five stars because there were no more stars to give.</li>
            <li> I also gave a bar to my grandson who suffers from teenage acne and eczema (he&#x27;s 13)</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick soapy residue on your skin.</li>

            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this product at any price, so at this price, how can you go wrong???</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with this soap.  </li>
            <li> I am unable to find this product locally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I first purchased one bar of this soap at a community festval that was going on. The vendor had pure Shea Butter that I was purchasing. I absolutely love pure shea butter, and use it for many, many things! It was from this that we began discussing black soap. i decided to buy a bar and try it. It is fabulous! Has a natural, herbal smell; gives you tons of lather; makes your skin not only clean, but also very soft; and can be used as a shampoo for short or fine hair! My husband has very fine hair that gets oily very easily. He uses the soap as his shampoo now, and his hair looks and smells great! My one son has very short, medium bodied hair, and he uses the soap for shampoo also! My daughter had foliculitis on her arms (all those little bumps), and since using the black soap, all of them are going away! I love the way my skin feels since I&#x27;ve been using it, and have found that it is wonderful for shaving my underarms and legs with. No more razor burn of any kind, not even on the more sensitive area of the inner thigh or bikini area! I would definitely reccommend this soap to anyone, of any ethnicity (I am caucasian)! It really is fabulous!</li>
            <li> There are several reasons why I love this soap:  it smells great, it is all-natural, and it makes my skin feel soft. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the brown mess it makes. It doesn&#x27;t dry quickly as many soaps do so it drips brown all over the place. The up-side to that is you can see where you need to clean. Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun soap was given to us by our daughter who discovered it online.  One of the black soaps from Africa, its ingredients have a very pleasant herbal odor and give a squeaky clean feeling without drying the skin.  My husband has psoriasis and feels it helps his skin improve.  We buy it in the 12 pack or more whenever we can afford it as this reduces the price significantly.  It is great as a shampoo also; if your hair tends to be limp, it supplies a body to it that lifts your roots, but you must use your usual creme rinse as hair will be tangled otherwise.  Be ready to reorder it if you try it.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s have skin problems so my sister recommended I try this.  They have been using it for nearly a month and the results are remarkable.  Even though they have different issues with their skin Dudu Osun black soap has worked wonders,  The flakiness and black patches from eczema has transitioned into normal skin, and my younger son had real issues with black heads on his nose... no more.  Now this is the real surprise.  I used it on my skin.  The first time I though I was going to die because it made my face sore.  After a month of using it my skin is doing a turnaround.  I mean I had was developing droopy eyelids and more signs of aging.  I was using revitalift for my eyes and garnier ultralift on my face.  I haven&#x27;t used either of them in weeks and I actually look BETTER.  This is the only thing I can attribute to the change. Clearer more evenly toned skin and my eyes???  Sore skin was so worth this.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this soap for 21 days, and I am so totally amazed by the results.  I have had problems with acne for 30 years, and am seeing total changes in my skin.  Places that were discolored ~ red and itchy ~ are clearing up, places that were scared ~ brown flaky ~ are smooth and soft.  I&#x27;m sold.  I want the whole world to try this soap.  I never feel like I&#x27;m suffocating in soap residue, I finally feel clean.  My skin loves this.  I love it, because I&#x27;m not embarrassed to show some skin for the first summer since .... I was a kid.</li>
            <li> I bought it per friends&#x27; recommendation.  It is really a good try. The feeling and the fragrance are both pleasant.</li>
            <li> I am changing my original negative review of this product. I was comparing this item to the same Dudu-Osun brand product purchased in Los Angeles 6 years ago. When I first compared this to the older version, the older version seemed stronger, with more exfoliating properties, and less of a commercial soap smell.    HOWEVER, after using what appears to be a newer formula for a couple of weeks, I see this soap is comparable to the original we have used for years (if not better). It appears that the newer soap received from this listing has more Shea butter compared to the older version. Shea butter is a good thing, so we don&#x27;t mind at all. As a result, the smell is a little milder and more fragrant, and the lather is not the deep, dark violet color like the older soap, which is good because it used to stain our shower tile and grout. This newer version still does eventually leave a burgundy/brown colored lather, but not nearly as intense as the older version.    Overall, this new formula (compared to the one we purchased 6+ years ago) works equally as well, if not better. After a couple of weeks, I can really notice the results and my skin actually feels smoother, cleaner, and tighter (if that makes any sense), than when I used the older formula. Both appeared the same as far as the packaging, etc., but this is a new formula. It appears slightly milder at first, but it works just as well, if not better. The exfoliating properties are also still there, but unlike the older one, you have to use the soap for a 2-3 days for the (roughness) to come out.    The only thing that cured my acne before I discovered Dudu-Osun were AcneFree three step system (very costly and time consuming) or Cetaphyl Antibacterial soap (harsh chemicals and twice as much cost as Dudu-Osun. Dudu-Osun works MUCH better than either of these products, is simple to use, and is very inexpensive when purchased on Amazon. Most importantly (to me) it is 100% natural, and it not only improved my acne, butmade my 37 year old facial skin as great as my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s facial skin. You can&#x27;t beat this product at any price, so at this price, how can you go wrong???</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this soap about three years ago through my fiance&#x60; because he does not use any processed perfumed soaps and he has the clearest skin that I have seen naturally; no blemishes whatsoever. This soap actually removes old cells and wherever there is a scar it actually lightens the scar in about two weeks; just totally amazing. You know when you use this soap, you are truly clean after bathing. Since using this soap, I use less deodorant, because the soap is active, and it really cleans deep in your pores. No more bumpy face or breakouts of acne at all. This soap is awesome.  A completely satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this soap for my face.  But I actually use it, literally all over.  I even use it to wash my hair.  I&#x27;m not so sure about for a facial wash, but my skin always feels super clean every single time I use it.  As for a shampoo, lathers up real well.  The hair comes out clean and surprisingly not too badly tangled or not at all depending. Would buy again, and I did get compliments when I first started using but I would prefer to use other facial scrubs, etc. along with this item for better results.  I think its a great product but in my case not for me.  Give it a try.  Wasn&#x27;t disappointed just got better results from other products, i.e. St.Ives  apricot scrub.  Oh, and additonally a lot of people comment on the smell.  It is pretty strong but I actually grew to like it.  To each his or her own.</li>
            <li> I started off purchasing this soap for my face but it has became my staple face and body soap the soap is natural, cleans, lathers, rinses off with no residue after use been using DuDu soap over a year now and will continue to make this soap my staple.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have EVER used. I used to use Dove soap, but after switching to this baby, I can feel an improvement in my own skin, and that is not something you can say about many other soaps. If you are thinking about trying this soap, then let me help you... DO IT! After I switched, I can&#x27;t use other soaps! I can feel the difference and other soaps don&#x27;t make my skin feel clean anymore. Buy this product! You will thank yourself for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend introduced me to this soap once and I have been thanking him ever since. I bought a few bars and gave one to my other family members and they keep coming back to ask me for more. I ordered a pack of 12 and when my mail lady delivered it, she said that she didnt know what I ordered, but it smelled amazing, and her whole mail truck smelled like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African and know about the product and love it. Happy to have found a seller that has a reasonable price. I&#x27;ll be back soon and get some more.</li>
            <li> This item arrived promptly and packaged well. It is a favorite of mine. I order it often and will continue in the future. It is gentle  on my dry skin. My husband likes it too. It has a nice fresh scent. I shall continue to buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin but this soap in conjunction with a pore brush from sephora works wonders.its much better than the expensive washes i used to get.</li>
            <li> Loved this soap, completely natural and it leaves the skin feeling so clean.  The smell is not like other \\&quot;perfumed soaps\\&quot;, it has a natural smell of the ingredients in it. I even use it for my face, feels super clean, but using on the face too much makes it feel dry. But in general, compared to traditional bath soaps, this soap leaves my skin more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. I don&#x27;t have skin problems but a lot of bar soap makes you feel dry.  This doesn&#x27;t. The smell is different, but not bad.  The one down side, is the soap leaves brown marks wherever you lay it down, so expect that. It&#x27;s not hard to clean, you just have to clean more to make your shower look white.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone who suffers from skin ailments or just enjoys having moisturized skin.It&#x27;s natural so the long term affects may take longer to see than the average technology infused items on today&#x27;s market.     I have a few family  members that suffer with skin ailments and it works wonderfully for them. Though I don&#x27;t have any skin allergies or conditions, I appreciate the moisture and rejuvenated look it gives my skin. I prefer to use it as a facial cleanser.     Whatever you do, DON&#x27;T use with white or light colored wash clothes, it stains the fabric and leaves a dingy unclean look (even with Clorox). It doesn&#x27;t affect tile or basins color wise but if not rinsed properly, you may have a slippery surface.     I&#x27;m always looking for a good deal on worthy products and I have yet to find a seller to give more for the dollar. Ounce for ounce it is better to buy in bulk than individually.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to order this soap after reading some of the 1-star reviews but decided to try it anyway since there were so many rave reviews. I am a fair skinned caucasian with dry skin (though not super sensitive) and I LOVE this soap! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month followed by shea butter which I also researched pretty thoroughly based on reviews. I also use it on my little boy who has had extremely dry skin and eczema. This soap with shea butter has been miraculous for his skin and there are no traces of eczema or the constant scratching he used to do. I think applying shea butter afterwards has been the main component with helping his skin.  The soap has a strong fragrance but it&#x27;s pleasant and smells clean. I think the thing I like best about this soap is that I feel so clean as well as silky. It seems that with soaps it&#x27;s either one or the other. Regular \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; soaps dry out my skin and leave a film. Natural moisturizing soaps leave the skin moisturized but don&#x27;t have that clean feel. I&#x27;ve never tried a soap like this that leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean AND silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I chose this soap after watching a you tuber do a review where she showed how her skin looked before using the soap and after using the soap for a couple months. I had eczema on my right hand for a while. I changed soaps using Canus goats milk soap (which is an excellent moisturizing soap), but it did nothing for my eczema. I decided to try the Dudu-Osun Black soap and within two weeks my right hand cleared up and has been that way ever since. It leaves my skin soft. I love this soap and will continue to purchase it. The only negative thing about the soap is the brown color it leaves on my wash cloth, but it rinses right out. So I guess it really is not a negative after all. I gave it five stars because there were no more stars to give. I would recommend this product to anyone with skin issues such as dry skin, eczema...etc.</li>
            <li> Great soap, great scent. People, this soap is for everyone, not just black people (do you know how incredibly ignorant that sounds?! I wish people would research stuff before they perpetuate this kind of nonsense.) It is called \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance. It is made from leaves and bark of various trees and plants that are burned in a kettle or vat. The leaves are from banana trees, plantain skins, leaves and bark, palm tree leaves, cocoa pods, shea tree bark, etc. The ashes from the leaves are then mixed with water and then filtered. Oils such as shea butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter are added to this water to create the soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is a blessing!  I have been battling acne (a 34 year old African American Woman with severe acne and hyper pigmentation).  I bought this after reading many reviews on the product.  I got a great deal buying in bulk here on Amazon but the soap does not last long.  I go through a bar a week but that&#x27;s okay because I love this stuff! I use the soap in the morning and  night all over my whole body.  I don&#x27;t finding it drying because I follow up the use with Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  The soap has a wonderful smell and does a great job cleansing my face and body.  After my shower I feel squeaky clean with no residue or film like other soaps of the past.  I also use it as a facial scrub once a week by taking a small piece of the soap and dipping it into sugar for an exfoliating sugar scrub.  Please, let me tell you, this soap in conjunction with my regimen of moisturizer (coconut oil) and fair and white bleaching creme, I have almost got rid of all of my dark marks.  I no longer get the cystic acne I was getting just an occiasional very small pimple here and there which is gone the next day. My skin loves this soap.  I used to also get a very itchy back from my old soap and now I don&#x27;t.  I will use this soap forever!</li>
            <li> This is the second time we purchased this item. I am 53 years old and have VERY oily skin. I use this daily and it works great.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I read a book that had the history of soap.  It prompted me to try out natural soap.  The first time I used it, and every time since, my skin felt different.  I even recognized the names of all the ingredients.  This is now my soap of choice.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> I buy this product all the time and even my husband has started using it. Love Love Love it. Reordering shortly</li>
            <li> As someone who has suffered from body acne for 10 years, this soap is by-far the best soap/body cleanser I&#x27;ve used - and I&#x27;ve used everything from Dove, to anti-acne washes, to Cetaphil.  I have been using it for about two years, and I believe it has played a major role in the clearing of my skin. Before it was pretty bad, almost cystic at times, and now I only get the occasional small red bump. That&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is all natural, and includes wonderful ingredients like honey, shea butter, aloe vera, and many other good-for-you natural oils and ashes. It gives off a fairly subtle, but pleasant smell. You can work up a rich lather with this soap without using a lot - one bar will last longer than normal soap. It also leaves you feeling very clean and fresh, without the feeling of any left over residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this soap strongly enough, especially to someone who has struggled with acne or any other skin ailment. It might not be a compete remedy, but it will definitely help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is absolutely worth buying in bulk to get a better price per bar. You won&#x27;t buy another soap again.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. It leaves you with no residue. If you wonder how I know this... the first time I used it after I turned off the shower and went to wipe the excess water off my arm it didn&#x27;t slide down, my hand stopped suddenly and that&#x27;s when I discovered all my life there was a soap residue left on me and I was repulsed by it. Listen, all I have to say is if you want to experience clean use Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li> This soap is my best ever discovery.  It has really changed a life long fight with my skin and facial break outs.  I have found it also heals minor wounds and sores better than products like Neosporin.  I gave a bar to my 88 yr old mother and she loves it too.  I do concur with other reviewers that you don&#x27;t want to use light colored washcloths.  I went to a big lot store and got the inexpensive pack of a nice brown...no worries about stains.  I just ordered a dozen bars and I hope Amazon carries this product FOREVER.</li>
            <li> This is  my favorite soap ever (for oily/acne prone skin!) It rinses clean, leaving no residue. It really helps with my oily skin without leaving it too dry like some benzoyl or sulphur soaps.</li>
            <li> I had a huge problem finding out how many unnatural and abrasive ingredients were in the soap I was using in the shower to clean my body daily. I wanted to find an amazing soap with ingredients I could read and understand. I was looking for an all natural product for my body and I found this and I&#x27;m glad I did. I had a special need though, but it never ended up mattering with this product. Okay, so I had suffered with cystic acne on my neck/back for a year or so after using some ill prescribed lotion and I felt helpless. No product I could find was ever able to fully clear my neckline of the cysts I had. This soap did that and then some. Dudu Osun Black Soap has made my skin smooth, vibrant, clear and great smelling. I use this soap all over my body. I bought it for my neck and its acne benefits but I use it on my body and hair too. I live with a hairstylist and he was amazed when I told him I used only this bar of soap on my hair. I have naturally thick hair and this soap leaves it manageable and light. The soap on my body skin is exfoliating and invigorating at the same time. As it removes dirt from my skin, the all natural ingredients soften and tone it while leaving it smelling like a rain forest (it literally smells like fresh flowers). This soap is made with all natural Vitamin A. Vitamin A, when formulated for skincare, has the ability to rapidly exfoliate and cleanse skin cells. Vitamin A powers Accutane, Tazorac and Retin-A to name a few of the top prescribed topical treatments for acne. The Vitamin A in this soap comes from COMPLETELY natural sources, all of which are listed on the back of every box (there may be 6 or 7 ingredients in the soap all together). I needed a natural soap for my body acne and this WAS IT. Not only did it clear my neckline COMPLETELY, this soap leaves my body fresh and clean. It makes my hair look and feel sensational. I will say it is powerful. I wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face because its that strong. It works great for my body but my facial skin is too sensitive and this stuff is powerful. This soap turned my body&#x27;s skin into fantastic skin within 2 months of daily use. This soap turned my hair into the envy of hairdressers. This soap is all natural. GO FOR IT. It leaves my bathroom and my body smelling like a garden. EXACTLY.</li>
            <li> One bar lasts a long time. Is an exfoliating soap. Helps with acne and is a cheaper facial soap. Dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this soap because of its natural ingredients and light fragrance. Dudu-Osun still provides the same burning sensation as regular soap which makes me skeptical about its natural properties when lather contacts the eyes. Overall I like the product enough to make a subsequent purchase.</li>
            <li> It great, my face feel good,the dark spots disappeared, I look younger!! Try it you will like it, I love it!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural pine tar soap at a great price, and found this soap, all natural though at first smelled a tad too perfumey but after use the smell died down, and the soap works great.  i highly recommend this product, great value.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful. I am in my late 70&#x27;s and my skin has never looked better. My daughter had dark scars from acne on her face and they have lightened considerably.  I also gave a bar to my grandson who suffers from teenage acne and eczema (he&#x27;s 13) and even he says this is the only soap he wants to use. His acne has cleared up and his eczema gets better every day. Some of the reviews I read said that the soap burned the first couple of times they used it. I didn&#x27;t notice that however my grandson said it was very mild burn and the burn went away by about the 4th time he used it. This black soap is worth every penny. I only wish I&#x27;d discovered it earlier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for years. Absolutely love it! When wet, it really creates a lot of suds. Also, the delivery was really quick</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this soap has a very rich lather. It does a good job of cleaning the skin. It may sting a little but I see that as validation that it&#x27;s doing what its supposed to do. I also like the fact that the ingredients are simple and straight to the point and you can Google all of them and see what&#x27;s going on your skin.

            <li> works for my dry, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;My 18yr. old son who has bouts with acne will not use any other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love this soap!!  I discovered this soap at the Houston International Festival!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
            <li> Loved by ALL  skin types.....many fakes out there,,,this IS real and best.  Many doctors promote this product ingredients...also good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great soap, well made with natural products. My nieces use it to keep acne away, it is very gentle on the skin and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I buy it in bulk so that I never run out.  Great for skin and hair.  This vendor through Amazon always gets it to me on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have finally tried African Black Soap!  It&#x27;s really as good as the other users are saying and I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, however, that just like there are different formulations for American and European made soaps, you need to shop around to find the brand of black soap that works best for you, since the formulas vary a little  in the different African countries.  My first choice is the Ghana made black soap, but Dudu-Osun comes in at a close second so it’s really a matter of preference.  Over all, African Black soap is a &amp;#34;one stop soap” because I use it to wash my hair as well as my body and it does WAY better as an antibacterial and deodorant soap, without using all those harsh chemicals.  Never mind that it leaves a ring, or that it lathers up dark on your wash cloth.  THE SOAP REALLY LEAVES THE SKIN SOFT.  I haven&#x27;t really needed to use much lotion since I started using it although I tend to have dry skin.  I don&#x27;t have major skin problems, but I trust the many other reviewers when they say it&#x27;s good for helping skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis.  I personally can say that the chemicals in the different shampoos had caused my hair to break badly and I was watching clumps wash down the drain.  Since I started shampooing my hair with this same black soap, the breakage has stopped and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m seeing and feeling my own natural hair for the first time in years!  No need for a lot of unnecessary product...  SAME BAR OF SOAP for body and hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a lot of time researching the different brands of black soap before making my purchases and made my choices based on the information provided and the reviews (Coastal Scents Black Soap with Shea Butter and Black Soap with Cocoa Butter; Dudu-Osun Black Soap).  My advice to first time users of any kind of black soap is to do your homework.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful to look at the ingredients and if it includes a bunch of chemicals and fragrances, then it&#x27;s not authentic but a westernized version, and those chemicals will probably cancel the simplicity and benefits of the black soap in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black soap is BROWN in color, not black.  Although Dudu-Osun looks black in the photos, it’s actually a dark brown color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful that the manufacturer is not putting black dye in the product in an attempt to duplicate the true African product which is very simple and natural.  If you aren&#x27;t sure, buy a couple of different bars and at least give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure it&#x27;s real AFRICAN Black Soap and not a westernized version being made by a manufacturer trying to get in on a new trend, but cutting corners and adding a bunch of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the bottom line is, I love it and it&#x27;s African Black soap from now on!hen it&#x27;s not authentic but a westernized version, and those chemicals will probably cancel the simplicity and benefits of the black soap in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Black soap is BROWN in color, not black.

            <li> This product is the best on the market, I have introduce this product to several peoples and all of them is well please with the results.</li>
            <li> This soap may bit a tad bit pricey. But, I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s worth it. I recommend giving it a try. Especially if you have acne or eczema.</li>
            <li> OBSESSED with this soap.  OBSESSED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves me with a clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Got rid of the acne on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could be considered a con is that this soap dries my skin.  I moisturize often, so I&#x27;m ok overall.</li>
            <li> Great all natural soap. Works great on oily faces, eczema, and dry skin all in 1 bar of soap! What else do you need?</li>
            <li> I use this as a shampoo bar. It keeps the scalp flake free and clean. It clears up the face as well. The first time I used it to wash my hair I felt my face tingling all over. After looking in the mirror my face was so soft and clean. I was like wowwwwwwwwwwww this Dudu -Osun will be a must have from now. It does not black up your shower, the bar lasts long as long as you keep it dry. Get this soap folks especially if you suffer from acne, dandruff, psoriasis, eczema etc.</li>
            <li> wonderful product and price.  will buy again.  this is the only soap my family and friends use.&lt;br /&gt;this is the best price found on the internet and at flea markets.&lt;br /&gt; use with shea butter.</li>
            <li> Its good for skin problems like agzema and acne I feel my skin be better with it . Even the smeel is nais</li>
            <li> The best cure for acne that I have seen. This is a very strong soap that will dry your skin out, but it will help your teenagers acne better than anything else that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Compared to others selling this product this is the most cost effective I have seen.  I also received the product very quickly. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have been having major problems with my skin.  The doctors kept saying it was eczema, which I have been told is a general term for skin problems when they cannot pin point the specific cause.  Anyway I have been on so many different medications which did not help much.  I began using the soap late last year and it seems to have calm down the itchiness of my skin.  Also, I had major discoloration on my legs, arms, and back due to the eczema.  I was told by the derms that because I am of color it will take a long time for the skin tone to return to its natural state.  Slowly but surely the color is evening out due to some of the ingredients in the soap.  I believe lime and possibly lemon are the soap, both of which are natural lightners. This soap is simply amazing!  It has helped me out so much with the skin problems I have been having.  I would definitely recommend this soap to anyone that is suffering with itchy, discoloration, or acne skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It leaves your skin clean and soft. I use it from head to toe!!!It is naturally made (water based) so it dissolves if left in water.  It also ships and arrives quickly :) 5 stars</li>
            <li> Love this product, my second time buying it.  Makes my skin feel really clean after I use it.  Just have to be sure to moisturize.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for years.  It does not dry out my skin in the winter months.  This was the best price that I could find.  Good soap with a pleasant smell.  New in the box, arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Great soap, lathers well, but can be a bit drying if you are a scrubber...like me...helps with oiliness and scars. when i refrain from scrubbing to much, not drying at all. no complaints.</li>
            <li> Love tis soap, bulk price is great.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve reached advanced age all kinds of new things show up.  Now I have a skin condition  on my lower legs.  Going to a dermatologist and he writes a very expensive  prescription in a small tube that you can only put on sparely  for only minor help.  I took a shot at trying to help myself with Dudo-Osun Black Soap and washing with it.  My problem is gone!!  It works!  I get the 12 pack.  Give 6 bars to my son and 6 bars for me.  I feel that this is worth a try for any skin condition.  I also use it for washing my hair.</li>
            <li> i have been using this soap for three years. i use it for washing my hair often but also use shampoo sometimes as the soap alone can dry it out. I am a 39 yr old male. give this soap a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap to wash my face for the past 3 months, and it&#x27;s been a nice surprise.  Some of the reviews had me worried as I have a sensitive skin.  The soap turned out to be good for me.  At first, my face felt really dry after washing it, but as long as you moisturize your face, you&#x27;re fine.  It did get rid of some of the blemishes, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on the soap alone to do that.  At any rate, I like this soap, because it leaves me feeling very clean whether it&#x27;s my face, or my body.  My girlfriend now uses it to wash her face, and she loves it too.  We&#x27;re sold!</li>
            <li> Great soap, Purchase this often. Oh, it&#x27;s time to reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dudu-Osun Black Soap for a while now and love how it cleans and leaves your skin. I&#x27;ve used it to clean my little dogs and their coat comes out phenomenal. The soap does have its downfall because it disintegrates quickly, but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome! My skin (which is naturally dry) is soft after using. I have very sensitive skin on my face, but I can wash my face with this with no problems. I have even used it to wash my hair. When I run out and have to use other soaps, I never feel \\&quot;clean\\&quot;. It it is not black when lathering, and you get so much lather, one bar lasts a long time. I recommend this soap to anyone with sensitive skin, or anyone that just wants to feel clean after a shower.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product at an awesome price!! I will surely be purchasing this product again and again...Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> have ordered several times&lt;br /&gt;this soap is now an everyday essential for&lt;br /&gt;the whole family&lt;br /&gt;been using it religiously for over a year now&lt;br /&gt;package good ship good product great</li>
            <li> This soap works great and lasts a time when used correctly. Get in shower and wet hair. Rub soap once thru hair and put in a dry place. Work soap and rinse. Wet a wash cloth and rub soap on once or twice. Put soap back in dry place and wash body while staying out of the water. Then rinse off.</li>
            <li> Natural, does the job and smells great.</li>
            <li> I am American African and I have 4 boys and 1 girl, oldest son is 20. We all benefit from using it whether just dry skin or eczema. Combine this with raw Shea butter as a moisturizer  and you are close to having beautiful skin. I say close b/c diet does matter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a year now and I love it. The smell is nice, the ingredients is all natural, and my skin feels better then before. Also this soap lathers very nicely as well. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Best soap on the market and a great value.  Smells wonderful and helped clear up my skin. LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> This lathers up nicely. This soap will leave your body feeling squeaky clean. I don&#x27;t really know what other great comments to say about this because of all the other great reviews. This review is just to reinforce the others.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this soap at least 6 years and we absolutely love it! I started our children on it too and we no longer have any issues with dry skin or eczema. I love the fact that it is natural and it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick soapy residue on your skin. I am going to try it on my face for some blemishes and dark spots. This is the cheapest price that I have seen so far!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes the skin feel fantastic!  It arrived fast and with out any issues. I woukd definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand black soap for some years now and will continue to use.  I love the smell, how it cleans my skin, and keeps it soft also.  It is a bit drying, but the benefits out weigh that minor effect because I keep my skin moisturized.  The price was great also, and I like to buy this soap in bulk so that I will not run out.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I used the Dudu-Osun Black Soap only for my face. It leaves the skin feeliing clean amd moisturize instead of tight and dry as most other soaps do.  The price was excellent on the 12-pack.  I am unable to find this product locally.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it from Amazon and received it quickly. I get many coompliments on my complexion and would highly recomment this&lt;br /&gt;soap to anyone.</li>
            <li> yea great soap only thing is it&#x27;s black and now you will have all this black soap residue in your soap dish, sink, and tub.&lt;br /&gt;but its nice soap.</li>
            <li> I had bought another type of black soap but this brand is so much more yummy!  The smell when taking a shower is fresh and fantastic. It fragrances the bathroom and surrounding rooms, not strong but just a pleasing clean smell. You skin is soft not tight. Also, the cost per bar is so reasonable compared to the others I bought. This is definitely a keeper, I will reorder in the future as I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson who suffers from acne, it works well but quite drying.</li>
            <li> I heard about \\&quot;Dudu-Osun Black Soap\\&quot; on the Dr. Oz show so I thought I would give it a try.  I really am pleased.  It smells good and it leaves me feeling clean &amp; refreshed and isn&#x27;t drying.  I bought a 12 pack of this soap and have given a couple bars to friends.  They too really have liked it.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, as described.  Love the soap, smells great- my new favorite!  It&#x27;s all natural and leaves the bathroom smelling great too!</li>
            <li> This s the best soap ever.  I am a burn survivor that has struggled many, many years with dry, cracking, and flaking skin.  This soap has made a huge difference in my skin. i have been using ot for almost a year now, and I will never go back to using over the counter soaps.  It&#x27;s a pure, clean and natural soap that doesn&#x27;t leave a soap residue on the body, and it conditions to skin as well as your hair.  Yes, this can also be used as a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, I promise you will love this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the raw black soap, but it is a very good quality of soap.  It smells pleasant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khalfani</li>
            <li> My brother brought this lotion home from college maybe six years ago and I was in love with it. Surprisingly after all this time the formula and the box it came in is exactly the same. OoooOooo the smell is what gives it a five. Buy this son!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and it smells great. This is the only soap my husband will use now. He used to use Dove because he has sensitive skin.  Now, he uses this. He loves the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Helps keep hands supple.  The only problem is that it is black and the soap dish looks awful most of the time, but it smells terrific and seems to help.</li>
