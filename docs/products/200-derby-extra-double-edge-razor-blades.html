            <li>I prefer a sharper blade, but you might be happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great value.  </li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>These blades tilt toward forgiveness and \\&quot;mildness\\&quot; at just over a nickel per blade which, for many, makes this the perfect double-edge blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have known the price/quanity was to good for them to be a quality product.</li>
            <li>about 4 to 6 good shaves out of 1 blade...........YMMV.</li>
            <li>I tried the sample pack from another Amazon purchase... and found the Derby to be a consistently good close shave for my face that works well with my razor.  </li>
            <li>Good for the cost.</li>
            <li>If it is after that time you can assume that the blades worked out good for me.ut</li>
            <li>If it is after that time you can assume that the blades worked out good for me.</li>
            <li>Good quality.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a sample pack of blades here on Amazon and loved the Derby Blades.</li>
            <li>but they are a good, sharp-enough, servicle blade.</li>
            <li>I decided to try these because of the price and was very pleased that they worked out for me.</li>
            <li>These razors are a great deal, are comfortable to use, and give a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I love these blades!  </li>
            <li>Very good razor blades for an economical price.  </li>
            <li>Great deal and smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>These are an amazing deal for the price.</li>
            <li>If I have the time, I&#x27;ll have a nice relaxing shave that results in a BBS face.</li>
            <li>and I liked them.</li>
            <li>These blades are the best deal here on Amazon, and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>; compared the latest Gillette to their own disposable plastic razor.</li>
            <li>They lose edge VERY quickly, but that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s 200 of them!</li>
            <li>They provide a good close smooth shave and are better than the Merkur blades that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li>but this was a great investment, great quality and big money saver.</li>
            <li>Love shopping at Amazon, the best, order is fast , accurate, and , on time, product is like they advertise and will continue to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The cut is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have to say, having fiddled around with several brands, these are the best I&#x27;ve found for me.  </li>
            <li>They are also astonishing value.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have bought more of those.</li>
            <li>We have been very happy with these blades and also use them on several vintage Gillette razors in my Rotation.</li>
            <li>There are some excellent videos on You Tube of how to shave properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying I love Derby&#x27;s DE blades.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re my favorite blades I&#x27;ve tried since switching to DE razors 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>This blade is able to provide me with 2 to 3 days of shaving.  </li>
            <li>You will love these</li>
            <li>These are among my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>Now, I love Feather blades..........</li>
            <li>you make Derby look better and</li>
            <li>They are well packaged and at this price a truly phenomenal value.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These razors are cheap and 200 lasts FOREVER!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there might be better blades out there for more money, but I&#x27;m shaving my face, not performing surgery</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Not often that I am able to get two shaves from a blade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
            <li>However, blades are very personal, so if they work for you, then great!</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, I like the Derby blades better.</li>
            <li>And they give me four good shaves before I trade them out for a fresh blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soap and shaving balm are more of a factor than the price of these blades.  </li>
            <li>Many are.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite brand</li>
            <li>After 7 or 8 weeks of using the Derby Extra blades, I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so satisfied</li>
            <li>And best of all, I can go against the grain, and go for a total of three passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would love to review this item.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they are better for a mans beard hair.</li>
            <li>These are a lot more forgiving than sharper blades in that you&#x27;re not going to cut up your face.</li>
            <li>I stocked up and have been very happy with the blades performance overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great value and a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I have also tried the Shark blades and those were also pretty good blades.</li>
            <li>I use an Edwin Jagger DE89 and it is an amazingly close, mild shave</li>
            <li>There are better blades available but for the cost these do</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp with good packaging!  </li>
            <li>These razors are incredibly sharp and are the best out of the blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and could easily do three</li>
            <li>Seems to easily dig into my skin regardless of my angle or pressure.  </li>
            <li>Easy to learn on</li>
            <li>Good technique is a must as is a good razor and skin protection when you begin wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have course hair, nor fine</li>
            <li>I could easily get a week out of them though, but why bother when they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making this available and your fine service.</li>
            <li>worth the purchase for sure.</li>
            <li>These are a great middle of the road blade.  </li>
            <li>Team these up with Proraso products which are also available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My shaving has been comfortable and not even a cut yet.</li>
            <li>These blades provided me a minimum of two comfortable</li>
            <li>I like that they are so cheap that I never need to re-use a blade.</li>
            <li>So buy these blades and give them a try for a smooth bloodless shave.</li>
            <li>#500 + 5 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Your experiences may vary, but the quality of these blades is top notch and the cost is economical.</li>
            <li>While these aren&#x27;t the sharpest blades, you can&#x27;t beat the value in this very economical deal.</li>
            <li>I just want to warn people that might get excited about this price and</li>
            <li>They are a quality blade with a consistent edge from blade to blade, so if they work for you, you can be confident that they will always work.  </li>
            <li>Avoid price hikes, out of stocks, back orders, worrying about sales &amp; who offers the allegedly best discounts, along with FREE freight for qualifying orders.</li>
            <li>This fits my old double edge razor perfect.</li>
            <li>This was my second order from Deals For Salons and it was just as great as the first (Astra blades) one.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a dot of cocoa butter lotion with the lucky tiger</li>
            <li>and I love the feel of using a classic razor.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to invest in more premium blades that are consistently high quality.</li>
            <li>Concerning the quantity you are offered for this small price, you have a very good deal.</li>
            <li>I tried most of the top names, but, Derby&#x27;s were EXTREMELY SMOOTH yet sharp.  </li>
            <li>A little pre-info, I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL razor and EJ best badger brush with Lucky Tiger aftershave, and either proraso sensitive shaving soap or Dr Harris Lavender shaving soap (I like them both).  </li>
            <li>I can easily recommend these to someone who is just starting out using a double edge and those who are experienced users.</li>
            <li>After reading a lot of reviews on Badger &amp; Blade, and also getting some Derby&#x27;s Free with an Edwin Jagger Razor that I bought on Amazon, I felt that by considering the quality and value of Derby I would commit to a large supply.</li>
            <li>My favorite blades, pretty sharp, glides over face nicely, leaves me with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>So the real question is whether they are suitable for your particular shave.  </li>
            <li>While not in the same class as Feather blades, these Derbys&#x27; are a great blade and a good bargan that is hard to pass up.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the switch.</li>
            <li>The blade is very forgiving to new  double edge shavers, and is a great beginner blade.  </li>
            <li>how much cheaper it is than other listings for Derby DE blades on Amazon: if something seems too good to be true, there&#x27;s probably a reason.</li>
            <li>: Solid performer, I don&#x27;t like them quite as much as the personna reds but they are better for me than merkur and the ones I choose to purchase because they are wicked cheap on a lot of sites.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Astra: I didn&#x27;t like these very much.  </li>
            <li>I get a very smooth shave especially after three passes without cuts or nicks.  </li>
            <li>Good blades, but after 3 times i really need to change it and with other blades i get about 5 times before i have to change it.</li>
            <li>After having compared Merkur, Feather, Derby, Astra, Lord,  I can say that although the Feather&#x27;s are definitely the sharpest, they are not the most forgiving.</li>
            <li>When I am done, I am smooth and soft to the touch without feeling the razor burn you often feel with cartridge multi blade razor blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sampler packs of blades, and I found that these gave me a consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>Initially, I thought sharper blades like Feather, would be better.  </li>
            <li>The great thing is, at one blade a week, this will will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>First off, I use a Merkur Futur, just for reference.</li>
            <li>First off, everyone has a preference for blades so unless it&#x27;s garbage, you&#x27;ll get uncertain reviews.</li>
            <li>but I think is appropriate so you can get a feel for how this specific blade performs or stacks up to the competition.</li>
            <li>I would only choose the personnas over thesee if I could find the personnas for a more competative price.  </li>
            <li>Astra or Gilette or most especially Feather blades are what you want if you are looking for sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>because they arent consistent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve returned to shaving with a double-edge razor after many years of shelling out multiple dollars for cartridges.  </li>
            <li>The plastic blade container also holds the used blades so that&#x27;s a definite and safe convenience.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, this was the first double-edge blade I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>First rate blades for novices &amp; seasoned pros.</li>
            <li>The price alone makes this a stellar bargain.</li>
            <li>I get 4 perfect shaves before they drag a little.</li>
            <li>and these are good enough that I am still on the same box from two years ago, but I do skip shaving in the winter.</li>
            <li>I found the sharks were ok, but I seem to knick myself with some regularity using them - and the Derby&#x27;s have yet to draw blood (and they shave beautifully as long as I remember to change them weekly...</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a straight razor.</li>
            <li>am not a shaving connoisseur who has tried every brand on the market but they certainly blow the store bought blades out of the water</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s coincidence, it&#x27;s been a very consistent one so far.  </li>
            <li>Though, if I need a much quicker shave, I can still do so, and not end up with road rash on my face.</li>
            <li>Occasionally the blades will glide effortlessly and give me a fantastic shave.  </li>
            <li>I get a really close shave</li>
            <li>I wanted to like these so much.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see the need to start experimenting.</li>
            <li>You get a whole weeks of shaves with one blade and the cost per blade is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>They are stainless steel.</li>
            <li>is how I feel after having used up all 5 packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather: Definitely the sharpest by far, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I can get at least three good shaves from one blade, using them in a M&amp;uuml;hle R89 Grande razor.</li>
            <li>experience suggests these are sharp enough to avoid pulling, giving me a good shave in two passes.  </li>
            <li>They are of a consistently high quality and as I have a rather difficult beard can be relied upon to produce a good smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>A little too much resistance but all around solid blade if you get a good price</li>
            <li>I was thrilled at the price as this is literally a fraction of the usual price</li>
            <li>While they are not as sharp as others, they are cheap enough through offers like this that I am able to use them while traveling; throwing out the blade every day.</li>
            <li>I cut myself less, and seem to do a better shaving job with these blades.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money; never going back to cartridge razors ever again.</li>
            <li>These are probably best left to those without thick facial hair, or those who have a tendency to shave too fast/sloppily and cut themselves regularly with sharper razors.</li>
            <li>The Astra&#x27;s weren&#x27;t nearly as sharp (but still smooth), and the Feather&#x27;s are smooth, but WAY too sharp and cause razor burn.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to DE shaving or are shopping for new blades to use try Derby.</li>
            <li>I have a new box of 200 coming</li>
            <li>I tend to use a new blade every 1-2 weeks, so a pack this size lasts for well over a year.</li>
            <li>I can only use them a couple of shaves and I am hacking away even at first use.  </li>
            <li>Once you get used to an old fashioned razor you will be hooked!</li>
            <li>First off, everyones skin is different.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a bulk order of 200 on Amazon for less than $13 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately many of the blades are not very good, but the quantity makes up for it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;in quality, even more so in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a rather coarse beard and typically skip a day of shaving once or twice each week.</li>
            <li>Before it sounds like I am trying to promote this blade because it is cheap, I would like to point out that Muhle ships their fine and expensive razors with this blade included in the box.</li>
            <li>Each dispenser is wrapped in clear wrapping.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I have mild razor burn with these, but less than with Dorco blades, and about the same as the Israeli Personnas and the Israeli Crystals (similarly priced, and similarly mild blades, in my experience).  </li>
            <li>I alternate them with Shark stainless blades.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>B0007MW32Y Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College Shaving Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>B000IB0G8M Geo F. Trumper Coconut Oil Soft Shaving Cream</li>
            <li>My only beef really is with the blades themselves, though I knew what I was getting into.</li>
            <li>This blade is a great price for the money, does not last as long as others that I have used in the past , but the price is right, so change your blade a little early.</li>
            <li>imagine this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if your have a thin beard, as long as your technique is good.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I get one that is duller than the others, and I have to replace it right away (like after a single shave).  </li>
            <li>would buy a small batch the first time you try these, rather than 200 straight off.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have had some bad blades here and there, but overall these have been pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard and depending on how many days I go without shaving, I can get</li>
            <li>&gt; When Feather prices are too high, I will buy these, and here lately Feather blades have not been economical for me, but these have been working out for me.</li>
            <li>You cant really recommend razor blades to anyone because everyone has a different face and their facial hair grows differently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for one year, &amp; have no regrets.</li>
            <li>More often they snag on my skin or leave a millimeter or two of stubble behind.  </li>
            <li>To be fair, my beard is VERY thick, so I have to use a very sharp blade, so I use Feathers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not knocking them down for that, but its the first thing that I need to mention.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;ve got thick, wiry facial hair, you pretty much get one good shave per razor and then have to switch or risk some pretty brutal razor burn.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves these for her legs ,but are not sharp enough for my beard .</li>
            <li>These are very well made razor blades, thin, sharp and comfortable.</li>

            <li> Great value.  </li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> These blades tilt toward forgiveness and \\&quot;mildness\\&quot; at just over a nickel per blade which, for many, makes this the perfect double-edge blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have known the price/quanity was to good for them to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> about 4 to 6 good shaves out of 1 blade...........YMMV.</li>
            <li> I tried the sample pack from another Amazon purchase... and found the Derby to be a consistently good close shave for my face that works well with my razor.  </li>
            <li> Good for the cost.</li>
            <li> If it is after that time you can assume that the blades worked out good for me.ut</li>
            <li> If it is after that time you can assume that the blades worked out good for me.</li>
            <li> Good quality.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a sample pack of blades here on Amazon and loved the Derby Blades.</li>
            <li> but they are a good, sharp-enough, servicle blade.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these because of the price and was very pleased that they worked out for me.</li>
            <li> These razors are a great deal, are comfortable to use, and give a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I love these blades!  </li>
            <li> Very good razor blades for an economical price.  </li>
            <li> Great deal and smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> These are an amazing deal for the price.</li>
            <li> If I have the time, I&#x27;ll have a nice relaxing shave that results in a BBS face.</li>
            <li> and I liked them.</li>
            <li> These blades are the best deal here on Amazon, and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> ; compared the latest Gillette to their own disposable plastic razor.</li>
            <li> They lose edge VERY quickly, but that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s 200 of them!</li>
            <li> They provide a good close smooth shave and are better than the Merkur blades that came with my razor.  </li>
            <li> but this was a great investment, great quality and big money saver.</li>
            <li> Love shopping at Amazon, the best, order is fast , accurate, and , on time, product is like they advertise and will continue to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The cut is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have to say, having fiddled around with several brands, these are the best I&#x27;ve found for me.  </li>
            <li> They are also astonishing value.  </li>
            <li> Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought more of those.</li>
            <li> We have been very happy with these blades and also use them on several vintage Gillette razors in my Rotation.</li>
            <li> There are some excellent videos on You Tube of how to shave properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I love Derby&#x27;s DE blades.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re my favorite blades I&#x27;ve tried since switching to DE razors 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> This blade is able to provide me with 2 to 3 days of shaving.  </li>
            <li> You will love these</li>
            <li> These are among my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> Now, I love Feather blades..........</li>
            <li> you make Derby look better and</li>
            <li> They are well packaged and at this price a truly phenomenal value.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These razors are cheap and 200 lasts FOREVER!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there might be better blades out there for more money, but I&#x27;m shaving my face, not performing surgery</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Not often that I am able to get two shaves from a blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
            <li> However, blades are very personal, so if they work for you, then great!</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, I like the Derby blades better.</li>
            <li> And they give me four good shaves before I trade them out for a fresh blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soap and shaving balm are more of a factor than the price of these blades.  </li>
            <li> Many are.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite brand</li>
            <li> After 7 or 8 weeks of using the Derby Extra blades, I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so satisfied</li>
            <li> And best of all, I can go against the grain, and go for a total of three passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would love to review this item.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they are better for a mans beard hair.</li>
            <li> These are a lot more forgiving than sharper blades in that you&#x27;re not going to cut up your face.</li>
            <li> I stocked up and have been very happy with the blades performance overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great value and a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the Shark blades and those were also pretty good blades.</li>
            <li> I use an Edwin Jagger DE89 and it is an amazingly close, mild shave</li>
            <li> There are better blades available but for the cost these do</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp with good packaging!  </li>
            <li> These razors are incredibly sharp and are the best out of the blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and could easily do three</li>
            <li> Seems to easily dig into my skin regardless of my angle or pressure.  </li>
            <li> Easy to learn on</li>
            <li> Good technique is a must as is a good razor and skin protection when you begin wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have course hair, nor fine</li>
            <li> I could easily get a week out of them though, but why bother when they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this available and your fine service.</li>
            <li> worth the purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> These are a great middle of the road blade.  </li>
            <li> Team these up with Proraso products which are also available from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My shaving has been comfortable and not even a cut yet.</li>
            <li> These blades provided me a minimum of two comfortable</li>
            <li> I like that they are so cheap that I never need to re-use a blade.</li>
            <li> So buy these blades and give them a try for a smooth bloodless shave.</li>
            <li> #500 + 5 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Your experiences may vary, but the quality of these blades is top notch and the cost is economical.</li>
            <li> While these aren&#x27;t the sharpest blades, you can&#x27;t beat the value in this very economical deal.</li>
            <li> I just want to warn people that might get excited about this price and</li>
            <li> They are a quality blade with a consistent edge from blade to blade, so if they work for you, you can be confident that they will always work.  </li>
            <li> Avoid price hikes, out of stocks, back orders, worrying about sales &amp; who offers the allegedly best discounts, along with FREE freight for qualifying orders.</li>
            <li> This fits my old double edge razor perfect.</li>
            <li> This was my second order from Deals For Salons and it was just as great as the first (Astra blades) one.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a dot of cocoa butter lotion with the lucky tiger</li>
            <li> and I love the feel of using a classic razor.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to invest in more premium blades that are consistently high quality.</li>
            <li> Concerning the quantity you are offered for this small price, you have a very good deal.</li>
            <li> I tried most of the top names, but, Derby&#x27;s were EXTREMELY SMOOTH yet sharp.  </li>
            <li> A little pre-info, I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL razor and EJ best badger brush with Lucky Tiger aftershave, and either proraso sensitive shaving soap or Dr Harris Lavender shaving soap (I like them both).  </li>
            <li> I can easily recommend these to someone who is just starting out using a double edge and those who are experienced users.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews on Badger &amp; Blade, and also getting some Derby&#x27;s Free with an Edwin Jagger Razor that I bought on Amazon, I felt that by considering the quality and value of Derby I would commit to a large supply.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades, pretty sharp, glides over face nicely, leaves me with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> So the real question is whether they are suitable for your particular shave.  </li>
            <li> While not in the same class as Feather blades, these Derbys&#x27; are a great blade and a good bargan that is hard to pass up.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> but it was worth the switch.</li>
            <li> The blade is very forgiving to new  double edge shavers, and is a great beginner blade.  </li>
            <li> how much cheaper it is than other listings for Derby DE blades on Amazon: if something seems too good to be true, there&#x27;s probably a reason.</li>
            <li> : Solid performer, I don&#x27;t like them quite as much as the personna reds but they are better for me than merkur and the ones I choose to purchase because they are wicked cheap on a lot of sites.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Astra: I didn&#x27;t like these very much.  </li>
            <li> I get a very smooth shave especially after three passes without cuts or nicks.  </li>
            <li> Good blades, but after 3 times i really need to change it and with other blades i get about 5 times before i have to change it.</li>
            <li> After having compared Merkur, Feather, Derby, Astra, Lord,  I can say that although the Feather&#x27;s are definitely the sharpest, they are not the most forgiving.</li>
            <li> When I am done, I am smooth and soft to the touch without feeling the razor burn you often feel with cartridge multi blade razor blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sampler packs of blades, and I found that these gave me a consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> Initially, I thought sharper blades like Feather, would be better.  </li>
            <li> The great thing is, at one blade a week, this will will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> First off, I use a Merkur Futur, just for reference.</li>
            <li> First off, everyone has a preference for blades so unless it&#x27;s garbage, you&#x27;ll get uncertain reviews.</li>
            <li> but I think is appropriate so you can get a feel for how this specific blade performs or stacks up to the competition.</li>
            <li> I would only choose the personnas over thesee if I could find the personnas for a more competative price.  </li>
            <li> Astra or Gilette or most especially Feather blades are what you want if you are looking for sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> because they arent consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned to shaving with a double-edge razor after many years of shelling out multiple dollars for cartridges.  </li>
            <li> The plastic blade container also holds the used blades so that&#x27;s a definite and safe convenience.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, this was the first double-edge blade I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> First rate blades for novices &amp; seasoned pros.</li>
            <li> The price alone makes this a stellar bargain.</li>
            <li> I get 4 perfect shaves before they drag a little.</li>
            <li> and these are good enough that I am still on the same box from two years ago, but I do skip shaving in the winter.</li>
            <li> I found the sharks were ok, but I seem to knick myself with some regularity using them - and the Derby&#x27;s have yet to draw blood (and they shave beautifully as long as I remember to change them weekly...</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a straight razor.</li>
            <li> am not a shaving connoisseur who has tried every brand on the market but they certainly blow the store bought blades out of the water</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s coincidence, it&#x27;s been a very consistent one so far.  </li>
            <li> Though, if I need a much quicker shave, I can still do so, and not end up with road rash on my face.</li>
            <li> Occasionally the blades will glide effortlessly and give me a fantastic shave.  </li>
            <li> I get a really close shave</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these so much.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see the need to start experimenting.</li>
            <li> You get a whole weeks of shaves with one blade and the cost per blade is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> They are stainless steel.</li>
            <li> is how I feel after having used up all 5 packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather: Definitely the sharpest by far, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I can get at least three good shaves from one blade, using them in a M&amp;uuml;hle R89 Grande razor.</li>
            <li> experience suggests these are sharp enough to avoid pulling, giving me a good shave in two passes.  </li>
            <li> They are of a consistently high quality and as I have a rather difficult beard can be relied upon to produce a good smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> A little too much resistance but all around solid blade if you get a good price</li>
            <li> I was thrilled at the price as this is literally a fraction of the usual price</li>
            <li> While they are not as sharp as others, they are cheap enough through offers like this that I am able to use them while traveling; throwing out the blade every day.</li>
            <li> I cut myself less, and seem to do a better shaving job with these blades.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money; never going back to cartridge razors ever again.</li>
            <li> These are probably best left to those without thick facial hair, or those who have a tendency to shave too fast/sloppily and cut themselves regularly with sharper razors.</li>
            <li> The Astra&#x27;s weren&#x27;t nearly as sharp (but still smooth), and the Feather&#x27;s are smooth, but WAY too sharp and cause razor burn.  </li>
            <li> If you are new to DE shaving or are shopping for new blades to use try Derby.</li>
            <li> I have a new box of 200 coming</li>
            <li> I tend to use a new blade every 1-2 weeks, so a pack this size lasts for well over a year.</li>
            <li> I can only use them a couple of shaves and I am hacking away even at first use.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to an old fashioned razor you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> First off, everyones skin is different.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a bulk order of 200 on Amazon for less than $13 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately many of the blades are not very good, but the quantity makes up for it.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;in quality, even more so in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a rather coarse beard and typically skip a day of shaving once or twice each week.</li>
            <li> Before it sounds like I am trying to promote this blade because it is cheap, I would like to point out that Muhle ships their fine and expensive razors with this blade included in the box.</li>
            <li> Each dispenser is wrapped in clear wrapping.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I have mild razor burn with these, but less than with Dorco blades, and about the same as the Israeli Personnas and the Israeli Crystals (similarly priced, and similarly mild blades, in my experience).  </li>
            <li> I alternate them with Shark stainless blades.</li>
            <li> but my skin is sensitive.  </li>

            <li> B000IB0G8M Geo F. Trumper Coconut Oil Soft Shaving Cream</li>
            <li> My only beef really is with the blades themselves, though I knew what I was getting into.</li>
            <li> This blade is a great price for the money, does not last as long as others that I have used in the past , but the price is right, so change your blade a little early.</li>
            <li> imagine this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if your have a thin beard, as long as your technique is good.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I get one that is duller than the others, and I have to replace it right away (like after a single shave).  </li>
            <li> would buy a small batch the first time you try these, rather than 200 straight off.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have had some bad blades here and there, but overall these have been pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and depending on how many days I go without shaving, I can get</li>
            <li> &gt; When Feather prices are too high, I will buy these, and here lately Feather blades have not been economical for me, but these have been working out for me.</li>
            <li> You cant really recommend razor blades to anyone because everyone has a different face and their facial hair grows differently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for one year, &amp; have no regrets.</li>
            <li> More often they snag on my skin or leave a millimeter or two of stubble behind.  </li>
            <li> To be fair, my beard is VERY thick, so I have to use a very sharp blade, so I use Feathers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not knocking them down for that, but its the first thing that I need to mention.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ve got thick, wiry facial hair, you pretty much get one good shave per razor and then have to switch or risk some pretty brutal razor burn.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves these for her legs ,but are not sharp enough for my beard .</li>
            <li> These are very well made razor blades, thin, sharp and comfortable.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not hair trigger sharp, but offer very close shaves with minimal facial disruptions.</li>
            <li> This is the third or fourth set I have bought over the years and at 200 blades a container they last a reasonably long time.  </li>
            <li> if my skin is feeling particularly dry (but usually I like that lucky tiger does not leave much moisturizing behind though as my skin is typically not dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on the seller of these blades (I see some people complaining about them being old or dull) but I have a new box of 200 coming</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands of double edge blades but always come back to Derby Extra.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, including solingen and merkur razor blades and they made shaving a painful experience; but when I tried this Derby razors it was a whole different world, you can shave easily</li>
            <li> how long I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well suited for several wet shaves without having to change blades.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the difficulty I have sometimes getting new blades from the cartridge.</li>
            <li> I use Derby Extra blades for my standard, everyday shave.</li>
            <li> The standard out of the box is sharp and stays fairly sharp for a while.</li>
            <li> I have been double edge shaving now for a little over three years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say bout 40% of the blades I&#x27;ve used thus far have been so dull it&#x27;s literally pulling the hairs out of my face.</li>
            <li> Derby blades are smooth cutting, and I can shave about 3 to 5 times before changing the blade.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve spent on shaving.</li>
            <li> and I dont&#x27; always have 45mins of careful time for a shave.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way the drag on my face feels or the shave I get from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re curious, I use/rotate between the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Clean cutting during the shave and leaves me with no razor bumps.</li>
            <li> A little more expensive though and hard to get on amazon</li>
            <li> The derby&#x27;s on the other hand, offer a balance of sharpness, and forgiveness.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on other reviews but have found they are not as sharp as the Feather brand.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sharp as can be.</li>
            <li> They are not that sharp but it will get the job done without you feeling any pulling or anything.</li>
            <li> The blades have not been consistently sharp out of 100 blades for me.</li>
            <li> These blades arent sharp.</li>
            <li> , the reason I give them three stars isn&#x27;t because they aren&#x27;t sharp,</li>
            <li> Also, the packages came written in a foreign language (Turkish I think?).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady that uses a safety razor and these are just too sharp for me.  </li>
            <li> least get your supplies without aggravation &amp; extreme financial outlays.</li>
            <li> average blades and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read negative reviews about these blades, but this is my second purchase of 200, and they have been working for me.</li>
            <li> Derby tops them all hands down.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> these blades are a great price....average blades and i get about 3 shaves per blade before tossing them. worth the purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> I stocked up on these at a rock bottom price:  at my present rate of usage I&#x27;ll need replacements in 2021.  Good deal, yes!</li>
            <li> I have to say, having fiddled around with several brands, these are the best I&#x27;ve found for me.  They are also astonishing value.  I found the sharks were ok, but I seem to knick myself with some regularity using them - and the Derby&#x27;s have yet to draw blood (and they shave beautifully as long as I remember to change them weekly...) If it&#x27;s coincidence, it&#x27;s been a very consistent one so far.  I think the best advice anyone can offer with blades is try &#x27;em before you buy &#x27;em... meaning don&#x27;t buy a 200 pack of anything on someone else&#x27;s say so.  Get a few of each. Test and see. Then buy the ones you like.  I do like these, however.  You should at least try them.</li>
            <li> you can spend three bucks a blade for your gilette fusion, or thirty times less with your father&#x27;s DE. the choice is yours.</li>
            <li> For the price of about 5 typical razor cartridges, I had 200 razor blades delivered to my house without a hitch or a problem.  Great deal and smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Concerning the quantity you are offered for this small price, you have a very good deal.</li>
            <li> After having compared Merkur, Feather, Derby, Astra, Lord,  I can say that although the Feather&#x27;s are definitely the sharpest, they are not the most forgiving. The derby&#x27;s on the other hand, offer a balance of sharpness, and forgiveness. If I have the time, I&#x27;ll have a nice relaxing shave that results in a BBS face. Though, if I need a much quicker shave, I can still do so, and not end up with road rash on my face. This cannot be done with the feathers. Well worth the money; never going back to cartridge razors ever again.</li>
            <li> If anyone thinks that all DE blades shave the same they are mistaken. I have tried Shark, Merkur, Dorco, Lord, Personna, Wilkinson Sword, and Supermax. Derby tops them all hands down. Derby blades are smooth cutting, and I can shave about 3 to 5 times before changing the blade. These blades do not feel like they are pulling my skin and beard rather than shaving hairs as some of the others do. Merkur and Dorco blades are especially uncomfortable in this way. I use Derby blades with a Merkur Progress razor. If you are new to DE shaving or are shopping for new blades to use try Derby. I almost gave up DE shaving as too uncomfortable until I realized the vast difference in blades and tried a pack of Derby that a friend gave me. BIG Difference!</li>
            <li> These are a great middle of the road blade.  They provide a good close smooth shave and are better than the Merkur blades that came with my razor.  While not in the same class as Feather blades, these Derbys&#x27; are a great blade and a good bargan that is hard to pass up.</li>
            <li> Love shopping at Amazon, the best, order is fast , accurate, and , on time, product is like they advertise and will continue to order through Amazon. Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on other reviews but have found they are not as sharp as the Feather brand. Wish I would have bought more of those. Now I have 200 so so blades.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of reviews on Badger &amp; Blade, and also getting some Derby&#x27;s Free with an Edwin Jagger Razor that I bought on Amazon, I felt that by considering the quality and value of Derby I would commit to a large supply. We have been very happy with these blades and also use them on several vintage Gillette razors in my Rotation. Team these up with Proraso products which are also available from Amazon. Good technique is a must as is a good razor and skin protection when you begin wet shaving. There are some excellent videos on You Tube of how to shave properly. Use the 3 pass method for BBS shaves, and each Derby lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I love Derby&#x27;s DE blades. They&#x27;re my favorite blades I&#x27;ve tried since switching to DE razors 5 years ago. However, I&#x27;ve had very bad luck with this batch of 200 ct that I ordered recently. I was thrilled at the price as this is literally a fraction of the usual price but perhaps there&#x27;s a reason. I&#x27;d say bout 40% of the blades I&#x27;ve used thus far have been so dull it&#x27;s literally pulling the hairs out of my face. Each time I throw it away, I pull another out and it&#x27;s sharp as can be. Maybe it&#x27;s a faulty batch, I don&#x27;t know. I just want to warn people that might get excited about this price and how much cheaper it is than other listings for Derby DE blades on Amazon: if something seems too good to be true, there&#x27;s probably a reason.</li>
            <li> This blade is able to provide me with 2 to 3 days of shaving.  Each shave has 3 to 4 passes over my face, but I have a fairly tough beard.  When I am done, I am smooth and soft to the touch without feeling the razor burn you often feel with cartridge multi blade razor blades.  The blade is very forgiving to new  double edge shavers, and is a great beginner blade.  This is one I will always have in my rotation no matter how long I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a great value and a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch but these are incredibly dull blades. I&#x27;ve got a ton of them now that I will not be using.&lt;br /&gt;Should have known the price/quanity was to good for them to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> I just received my shipment ot these blades. I have now used and they are wonderful. Come in two packages of 100 blades and within that package are 20- 5 blade dispensers. Each dispenser is wrapped in clear wrapping. The one thing I dislike is the dispenser had no place to deposit a used blade. This was a 5 star except that lowered opinion. My shaving has been comfortable and not even a cut yet. You can feel the difference when compared to my store bought DE blades. You will love these and I have about a 2 year supply for $17. Give them a try, you have little to lose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Derby Extra blades for about a year now. They are very sharp, but forgiving as well, so that if you make a little mistake, you probably won&#x27;t end up with a nick. These are among my favorite blades. I alternate them with Shark stainless blades.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, including solingen and merkur razor blades and they made shaving a painful experience; but when I tried this Derby razors it was a whole different world, you can shave easily and you don&#x27;t feel like if you have passed sandpaper over your face like with the previously mentioned ones.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price, nor the quality/comfort of the shave with these blades. They are my go-to blades for shaving every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read negative reviews about these blades, but this is my second purchase of 200, and they have been working for me. Now, I love Feather blades..........these aren&#x27;t Feathers, they are not going to change your life. Even Feather blades don&#x27;t work for everyone. This is my point..........I can sit here and tell you these things last for 100 shaves........(they don&#x27;t)...........I can say they gave me a mini facial every time I used them...........(they didn&#x27;t)............you have to figure out if they work for you. I can only tell you for the price they did the job and reduced the stubble on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When Feather prices are too high, I will buy these, and here lately Feather blades have not been economical for me, but these have been working out for me. If anyone from Feather is listening............come down on the darn prices...........you make Derby look better and better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy a small batch the first time you try these, rather than 200 straight off. That way you aren&#x27;t stuck with 199 blades if they don&#x27;t work for you. I have a tough beard and depending on how many days I go without shaving, I can get about 4 to 6 good shaves out of 1 blade...........YMMV.</li>
            <li> I love these blades!  I tried the sample pack from another Amazon purchase... and found the Derby to be a consistently good close shave for my face that works well with my razor.  So I purchased this set of 200.  You get about 5 - 6 shaves per blade.  I don&#x27;t have course hair, nor fine... bout somewhere in the middle.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to a safety razor. 200 blades for just under $19 how could I pass that up. I get 4 or 5 shaves per blade and a close shave. The blades came in the mail in just a few days. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These razors are a great deal, are comfortable to use, and give a good shave.  My only complaint is the difficulty I have sometimes getting new blades from the cartridge.</li>
            <li> I bought 200 of these blades and maybe I too got a bad batch but they are dull.  I can only use them a couple of shaves and I am hacking away even at first use.  I will not buy this product again.  Also no slot on the box for disposing of used blades.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves these for her legs ,but are not sharp enough for my beard . I got some feather blades and they work great on my beard . so we are both happy !</li>
            <li> These are very well made razor blades, thin, sharp and comfortable. They are well packaged and at this price a truly phenomenal value.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a shaving connoisseur who has tried every brand on the market but they certainly blow the store bought blades out of the water&lt;br /&gt;in quality, even more so in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a rather coarse beard and typically skip a day of shaving once or twice each week. These blades provided me a minimum of two comfortable&lt;br /&gt;shaves per blade and could easily do three but they&#x27;re so inexpensive I prefer having the maximum comfort with each shave. They have never&lt;br /&gt;shown any sign of rust, are neatly packaged and individually wrapped. Even though I recently purchased 200 I am inclined to order another 200&lt;br /&gt;now because I fear by the time I need them again the price will have went up.</li>
            <li> These razors are incredibly sharp and are the best out of the blades I&#x27;ve tried. Clean cutting during the shave and leaves me with no razor bumps. Can&#x27;t beat the price either. 200 of them should last me quite a while</li>
            <li> Great price, great shave. They lose edge VERY quickly, but that&#x27;s why there&#x27;s 200 of them!</li>
            <li> I ordered two boxes of these razors about a year ago, and I have enough to last for another year or two. These are an amazing deal for the price. Unfortunately many of the blades are not very good, but the quantity makes up for it. If you want a lot of razor blades, get this.</li>
            <li> awesome blades for an awesome price..best deal you can find on derby blades.  i&#x27;ve gotton 8 shaves per blade cant beat that!</li>
            <li> Bad blades to shave with. These blades are unable to get a close shave and are really rough on the skin.  Looks like I shaved with sandpaper afterwards.</li>
            <li> i bought these for personal use and they have lasted over 2 years, grated i snap them in have and use them by halves but this was a great investment, great quality and big money saver.</li>
            <li> These blades just work for me. I&#x27;ve tried sampler packs of blades, and I found that these gave me a consistent shave.  Initially, I thought sharper blades like Feather, would be better.  But I was wrong. The great thing is, at one blade a week, this will will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Razors are so expensive from the store.  These razors are cheap and 200 lasts FOREVER!  I&#x27;m so thankful that I was introduced to these razors.</li>
            <li> A Facebook ad today for the &amp;#34;Dollar Shave Club&amp;#34; compared the latest Gillette to their own disposable plastic razor. I was reminded of my purchase of these Derby Extras so I looked up when I ordered them. I bought a double pack of these blades in May of 2011. Over three years and I&#x27;m still working through this batch with my antique store purchased handle. Best $20 or so I&#x27;ve spent on shaving. And for the foreseeable future (since I shave with olive oil), the last.</li>
            <li> These blades are an excellent value. They give a great shave. I get 4 perfect shaves before they drag a little. I could easily get a week out of them though, but why bother when they are so cheap. For the retail price of one 4-pack of Fusion blades, you can shave for one to two years with these.</li>
            <li> First off, I use a Merkur Futur, just for reference. There are a couple things to keep in mind. First off, everyone has a preference for blades so unless it&#x27;s garbage, you&#x27;ll get uncertain reviews. I started with a Merkur sample pack of blades and I liked them. Then onto what was carried in the local store Wilkinson Sword blades which for me were inconsistent in quality. I opted for the Derby because of the price point and my comfort level at shaving. I dont&#x27; want the sharpest, thinnest blades out there that&#x27;ll provide me with skin graft samples.&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, for my Futur(adjustable) these blades work great. They shave, as close as I let them and they are an ideal price-point. I&#x27;m sure there might be better blades out there for more money, but I&#x27;m shaving my face, not performing surgery and I dont&#x27; always have 45mins of careful time for a shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them. For some reason the cut my face a lot.</li>
            <li> You cant really recommend razor blades to anyone because everyone has a different face and their facial hair grows differently but these blades worked for me. They are not that sharp but it will get the job done without you feeling any pulling or anything. I decided to try these because of the price and was very pleased that they worked out for me. I have also tried the Shark blades and those were also pretty good blades. I would suggest you guys try both blades.</li>
            <li> After using these blades for several months I&#x27;ve gotten vastly different shaving experiences from one blade to the next.  Occasionally the blades will glide effortlessly and give me a fantastic shave.  More often they snag on my skin or leave a millimeter or two of stubble behind.  The next time I buy razors I&#x27;m going to invest in more premium blades that are consistently high quality.</li>
            <li> Not the best or the worst. Good for the cost. There are better blades available but for the cost these do okay.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp, bought these blades for my husband. He can get about two shaves with his heavy beard and I can shave my legs once before we change the blade and we have both noticed a reduction in razor burn.</li>
            <li> The blades have not been consistently sharp out of 100 blades for me. Not often that I am able to get two shaves from a blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over a year now with a Merkur 1904.  I like that they are so cheap that I never need to re-use a blade.</li>
            <li> i think these will last me a life time! Once you get used to an old fashioned razor you will be hooked!</li>
            <li> These razors were inexpinsive and work well.  Not the sharpest blades but for my face they work well.  Would recommend buying a smaller quantity for those that haven&#x27;t tested these blades before.</li>
            <li> I am revewing 5 different DE blades in one which seems off topic yeah... but I think is appropriate so you can get a feel for how this specific blade performs or stacks up to the competition. A little pre-info, I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL razor and EJ best badger brush with Lucky Tiger aftershave, and either proraso sensitive shaving soap or Dr Harris Lavender shaving soap (I like them both).  Sometimes I use a dot of cocoa butter lotion with the lucky tiger if my skin is feeling particularly dry (but usually I like that lucky tiger does not leave much moisturizing behind though as my skin is typically not dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to the review.  I purchased a variety pack containing blades from the following: merkur,  personna platinum israeli red version, astra premium platinum, derby, and feather hi stainless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I feel after having used up all 5 packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather: Definitely the sharpest by far, but not my favorite. Seems to easily dig into my skin regardless of my angle or pressure.  Really slides through the hair but makes my skin feel unhappy after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur: Very middle ground.  A little too much resistance but all around solid blade if you get a good price or they are your only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra: I didn&#x27;t like these very much.  Didn&#x27;t like the way the drag on my face feels or the shave I get from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personna Red Israeli version:  My favorite blades, pretty sharp, glides over face nicely, leaves me with no razor burn.  A little more expensive though and hard to get on amazon sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby: Solid performer, I don&#x27;t like them quite as much as the personna reds but they are better for me than merkur and the ones I choose to purchase because they are wicked cheap on a lot of sites.  I would only choose the personnas over thesee if I could find the personnas for a more competative price.  I cannot comment on the seller of these blades (I see some people complaining about them being old or dull) but I have a new box of 200 coming and if I experience similar problems I will edit my review by Christmas of 2012.  If it is after that time you can assume that the blades worked out good for me.ut I have a new box of 200 coming and if I experience similar problems I will edit my review by Christmas of 2012.  If it is after that time you can assume that the blades worked out good for me.</li>
            <li> I asked my barber what were the best blades to order for my safety razor and he recommended these. I&#x27;m glad I listened. I get a really close shave and I love the feel of using a classic razor. You can&#x27;t beat the savings either! 200 double-sided blades beats buying the jumbo pack at Costco any day.</li>
            <li> I use Derby Extra blades for my standard, everyday shave. While they are not as sharp as others, they are cheap enough through offers like this that I am able to use them while traveling; throwing out the blade every day.</li>
            <li> Very good razor blades for an economical price.  Good quality.  Well suited for several wet shaves without having to change blades.  I purchased a bulk order of 200 on Amazon for less than $13 with free shipping. Before it sounds like I am trying to promote this blade because it is cheap, I would like to point out that Muhle ships their fine and expensive razors with this blade included in the box. It would not make sense for a \\&quot;Cadillac type product\\&quot; to be shipped with a bad blade.  The company wouldn&#x27;t want to give the wrong impression of their well made razor.</li>
            <li> These blades arent sharp. I&#x27;m not knocking them down for that, but its the first thing that I need to mention. Astra or Gilette or most especially Feather blades are what you want if you are looking for sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the reason I give them three stars isn&#x27;t because they aren&#x27;t sharp, its because they arent consistent. To be fair, my beard is VERY thick, so I have to use a very sharp blade, so I use Feathers. But I started with derbys, and I had some that could shave me, and some that couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if your have a thin beard, as long as your technique is good. And frankly, for 10 cents a piece, they are literally an eighth of the price of the blades I use now. I wanted to like these so much. But I don&#x27;t. However, blades are very personal, so if they work for you, then great! Consistency isn&#x27;t an issue when you go through eight blades for the price of one from anyone else.</li>
            <li> I have a Merkur razor, and some Merkur blades. For whatever reason, I like the Derby blades better. I cut myself less, and seem to do a better shaving job with these blades. I&#x27;ve used them for over a year, and had no problems yet. I tend to use a new blade every 1-2 weeks, so a pack this size lasts for well over a year. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp with good packaging!  Give them a try. So buy these blades and give them a try for a smooth bloodless shave.</li>
            <li> This was my second order from Deals For Salons and it was just as great as the first (Astra blades) one.  These Derby&#x27;s are perfect for just about any face.  I can get at least three good shaves from one blade, using them in a M&amp;uuml;hle R89 Grande razor.</li>
            <li> These blades tilt toward forgiveness and \\&quot;mildness\\&quot; at just over a nickel per blade which, for many, makes this the perfect double-edge blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience suggests these are sharp enough to avoid pulling, giving me a good shave in two passes.  I have sensitive skin, so I have mild razor burn with these, but less than with Dorco blades, and about the same as the Israeli Personnas and the Israeli Crystals (similarly priced, and similarly mild blades, in my experience).  And they give me four good shaves before I trade them out for a fresh blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I am at this price point, I don&#x27;t quibble over pennies.  Soap and shaving balm are more of a factor than the price of these blades.  So the real question is whether they are suitable for your particular shave.  I prefer a sharper blade, but you might be happy with this one.  Many are.  So buy a sample pack.  They are a quality blade with a consistent edge from blade to blade, so if they work for you, you can be confident that they will always work.  And then, buying 200 of these gives you a couple years&#x27; supply and saves you a trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Good blades, but after 3 times i really need to change it and with other blades i get about 5 times before i have to change it. But i&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have had some bad blades here and there, but overall these have been pretty good. The standard out of the box is sharp and stays fairly sharp for a while.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. Not my favorite brand but it was worth the switch.</li>
            <li> and these are good enough that I am still on the same box from two years ago, but I do skip shaving in the winter. Easy to learn on and they hold up well in the holder.</li>
            <li> I purchased a sample pack of blades here on Amazon and loved the Derby Blades. I didn&#x27;t even finish the sample pack before picking up the 200 blade deal here. I use an Edwin Jagger DE89 and it is an amazingly close, mild shave, that did not irritate my face (specifically my neck) at all. These blades are the best deal here on Amazon, and I highly recommend them. The blades were boxed in 100 packs, each box was then broken down into 20 plastic packs of 5 blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned to shaving with a double-edge razor after many years of shelling out multiple dollars for cartridges.  After 7 or 8 weeks of using the Derby Extra blades, I&#x27;m impressed.  I get a very smooth shave especially after three passes without cuts or nicks.  The plastic blade container also holds the used blades so that&#x27;s a definite and safe convenience. Admittedly, this was the first double-edge blade I&#x27;ve tried but I&#x27;m so satisfied I really can&#x27;t see the need to start experimenting.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades.  Occasionally I get one that is duller than the others, and I have to replace it right away (like after a single shave).  Despite this, at the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  Also, the packages came written in a foreign language (Turkish I think?).</li>
            <li> First off, everyones skin is different.  I am African American, but even in our culture we all have different hair types.  My hair is curly/wavy thick and prone to razor bumps but my skin is sensitive.  I have been double edge shaving now for a little over three years.  I used to use Astra&#x27;s and Feather blades.  The Astra&#x27;s weren&#x27;t nearly as sharp (but still smooth), and the Feather&#x27;s are smooth, but WAY too sharp and cause razor burn.  After getting sick of the razor burn with Feather&#x27;s, I ordered a sampler pack of blades.  I tried most of the top names, but, Derby&#x27;s were EXTREMELY SMOOTH yet sharp.  And best of all, I can go against the grain, and go for a total of three passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your technique is down packed, it&#x27;s hard to cut yourself with these.  Again, everyone&#x27;s skin needs are different but you owe it to yourself to try a pack of these.  Just get a 5 pack and not 100+ just in case your skin doesn&#x27;t like these.  By the way, my barber edges my hair line up with these, and these never nick or cut me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re curious, I use/rotate between the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0022RB738 Merkur Progress Double Edge Safety Razor #500 + 5 Free DE Razor Blades]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00020UQQQ Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Shave Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000RG8D6K Truefitt &amp; Hill 1805 Aftershave Balm]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000F5NRQY Truefitt &amp; Hill Ultimate Comfort Pre-Shave Oil, 2 oz.]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0007MW32Y Taylor of Old Bond Street Eton College Shaving Cream Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00278OIBA D R Harris Arlington Aftershave Milk (100 ml)]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000IB0G8M Geo F.

            <li> I would love to review this item. I can&#x27;t. Because I never got this item, which I did order. And there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to get in contact with someone to rectify this.</li>
            <li> First rate blades for novices &amp; seasoned pros. They&#x27;re not hair trigger sharp, but offer very close shaves with minimal facial disruptions. I&#x27;ve used them for one year, &amp; have no regrets. The best values are gotten by purchasing bulk packs like this. Avoid price hikes, out of stocks, back orders, worrying about sales &amp; who offers the allegedly best discounts, along with FREE freight for qualifying orders. You may hate shaving, but @ least get your supplies without aggravation &amp; extreme financial outlays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady that uses a safety razor and these are just too sharp for me.  Every time I use them on my legs I nick myself.  Perhaps they are better for a mans beard hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other brands of double edge blades but always come back to Derby Extra.  They are of a consistently high quality and as I have a rather difficult beard can be relied upon to produce a good smooth shave.  This is the third or fourth set I have bought over the years and at 200 blades a container they last a reasonably long time.  I can easily recommend these to someone who is just starting out using a double edge and those who are experienced users.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried over 15 different types of blades from different manufacturers and I&#x27;ve found that Derby blades provide me with a close, irritation-free shave every time.  Your experiences may vary, but the quality of these blades is top notch and the cost is economical.</li>
            <li> This blade is a great price for the money, does not last as long as others that I have used in the past , but the price is right, so change your blade a little early.</li>
            <li> Great value.  You get a whole weeks of shaves with one blade and the cost per blade is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Blades arrived on time and as advertised. My only beef really is with the blades themselves, though I knew what I was getting into. These are a lot more forgiving than sharper blades in that you&#x27;re not going to cut up your face. But if you&#x27;ve got thick, wiry facial hair, you pretty much get one good shave per razor and then have to switch or risk some pretty brutal razor burn. These are probably best left to those without thick facial hair, or those who have a tendency to shave too fast/sloppily and cut themselves regularly with sharper razors.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a straight razor. It cuts closer than my four blade cartridge, and costs a lot less. It takes a bit of getting used to at the beginning, and I get four shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> The product is great. This fits my old double edge razor perfect. The blades are individually wrapped in paper bundled in fives. They are stainless steel. The cut is very smooth. The shipping was quick. Thank you for making this available and your fine service.</li>
            <li> While these aren&#x27;t the sharpest blades, you can&#x27;t beat the value in this very economical deal. I stocked up and have been very happy with the blades performance overall.</li>
            <li> Great blades! But then again you should already know that if you are considering buying them in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;Amazing price, too!</li>
            <li> These blades might not be the sharpest on planet earth but they are a good, sharp-enough, servicle blade. The price alone makes this a stellar bargain.</li>
