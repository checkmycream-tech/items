            <li>Excellent!!</li>
            <li>Product is great and speedy delivery!</li>
            <li>This is not something I have experienced before.</li>
            <li>Teeth whitening gel was very effective and give goo d result</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>I still use it because it does the job for whitening better than most.</li>
            <li>This is great, I noticed a difference after the second applications must be a years supply very strong too.</li>
            <li>Timely delivery, great price compared to the dentist office for similar products.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Great and fast acting product.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>works well but hot damn!  </li>
            <li>it is a powerful product, that being said its is everything they said it would be and what i was expecting.</li>
            <li>The gel I got directly from my dentist was so much better.</li>
            <li>Be careful, you cannot leave on for more than 30 minutes or it will irritate your gums.  </li>
            <li>but the product was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Love these, but be careful about the gum line, it will kill the gum tissue and make it peel.</li>
            <li>Would recommend only using for 2-3 hours at a time it is strong and will cause your teeth to be sensitive for 24hrs.  </li>
            <li>quick and efficient my husband loves his white teeth!</li>
            <li>Really strong stuff - does the trick in a week or less.</li>
            <li>Not sure if these whiten any better than our previous brand</li>
            <li>This is very strong at 44%, you have to be very careful not to put too much gel on as it can really be painful and does make your teeth very sensitive.</li>

            <li> Timely delivery, great price compared to the dentist office for similar products.  Would recommend only using for 2-3 hours at a time it is strong and will cause your teeth to be sensitive for 24hrs.  This product will whiten your teeth noticeably with one application.</li>

            <li> Be careful, you cannot leave on for more than 30 minutes or it will irritate your gums.  This happened to both my wife and me.  Not sure if these whiten any better than our previous brand but the product was reasonably priced.</li>
