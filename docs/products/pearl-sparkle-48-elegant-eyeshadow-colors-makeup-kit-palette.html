            <li>I thought these eyesshadows were great!</li>
            <li>The colors LOOK beautiful but they are nothing but a Vaseline-type goop that won&#x27;t even blend!  </li>
            <li>the variety of colors is wonderful, and the amount of shimmer is PERFECT for day or night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to use the sponge brush that comes with the palettes.</li>

            <li>Just on the top.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>esecially I like metalic colors that make clay more</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>All the sparkle is just on the top layer</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>After opening the package, it was bubble wrapped to make sure it wouldnt be damaged through shipping.</li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>I tried the colors on, and they are just okay -</li>
            <li>it sparkles until you brush the top layer of shadow</li>
            <li>Such a great buy!  </li>
            <li>the shimmer is mostly on top, once you use it once it&#x27;s not too shimmery anymore</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>.. thank you amazon :)</li>
            <li>But they still have a lovely shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>Love this product will definately buy this again.</li>
            <li>can give one to a friend, but thought i was gonna get more colors?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like some shadows that the top of it is shimmery</li>
            <li>but once you remove the top layer the shimmer is gone.</li>
            <li>I know I will get more when I run out.</li>
            <li>i love this</li>
            <li>I just love all the colors...</li>
            <li>im getting so many compliments....</li>
            <li>im really enjoying this product</li>
            <li>colors look better in pic</li>
            <li>Love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li>they have excellent coverage and last all night or day.</li>
            <li>Love the shimmer and shine I get with this.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Would love if no damage</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;ll order another one for myself :)</li>
            <li>The layer of glitter does not event work as eye shadow, but seems more like something you&#x27;d glue on paper.</li>
            <li>my niece was well pleased.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Lasted for more than eight hours</li>
            <li>, colors are great very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I love the color selection</li>
            <li>I was very excited to receive this pallet</li>
            <li>and i love the many colors the colors dont break easy</li>
            <li>The colors blend well together and looked amazing even after a full day of wearing.</li>
            <li>i loved them so pretty and</li>
            <li>good for club scene or hot nights out.</li>
            <li>the variety of colors is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>This product WILL NOT gather onto a brush easily like with most eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I love this set and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>love eye shadows, goes on smooth</li>
            <li>and she said that this palette is excellent the color are true to what you see and that they go on, with easy and last all day.</li>
            <li>Worth buying, has amazing colors and they go on easy, don&#x27;t even need to use a primer.  </li>
            <li>I love how the colors are so sparkly and shimmery, love how the colors stand out, yet are not to bold.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off, easily.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re easy to blend</li>
            <li>on nice and thick - great with blending&lt;br /&gt;-Stays on and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other then that everything is just fine</li>
            <li>It compliments any fine stage quality foundations (MAC, NARS, MEHRON, BEN NYE, etc.)</li>
            <li>I guess the best thing about these shadows was how little it cakes after hours of wear.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty!</li>
            <li>overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li>nothing particularly brilliant about them, and they are not as strong as other pigments/shadows that I have.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this to anyone who wants amazing eyepopping Color on their eyes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really light and portable, though.</li>
            <li>They really go have a nice pearl finish to each color.</li>
            <li>It is a nice side it doesn&#x27;t take up  to much room in my make up area.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ve got to remember that these are terribly cheap.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a 14 year old girl &amp; she loved the variety of colors.  </li>
            <li>Great beginner kit or great for someone who wants a little sparkle!</li>
            <li>Emori eyeshadows are smooth and silky and all of the colors are nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li>its nice that they are not so high</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again (from someone else :P).</li>
            <li>I love the eye shadow so pretty...</li>
            <li>Have been having fun since I got it!</li>
            <li>They are a great alternative to those sticky goopy \\&quot;glitter cream\\&quot; palettes, which are dry and do not spread evenly over your eyelids.</li>
            <li>For something that was $6 they&#x27;re not bad, but I&#x27;ve certainly had better.</li>
            <li>This is super fun and glittery!</li>
            <li>i was expecting not so great quality due to the amazing price, but was plesantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I would say they are almost as good as MAC, but about ten times cheaper!</li>
            <li>very pleasing to the eyes, love them all,gr8 colors to use, arrived on time, packaged well in bubble wrap</li>
            <li>i really like these eye shadows and will buy more.</li>
            <li>Really like how many colors there are two and the way they feel.</li>
            <li>This is only good for makeup play.</li>
            <li>they have a glitter  coat on top and it hides the real color of each one</li>
            <li>but all of the glitter is just on the top all though the eye shadows are still very pigmented which I like</li>
            <li>its not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>which I like(: not a bad buy for $5.</li>
            <li>got it for my little sister for Christmas she cried lol and says they work fabulously</li>
            <li>A whole lotta fun!!</li>
            <li>even though they aren&#x27;t sparkly after you actually wipe the top off, they&#x27;re more of a pearl.</li>
            <li>My only issue was that the glitter particles would get in my eye all the time,but overall great product!</li>
            <li>I love the colers, they are vibrant</li>
            <li>the product is good, the colors are beautiful even considering that the texture of some of they are not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>These are vibrant colors, they stay on very well, and go on even better!</li>
            <li>The sparkle is only on the very top.  </li>
            <li>and they are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Item is same as descibed and we are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>although the sparkle is only on the very top of each color they are still shiny.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery,beautiful colors, 9 yr old was very pleased</li>
            <li>it is only glittery on the top and after first time use it is better described as pearly.</li>
            <li>the eye shadow was shipped fast and was well protected when shipped!!</li>
            <li>The colors go on smooth &amp; bold, and the glitter is just right...not too much.  </li>
            <li>The eye shadow overall is amazing.</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have loads of fun with these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife and she and my four year old daughter absolutely love them</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth</li>
            <li>SO MUCH FUN</li>
            <li>For the price, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it is nice to explore different colors wiithout going broke.</li>
            <li>totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The shadow sticks and a lot of fun too put on.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth what I paid for.</li>
            <li>fun stay on all day and the colors blend</li>
            <li>But they are cute if you want a soft glittery glow or for costume makeup.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>really nice last all day</li>
            <li>I tried wiping it off with toilet paper and most of the color stayed on my lid!</li>
            <li>The have more of a pearl effect than a glitter, but the colors are rich and last all day.</li>
            <li>the product came right away ( within a day)</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and add the right amount of glitter and sparkle without looking tacky!</li>
            <li>I have purchased many many many more expensive, designer eyeshadows and this eye shadow is still a winner in my book!</li>
            <li>but this , product is great and a lot for so little great long lasting eye shadow also its sparkly</li>
            <li>It arrived a day earlier than expected, which is a very good thing.</li>
            <li>It came in super fast even though it didn&#x27;t have Prime 2-Day shipping.</li>
            <li>excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, the colors expected, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s bright enough to see in a dimly lit room</li>
            <li>the eye shadow is very pigmented and very pretty colors when put on your eyes.</li>
            <li>It is very sparkly and bright and fun for young girls to put on but very low quality.</li>
            <li>Very much pigmented nd stays on all day without any primer i tried on my eyes</li>
            <li>Arrival was very precise, that is the only reason for 1star.</li>
            <li>I am enjoyingi my eye shadows very much.</li>
            <li>These eye shadows arrived within 3-4 days of being ordered ;-)  </li>
            <li>only sparkly on the top layer</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for, Overall I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li>Pretty sparkly-vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>for the Grade I would Say maybe give it to Your Daughters when there First Learning how to apply make up on themselves.</li>
            <li>It really does give you that shiny, metallic look that makes your eyes pop!</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more to keep as back up</li>
            <li>This really helps keep eyeshadow on all day!</li>
            <li>Another thing was that when I opened the packaging, one whole shadow fell out, and it was everywhere!</li>
            <li>It will look great and last a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Highly pigmented colors that can make so many different combos</li>
            <li>First - the pallets come in two separate plastic cases, and does not appear to be the one set</li>
            <li>It looks way higher quality in the photo.</li>
            <li>,exactly wht</li>
            <li>the sparkle is only on top.</li>
            <li>The glitter is definitely layered directly on top of each colour, so when you wipe it its gone.</li>
            <li>swatched some...looked pretty then.  </li>
            <li>pretty like always buy for them</li>
            <li>I love this pallet and definitely would reccomend this so anyone who loves eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product:)</li>
            <li>The shipping was a high price, but compared to everything else that doesn&#x27;t even matter to me!!  </li>
            <li>The first 1 I bought</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this eyeshadow...except that it is too difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li>The quality is fair, but the amount of palettes in the description is not completely accurate.</li>
            <li>Not only beautiful colors, but easy to put on and last a long time.</li>
            <li>The colors are vivid and not only that, the way it sparkles is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Its not a completely bad product - but not as elegant as some other items I have tried.</li>
            <li>usually I write pretty Good reviews on products.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I really like the colors, and the price was outstanding!</li>
            <li>This is a cute sampler for someone who likes to wear a variety of colors or wants to try out different looks.</li>
            <li>but it only had sparkle on the top of the eye shadow not the whole eye shadow</li>
            <li>and i loved the price ill shop with your often when i see more items</li>
            <li>First one was all smashed and destroyed before I even got it out the package and they sent me another one really fast</li>
            <li>I really like the way the colors looked on me at my semi when I first used them and got a lot of compliments</li>
            <li>When they wore the colors were very vibrant.</li>
            <li>so if u us the slights about of preacher the eye shadow brakes but it is easy to but back together cuz of the cream</li>
            <li>It is two cases and not one large one.  </li>
            <li>but still awseome!&lt;br /&gt;They are highly pigmented and very sparkly!</li>
            <li>I bought the bright colors for Halloween since I didn&#x27;t feel like shelling out big bucks for one night of makeup, but I&#x27;ll be going back to buy one of the more neutral palettes for everyday use.</li>
            <li>If really shiny and glitterly eyeshadows are your thing, then be my guest and buy it.</li>
            <li>was expecting 1 pallette and received both and was very happy!&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>i really rubbed em to gt off my eyes to check for hw</li>
            <li>P1 was in great condition while P2 had a couple of broken, unusable colors.</li>
            <li>(although with a primer they are much bolder)</li>
            <li>These colors blend well and give a very pleasent color to the eyes.</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY.</li>
            <li>The colors are shimmering and really added definition and glow to my eyes.</li>
            <li>but there is no Pigment really to this eye shadow.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>its really shimmery the way i like it</li>
            <li>Not quality mineral enough but cheap.</li>
            <li>really like and came fast</li>
            <li>It was packed very well</li>
            <li>I had no broken eyeshadows and no defects.</li>
            <li>It really has shimmer, a pearl like affect to it.</li>
            <li>but they blend really well and shine all day.</li>
            <li>The colors show up really well</li>
            <li>They are all very well priced.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors and the formula.</li>
            <li>I really didnt like the eyeshdow</li>
            <li>it didnt  really show and it feels rusty when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Packaged well, no broken shades.</li>
            <li>thought it was too much of a glitter effect.</li>
            <li>I consider myself a makeup fanatic and this is really good eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>my only dissapointment is that they are not eyeshadow brush friendly</li>
            <li>This was better than I expected!</li>
            <li>i really like all the diferent shades..and love how it looks when i put it down..</li>
            <li>it kind of looks like a normal plain eyeshadow with color would.</li>
            <li>When I finally decided to buy it, it came fairly quick.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors</li>
            <li>When I received these they came in decent condition.</li>
            <li>Some shades are repetitive, which is good especially if you like a certain color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li>Recommend them to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like paying high prices.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t high quality pigment.  </li>
            <li>This palet has helped me more than any other thus far.</li>
            <li>but I just wish there was a little more sparkle to them.</li>
            <li>im just saying the packaging needs to be packaged a little better..</li>
            <li>but it would make a reasonable gift for young girls.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for a few months and have no complaints I love them.</li>
            <li>Other than that the color is fantastic ....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it for a new one..</li>
            <li>There were scratches in the case, so it didn&#x27;t look brand new.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to browse through the photos and see that they are very clearly separate.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction at all.</li>
            <li>As other reviews stated, the \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; is only on top.</li>
            <li>THE COLOR OF THE EYE SHADOWS IS EXACTLY THE SAME COLOR WHEN APPLIED TO YOUR PIGMENTATION.</li>
            <li>But in general I really like it</li>
            <li>finally, this is really luminous pearl eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>i have 2 identiacal ones and the colors are exactly the same on each...  </li>
            <li>Buyers be aware when purchasing this product, that the 16 colors are the same in each kit.</li>
            <li>These are long lasting, pretty, colorful, and blend well together.  </li>
            <li>First I&#x27;ll just say I bought this product because of the reviews saying it is not properly advertised.</li>
            <li>it creases too easy even with primer and it smudges a little.</li>
            <li>They are a little light</li>
            <li>of my eyeshadows were broken, they are amazing qaulity</li>
            <li>packaging was well wrapped but still had a cracked cover, one color completely out of it&#x27;s \\&quot;shell\\&quot; and another color exploded looking used in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are not too loud but its sparkly which is what i wanted.</li>
            <li>When I got it, it surprised me that they had sparkles in them, but they worked for every occasion.</li>
            <li>soft powder form&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased this item about a week ago, and I was really hesitant when I got it because of the low price, and I had never heard of the brand.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old loves to play with makeup.</li>
            <li>I started to test out the colors and see how they blended, and they actually blend very well.</li>
            <li>As far as the products application review....</li>
            <li>no this is not professional grade make up nor is it \\&quot;glittery\\&quot; like people think but the description is \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; and it is exactly that.</li>
            <li>but I paid $12 with shipping and it would cost me too much to ship it back.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 10 yr old daughter who likes to do makeup with her friends.  </li>
            <li>It offers a lot of colors, I&#x27;ve even borrowed a couple.  </li>
            <li>They are worth the price minus the damage to them.</li>
            <li>Im not completely dissaponted just a little :)</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, the eyeshadows are decent.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and there are multiple shades of each color.</li>
            <li>They are blendable and all colors have a very pretty pearl like finish...even the black.</li>
            <li>I tried a few and expected them to be sheer or light without a primer, but they weren&#x27;t-they were deep and rich.  </li>
            <li>I love using these with other matte colors i have to tone down some of the shine or to add some sparkle to an a mazing matte color i already have.</li>
            <li>these (Profusion Brand) were available at the Dollar Tree Store, waste of my money and time buying these online, if only they showed what brand it was</li>
            <li>and for those who could actually compare to high known brands like MAC or Channel obviously dont know their products</li>
            <li>-- I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I rely on it for daily use</li>
            <li>They are pearlescent shadows covered with 1 thin layer of glitter just to make them look better.</li>
            <li>It is vibrant, pearly, long lasting goodness.</li>
            <li>and I wanted extreme colors to make my eyes really</li>
            <li>It came very well packaged and it was bigger than what I expected.</li>
            <li>No colors missing, nothing broken, the case is good.</li>
            <li>Lots of colors to choose from, with a little primer or eyeliner on your lids first, the pigment will stay all day</li>
            <li>There was barely even enough of it to cover two of my fingers.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t fade as fast as other eyeshadows!</li>
            <li>These colors are not that pigmented when used dry, but if you wet them, they are extremely pigmented and very sparkley, I really like them a lot and</li>
            <li>I must admit I was very happy when I ordered these, but when they came in the mail I was very disappointed, they pigmented well</li>
            <li>The color tends to bunch in the crease of the eyelid like many other eye shadows, so it&#x27;s not good for humid areas, or hot/sweaty temperatures.</li>
            <li>This could be a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just on the top.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> esecially I like metalic colors that make clay more</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> All the sparkle is just on the top layer</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> After opening the package, it was bubble wrapped to make sure it wouldnt be damaged through shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> I tried the colors on, and they are just okay -</li>
            <li> it sparkles until you brush the top layer of shadow</li>
            <li> Such a great buy!  </li>
            <li> the shimmer is mostly on top, once you use it once it&#x27;s not too shimmery anymore</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> .. thank you amazon :)</li>
            <li> But they still have a lovely shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> Love this product will definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> can give one to a friend, but thought i was gonna get more colors?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like some shadows that the top of it is shimmery</li>
            <li> but once you remove the top layer the shimmer is gone.</li>
            <li> I know I will get more when I run out.</li>
            <li> i love this</li>
            <li> I just love all the colors...</li>
            <li> im getting so many compliments....</li>

            <li> Love the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> they have excellent coverage and last all night or day.</li>
            <li> Love the shimmer and shine I get with this.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Would love if no damage</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ll order another one for myself :)</li>
            <li> The layer of glitter does not event work as eye shadow, but seems more like something you&#x27;d glue on paper.</li>
            <li> my niece was well pleased.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Lasted for more than eight hours</li>
            <li> , colors are great very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love the color selection</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this pallet</li>
            <li> and i love the many colors the colors dont break easy</li>
            <li> The colors blend well together and looked amazing even after a full day of wearing.</li>
            <li> i loved them so pretty and</li>
            <li> good for club scene or hot nights out.</li>
            <li> the variety of colors is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> This product WILL NOT gather onto a brush easily like with most eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I love this set and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> love eye shadows, goes on smooth</li>
            <li> and she said that this palette is excellent the color are true to what you see and that they go on, with easy and last all day.</li>
            <li> Worth buying, has amazing colors and they go on easy, don&#x27;t even need to use a primer.  </li>
            <li> I love how the colors are so sparkly and shimmery, love how the colors stand out, yet are not to bold.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash off, easily.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re easy to blend</li>
            <li> on nice and thick - great with blending&lt;br /&gt;-Stays on and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other then that everything is just fine</li>
            <li> It compliments any fine stage quality foundations (MAC, NARS, MEHRON, BEN NYE, etc.)</li>
            <li> I guess the best thing about these shadows was how little it cakes after hours of wear.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty!</li>
            <li> overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> nothing particularly brilliant about them, and they are not as strong as other pigments/shadows that I have.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anyone who wants amazing eyepopping Color on their eyes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really light and portable, though.</li>
            <li> They really go have a nice pearl finish to each color.</li>
            <li> It is a nice side it doesn&#x27;t take up  to much room in my make up area.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ve got to remember that these are terribly cheap.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 14 year old girl &amp; she loved the variety of colors.  </li>
            <li> Great beginner kit or great for someone who wants a little sparkle!</li>
            <li> Emori eyeshadows are smooth and silky and all of the colors are nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> its nice that they are not so high</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again (from someone else :P).</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadow so pretty...</li>
            <li> Have been having fun since I got it!</li>
            <li> They are a great alternative to those sticky goopy \\&quot;glitter cream\\&quot; palettes, which are dry and do not spread evenly over your eyelids.</li>
            <li> For something that was $6 they&#x27;re not bad, but I&#x27;ve certainly had better.</li>
            <li> This is super fun and glittery!</li>
            <li> i was expecting not so great quality due to the amazing price, but was plesantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I would say they are almost as good as MAC, but about ten times cheaper!</li>
            <li> very pleasing to the eyes, love them all,gr8 colors to use, arrived on time, packaged well in bubble wrap</li>
            <li> i really like these eye shadows and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Really like how many colors there are two and the way they feel.</li>
            <li> This is only good for makeup play.</li>
            <li> they have a glitter  coat on top and it hides the real color of each one</li>
            <li> but all of the glitter is just on the top all though the eye shadows are still very pigmented which I like</li>
            <li> its not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> which I like(: not a bad buy for $5.</li>
            <li> got it for my little sister for Christmas she cried lol and says they work fabulously</li>
            <li> A whole lotta fun!!</li>
            <li> even though they aren&#x27;t sparkly after you actually wipe the top off, they&#x27;re more of a pearl.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that the glitter particles would get in my eye all the time,but overall great product!</li>
            <li> I love the colers, they are vibrant</li>
            <li> the product is good, the colors are beautiful even considering that the texture of some of they are not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These are vibrant colors, they stay on very well, and go on even better!</li>
            <li> The sparkle is only on the very top.  </li>
            <li> and they are very pretty.</li>
            <li> Item is same as descibed and we are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> although the sparkle is only on the very top of each color they are still shiny.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,beautiful colors, 9 yr old was very pleased</li>
            <li> it is only glittery on the top and after first time use it is better described as pearly.</li>
            <li> the eye shadow was shipped fast and was well protected when shipped!!</li>
            <li> The colors go on smooth &amp; bold, and the glitter is just right...not too much.  </li>
            <li> The eye shadow overall is amazing.</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have loads of fun with these eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she and my four year old daughter absolutely love them</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth</li>
            <li> SO MUCH FUN</li>
            <li> For the price, it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it is nice to explore different colors wiithout going broke.</li>
            <li> totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The shadow sticks and a lot of fun too put on.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth what I paid for.</li>
            <li> fun stay on all day and the colors blend</li>
            <li> But they are cute if you want a soft glittery glow or for costume makeup.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.</li>
            <li> really nice last all day</li>
            <li> I tried wiping it off with toilet paper and most of the color stayed on my lid!</li>
            <li> The have more of a pearl effect than a glitter, but the colors are rich and last all day.</li>
            <li> the product came right away ( within a day)</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented and add the right amount of glitter and sparkle without looking tacky!</li>
            <li> I have purchased many many many more expensive, designer eyeshadows and this eye shadow is still a winner in my book!</li>
            <li> but this , product is great and a lot for so little great long lasting eye shadow also its sparkly</li>
            <li> It arrived a day earlier than expected, which is a very good thing.</li>
            <li> It came in super fast even though it didn&#x27;t have Prime 2-Day shipping.</li>
            <li> excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, the colors expected, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s bright enough to see in a dimly lit room</li>
            <li> the eye shadow is very pigmented and very pretty colors when put on your eyes.</li>
            <li> It is very sparkly and bright and fun for young girls to put on but very low quality.</li>
            <li> Very much pigmented nd stays on all day without any primer i tried on my eyes</li>
            <li> Arrival was very precise, that is the only reason for 1star.</li>
            <li> I am enjoyingi my eye shadows very much.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows arrived within 3-4 days of being ordered ;-)  </li>
            <li> only sparkly on the top layer</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for, Overall I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> Pretty sparkly-vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> for the Grade I would Say maybe give it to Your Daughters when there First Learning how to apply make up on themselves.</li>
            <li> It really does give you that shiny, metallic look that makes your eyes pop!</li>
            <li> I will probably buy more to keep as back up</li>
            <li> This really helps keep eyeshadow on all day!</li>
            <li> Another thing was that when I opened the packaging, one whole shadow fell out, and it was everywhere!</li>
            <li> It will look great and last a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Highly pigmented colors that can make so many different combos</li>
            <li> First - the pallets come in two separate plastic cases, and does not appear to be the one set</li>
            <li> It looks way higher quality in the photo.</li>
            <li> ,exactly wht</li>
            <li> the sparkle is only on top.</li>
            <li> The glitter is definitely layered directly on top of each colour, so when you wipe it its gone.</li>
            <li> swatched some...looked pretty then.  </li>
            <li> pretty like always buy for them</li>
            <li> I love this pallet and definitely would reccomend this so anyone who loves eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product:)</li>
            <li> The shipping was a high price, but compared to everything else that doesn&#x27;t even matter to me!!  </li>
            <li> The first 1 I bought</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this eyeshadow...except that it is too difficult to wash off.</li>
            <li> The quality is fair, but the amount of palettes in the description is not completely accurate.</li>
            <li> Not only beautiful colors, but easy to put on and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are vivid and not only that, the way it sparkles is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Its not a completely bad product - but not as elegant as some other items I have tried.</li>
            <li> usually I write pretty Good reviews on products.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I really like the colors, and the price was outstanding!</li>
            <li> This is a cute sampler for someone who likes to wear a variety of colors or wants to try out different looks.</li>
            <li> but it only had sparkle on the top of the eye shadow not the whole eye shadow</li>
            <li> and i loved the price ill shop with your often when i see more items</li>
            <li> First one was all smashed and destroyed before I even got it out the package and they sent me another one really fast</li>
            <li> I really like the way the colors looked on me at my semi when I first used them and got a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> When they wore the colors were very vibrant.</li>
            <li> so if u us the slights about of preacher the eye shadow brakes but it is easy to but back together cuz of the cream</li>
            <li> It is two cases and not one large one.  </li>
            <li> but still awseome!&lt;br /&gt;They are highly pigmented and very sparkly!</li>
            <li> I bought the bright colors for Halloween since I didn&#x27;t feel like shelling out big bucks for one night of makeup, but I&#x27;ll be going back to buy one of the more neutral palettes for everyday use.</li>
            <li> If really shiny and glitterly eyeshadows are your thing, then be my guest and buy it.</li>
            <li> was expecting 1 pallette and received both and was very happy!&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> i really rubbed em to gt off my eyes to check for hw</li>
            <li> P1 was in great condition while P2 had a couple of broken, unusable colors.</li>
            <li> (although with a primer they are much bolder)</li>
            <li> These colors blend well and give a very pleasent color to the eyes.</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY.</li>
            <li> The colors are shimmering and really added definition and glow to my eyes.</li>
            <li> but there is no Pigment really to this eye shadow.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> its really shimmery the way i like it</li>
            <li> Not quality mineral enough but cheap.</li>
            <li> really like and came fast</li>
            <li> It was packed very well</li>
            <li> I had no broken eyeshadows and no defects.</li>
            <li> It really has shimmer, a pearl like affect to it.</li>
            <li> but they blend really well and shine all day.</li>
            <li> The colors show up really well</li>
            <li> They are all very well priced.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and the formula.</li>
            <li> I really didnt like the eyeshdow</li>
            <li> it didnt  really show and it feels rusty when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Packaged well, no broken shades.</li>
            <li> thought it was too much of a glitter effect.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a makeup fanatic and this is really good eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> my only dissapointment is that they are not eyeshadow brush friendly</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected!</li>
            <li> i really like all the diferent shades..and love how it looks when i put it down..</li>
            <li> it kind of looks like a normal plain eyeshadow with color would.</li>
            <li> When I finally decided to buy it, it came fairly quick.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors</li>
            <li> When I received these they came in decent condition.</li>
            <li> Some shades are repetitive, which is good especially if you like a certain color.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Recommend them to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like paying high prices.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t high quality pigment.  </li>
            <li> This palet has helped me more than any other thus far.</li>
            <li> but I just wish there was a little more sparkle to them.</li>
            <li> im just saying the packaging needs to be packaged a little better..</li>
            <li> but it would make a reasonable gift for young girls.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a few months and have no complaints I love them.</li>
            <li> Other than that the color is fantastic ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it for a new one..</li>
            <li> There were scratches in the case, so it didn&#x27;t look brand new.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to browse through the photos and see that they are very clearly separate.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction at all.</li>
            <li> As other reviews stated, the \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; is only on top.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR OF THE EYE SHADOWS IS EXACTLY THE SAME COLOR WHEN APPLIED TO YOUR PIGMENTATION.</li>
            <li> But in general I really like it</li>
            <li> finally, this is really luminous pearl eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> i have 2 identiacal ones and the colors are exactly the same on each...  </li>
            <li> Buyers be aware when purchasing this product, that the 16 colors are the same in each kit.</li>
            <li> These are long lasting, pretty, colorful, and blend well together.  </li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ll just say I bought this product because of the reviews saying it is not properly advertised.</li>
            <li> it creases too easy even with primer and it smudges a little.</li>
            <li> They are a little light</li>
            <li> of my eyeshadows were broken, they are amazing qaulity</li>
            <li> packaging was well wrapped but still had a cracked cover, one color completely out of it&#x27;s \\&quot;shell\\&quot; and another color exploded looking used in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are not too loud but its sparkly which is what i wanted.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it surprised me that they had sparkles in them, but they worked for every occasion.</li>
            <li> soft powder form&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about a week ago, and I was really hesitant when I got it because of the low price, and I had never heard of the brand.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old loves to play with makeup.</li>
            <li> I started to test out the colors and see how they blended, and they actually blend very well.</li>
            <li> As far as the products application review....</li>
            <li> no this is not professional grade make up nor is it \\&quot;glittery\\&quot; like people think but the description is \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; and it is exactly that.</li>
            <li> but I paid $12 with shipping and it would cost me too much to ship it back.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 10 yr old daughter who likes to do makeup with her friends.  </li>
            <li> It offers a lot of colors, I&#x27;ve even borrowed a couple.  </li>
            <li> They are worth the price minus the damage to them.</li>
            <li> Im not completely dissaponted just a little :)</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price, the eyeshadows are decent.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and there are multiple shades of each color.</li>
            <li> They are blendable and all colors have a very pretty pearl like finish...even the black.</li>
            <li> I tried a few and expected them to be sheer or light without a primer, but they weren&#x27;t-they were deep and rich.  </li>
            <li> I love using these with other matte colors i have to tone down some of the shine or to add some sparkle to an a mazing matte color i already have.</li>
            <li> these (Profusion Brand) were available at the Dollar Tree Store, waste of my money and time buying these online, if only they showed what brand it was</li>
            <li> and for those who could actually compare to high known brands like MAC or Channel obviously dont know their products</li>
            <li> -- I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I rely on it for daily use</li>
            <li> They are pearlescent shadows covered with 1 thin layer of glitter just to make them look better.</li>
            <li> It is vibrant, pearly, long lasting goodness.</li>
            <li> and I wanted extreme colors to make my eyes really</li>
            <li> It came very well packaged and it was bigger than what I expected.</li>
            <li> No colors missing, nothing broken, the case is good.</li>
            <li> Lots of colors to choose from, with a little primer or eyeliner on your lids first, the pigment will stay all day</li>
            <li> There was barely even enough of it to cover two of my fingers.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t fade as fast as other eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> These colors are not that pigmented when used dry, but if you wet them, they are extremely pigmented and very sparkley, I really like them a lot and</li>
            <li> I must admit I was very happy when I ordered these, but when they came in the mail I was very disappointed, they pigmented well</li>
            <li> The color tends to bunch in the crease of the eyelid like many other eye shadows, so it&#x27;s not good for humid areas, or hot/sweaty temperatures.</li>
            <li> This could be a good thing and a bad thing.</li>
            <li> and there was very little damage (light dusting from a slightly cracked eyeshadow)</li>
            <li> when i first opened it and tried to use it, i realized that what looks like a creamy pearlescent eyeshadow...is actually clumpy and hard to spread.</li>
            <li> My only complaint are the eye shadow applicators that come with it suck and the end fell off during first time use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really two small ones.</li>
            <li> oh well they look bigger in the pictures the eye shadow also lasts a long time on your eyes</li>
            <li> disappointed with a product that could have been good.</li>
            <li> Be careful, as they are hexagons, and the ones on the border get cut off right down the middle, making for less of the unlucky color.</li>
            <li> I felt a little ripped off on that note, because you can clearly see in the picture that there are different colors on each side.</li>
            <li> i was a little surprised that this kit came in two pieces and that several of the colors were repeated in each piece.</li>
            <li> I expected a bigger pallette, but for only five bucks, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> long can they stay so guyz definetly buy this</li>
            <li> The colors stay intact all day long as well.</li>
            <li> Containers are larger than expected.</li>
            <li> As long as you buy this with the understanding that it is NOT glitter eyeshadow and know its just the surface that looks sparkly then the glitter is gone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s some seriously long wear stuff.</li>
            <li> Only 30 out of the 32 in P2 were usable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, both palettes were hard and not easy to work with \\&quot;right off the bat.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was really excited when i ordered these and sad when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Also they have a very strange smell.</li>
            <li> but i feel the colors are too dry ,</li>
            <li> The single package contained 2 palettes (I will call them P1 and P2--palette one and palette two).</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the colors would be flat since the price was so cheap</li>
            <li> and when I open it all my clothes got mess up from it</li>
            <li> the colors are very pretty, they are glittery but not to the point were it looks weird</li>
            <li> and it stays on all day long!!!  </li>
            <li> Something that bothered me about other people&#x27;s reviews is that they are saying this product is misrepresented as a single pallet.</li>
            <li> with that much eyeshadow it was ridiculous to give her all 4 when she will prolly never use half of it.</li>
            <li> The shadows are not intense.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED and</li>
            <li> Harder to blend colors though.</li>
            <li> Using it every day but careful not to use brush that has any dampness</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not very pigmented and the powders are VERY loose, so beware.</li>
            <li> (i did use eye shadow primer, but other shadows have rubbed off even with the primer)Had to wash with soap and water to get it off.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I recieved the eyeshadow palette in 2 days even though I had the basic shipping(3-5 days)From reading the past reviews</li>
            <li> I bought this product knowing the warnings of other customers of their disappointment/issues.</li>
            <li> it is just the top layer :(</li>
            <li> i kept one for myself and gave the other to my mommy</li>
            <li> Been experimenting with the wide array of colors!</li>
            <li> packaged with care, was hard to open it was package so well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend use for someone who sticks to only a few colors because the color hexagons are really small.</li>
            <li> I tried to use one of the colors but because I am dark skinned</li>
            <li> HONESTLY IT IS NOT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> i mean it doesn&#x27;t  have enough moisture for the make-up to work the beauty on the face</li>
            <li> The case was slightly cracked but no damage done to eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I got them half of the make was all over the place</li>
            <li> Amazingly, this product hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet!</li>
            <li> it came in two days but sad  its not as shiny as my normal eyeshadows</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the merchant sent the product to me in an unacceptable condition (one eyeshadow was actually USED, another was BROKEN--before shipping process, because the broken eyeshadow had been cleaned up beforehand, as opposed to being spilled all over the case if during shipping).</li>
            <li> Sparkling pigments but not bright enough when applied to the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a little girl for playing.</li>
            <li> The picture is a little deceiving though, it looks like one palette.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the smell of the little makeup sets I was given as a child from my grandmother.</li>
            <li> I have found the smell fades and the pros outweigh this little con to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a few photo shoots coming up</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> How redundant is that?</li>
            <li> It wasa waste of money.</li>
            <li> Disliked the product, this was def a waste of money. ..</li>
            <li> Underneath is nothing but plain powder.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too shocked about how it looked when i first opened it.</li>
            <li> but after half an hour were hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Once that layer is brushed away, there is only a pearlescent color, which isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Will some little girl will like it!</li>
            <li> I use a base first!</li>
            <li> Yes they are that Small.</li>
            <li> but I did not expect the product to be so small, the picture decieved me :</li>
            <li> The blue and the red were broken!!!</li>
            <li> I am not saying this to be mean</li>
            <li> I do use a high end shadow base though</li>
            <li> The product itself is very small.</li>
            <li> very very small item.</li>
            <li> Some of my pearl eyeshadow is seriously lacking some luster compared to this stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bad thing when makeup needs to be changed for different photo themes...</li>
            <li> the bad side to the eye shadow is that its a cream like and powder at the same time</li>
            <li> cause a deal like this is hard to find!</li>
            <li> I was dissapointed that there were a couple colors broken.</li>
            <li> Some were broken to bits and even the ones that weren&#x27;t did Not apply well.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the product, it was completely broken..</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken or cracked.  </li>
            <li> This is falsely represented.  </li>
            <li> NOT at all what I expected disappointed</li>
            <li> I bought quite a few of the Emori palettes and wasn&#x27;t disappointed by any of them.</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> weird....</li>
            <li> instead they are dimmer than shown, I&#x27;m not impressed</li>
            <li> I would give this product 0 stars, but sadly you cant.</li>
            <li> I do not like the fact that these pallets are basically a blatant lie.</li>
            <li> but it was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> P2 was quite filthy with the broken colors dusted over the rest of the palette.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t belv bad lies</li>
            <li> I hate glitter eye shadow, horribly tacky.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> This is CRAP!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> worst thing is they are not glittery</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is overall too shimmery, I thought it would be a bit sheen with a hint of shimmer but when I got it it&#x27;s more of makeup I&#x27;d get a little girl for playing.</li>
            <li> This product image on line is musleading. The product itself is very small. The shadows are not intense.Ok for on the go and you have nothing else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as big as the picture make it seem but this , product is great and a lot for so little great long lasting eye shadow also its sparkly I recommend this product Grade A from me !</li>
            <li> The sparkle is only on the very top.  Underneath is nothing but plain powder.  I could have bought this at the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows were way too shiny. If really shiny and glitterly eyeshadows are your thing, then be my guest and buy it.</li>
            <li> Colors are great.  FYI It comes with glitter over the top of the colors.  A whole lotta fun!!</li>
            <li> These eye shadows arrived within 3-4 days of being ordered ;-)  The colors are bold, beautiful, and soooo sparkly - perfect for the hoidaze and evenings out!  Just amazing for the price, too.</li>
            <li> As other reviews stated, the \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; is only on top. Once that layer is brushed away, there is only a pearlescent color, which isn&#x27;t bad. The colors blend well and they are very pretty. I expected a bigger pallette, but for only five bucks, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My packaging was well wrapped but still had a cracked cover, one color completely out of it&#x27;s \\&quot;shell\\&quot; and another color exploded looking used in the center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Great blending and variety of colors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Defective product prevented me from using/enjoying 100% of product</li>
            <li> I Love this make-up! It is vibrant, pearly, long lasting goodness. Like every one else has commented... it is only glittery on the top and after first time use it is better described as pearly. The colors blend well together and looked amazing even after a full day of wearing. I tried wiping it off with toilet paper and most of the color stayed on my lid! (i did use eye shadow primer, but other shadows have rubbed off even with the primer)Had to wash with soap and water to get it off. Came in the proper packaging covered in bubble wrap. Is in perfect new condition! My only complaint are the eye shadow applicators that come with it suck and the end fell off during first time use. My make-up brushes worked well with it though.</li>
            <li> I recieved my package today. The colors were great and it went on smooth. The colors have something in them that make them stick better. I was dissapointed that there were a couple colors broken. The blue and the red were broken!!! There needs to be some padding in between the eyeshadow in the case it&#x27;s self. I would return it for another one but i dont want to wait for another one. [[ASIN:B004W5RCNM Pearl Sparkle 64 Elegant Eyeshadow Colors Makeup Kit Palette]]</li>
            <li> Great eye shadow. The color variation is awesome!</li>
            <li> I can tell you I have loads of fun with these eyeshadows. They stuck to the eyelids and didn&#x27;t flake off. I don&#x27;t use eye primer either.</li>
            <li> I thought these eyesshadows were great! Smaller than expected but still awseome!&lt;br /&gt;They are highly pigmented and very sparkly! Alittle goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting 1 pallette and received both and was very happy!&lt;br /&gt;None of my eyeshadows were broken, they are amazing qaulity</li>
            <li> Very much pigmented nd stays on all day without any primer i tried on my eyes nd it didnt come out i really rubbed em to gt off my eyes to check for hw long can they stay so guyz definetly buy this</li>
            <li> i love the colors and the glitter on it but i feel the colors are too dry , i mean it doesn&#x27;t  have enough moisture for the make-up to work the beauty on the face</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED and these (Profusion Brand) were available at the Dollar Tree Store, waste of my money and time buying these online, if only they showed what brand it was I could&#x27;ve just bought at the dollar store!!</li>
            <li> bought this as a gift for my daughter but since it came with 2, I kept  one for myself.  The colors are not too loud but its sparkly which is what i wanted. I think i will be wearing this alot.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these shadows 3 times now.  The have more of a pearl effect than a glitter, but the colors are rich and last all day.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow was exactly what i wanted from the Colorado the sparkle and the price was even great....i would recommend this to anyone who wants amazing eyepopping Color on their eyes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she and my four year old daughter absolutely love them I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it... Everything about this product is what&#x27;s shown don&#x27;t belv bad lies this is a great palette. Shipping is bomb n the packaging was amazing</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive this pallet but it was disappointing.  The colors LOOK beautiful but they are nothing but a Vaseline-type goop that won&#x27;t even blend!  I&#x27;m returning this item!</li>
            <li> These are vibrant colors, they stay on very well, and go on even better! I love using these colors and how they go on and wear. Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> So cheap! only sparkly on the top layer</li>
            <li> Just recieved my eyeshadows and i LOVE them. i was expecting not so great quality due to the amazing price, but was plesantly surprised! the variety of colors is wonderful, and the amount of shimmer is PERFECT for day or night. cant wait to do up my makeup again with another color combo. probably will buy another set as a gift :) Great product, and it was shipped to me within just a couple days!</li>
            <li> Yes, this is also for my daughter  and she said that this palette is excellent the color are true to what you see and that they go on, with easy and last all day. I will be order from this company again for her soon the price on this palette is great.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It arrived a day earlier than expected, which is a very good thing. I have a few photo shoots coming up and I wanted extreme colors to make my eyes really \\&quot;pop\\&quot; in the photos. The single package contained 2 palettes (I will call them P1 and P2--palette one and palette two). Each palette contains 32 colors. P1 was in great condition while P2 had a couple of broken, unusable colors. P2 was quite filthy with the broken colors dusted over the rest of the palette. Only 30 out of the 32 in P2 were usable.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, both palettes were hard and not easy to work with \\&quot;right off the bat.\\&quot; I recommend that you don&#x27;t use a brush. This product WILL NOT gather onto a brush easily like with most eyeshadows. It&#x27;s best to use the sponge brush that comes with the palettes. The more you work with the sponge brush, the easier it will become to use. It doesn&#x27;t wash off, easily. This could be a good thing and a bad thing. It would be a good thing to wear for an outing. It&#x27;s a bad thing when makeup needs to be changed for different photo themes... like with modeling.</li>
            <li> There is a color for every occasion! I love anything that sparkles so these were perfect for me. And if u get the glitter eyeliners it definitely makes an impression on people when they see u!  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of wonderful comments on how great my makeup looks! I luv them.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow overall is amazing. This product is definitely worth it&#x27;s price and is just what you would like in eye shadow. When I got it, it surprised me that they had sparkles in them, but they worked for every occasion.</li>
            <li> I love the colors when I recieved the pallete there was no damage to the eyeshadows or casihng thy arrived in great condition my only dissapointment is that they are not eyeshadow brush friendly I had to apply them with the eyeshadow applicator that came with them but in all they are very cute but I dont think I would purchase them again dont get me wrong Im not completely dissaponted just a little :)</li>
            <li> i was a little surprised that this kit came in two pieces and that several of the colors were repeated in each piece. but the variety of colors was very nice and the colors show up as bright as i had hoped they would even without primer. (although with a primer they are much bolder) overall im pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love all of the colors. It comes in two seperate sets and some colors are repeated but I like it</li>
            <li> These colors blend well and give a very pleasent color to the eyes. This palet has helped me more than any other thus far.</li>
            <li> The items were received in a timely matter. The case was slightly cracked but no damage done to eye shadows. I really liked the product for the price. Sadly glitter is only on top layer but you get what you pay for, Overall I am pleased with the product</li>
            <li> I loved it, there IS glitter, i wiped it off as the above review said, and the glitter didn&#x27;t come off.   What you receive is two hand sized palettes with colors. Be careful, as they are hexagons, and the ones on the border get cut off right down the middle, making for less of the unlucky color. Each palette comes with a stub (those brushes that look like cotton swabs), which the head of come came off on my hand (no big deal, I&#x27;ll get another one at Ulta), and one eyeshadow color looked like it had been stabbed, and another was cracked. The case was cracked, but that just might have been my baby sister sitting on it (xD).   The colors are o bright they don&#x27;t even need a primer!!! I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful sparkling colors in many, many hues and tones!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. I want to buy another one. It came with 2 palattes so I must have 50 or more colors to choose from. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better eyeshadow before. I guess the best thing about these shadows was how little it cakes after hours of wear. All of the shadows are a glitter shadow and I didn&#x27;t realize that until the product arrived on my doorstep. Overall, for the price, the eyeshadows are decent.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Pretty sparkly-vibrant colors. They&#x27;re small palettes, nothing big but definitely pretty colors. Will recommend, especially if you want to add to any collection of eye shadows.</li>
            <li> VERY BEAUTIFUL COLORS!  THE COLOR OF THE EYE SHADOWS IS EXACTLY THE SAME COLOR WHEN APPLIED TO YOUR PIGMENTATION. FAST DELIVERY. ALSO PRODUCTS CAME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION (UNBROKEN) WITH VERY GOOD PACKAGING.</li>
            <li> packaged with care, was hard to open it was package so well. Last night I tested the colors.. they are shiny and they go on well without a million layers. I would say they are almost as good as MAC, but about ten times cheaper!</li>
            <li> I consider myself a makeup fanatic and this is really good eyeshadow. It came very well packaged and it was bigger than what I expected. The colors are shimmering and really added definition and glow to my eyes. I was afraid that the colors would be flat since the price was so cheap but that is definitely not the case. The colors stay intact all day long as well. I&#x27;m so happy I got this and at such an amazing price! (:</li>
            <li> I added this Eye Shadow pallet to my Wish list. liked the Bright Colors, not knowing the Company or anything. I took a Gamble. This is CRAP!!!!!!! usually I write pretty Good reviews on products. but there is no Pigment really to this eye shadow. The Size of the Colors I would Say it is a Sample Pallet. Yes they are that Small. for the Grade I would Say maybe give it to Your Daughters when there First Learning how to apply make up on themselves. or Play make up. I am not saying this to be mean but I want to Save you from the Dissopiontment. My husband got me this for a Gift,</li>
            <li> This make up kit was the perfect gift for my grown daughters and friends. When they wore the colors were very vibrant. I reccomend.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many many many more expensive, designer eyeshadows and this eye shadow is still a winner in my book! It really does give you that shiny, metallic look that makes your eyes pop!</li>
            <li> Excellent product to take on holiday!&lt;br /&gt;Most of the colours shimmer....soft powder form&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you buy some extra applicators because there are so many colours you need more than the one supplied.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise...very happy!!!!</li>
            <li> Containers are larger than expected. Colors are perfect adds just enough shimmer. I will probably buy more to keep as back up cause a deal like this is hard to find!</li>
            <li> I LET THEM PLAY AND PLAY WITH THIS THEY ARE GOING TOO BE SO GOOD SO SOON AT MAKEUP I LOVE THEM SO MUCH IT SUCH AND BLESSING TOO SEE THEM HAVE SO MUCH FUN GOD GIVEN THEM TOO ME.</li>
            <li> this is a really good product for the price... Im happy with it its really shimmery the way i like it</li>
            <li> kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk, kool! kool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I totally love this, it does wonders for me. I have recommded this to my cousin, and so on.</li>
            <li> Not only beautiful colors, but easy to put on and last a long time. These are awesome, cause the colors pop out. loving it</li>
            <li> This really helps keep eyeshadow on all day! i love it and never have to worry about it creasing or wearing off. Harder to blend colors though.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of the colors but many aren&#x27;t of any use. For the price, it was worth it.  Sometimes it is nice to explore different colors wiithout going broke.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item about a week ago, and I was really hesitant when I got it because of the low price, and I had never heard of the brand. (Emori) When I finally decided to buy it, it came fairly quick. The picture is a little deceiving though, it looks like one palette. It&#x27;s really two small ones. They&#x27;re really light and portable, though. I like the colors, even though they aren&#x27;t sparkly after you actually wipe the top off, they&#x27;re more of a pearl. Another thing was that when I opened the packaging, one whole shadow fell out, and it was everywhere! I&#x27;m returning it for a new one.. Other than that, I really like the colors, and the price was outstanding!</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive makeup set. My kids love it. Came on time and in perfect condition. Item is same as descibed and we are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my FAVORITE GLITTER EYESHADOW!!!!! There are amazing colors that you can match up to anything and it stays on all day long!!!  : D</li>
            <li> NOT at all what I expected disappointed</li>
            <li> Ok product if you use your own makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> great product and I have very sensitive skin and had no reaction at all.</li>
            <li> This Emori eyeshadow is amazing! Great for starters also. My only issue was that the glitter particles would get in my eye all the time,but overall great product!</li>
            <li> i really like all the diferent shades..and love how it looks when i put it down..it was for a really good price too!</li>
            <li> im white skinned so i would of thought putting o this purple eyeshadow i have on now was very pigmented very bright like i saw on youtube videos and comment reviews nothing like i thought kind of dissapointed but it is beautiful case tho and very fast delivery they said it would be here may 28 to june 3rd it came in two days but sad  its not as shiny as my normal eyeshadows i use  it kind of looks like a normal plain eyeshadow with color would.</li>
            <li> This is a cute sampler for someone who likes to wear a variety of colors or wants to try out different looks. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend use for someone who sticks to only a few colors because the color hexagons are really small. The color tends to bunch in the crease of the eyelid like many other eye shadows, so it&#x27;s not good for humid areas, or hot/sweaty temperatures.</li>
            <li> Sparkling pigments but not bright enough when applied to the face. Not quality mineral enough but cheap.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKEUP IS AWESOME GREAT FOR GOING OUT TO A PARTY OR JUST EVERYDAY WEAR BUT IT IS GREAT AND THE COLOR IS OUTSTANDING</li>
            <li> the product is good, the colors are beautiful even considering that the texture of some of they are not exactly what I expected. But in general I really like it</li>
            <li> The colors are not as vybrant like in the picture and it&#x27;s two separate pallets. I tried to use one of the colors but because I am dark skinned it didn&#x27;t show at all. I guess I&#x27;ll just keep it around if any of my girl friends want to use it.</li>
            <li> such great colors, and the pearl pigments are great.. i love this set.. totally worth it. helped me make my rainbow eyes for edc!!</li>
            <li> My 10 year old loves to play with makeup. This was the perfect buy for her for christmas! This has every color imaginable - comes with no brush - easy to apply! It has all you need to dress up with! Great find, great amount, great buy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS product!!! I use it everyday. I gave the second one to my mom. She loves it too!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a 14 year old girl &amp; she loved the variety of colors.  But she accidentally dropped it on a CARPETED floor and several of the pearls popped out of the case.  we glued them back in but the palette was never the same.  Might be good for a starter or play kit.</li>
            <li> I love love love! They really go have a nice pearl finish to each color. The colors are very pretty!</li>
            <li> my favorite! the color pop like never before</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeshadow!  It will look great and last a long time. I have received so many compliments every time I wear it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like is that the picture makes it look as if it one case with 64 colors.  It is not.  It is two cases and not one large one.  Other than that the color is fantastic .... your eyes will look like a PRO did them!  Follow me on PinInterest ....BrooklynGirl626 to see more of the things I like and love!</li>
            <li> These are very good eyeshadows. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because the glitter does not go all the way through. Just on the top. But these have good strong color and are gorgeous. I would still buy again. Great pearl essence.</li>
            <li> really like and came fast</li>
            <li> the the colors. The shadow sticks and a lot of fun too put on. I love it.  Thank u .</li>
            <li> I used them for coloring my polymer clay project. esecially I like metalic colors that make clay more shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this Beautiful color!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup :) looks great on my skin tone :) for me being east Indian :) thank you for making great makeup!</li>
            <li> I bought these just because of the bright colors and the fact that there are so many shades! Loove it!</li>
            <li> IF YOU APPLY THIS AND THEN YOU BLINK THE COLOR WILL BE GONE! DO NOT BUY IT PEOPLE, HONESTLY IT IS NOT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> I love how the colors are so sparkly and shimmery, love how the colors stand out, yet are not to bold.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The eyeshadows are so cute, and they go on very smoothly. The only downside is that it is 2 pieces, and some of the colors are repeated. However, I still looooove them.</li>
            <li> All the sparkle is just on the top layer but they are super good quality for the price. I would recommend this if you don&#x27;t care about the sparkle</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and wonderful shine to the eyeshadow, long lasting, beautiful combinations, no bleeding from eyeshadow to another. I would recommend this product to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye shadow.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on it! It is the only eye makeup I wear! I will buy it again and again. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> I just got this today. The packageing was everything I thought it was. I was scared that it wasnt going to be packed properlly, so I am greatfull. After opening the package, it was bubble wrapped to make sure it wouldnt be damaged through shipping. No colors missing, nothing broken, the case is good. This is a great experience. Definately!</li>
            <li> As long as you buy this with the understanding that it is NOT glitter eyeshadow and know its just the surface that looks sparkly then the glitter is gone you&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and still got it because i liked the colors and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love it!! The colors are great</li>
            <li> Excellent pay off I was expecting the pallet to be bigger but in all very nice. Very beautiful colors. Sparkly!</li>
            <li> The colors are vivid and not only that, the way it sparkles is amazing.  I recommend it.  Love the colors.</li>
            <li> I love my selection even though some of the colors have been repeated, and for me thatâ€™s a good thing just in case I fall in love with a color that have been repeated that will be my backup color! LOL To make the colors POP I use a base first!</li>
            <li> These colors are incredibly pigmented and long-lasting. I bought the bright colors for Halloween since I didn&#x27;t feel like shelling out big bucks for one night of makeup, but I&#x27;ll be going back to buy one of the more neutral palettes for everyday use.</li>
            <li> What a great gift to give and recieve. If you love your makeup, you will love this set! I have seen nothing to compare to this great deal in any store!</li>
            <li> I recieved the eyeshadow palette in 2 days even though I had the basic shipping(3-5 days)From reading the past reviews I wasn&#x27;t too shocked about how it looked when i first opened it. There were scratches in the case, so it didn&#x27;t look brand new. I started to test out the colors and see how they blended, and they actually blend very well. Forgetting to wipe my make up off before i went to bed, i slept with it on. I woke up this morning and the eyeshadow looked as if I had just put it on. I was very pleased by how it didn&#x27;t crease or wipe off easily. Great product, I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeshodow i have ever used i love it and its a great buy!and a wonefull gift idea!</li>
            <li> I got them half of the make was all over the place and when I open it all my clothes got mess up from it</li>
            <li> I bought this product knowing the warnings of other customers of their disappointment/issues. Amazingly, this product hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet! It came in super fast even though it didn&#x27;t have Prime 2-Day shipping. It was packed very well and there was very little damage (light dusting from a slightly cracked eyeshadow) but I expect that when buying eyeshadow online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Goes on nice and thick - great with blending&lt;br /&gt;-Stays on and looks amazing. I actually slept in it and the next morning the my eyes still shone and had a bit left from it&lt;br /&gt;-Highly pigmented colors that can make so many different combos -- I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I rely on it for daily use&lt;br /&gt;-And finally, this is really luminous pearl eyeshadow! Some of my pearl eyeshadow is seriously lacking some luster compared to this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Only one I can think of... the smell! It reminds me of the smell of the little makeup sets I was given as a child from my grandmother. I have found the smell fades and the pros outweigh this little con to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, pretty darn good buy!</li>
            <li> I noticed alot of negativity on this product. My own experience Is this....the product came right away ( within a day) and when I got it it was bubble wrapped in a padded bubble envelope with packing peanuts. I had no broken eyeshadows and no defects. As far as the products application review....no this is not professional grade make up nor is it \\&quot;glittery\\&quot; like people think but the description is \\&quot;pearl\\&quot; and it is exactly that. They are blendable and all colors have a very pretty pearl like finish...even the black. overall I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED! The product in the photo and what I received WERE NOT the same. First - the pallets come in two separate plastic cases, and does not appear to be the one set that the photo would have you beleive. At any rate, my biggest problem with this product is that the SAME COLORS were on EACH SIDE - just organized in different places on the pallette! How redundant is that? I felt a little ripped off on that note, because you can clearly see in the picture that there are different colors on each side. I tried the colors on, and they are just okay - nothing particularly brilliant about them, and they are not as strong as other pigments/shadows that I have. Its not a completely bad product - but not as elegant as some other items I have tried. I will have to say I would not recommend this product for adults- but it would make a reasonable gift for young girls.</li>
            <li> Tons of color choices</li>
            <li> The colours are beautiful, but without the use of an eyeshadow primer these colours come off within minutes.</li>
            <li> It looks way higher quality in the photo. The actual product looks nothing like it and the makeup is coarse.</li>
            <li> Great Item and seller!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors! These are 2 separate shadow palettes, the size of the shadows are about the size of a nickel. They are very pigmented and add the right amount of glitter and sparkle without looking tacky! They are a great alternative to those sticky goopy \\&quot;glitter cream\\&quot; palettes, which are dry and do not spread evenly over your eyelids. My only complaint was that the merchant sent the product to me in an unacceptable condition (one eyeshadow was actually USED, another was BROKEN--before shipping process, because the broken eyeshadow had been cleaned up beforehand, as opposed to being spilled all over the case if during shipping). BUT aside from the merchant, the product itself is GREAT! I would definitely buy again (from someone else :P).</li>
            <li> This is falsely represented.  It is not glitter at all... it sparkles until you brush the top layer of shadow then it is simply a pearl shadow.  If your looking for glitter look elsewhere... I&#x27;d send it back but I paid $12 with shipping and it would cost me too much to ship it back. I&#x27;ll just give the one unopenned side away to Good Will some little girl will like it! Very disappointed...I wanted it to be a great glitter effect for Halloween.</li>
            <li> Loved this palette! It came very quickly, in perfect condition and I was very satisfied with the colors! Happily grateful!</li>
            <li> Such a great buy!  My daughter is just getting into makeup and loved the colors!  When I read the reviews on this it said there was only shimmer on too.. we used almost every color and it is all shimmer!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> i bought this for a friend for xmas. when it arrived i was impressed by the way it was well packaged but that was about it. i realized upon closer inspection that the four different eyeshadow &amp;#34;boxes&amp;#34; that had arrived, they were actually 2 sets of the same colors. with that much eyeshadow it was ridiculous to give her all 4 when she will prolly never use half of it. so i kept 2 and gave her 2. when i first opened it and tried to use it, i realized that what looks like a creamy pearlescent eyeshadow...is actually clumpy and hard to spread. maybe she will (hopefully) find some way to use this. but i wont. disappointed with a product that could have been good.</li>
            <li> I love this palette! This is super fun and glittery! It is nice because it adds sparkle to any eye that I am trying to make!</li>
            <li> very pleasing to the eyes, love them all,gr8 colors to use, arrived on time, packaged well in bubble wrap,exactly wht i aw on line</li>
            <li> First one was all smashed and destroyed before I even got it out the package and they sent me another one really fast but it only had sparkle on the top of the eye shadow not the whole eye shadow</li>
            <li> great eye colors, and some colors that you might not think you would use but i used everyone of them!!</li>
            <li> excellent product, what I asked was expected, a quality 100 %  , quality at low cost, the finish is spectacular, the colors expected, I recommend this product to buyers, are you going to like, thanks ...</li>
            <li> Using it every day but careful not to use brush that has any dampness it clumps - but otherwise very happy with this product</li>
            <li> the shimmer is mostly on top, once you use it once it&#x27;s not too shimmery anymore but it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> the eye shadows are not sparkly. the sparkle is only on top. the eye shadow is very pigmented and very pretty colors when put on your eyes. the bad side to the eye shadow is that its a cream like and powder at the same time so if u us the slights about of preacher the eye shadow brakes but it is easy to but back together cuz of the cream like. i really like these eye shadows and will buy more. the eye shadow was shipped fast and was well protected when shipped!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she loves the colors. I use them sometimes too. :D</li>
            <li> i try to use all the colors and i loved the price ill shop with your often when i see more items</li>
            <li> I love the eye shadow so pretty... i don&#x27;t wear make up every day but when i do go out with friends or to a party i like to look nice and i did my make up today just to try them out i loved them so pretty and its nice that they are not so high.. thank you amazon :)</li>
            <li> got it for my little sister for Christmas she cried lol and says they work fabulously</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are amazing! The stayed on ALL day, 8.5 hours of work, Night class , and Roller Derby practice, and my eyeshadow was still on perfectly! Check out my youtube review on this product here [...]</li>
            <li> The colours are awesome.. This is truly a great product.. The colours truly pops..ðŸ˜ŠI am truly satisfied with this product!!</li>
            <li> I love these shades!!! The glitter is definitely layered directly on top of each colour, so when you wipe it its gone. But they still have a lovely shimmer to it. Some shades are repetitive, which is good especially if you like a certain color.</li>
            <li> I really like the way the colors looked on me at my semi when I first used them and got a lot of compliments but I just wish there was a little more sparkle to them. Really like how many colors there are two and the way they feel. Love this product will definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> think i got 2 of the same ones, the image shows something different i think?  i have 2 identiacal ones and the colors are exactly the same on each...  but still a great deal either way...  can give one to a friend, but thought i was gonna get more colors? weird....</li>
            <li> It really has shimmer, a pearl like affect to it. It&#x27;s not like some shadows that the top of it is shimmery but once you remove the top layer the shimmer is gone. This product is shimmery all the way. The colors are bright, and blend well. I highly recommend buying this. I know I will get more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I liked all the variety in colors and they were easy to apply but I didn&#x27;t realize it would be so sparkly. I believe it was still a Good buy for the price though.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when i ordered these and sad when they arrived. Some were broken to bits and even the ones that weren&#x27;t did Not apply well. It wasa waste of money.</li>
            <li> I order this for a friend for a Christmas gift exchange. She absolutely loved it. She can&#x27;t stop bragging about it lol</li>
            <li> Yes they are a lot smaller than they look here but they blend really well and shine all day. I love this set and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I ordered this along with their 32 Color Design Neon Glitter and Plan Eyeshadow Makeup Kit, and received two (2) of those with different shades in each set but I never received this product.</li>
            <li> Musta worked, because my ex wife left me for another! lol</li>
            <li> I bought this 3 months ago and i love the many colors the colors dont break easy i love this</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow colors are nice, more glitter than shimmer. The quality is fair, but the amount of palettes in the description is not completely accurate. There is 64 colors that comes in kits of 4 with 16 eyeshadow colors in each. Buyers be aware when purchasing this product, that the 16 colors are the same in each kit.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used this one yet....swatched some...looked pretty then.  need to see if glitter holds up when applied on eyes tho.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the product, it was completely broken.. the eye shadow was EVERYWHERE..im just saying the packaging needs to be packaged a little better..</li>
            <li> I love the palette, beautiful colors and sparkle...good for club scene or hot nights out. The product was packaged perfectly..recommend for all.</li>
            <li> I use these a lot and they are great! Vibrant colors and they don&#x27;t fade as fast as other eyeshadows! There are so many colors to choose from I really love this product!</li>
            <li> LOVED THE COLORS BUT I DONT LIKE TO HAVE ALOT OF TRAYS OF MAKEUP THIS ONE WAS 2 TRAYS UPSET.</li>
            <li> The colors show up really well and you don&#x27;t have to constantly add for the color to show up on your eyes.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy with this product. it exceeded my expectations and i&#x27;m very pleased. i would highly recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I just love all the colors...i have a color to match everything plus im getting so many compliments....im really enjoying this product</li>
            <li> Great product, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> pretty like always buy for them</li>
            <li> i love this! mine came in PERFECT condition no cracks, nothing. it also came a 2 days before it was suppose to come and i paid for standard shipping! the colors are very pretty, they are glittery but not to the point were it looks weird lol its perfect! the only problem i have with this is the size i thought it would be bigger the eyeshadows are pretty small and so is the palette so if your looking for a bigger one this one wouldnt be for you  but over all i would recommend this product. the makeup also doesnt stay on all day</li>
            <li> Worth buying, has amazing colors and they go on easy, don&#x27;t even need to use a primer.  I bought it with amazon gift cards, and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> They are a little light so I use my finger to apply which makes it heavier. I love this pallet and definitely would reccomend this so anyone who loves eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I love the colers, they are vibrant but I did not expect the product to be so small, the picture decieved me :c&lt;br /&gt;Other then that everything is just fine</li>
            <li> The picture is not what you get, they are split in to, I thought I would get a pallet (bought these for x-mas gifts) but it was seperate ughh ...colors look better in pic instead they are dimmer than shown, I&#x27;m not impressed</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!! Love the variety of colors. Definitely worth what I paid for. I would definitely recommend this product:)</li>
            <li> Arrival was very precise, that is the only reason for 1star.Disliked the product, this was def a waste of money. ..and for those who could actually compare to high known brands like MAC or Channel obviously dont know their products</li>
            <li> The shipping was a high price, but compared to everything else that doesn&#x27;t even matter to me!!  These are long lasting, pretty, colorful, and blend well together.  Great beginner kit or great for someone who wants a little sparkle!</li>
            <li> although the sparkle is only on the very top of each color they are still shiny. they have excellent coverage and last all night or day. I have had mine for a few months and have no complaints I love them.</li>
            <li> This is only good for makeup play. It is very sparkly and bright and fun for young girls to put on but very low quality.</li>
            <li> Love the shimmer and shine I get with this. you have to try the colors befor you judge the colors in these packs. they have a glitter  coat on top and it hides the real color of each one so you may think your getting duplicates when your not its a different color. I love using these with other matte colors i have to tone down some of the shine or to add some sparkle to an a mazing matte color i already have.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful colors .Good variety of colors.Nice quality.It is a nice side it doesn&#x27;t take up  to much room in my make up area.</li>
            <li> I loved the color in this palette. They are very pigmented and smooth. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, just tested some on my fingers and they all seemed bright.I bought quite a few of the Emori palettes and wasn&#x27;t disappointed by any of them. The first 1 I bought, I had no idea of how they would be because I never heard of the name before. Emori eyeshadows are smooth and silky and all of the colors are nice and vibrant. They are all very well priced. Recommend them to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like paying high prices.</li>
            <li> My daughter was so happy she loved it &amp; as soon as she needs more I would defitnetly buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow. It&#x27;s some seriously long wear stuff. It goes on nice and stays on all day. I have to scrub to remove this stuff. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was very happy when I ordered these, but when they came in the mail I was very disappointed, they pigmented well but after half an hour were hardly noticeable. Also they have a very strange smell. It stank up my makeup droor for months, even after I threw them away. I would give this product 0 stars, but sadly you cant.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette after looking at what seemed like hundreds.  I received it in 2-3 days.  The palettes were wrapped in bubble wrap inside a bubble wrap envelope.  Nothing was broken or cracked.  The colors are beautiful and very pigmented.  I tried a few and expected them to be sheer or light without a primer, but they weren&#x27;t-they were deep and rich.  I would definitely recommend this palette.  It has a great price and choice of colors!</li>
            <li> When I received these they came in decent condition.</li>
            <li> fun stay on all day and the colors blend well. worst thing is they are not glittery it is just the top layer :(</li>
            <li> these are great quality but arrived damaged . They are worth the price minus the damage to them. Would love if no damage</li>
            <li> Lots of colors to choose from, with a little primer or eyeliner on your lids first, the pigment will stay all day</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,beautiful colors, 9 yr old was very pleased and I think I&#x27;ll order another one for myself :)</li>
            <li> For something that was $6 they&#x27;re not bad, but I&#x27;ve certainly had better. They&#x27;re not very pigmented and the powders are VERY loose, so beware. But they are cute if you want a soft glittery glow or for costume makeup.</li>
            <li> I am enjoyingi my eye shadows very much. The price was great and glad to be a cutomer at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very good deal! I work in a club and it&#x27;s bright enough to see in a dimly lit room and it lasts all night.</li>
            <li> very very small item.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 10 yr old daughter who likes to do makeup with her friends.  It offers a lot of colors, I&#x27;ve even borrowed a couple.  They aren&#x27;t high quality pigment.  They are sparkley!  My daughter and her friends play together for hours with makeup and doing hair.  The cost is great for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on kids &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; makeup.  No one has experienced any sort of issue using this product.</li>
            <li> Ã‰ um jogo de maquiagem que mais parece um brinquedo, pois Ã© muito pequeno. Na foto temos a impressÃ£o de haver 1 Ãºnico conjunto, mas na verdade sÃ£o 2, um ao lado do outro.</li>
            <li> First I&#x27;ll just say I bought this product because of the reviews saying it is not properly advertised. I hate glitter eye shadow, horribly tacky. I do not like the fact that these pallets are basically a blatant lie. These are  NOT glitter shadows. They are pearlescent shadows covered with 1 thin layer of glitter just to make them look better. The layer of glitter does not event work as eye shadow, but seems more like something you&#x27;d glue on paper. There was barely even enough of it to cover two of my fingers. As soon as I got this I rubbed all the glitter off anyway. I really like the colors and the formula. I do use a high end shadow base though, they work great with that but you&#x27;ve got to remember that these are terribly cheap. Their not going to work miracles. The formula is somewhere in between a powder shadow and cream, which is nice. Something that bothered me about other people&#x27;s reviews is that they are saying this product is misrepresented as a single pallet. It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to browse through the photos and see that they are very clearly separate.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome palette! The colors go well with EVERYTHING. You can use it for all occasions! So nice.</li>
            <li> Marvelous eyeshadow colors. 64 brilliant  shades to choose from. my niece was well pleased. It was worth the money. It arrived in great condition and on time.</li>
            <li> very good item best for a woman on the go with little time to reapply her makeup&lt;br /&gt;Lasted for more than eight hours</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this eyeshadow...except that it is too difficult to wash off. It blends well and is so beautiful, but getting it off is the hardest part. I don&#x27;t know if I would purchase the product again, maybe, maybe not.</li>
            <li> in the picture it kinda looks like one big pallette but it&#x27;s two.. i kept one for myself and gave the other to my mommy she really liked it:D i like it too.. ALOT((:</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and I absolutely LOVE it!!  The colors go on smooth &amp; bold, and the glitter is just right...not too much.  Between these EMORI palettes &amp; my MAC makeup, my face stays BEAT!!</li>
            <li> I really didnt like the eyeshdow it didnt  really show and it feels rusty when you put it on.Do not like it one bit.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. I purchased it so I&#x27;d have a variety of colors to work with for nights when I wear shadow. The colors are vibrant and there are multiple shades of each color. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! I was so happy I told my daughter and she ordered one as well!!! Thank you so much</li>
            <li> If you want to achieve fantastical makeup for your eyes, you need fantastical colors and this eyeshadow palette provides that and BEYOND.  The shadow is great quality.  It compliments any fine stage quality foundations (MAC, NARS, MEHRON, BEN NYE, etc.) an dlasts under stage lighting and doesn&#x27;t smear under perspiration.  THIS IS A STEAL!</li>
            <li> love eye shadows, goes on smooth, colors are great very pigmented. Packaged well, no broken shades. Great for the price!</li>
            <li> Great product, its my new favorite makeup! Was nervous to order makeup online but it was a great choice. Came in the mail promptly and on time.</li>
            <li> really nice last all day</li>
            <li> thought it was too much of a glitter effect. it creases too easy even with primer and it smudges a little. its not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I like the eye shadows I love the color selection but all of the glitter is just on the top all though the eye shadows are still very pigmented which I like and they&#x27;re easy to blend I also would have thought they would have been bigger but oh well they look bigger in the pictures the eye shadow also lasts a long time on your eyes the colors are also very bright and rich which I like(: not a bad buy for $5.</li>
            <li> These colors are not that pigmented when used dry, but if you wet them, they are extremely pigmented and very sparkley, I really like them a lot and the variety of colors is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> This was better than I expected! Have been having fun since I got it! Been experimenting with the wide array of colors!</li>
