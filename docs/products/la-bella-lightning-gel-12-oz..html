            <li>This product is the best!</li>
            <li>so awesome.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like peroxide either.  </li>
            <li>I will use more again during summer months, but...what a bargain!!!</li>
            <li>I then use my hair dryer to speed up the process a bit, and it turns out beautifully.</li>
            <li>But my hair feels and looks great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>I feel like it was a great deal.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great bleach alternative.</li>
            <li>Never want to run out of this stuff, it is truly great.</li>
            <li>The La Bella worked GREAT on my roots.</li>
            <li>Over all great product.</li>
            <li>also great if you dont wanna bleach your hair before dying it.</li>
            <li>This gel is great.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for maintenance.</li>
            <li>But over all, it was very effective</li>
            <li>The process is very effective yet gradual.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective product, which has allowed my hair to gradually lighten over the course of a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>and now it looks amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with how well this gel works and how incredibly affordable it is!</li>
            <li>So if you are planning on lounging in the sun after putting in this gel, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get the great results even faster!</li>
            <li>For the good price, it is a great product to get for any people who want to lighten their hair during season.</li>
            <li>that will lighten some under bright sunlight.</li>
            <li>I read all the good reviews</li>
            <li>So a good 1/3 of an inch of roots were already showing.     </li>
            <li>I will be stocking up on this stuff - good buy</li>
            <li>This is a good gel.</li>
            <li>but it made my hair so gorgeous, with highlights and</li>
            <li>This is really good.</li>
            <li>and this took a good majority of the copper color out in a couple treatments.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for pulling out the orange color on the bleached ends of my hair and it also fades my hair so nicely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, and gorgeous, and my hair isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li>Great for lightening your locks:)</li>
            <li>I love this gel, works wonders, I hope amazon dont stop selling it!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cover-or go ahead more for me!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this gel, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
            <li>truly great stuff and cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice gradual lightener, and I think being in the sun helps the effect along faster.     </li>
            <li>is my honest review</li>
            <li>Just nice natural-looking highlights.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping to find another kind that works as well without these added chemicals.</li>
            <li>After using it for about 2 months, I have received a very nice light caramel color.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly on my medium brown hair and lets me lighten my hair slowly and with excellent precision.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best lightener I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I got this product after a good amount of research on lighteners and reviews about La Bella was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Works good and quickly, wish i could find more.</li>
            <li>This thing is great for anybody who wants to change their hair color.</li>
            <li>I felt that when you stand out in the sunlight after using it to works better from my experience.</li>
            <li>most people think it is.  </li>
            <li>Its quite lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My brother even used it on vacation and looks better than his girlfriend&#x27;s $100 highlights.</li>
            <li>but I took a chance and glad I did.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but it mostly fades through so my hair is not blotchy.</li>
            <li>I plan on using my blow dryer to help lighten the hair more</li>
            <li>just looks like you had a longer vacation! :)</li>
            <li>and I was so glad I did.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li>I bought 7 and might get some more to stock.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I do because I look better with it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I do not want my hair to get more lighter and more platinum which I doubt it will lighten my hair like that, though.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with color in my hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li>IF I HAVE TO BUY MORE</li>
            <li>However, I never used the gel more than two days.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, I checked as many online reviews as I could find to make sure this was a product that did what it said it would do AND not turn my hair any shade of orange.    </li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair recently though, because i am unpatient, and i will use la bella on my roots when they start coming out &lt;3</li>
            <li>but it would cost me much more:)</li>
            <li>Better than using bleach or going to a salon.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t love the way it came out in the salon.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fade, it was more two colors...</li>
            <li>I started putting the gel just above the line in my hair and out to the ends to try and get my hair to have more of a fade than a line which worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>The more you use it the lighter it gets.</li>
            <li>I used this on my roots between touching up my highlights and would get compliments..</li>
            <li>and I was able to get a very bright blonde</li>
            <li>I am delighted to say (no pun intended) that not only does LaBella lift my hair color, but it is also a darn good styling gel.</li>
            <li>It is a very true \\&quot;day at the beach\\&quot; lightener.</li>
            <li>You can decide how light you want your hair by choosing how many times you want to apply the gel.</li>
            <li>I use it nearly every day and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>I go part by part, section by section and really use a good amount of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The product made very nice, natural looking, caramel highlights.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That means more for me and my friends, perfect little gift to because these go away for a while.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal!  </li>
            <li>It worked very quickly, 3 treatments made my hair visibly lighter.</li>
            <li>Easy highlitghts.</li>
            <li>I got this because I really wanted to skip paying $80 for professional highlighting, and it has done that perfectly.</li>
            <li>so it might be too strong for some people.   </li>
            <li>The first day, yes, the first day I had very nice caramel highlights.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much amazing.</li>
            <li>Wow, I cannot believe how effective this product is!</li>
            <li>Touching up roots is quick and easy</li>
            <li>loved my new hair color</li>
            <li>However, I did a strand test and it was fine.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, I am very pleased with this product, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>After applying it for 2 days I have noticed a huge differnce.</li>
            <li>I liked it,  really did the job.</li>
            <li>About every 2-3 weeks after a shower I cover my scalp and roots with the Light&#x27;ning gel.  </li>
            <li>I had great luck with John Frieda beach blonde</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>What is also nice about the gel is that it doesn&#x27;t stick my hair together so much that it crunches to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair (used to be blond).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I found such an effective product for such great price!   </li>
            <li>I have never written a review before - so you should know this product is worth the effort :)&lt;</li>
            <li>If you have undyed hair then this will be FANTASTIC on your hair.</li>
            <li>The smell was light and even then it didn&#x27;t stay around.</li>
            <li>No longer made, but this stuff was fantastic for lightening your hair where you want to.</li>
            <li>My hair color is ash brown, between light and medium, closer to medium.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in search of a good replacement that can lighten hair at home and not destroy it.</li>
            <li>My wife wanted it &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it, so we turned to the good old interweb to find it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any drying of my hair, but my hair is really healthy and using this gel has to better on my hair than going to have the ends bleached every 3 months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very handy that this is a gel, because I can pull my hair back and use this product to hold it in place during my exercise.  </li>
            <li>I saw a change in my hair color immediately after the first use, and as I kept going my hair got more and more golden.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair an amazing golden color - totally believable and I&#x27;ve had a TON of people ask if its natural -</li>
            <li>I worked immediately my co-workers made complitments when they noticed the golden brown color in my hair!</li>
            <li>Great value for the amount received, AND it really looks like natural highlights/lightener!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many positive things about this product.</li>
            <li>if I tried to use it before going to work or something, but it&#x27;s great for outdoor sports, going to the beach, or other situations where you can enjoy the sun.  </li>
            <li>if you kind of think about what your hair does when it fades in the summer, that&#x27;s pretty much what this does.</li>
            <li>The one thing that surprised/disappointed me is that it kind of blended in my natural highlights, so they aren&#x27;t as visible.</li>
            <li>I tried to lighten them more, and maybe I&#x27;ll try again, but they are already really blond.</li>
            <li>It will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>Cheap long lasting products are priceless, but these are cheap.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it! :)</li>
            <li>La Bella Lightning Gel does lift hair color gradually -- very gradually in my case, and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the gel to work a bit faster, but I am pleased with the results, especially because my hair is still healthy and the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with spray-in sun lighteners, but reached a point where I don&#x27;t get much time outside (full time work and full time school, I&#x27;m always at my computer!).</li>
            <li>I tried it first indoors, without the sun, using a blow dryer and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>you want a quick hair color change</li>
            <li>And since the change is somewhat gradual (the more you put on the faster it will work, and i put globs of gel on the strands-which is why it began to show in only 2 days), you can feel in control of how dramatic/subtle the end result will be! :)</li>
            <li>I get gorgeous highlights in the summer, but wanted to lighten my hair to a golden blonde with dying it.</li>
            <li>When going blonde, keep in mind that the best season to do it is spring/summer because the sun will help you immensely to achieve a desirable color.</li>
            <li>when I would go back to the salon to get more highlights my hair looked even better than before when I wouldn&#x27;t pre-lighten..</li>
            <li>SO THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT VERY KEEPING MY HAIR BLONDE</li>
            <li>I originally found this at drugstore.com, but then found it here on Amazon which, of course, offers FREE SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>It not only works, but for those of us who are either trying for a more natural lightning or sun-kissed look to our hair, or those of us who are just not ready to go drastically lighter too quickly, this product is perfect!</li>
            <li>I wish this kind of thing would happen more often \\&quot;the secret product that works better than the brand.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and have gotten great results and lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>Oh well, it was worth a try</li>
            <li>I ended up with too light hair painted on top and solid brown hair underneath - the skunk look.  </li>
            <li>My hair still feels touchable and soft, but just in case, every time I was I make sure to use a lot of conditioner.</li>
            <li>The first generation of John Frieda&#x27;s lightening products for blondes were pretty good, but they&#x27;re probably never coming back, so I&#x27;ll be using this gel from now on.    </li>
            <li>Because I used it repeatedly, and in different places, it resulted in all-over brightness and nice dimension and it doesn&#x27;t look like it came from a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item has some very positive ratings, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I used this product rather intensely for two days and have had significant lightning of my mouse brown hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy more bottles, but I have still have plenty left right now!</li>
            <li>I have been using La Bella Lightning Gel for a little over a week now and the results are spectacular!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, and am pleased to say my results match the general consensus.</li>
            <li>I used this product and it actually lighten my hair in more like golden blond which I am aiming to get.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and natural without too much copper tint.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li>I have used the product a total of 4 times over a 10 day period, and my hair is now a very light golden/coppery brown.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s pretty sweet and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>I should probably preface my review by saying that my natural hair is a light, drab brown.  </li>
            <li>I probably use this product different than most ladies.  </li>
            <li>Its not a fake platinum or brassy tone.  </li>
            <li>The gel formula allows me to target exactly the areas I want without getting the gel on areas I don&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this gel would work, so I only applied it to select strands of damp hair first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I am back to buy more soon.</li>
            <li>well it looks cute when I take it out the next morning</li>
            <li>does exactly what I wanted: gradually and discreetly lighten my locks without damaging them.</li>
            <li>But this stuff really, really, really works!</li>
            <li>It does change your color fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments for my hair, and my boyfriend says that my hair is so much more blonde now that he doesn&#x27;t immediately recognize me when he sees me.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first use, my hair was noticeably lighter, but not brassy like the sun-in results.</li>
            <li>My hair was healthy prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed its effect after 2 or 3 days and the lightening continued gradually.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s diffcult to find a product that actually fits it&#x27;s price, and even more so to find one that exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a gel, you know exactly where it&#x27;s going</li>
            <li>i tested strands from my brush first to see what color my hair would change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most similar alternative to this product would probably be Sun-In gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times and am thrilled with my natural looking results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got some nice natural undertones, but it&#x27;s kinda mousy without extra help.  </li>
            <li>So far I still have almost the full bottle since I stop using it, not because I dont like it</li>
            <li>It changed from kind of orange to dark blond on each application.   </li>
            <li>I also fallowed these treatments with a deep conditioning treatment, just to be safe, since the main ingredient is hydrogen peroxide, it&#x27;s not the gentlest stuff.</li>
            <li>I just put a little on my hair and a lot on my roots, I love the color!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased as it not only lightens, but works as a styling gel ....</li>
            <li>Half of you who even read this are not going to get this bottle to test it out either because it says, \\&quot;I was purchased at the dollar store and am just the kind of product that would do something</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t get it mixed up with the hubs normal hair gel. :)</li>
            <li>Plus sun exposure now lightens my hair a little more quickly</li>
            <li>Normally, they really stand out, but this stuff lightened the rest of my hair so well that the highlights aren&#x27;t as striking (not really a big deal)</li>
            <li>My dark hair is blending much better with the lighter sections now and the overall look is much more pleasing to me.  </li>
            <li>However after deep conditioning treatment its fine</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who wants lighter hair without having to dye it!</li>
            <li>The gel is easy to use, and can make your hair feel stiff and gritty, but it looked nice when I styled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering that the bottle is huge, this is enough for me for my lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do hair &amp;#34;sections&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34;, I do the whole head.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It was for my son who used to have very blond hair, but it has darkened over the years.  </li>
            <li>I really could see no difference at all.    </li>
            <li>This took no more effort than a leave-in conditioner and my hair is very healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I used this product for about 4 days straight...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle but efficient hair lightener, this is it.</li>
            <li>I have great gold shades (I applied different amounts on different parts to have several tones).   </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to dilute the product too much) and apply the product all over.</li>
            <li>It really changed my hair color.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling like cheap doll hair.</li>
            <li>BEFORE SUMMERS THANKS YOU AGAIN</li>
            <li>The bottle says not recommended for African American hair, but I am African American and it worked perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>I have light to medium brown hair with quite a bit of red  (naturally occurring) and this lightens even without blow drying or going outside if used consistently...works much better than the spray-</li>
            <li>A 2009 research shows that aging hair turns gray because it builds up too much hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you could really create an ombre from scratch with this</li>
            <li>Not beach blonde, mind you, but definitely a nice blonde shade.</li>
            <li>I repeated next day, and after two applications I&#x27;m done, I have the most natural highlights (see pics).</li>
            <li>Very rarely in life do we come across cheap products that work better than the expensive ones.</li>
            <li>It literally works like a charm and lightens hair significantly even after only one day&#x27;s use!    </li>
            <li>I like I use it 8 hours a day every other Sunday, or more at the roots if they begin to show through.</li>
            <li>also when I wanted a new color overall, it switched my haircolor to a nice brown overall.</li>
            <li>As some previous reviewer said \\&quot;it is rare when something cheap works\\&quot; but this product does.</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another hair lightning product as long as this one is still available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve highlighted my hair for years and am willing to pay whatever it takes for natural looking highlights that go all the way through my hair.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to keep applying the gel to the same strands, and after only 2 days i noticed a difference!</li>
            <li>so I made sure to get deep conditioning treatments at my local salon to keep my hair in shape.</li>
            <li>I was very blonde as a young child, but over the years my hair has darkened to a light, somewhat mousy brown.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>In sum, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I apply it all over to lighten it a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I should note also that you have to be careful to get the gel on your roots and evenly dispersed through the hair, because fixes unevenness or uneven roots is tough when the hair is significantly lightened (and the feel of globs of gel on your scalp isn&#x27;t the most pleasant feeling, but when the gel dries it&#x27;s not noticeable).    </li>
            <li>As far as damage, I didn&#x27;t really notice any.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much to go too far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just one application of this gel I could already notice the difference and now my hair is golden brown with blonde highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sun in for many, many years, and without the sun element to lighten the hair, it usually takes me enough uses to go through an entire bottle with a hair blow dryer to see the difference.</li>
            <li>Cheers to getting golden blonde!!!</li>
            <li>No heat, no light, no smell, no wearing gloves, and having your boyfriend cringe when you are about to use it because he knows what the bathroom is going to look like, and most of all</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s as if the sun naturally colored my hair while I was out doing natural outdoorsy stuff, which is exactly how I think hair coloring should look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;RESULTS- My hair has lightened about 2 shades, not counting the multiple golden highlights.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and it came out almost straw colored, easy to color over,  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product and I&#x27;m confident that you wont be disappointed with it...</li>
            <li>I pay attention to getting the gel to my roots so that the new hair is lightened as it grows in.</li>
            <li>Both friends and my mother have commented on the new color without being prompted.</li>
            <li>I think the smell dissipates after a while (or maybe I got used to it), but it&#x27;s not so strong that someone sitting next to you would smell it (only if they&#x27;re directly sniffing your hair).</li>
            <li>Like many of you, I was blond as a child and my hair would practically turn white when I spent my summers outdoors.</li>
            <li>And as I grew older it turned naturally mousy brown.</li>
            <li>I have deep conditioned each time after usage, which I think is important because hydrogen peroxide is essentially bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was stunned to see how much lighter my dark hair got in such a short time.</li>
            <li>People sometimes think I&#x27;am Irish which is funny</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and in a week, it has gradually gotten lighter and lighter to a light brown with caramel highlights...</li>
            <li>My hair has turned a dark auburn color already, and under my hair where I have not dyed has changed a light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first got this product last summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been pretty terrified to damage it with those kinds of chemicals... emotionally attached, if you will.</li>
            <li>It would completely strip my hair to light almost white ash blonde if I kept using it if that is your goal.  </li>
            <li>Which I lived in Los Angeles at the time where the water is pretty gross so after 6 weeks it was looking orange.</li>
            <li>It made my hair a little frizzy when it was in, but when I washed and conditioned my hair after, it was fine.</li>
            <li>No stiff hair.</li>
            <li>My hair naturally has some of those colors in it, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my hair for being so soft and shiny, so I have no worries about drying out my hair.</li>
            <li>If you do your whole head every time you need to touch up your roots you&#x27;re hair will just get lighter and lighter and not stay the same color.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t intending to go that blonde, so take note that it works very well</li>
            <li>My advise would be to stay far away from this.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>I did not want to go from my old hair color to highlighted over night</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old self.</li>
            <li>ive had this almost 3 years and it can be used for the ombre effect or for natural highlights.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t dye my hair, I have natural highlights from sun.</li>
            <li>Frequent use could affect your hair irreversibly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with it, considering that I was warned by other reviews of its possible effects on curls, but know that you&#x27;ve been warned as well.</li>
            <li>Right now my hair looks as if I&#x27;ve spent the summer out in the sun with natural highlights.</li>
            <li>I have naturally dark blonde hair now (from very light blonde as a child)</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>The first time he tried it, he put the gel on all over his hair and left it on overnight, even though the back of the bottle says to wash it out and not leave it overnight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much speeding up is really necessary though, because this gel works pretty fast.     </li>
            <li>then just dye it.it also has a bleach smell to it,im sure its not good for your hair.</li>
            <li>It has a golden shade to it now, I might even call it a dark blond.</li>
            <li>I used this until the bottle was gone and my dark brown hair was lightened to a medium golden brown.</li>
            <li>come February with light blonde hair from the summer with dark roots!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a new stylist (obviously) and, in the meantime, decided to give this gel</li>
            <li>However, I find it much easier to section my hair when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li>I just combed the jojoba oil through my hair and after I washed, shampooed, and let it air dry, I found that it made my hair shiny and feel silky, which is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it was the gel, and it was so minor that you can barely tell.</li>
            <li>It did dry the ends of my hair out considerably, so make sure you use a deep conditioner a few times afterwards.  </li>
            <li>My hair is strong, moderately thick, and can get oily and even I needed to add a bit of conditioner to it.</li>
            <li>My current stylist, however, has become lazy and started highlighting only the top layer.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and very hard to find it.</li>
            <li>but the bad reviews of users who had experienced hair loss convinced me to look for something else.</li>
            <li>Easy way to subtly lighten hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not ready to say that I&#x27;ll never get highlights again, but I really like this product and those numbers</li>
            <li>After using the gel for roughly a week, my hair has become much lighter with almost caramel colored highlights.  </li>
            <li>I had dyed \\&quot;natural medium brown\\&quot; hair prior to using this.  </li>
            <li>Naturally my hair is a light-ash brown with blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color might be referred to as &amp;#34;dishwater&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; blonde.  </li>
            <li>It did wonders with my dishwater blonde hair, but kept its shine, making it look natural.</li>
            <li>That said, if you&#x27;re willing to suffer through smelling not great for a while, I promise it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend La Bella for golden shades that are pretty hard to get!</li>
            <li>Not any more - I wet down my hair, rub the gel in and let it dry over night.</li>
            <li>When I was married I made the mistake of dying my hair jet black for my exhusband.</li>
            <li>only other thing I&#x27;d say is definitely condition your hair very well after you&#x27;re finished using the gel and have rinsed it from your hair if you intend to use it frequently or as intensely for a couple of days like I did because it can dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>I naturally have light brown hair, and in less than a week after a few applications, my hair changed from brown to somewhat orange.</li>
            <li>My hair didn&#x27;t dry out and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>I have dark blonde hair that only took 3 applications to get to golden blonde.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think the product would work well on my already color treated hair but worked fast but turned my dark brown hair a coppery color which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair is harder to lift into lighter shades of gold blonde, so I can end up with orange or reddish tones.</li>
            <li>I spent a total of 2-3 hours out in the sun while coming back inside every 30 minutes to wet my hair a little and add more La Bella Lightning gel.</li>
            <li>It turned it into such a lovely blonde, but it was stiff, straw-like, and dead.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT use if you have dark brown hair.. turned my hair red orange completely sucking the natural color out of it.</li>
            <li>I have only used about two tablespoons of this product in 5 applications as my hair is not long</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until then my remedy for this was pile it on thick and nice after washing my hair, and I usually place it in a french  braid because</li>
            <li>The softness is, however, after my hair is already dry (when the gel is just put into wet hair, it feels really sticky).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for someone who wants to gradually lighten their hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a little \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;, this wouldn&#x27;t be it.</li>
            <li>I was blonde as a child, but around high school my hair got to be really dark brown</li>

            <li> so awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like peroxide either.  </li>
            <li> I will use more again during summer months, but...what a bargain!!!</li>
            <li> I then use my hair dryer to speed up the process a bit, and it turns out beautifully.</li>

            <li> Great stuff</li>

            <li> This gel is great.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great for maintenance.</li>
            <li> But over all, it was very effective</li>
            <li> The process is very effective yet gradual.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product, which has allowed my hair to gradually lighten over the course of a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> and now it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with how well this gel works and how incredibly affordable it is!</li>
            <li> So if you are planning on lounging in the sun after putting in this gel, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get the great results even faster!</li>
            <li> For the good price, it is a great product to get for any people who want to lighten their hair during season.</li>
            <li> that will lighten some under bright sunlight.</li>
            <li> I read all the good reviews</li>
            <li> So a good 1/3 of an inch of roots were already showing.     </li>
            <li> I will be stocking up on this stuff - good buy</li>
            <li> This is a good gel.</li>
            <li> but it made my hair so gorgeous, with highlights and</li>
            <li> This is really good.</li>
            <li> and this took a good majority of the copper color out in a couple treatments.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for pulling out the orange color on the bleached ends of my hair and it also fades my hair so nicely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, and gorgeous, and my hair isn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> Great for lightening your locks:)</li>
            <li> I love this gel, works wonders, I hope amazon dont stop selling it!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cover-or go ahead more for me!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this gel, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
            <li> truly great stuff and cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice gradual lightener, and I think being in the sun helps the effect along faster.     </li>
            <li> is my honest review</li>
            <li> Just nice natural-looking highlights.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping to find another kind that works as well without these added chemicals.</li>
            <li> After using it for about 2 months, I have received a very nice light caramel color.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly on my medium brown hair and lets me lighten my hair slowly and with excellent precision.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lightener I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I got this product after a good amount of research on lighteners and reviews about La Bella was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Works good and quickly, wish i could find more.</li>
            <li> This thing is great for anybody who wants to change their hair color.</li>
            <li> I felt that when you stand out in the sunlight after using it to works better from my experience.</li>
            <li> most people think it is.  </li>
            <li> Its quite lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My brother even used it on vacation and looks better than his girlfriend&#x27;s $100 highlights.</li>
            <li> but I took a chance and glad I did.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but it mostly fades through so my hair is not blotchy.</li>
            <li> I plan on using my blow dryer to help lighten the hair more</li>
            <li> just looks like you had a longer vacation! :)</li>
            <li> and I was so glad I did.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap!</li>
            <li> I bought 7 and might get some more to stock.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I do because I look better with it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I do not want my hair to get more lighter and more platinum which I doubt it will lighten my hair like that, though.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with color in my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> IF I HAVE TO BUY MORE</li>
            <li> However, I never used the gel more than two days.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I checked as many online reviews as I could find to make sure this was a product that did what it said it would do AND not turn my hair any shade of orange.    </li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> But I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair recently though, because i am unpatient, and i will use la bella on my roots when they start coming out &lt;3</li>
            <li> but it would cost me much more:)</li>
            <li> Better than using bleach or going to a salon.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t love the way it came out in the salon.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fade, it was more two colors...</li>
            <li> I started putting the gel just above the line in my hair and out to the ends to try and get my hair to have more of a fade than a line which worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> The more you use it the lighter it gets.</li>
            <li> I used this on my roots between touching up my highlights and would get compliments..</li>
            <li> and I was able to get a very bright blonde</li>
            <li> I am delighted to say (no pun intended) that not only does LaBella lift my hair color, but it is also a darn good styling gel.</li>
            <li> It is a very true \\&quot;day at the beach\\&quot; lightener.</li>
            <li> You can decide how light you want your hair by choosing how many times you want to apply the gel.</li>
            <li> I use it nearly every day and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I go part by part, section by section and really use a good amount of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The product made very nice, natural looking, caramel highlights.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That means more for me and my friends, perfect little gift to because these go away for a while.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal!  </li>
            <li> It worked very quickly, 3 treatments made my hair visibly lighter.</li>
            <li> Easy highlitghts.</li>
            <li> I got this because I really wanted to skip paying $80 for professional highlighting, and it has done that perfectly.</li>
            <li> so it might be too strong for some people.   </li>
            <li> The first day, yes, the first day I had very nice caramel highlights.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much amazing.</li>
            <li> Wow, I cannot believe how effective this product is!</li>
            <li> Touching up roots is quick and easy</li>
            <li> loved my new hair color</li>
            <li> However, I did a strand test and it was fine.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, I am very pleased with this product, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is huge.</li>
            <li> After applying it for 2 days I have noticed a huge differnce.</li>
            <li> I liked it,  really did the job.</li>
            <li> About every 2-3 weeks after a shower I cover my scalp and roots with the Light&#x27;ning gel.  </li>
            <li> I had great luck with John Frieda beach blonde</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> What is also nice about the gel is that it doesn&#x27;t stick my hair together so much that it crunches to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair (used to be blond).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found such an effective product for such great price!   </li>
            <li> I have never written a review before - so you should know this product is worth the effort :)&lt;</li>
            <li> If you have undyed hair then this will be FANTASTIC on your hair.</li>
            <li> The smell was light and even then it didn&#x27;t stay around.</li>
            <li> No longer made, but this stuff was fantastic for lightening your hair where you want to.</li>
            <li> My hair color is ash brown, between light and medium, closer to medium.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in search of a good replacement that can lighten hair at home and not destroy it.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted it &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it, so we turned to the good old interweb to find it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any drying of my hair, but my hair is really healthy and using this gel has to better on my hair than going to have the ends bleached every 3 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very handy that this is a gel, because I can pull my hair back and use this product to hold it in place during my exercise.  </li>
            <li> I saw a change in my hair color immediately after the first use, and as I kept going my hair got more and more golden.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair an amazing golden color - totally believable and I&#x27;ve had a TON of people ask if its natural -</li>
            <li> I worked immediately my co-workers made complitments when they noticed the golden brown color in my hair!</li>
            <li> Great value for the amount received, AND it really looks like natural highlights/lightener!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many positive things about this product.</li>
            <li> if I tried to use it before going to work or something, but it&#x27;s great for outdoor sports, going to the beach, or other situations where you can enjoy the sun.  </li>
            <li> if you kind of think about what your hair does when it fades in the summer, that&#x27;s pretty much what this does.</li>
            <li> The one thing that surprised/disappointed me is that it kind of blended in my natural highlights, so they aren&#x27;t as visible.</li>
            <li> I tried to lighten them more, and maybe I&#x27;ll try again, but they are already really blond.</li>
            <li> It will last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> Cheap long lasting products are priceless, but these are cheap.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> La Bella Lightning Gel does lift hair color gradually -- very gradually in my case, and that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the gel to work a bit faster, but I am pleased with the results, especially because my hair is still healthy and the price is so cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with spray-in sun lighteners, but reached a point where I don&#x27;t get much time outside (full time work and full time school, I&#x27;m always at my computer!).</li>
            <li> I tried it first indoors, without the sun, using a blow dryer and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> you want a quick hair color change</li>
            <li> And since the change is somewhat gradual (the more you put on the faster it will work, and i put globs of gel on the strands-which is why it began to show in only 2 days), you can feel in control of how dramatic/subtle the end result will be! :)</li>
            <li> I get gorgeous highlights in the summer, but wanted to lighten my hair to a golden blonde with dying it.</li>
            <li> When going blonde, keep in mind that the best season to do it is spring/summer because the sun will help you immensely to achieve a desirable color.</li>
            <li> when I would go back to the salon to get more highlights my hair looked even better than before when I wouldn&#x27;t pre-lighten..</li>
            <li> SO THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT VERY KEEPING MY HAIR BLONDE</li>
            <li> I originally found this at drugstore.com, but then found it here on Amazon which, of course, offers FREE SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> It not only works, but for those of us who are either trying for a more natural lightning or sun-kissed look to our hair, or those of us who are just not ready to go drastically lighter too quickly, this product is perfect!</li>
            <li> I wish this kind of thing would happen more often \\&quot;the secret product that works better than the brand.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and have gotten great results and lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Oh well, it was worth a try</li>
            <li> I ended up with too light hair painted on top and solid brown hair underneath - the skunk look.  </li>
            <li> My hair still feels touchable and soft, but just in case, every time I was I make sure to use a lot of conditioner.</li>
            <li> The first generation of John Frieda&#x27;s lightening products for blondes were pretty good, but they&#x27;re probably never coming back, so I&#x27;ll be using this gel from now on.    </li>
            <li> Because I used it repeatedly, and in different places, it resulted in all-over brightness and nice dimension and it doesn&#x27;t look like it came from a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item has some very positive ratings, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I used this product rather intensely for two days and have had significant lightning of my mouse brown hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably buy more bottles, but I have still have plenty left right now!</li>
            <li> I have been using La Bella Lightning Gel for a little over a week now and the results are spectacular!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, and am pleased to say my results match the general consensus.</li>
            <li> I used this product and it actually lighten my hair in more like golden blond which I am aiming to get.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy and natural without too much copper tint.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li> I have used the product a total of 4 times over a 10 day period, and my hair is now a very light golden/coppery brown.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s pretty sweet and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> I should probably preface my review by saying that my natural hair is a light, drab brown.  </li>
            <li> I probably use this product different than most ladies.  </li>
            <li> Its not a fake platinum or brassy tone.  </li>
            <li> The gel formula allows me to target exactly the areas I want without getting the gel on areas I don&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this gel would work, so I only applied it to select strands of damp hair first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I am back to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> well it looks cute when I take it out the next morning</li>
            <li> does exactly what I wanted: gradually and discreetly lighten my locks without damaging them.</li>
            <li> But this stuff really, really, really works!</li>
            <li> It does change your color fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments for my hair, and my boyfriend says that my hair is so much more blonde now that he doesn&#x27;t immediately recognize me when he sees me.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first use, my hair was noticeably lighter, but not brassy like the sun-in results.</li>
            <li> My hair was healthy prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed its effect after 2 or 3 days and the lightening continued gradually.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s diffcult to find a product that actually fits it&#x27;s price, and even more so to find one that exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a gel, you know exactly where it&#x27;s going</li>
            <li> i tested strands from my brush first to see what color my hair would change.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most similar alternative to this product would probably be Sun-In gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times and am thrilled with my natural looking results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got some nice natural undertones, but it&#x27;s kinda mousy without extra help.  </li>
            <li> So far I still have almost the full bottle since I stop using it, not because I dont like it</li>
            <li> It changed from kind of orange to dark blond on each application.   </li>
            <li> I also fallowed these treatments with a deep conditioning treatment, just to be safe, since the main ingredient is hydrogen peroxide, it&#x27;s not the gentlest stuff.</li>
            <li> I just put a little on my hair and a lot on my roots, I love the color!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased as it not only lightens, but works as a styling gel ....</li>
            <li> Half of you who even read this are not going to get this bottle to test it out either because it says, \\&quot;I was purchased at the dollar store and am just the kind of product that would do something</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t get it mixed up with the hubs normal hair gel. :)</li>
            <li> Plus sun exposure now lightens my hair a little more quickly</li>
            <li> Normally, they really stand out, but this stuff lightened the rest of my hair so well that the highlights aren&#x27;t as striking (not really a big deal)</li>
            <li> My dark hair is blending much better with the lighter sections now and the overall look is much more pleasing to me.  </li>
            <li> However after deep conditioning treatment its fine</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who wants lighter hair without having to dye it!</li>
            <li> The gel is easy to use, and can make your hair feel stiff and gritty, but it looked nice when I styled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering that the bottle is huge, this is enough for me for my lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do hair &amp;#34;sections&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34;, I do the whole head.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It was for my son who used to have very blond hair, but it has darkened over the years.  </li>
            <li> I really could see no difference at all.    </li>
            <li> This took no more effort than a leave-in conditioner and my hair is very healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 4 days straight...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle but efficient hair lightener, this is it.</li>
            <li> I have great gold shades (I applied different amounts on different parts to have several tones).   </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t want to dilute the product too much) and apply the product all over.</li>
            <li> It really changed my hair color.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling like cheap doll hair.</li>
            <li> BEFORE SUMMERS THANKS YOU AGAIN</li>
            <li> The bottle says not recommended for African American hair, but I am African American and it worked perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> I have light to medium brown hair with quite a bit of red  (naturally occurring) and this lightens even without blow drying or going outside if used consistently...works much better than the spray-</li>
            <li> A 2009 research shows that aging hair turns gray because it builds up too much hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you could really create an ombre from scratch with this</li>
            <li> Not beach blonde, mind you, but definitely a nice blonde shade.</li>
            <li> I repeated next day, and after two applications I&#x27;m done, I have the most natural highlights (see pics).</li>
            <li> Very rarely in life do we come across cheap products that work better than the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It literally works like a charm and lightens hair significantly even after only one day&#x27;s use!    </li>
            <li> I like I use it 8 hours a day every other Sunday, or more at the roots if they begin to show through.</li>
            <li> also when I wanted a new color overall, it switched my haircolor to a nice brown overall.</li>
            <li> As some previous reviewer said \\&quot;it is rare when something cheap works\\&quot; but this product does.</li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another hair lightning product as long as this one is still available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve highlighted my hair for years and am willing to pay whatever it takes for natural looking highlights that go all the way through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to keep applying the gel to the same strands, and after only 2 days i noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> so I made sure to get deep conditioning treatments at my local salon to keep my hair in shape.</li>
            <li> I was very blonde as a young child, but over the years my hair has darkened to a light, somewhat mousy brown.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> In sum, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I apply it all over to lighten it a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I should note also that you have to be careful to get the gel on your roots and evenly dispersed through the hair, because fixes unevenness or uneven roots is tough when the hair is significantly lightened (and the feel of globs of gel on your scalp isn&#x27;t the most pleasant feeling, but when the gel dries it&#x27;s not noticeable).    </li>
            <li> As far as damage, I didn&#x27;t really notice any.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much to go too far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just one application of this gel I could already notice the difference and now my hair is golden brown with blonde highlights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sun in for many, many years, and without the sun element to lighten the hair, it usually takes me enough uses to go through an entire bottle with a hair blow dryer to see the difference.</li>
            <li> Cheers to getting golden blonde!!!</li>
            <li> No heat, no light, no smell, no wearing gloves, and having your boyfriend cringe when you are about to use it because he knows what the bathroom is going to look like, and most of all</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s as if the sun naturally colored my hair while I was out doing natural outdoorsy stuff, which is exactly how I think hair coloring should look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;RESULTS- My hair has lightened about 2 shades, not counting the multiple golden highlights.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and it came out almost straw colored, easy to color over,  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product and I&#x27;m confident that you wont be disappointed with it...</li>
            <li> I pay attention to getting the gel to my roots so that the new hair is lightened as it grows in.</li>
            <li> Both friends and my mother have commented on the new color without being prompted.</li>
            <li> I think the smell dissipates after a while (or maybe I got used to it), but it&#x27;s not so strong that someone sitting next to you would smell it (only if they&#x27;re directly sniffing your hair).</li>
            <li> Like many of you, I was blond as a child and my hair would practically turn white when I spent my summers outdoors.</li>
            <li> And as I grew older it turned naturally mousy brown.</li>
            <li> I have deep conditioned each time after usage, which I think is important because hydrogen peroxide is essentially bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was stunned to see how much lighter my dark hair got in such a short time.</li>
            <li> People sometimes think I&#x27;am Irish which is funny</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and in a week, it has gradually gotten lighter and lighter to a light brown with caramel highlights...</li>
            <li> My hair has turned a dark auburn color already, and under my hair where I have not dyed has changed a light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first got this product last summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pretty terrified to damage it with those kinds of chemicals... emotionally attached, if you will.</li>
            <li> It would completely strip my hair to light almost white ash blonde if I kept using it if that is your goal.  </li>
            <li> Which I lived in Los Angeles at the time where the water is pretty gross so after 6 weeks it was looking orange.</li>
            <li> It made my hair a little frizzy when it was in, but when I washed and conditioned my hair after, it was fine.</li>
            <li> No stiff hair.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally has some of those colors in it, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my hair for being so soft and shiny, so I have no worries about drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> If you do your whole head every time you need to touch up your roots you&#x27;re hair will just get lighter and lighter and not stay the same color.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t intending to go that blonde, so take note that it works very well</li>
            <li> My advise would be to stay far away from this.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> I did not want to go from my old hair color to highlighted over night</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s old self.</li>
            <li> ive had this almost 3 years and it can be used for the ombre effect or for natural highlights.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dye my hair, I have natural highlights from sun.</li>
            <li> Frequent use could affect your hair irreversibly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with it, considering that I was warned by other reviews of its possible effects on curls, but know that you&#x27;ve been warned as well.</li>
            <li> Right now my hair looks as if I&#x27;ve spent the summer out in the sun with natural highlights.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark blonde hair now (from very light blonde as a child)</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> The first time he tried it, he put the gel on all over his hair and left it on overnight, even though the back of the bottle says to wash it out and not leave it overnight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much speeding up is really necessary though, because this gel works pretty fast.     </li>
            <li> then just dye it.it also has a bleach smell to it,im sure its not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> It has a golden shade to it now, I might even call it a dark blond.</li>
            <li> I used this until the bottle was gone and my dark brown hair was lightened to a medium golden brown.</li>
            <li> come February with light blonde hair from the summer with dark roots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new stylist (obviously) and, in the meantime, decided to give this gel</li>
            <li> However, I find it much easier to section my hair when it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> I just combed the jojoba oil through my hair and after I washed, shampooed, and let it air dry, I found that it made my hair shiny and feel silky, which is very nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think it was the gel, and it was so minor that you can barely tell.</li>
            <li> It did dry the ends of my hair out considerably, so make sure you use a deep conditioner a few times afterwards.  </li>
            <li> My hair is strong, moderately thick, and can get oily and even I needed to add a bit of conditioner to it.</li>
            <li> My current stylist, however, has become lazy and started highlighting only the top layer.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and very hard to find it.</li>
            <li> but the bad reviews of users who had experienced hair loss convinced me to look for something else.</li>
            <li> Easy way to subtly lighten hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to say that I&#x27;ll never get highlights again, but I really like this product and those numbers</li>
            <li> After using the gel for roughly a week, my hair has become much lighter with almost caramel colored highlights.  </li>
            <li> I had dyed \\&quot;natural medium brown\\&quot; hair prior to using this.  </li>
            <li> Naturally my hair is a light-ash brown with blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color might be referred to as &amp;#34;dishwater&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; blonde.  </li>
            <li> It did wonders with my dishwater blonde hair, but kept its shine, making it look natural.</li>
            <li> That said, if you&#x27;re willing to suffer through smelling not great for a while, I promise it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend La Bella for golden shades that are pretty hard to get!</li>
            <li> Not any more - I wet down my hair, rub the gel in and let it dry over night.</li>
            <li> When I was married I made the mistake of dying my hair jet black for my exhusband.</li>
            <li> only other thing I&#x27;d say is definitely condition your hair very well after you&#x27;re finished using the gel and have rinsed it from your hair if you intend to use it frequently or as intensely for a couple of days like I did because it can dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> I naturally have light brown hair, and in less than a week after a few applications, my hair changed from brown to somewhat orange.</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t dry out and looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair that only took 3 applications to get to golden blonde.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think the product would work well on my already color treated hair but worked fast but turned my dark brown hair a coppery color which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair is harder to lift into lighter shades of gold blonde, so I can end up with orange or reddish tones.</li>
            <li> I spent a total of 2-3 hours out in the sun while coming back inside every 30 minutes to wet my hair a little and add more La Bella Lightning gel.</li>
            <li> It turned it into such a lovely blonde, but it was stiff, straw-like, and dead.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT use if you have dark brown hair.. turned my hair red orange completely sucking the natural color out of it.</li>
            <li> I have only used about two tablespoons of this product in 5 applications as my hair is not long</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until then my remedy for this was pile it on thick and nice after washing my hair, and I usually place it in a french  braid because</li>
            <li> The softness is, however, after my hair is already dry (when the gel is just put into wet hair, it feels really sticky).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for someone who wants to gradually lighten their hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a little \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;, this wouldn&#x27;t be it.</li>
            <li> I was blonde as a child, but around high school my hair got to be really dark brown</li>
            <li> After tying toners, and purple shampoos which only neutralize the orange color for a few days I decided to look in to lightening gels and this was the only one with decent reviews.</li>
            <li> I have naturally drab brown hair - not dark, not light,</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, dark enough to look black unless I am in the sun or under a light.  </li>
            <li> I looked like a junior high kid trying to bleach his dark brown hair!</li>
            <li> The bottle is big and will last a long time, but I&#x27;m ordering a spare now since summer is coming.</li>
            <li> I have natural dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I applied the gel to parts of my hair and then flat ironed it.</li>
            <li> Doing the method I described above will definitely make your hair very dry though.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is naturally a medium brown color and use this to lighten it slightly.</li>
            <li> It just can dry your hair out after daily use</li>
            <li> Before that it was brown, I get bored of my brown hair easily.</li>
            <li> It does dry your hair though and obviously damages it.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I put this gel to a comb, and brushed my dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair grows about an inch a month (SO fast, it drives me crazy) and when I notice the darker roots coming in, I just apply the product to my roots and it fixes it right up.</li>
            <li> I did salon highlights as well and likely spent thousands.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I had dyed my natural dark brown/soft black hair to a neutral light-ish brown color about 4 weeks prior to use.</li>
            <li> As long as this product is avalable I will be purchasing!</li>
            <li> and I have very long hair..</li>
            <li> After a shampoo, just put the gel in your hair (I work it into the roots with my fingers and hands and then comb out to the ends), and leave on to dry.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t brittle, but it was definitely dry and got a lot of split ends</li>
            <li> If your hair gets dry, it&#x27;s just holding the color</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I did make brake three days between each appliance because it makes my hairs dry.</li>
            <li> , I brush it through with a comb and then blow dry it and go about my day.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few years, it really did destroy my hair.  </li>
            <li> Now about once a month I&#x27;ve been putting it all over my wet hair focusing on what areas are dark, generally underneath my hair where the sun doesn&#x27;t fade it</li>
            <li> I have used this around 5 times in a variety of ways, and my bottle is now almost empty  because I have put on a large amount each time on my hair, which is about 4 inches past my shoulders and average thickness.</li>
            <li> I went from dark brown to strawberry blonde in 4 days.</li>
            <li> I have medium blonde hair that lightens in the summer and gets dark in the winter.</li>
            <li> It took 3 uses for my roots to go from from dark brown to platinum blonde.</li>
            <li> my hair turned into a dark to medium blonde...</li>
            <li> Which for anyone who has sensitive skin like me, avoiding sunlight is usually recommended.</li>
            <li> I have dark blonde hair that I keep lightened, with the silver/gray highlights that I don&#x27;t want to cover up.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 yo guy in Atlanta with dark strawberry/ash blonde hair and despise the way the sun lightens my hair in spring.  </li>
            <li> I think if someone already has  base red pigments in their hair this product may turn it even more on the red side?  </li>
            <li> give it a try you wont be sorry as long as you rinse it out daily and test your strands from a brush or comb first.</li>
            <li> The only color-altering product I had used in the past was sun-in just for the summertime and that gave me \\&quot;okay\\&quot; results... definitely brought out the reddish tint in my hair but nothing drastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and still have nearly half of the bottle left.  </li>
            <li> This product will strip your hair color no doubt about it, the bottle is large and will last a long time, unless you strip your hair often, and that is unlikely.</li>
            <li> The only thing is you need to be especially careful with the undersides and back of your hair - the back can be very hard to reach and you might have dark streaks in the back of it, or underneath your hair, if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> The second time I used the La Bella Lightning Gel, I added a little jojoba oil about an hour before I planned to wash the lightning gel out of my hair and it helped keep my hair from drying out.</li>
            <li> It brings out the natural highlights of your hair without making it dull like bleaching would.  </li>
            <li> I started with dirty blonde curly hair that was much closer to brunette than blonde (never color treated before).</li>
            <li> And my blonde friend got a few streaks on her hair.</li>
            <li> so she put a few chunky, too white stripes in the bottom layer.  </li>
            <li> a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to apply the gel to wet hair then style (because it&#x27;s a styling gel as well as a lightener).  </li>
            <li> have to say that I have only used this for two days, the ends of my hair that have been dyed continuously are having trouble fading</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not much of a hair gel person when it comes to day-to-day styling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, you should be careful about hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 22 years old with very long, naturally dark brown hair - almost black - that I have never used dye on in the past (not for coloring or highlighting).</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve sectioned my hair and applied the product to the roots and dark sections of my dry hair at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> After only a few days, I have caramel strands in my DARK brown hair.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely satisfactory both in price and in quality.</li>
            <li> ALSO I HAVE OTHER FRIENDS AND FAMILILY</li>
            <li> Do be very careful and heed the warning.</li>
            <li> A few reviewers have complained about hair dryness and gel odor, but the gel has not dried out my hair</li>
            <li> I have applied the gel and sat outside for a few hours twice, applied and kept in on for a few hours while inside, and slept with it in my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint -</li>
            <li> I have medium dark brown hair and added highlights to face frame my face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care to color it dark.  </li>
            <li> After I washed my hair, I applied the gel again to the dark sections before styling.  </li>
            <li> By the waym, I hear that Sun-In doesn&#x27;t work for brunettes (turns hair red/orange), so all you girls with dark brown hair looking for some lightening-</li>
            <li> I did find while watching my hair the water had run a dark gray color.</li>
            <li> worked on my dyed hair as well to take the too dark brown to a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 bottles cause my hair is long and dyed, plus I&#x27;m very impatient.</li>
            <li> I may even try the lightning gel to take it down another shade or two soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been getting professional highlights, but this is expensive and limited</li>
            <li> and when I wake up in the morning I brush my hair and blow it dry and style it as usual.  </li>
            <li> (I have dark brown hair, almost black.</li>
            <li> The color it brought out was gold, with a slight orange/red tint.</li>
            <li> and I have it out and are battling while the hour and a half of sweating and heat induced color spritzes my face.</li>
            <li> I use it, I slightly dampen my hair (not too soaked -</li>
            <li> And i was always dying my hair pitch black.</li>
            <li> My black hair truned to brown clair after 3 times usage of this gel...</li>
            <li> I assumed at first that the gel had just made my hair really dirty, but after drying my hair I found my hair to become even lighter, and I believe it was the hair dye leaving my hair like an exorcism.</li>
            <li> about 22 1/2 inches long and incredibly thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long and the bottle I have has lasted me 2 months of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde but have to use lighteners to keep my hair from going to that mousy blonde color we all hate.</li>
            <li> If you have long hair this and have used this than you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I have to say that it does smell a little rancid in the hair</li>
            <li> That little spray bottle</li>
            <li> so it got on my skin and burnt it a little.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit apprehensive about buying this product because of the hydrogen peroxide, but my results speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You apply little, your hair changes a little.</li>
            <li> If you are a brunette and desperately want blonde hair without going to a salon or worrying about turning your hair orange, then I would definitely recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> doesnt really have a smell and can be done with a blow dryer on a cold day.</li>
            <li> Miraculously, after I washed, shampooed, and dried my hair</li>
            <li> and I have to say that my hair is already a few shades lighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but kinda crappy.  </li>
            <li> : usually it&#x27;s only a few thin strands of much-brighter hair amongst the mousy</li>
            <li> And the gel lightened it to a brown no more pitch black.</li>
            <li> really pale</li>
            <li> For a dramatic difference, i only used it twice a day under a lot of sun.</li>
            <li> After 23 years, I was tired of getting highlights (my hair grows fast), and wanted an easier and less expensive way to lighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this before but had a difficult time finding it locally.  </li>
            <li> I also prefer to sleep on a towel or an old cloth because I am afraid that it will bleach the pillowcases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually lighten my hair during summer.</li>
            <li> ; when the volume was low and since the vacuum was broken it became impossible to get the rest out.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to keep away from skin</li>
            <li> but rather to save some when my hair begins to change back to brown considering that this Lightning Gel is very hard to find!!</li>
            <li> Been using it for at least a year now, using it once every 2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> and this allowed that slow lightening to happen.  </li>
            <li> like I had my hair done by a ridiculously over priced salonist streaking my hair.</li>
            <li> This crap (with a s) completely fried my hair.  </li>
            <li> I really hate the idea of coloring my hair because I don&#x27;t want to contend with roots or become &amp;#34;dependent&amp;#34; on a colorist to keep it looking natural as my hair grows.  </li>
            <li> this tends to lift the color to what your natural base is so</li>
            <li> I was afraid of dying my hair, or using other products like Sun</li>
            <li> (I confused the smell of my hair with the smell of someone&#x27;s feet, so it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell).</li>
            <li> I was tired of being told I look like the girl from the grudge</li>
            <li> and I have fairly thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with how i recieved the gel.</li>
            <li> It works but after a while you do get the brassy look on your hair, not as bad as with other products like sun in though</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time and it doesn&#x27;t look fake at all.</li>
            <li> $150 for lousy salon highlights vs. $4.00 for a bottle of lightning gel?  </li>
            <li> In the winter with no sun to lighten my darker roots, I start to look silly</li>
            <li> and  responded VERY poorly to heat.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to bleach it because if I did that I could end up with a scary orange head for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally dirty blond hair with gold highlights in the front.</li>
            <li> I have medium blond hair, which you could call dirty blond.</li>
            <li> My hair darkrned to dirty blond in the winters.</li>
            <li> and I hate to call it</li>
            <li> I hate when my roots become visible</li>
            <li> and I absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> It also smells terrible!!</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t horrible.</li>
            <li> so disgusted with the outcome that tlas of today they still sit in the box</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This thing is great for anybody who wants to change their hair color. I naturally have light brown hair, and in less than a week after a few applications, my hair changed from brown to somewhat orange. People sometimes think I&#x27;am Irish which is funny but I like the look. And my blonde friend got a few streaks on her hair. I felt that when you stand out in the sunlight after using it to works better from my experience. So far I still have almost the full bottle since I stop using it, not because I dont like it but rather to save some when my hair begins to change back to brown considering that this Lightning Gel is very hard to find!!</li>
            <li> I have used this before but had a difficult time finding it locally.  Easy way to subtly lighten hair.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product because it made my hair orange!!!!!!! I thought it was going to turn my hair to a blondish color but it turned it into orange. I read all the good reviews and I thought it was gonna do the job but it didn&#x27;t so i had to shave my head.</li>
            <li> this works as described for sure.it takes a lot of applications though.if you want a quick hair color change then just dye it.it also has a bleach smell to it,im sure its not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dirty blond hair with gold highlights in the front. This product worked well for me. It worked very quickly, 3 treatments made my hair visibly lighter. The color it brought out was gold, with a slight orange/red tint. My hair naturally has some of those colors in it, so I don&#x27;t really think it was the gel, and it was so minor that you can barely tell. The one thing that surprised/disappointed me is that it kind of blended in my natural highlights, so they aren&#x27;t as visible. Normally, they really stand out, but this stuff lightened the rest of my hair so well that the highlights aren&#x27;t as striking (not really a big deal) I tried to lighten them more, and maybe I&#x27;ll try again, but they are already really blond. As far as damage, I didn&#x27;t really notice any. It made my hair a little frizzy when it was in, but when I washed and conditioned my hair after, it was fine. I also fallowed these treatments with a deep conditioning treatment, just to be safe, since the main ingredient is hydrogen peroxide, it&#x27;s not the gentlest stuff. But over all, it was very effective</li>
            <li> This worked so well for me just using it over 4 days. I just put a little on my hair and a lot on my roots, I love the color! I&#x27;m never going to the salon for highlights again.</li>
            <li> I liked it,  really did the job. loved my new hair color ;). What it does is makes your hair lighten up, I&#x27;m brunette and my hair turned auburn. But it takes time to change mine took a day to notice that it changed but after u want the desired color it stays on and u notice that ur hair is growing and put some lightning gel on roots and it changes also, I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I should probably preface my review by saying that my natural hair is a light, drab brown.  I used Sun-In for years, but it just never gave the lightening I wanted.  I did salon highlights as well and likely spent thousands.  I originally found this at drugstore.com, but then found it here on Amazon which, of course, offers FREE SHIPPING!  I probably use this product different than most ladies.  I don&#x27;t do hair &amp;#34;sections&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34;, I do the whole head.  About every 2-3 weeks after a shower I cover my scalp and roots with the Light&#x27;ning gel.  I go part by part, section by section and really use a good amount of this stuff.  I try to do this in the evenings and go to bed with my hair in a bun and when I wake up in the morning I brush my hair and blow it dry and style it as usual.  It gives my hair an amazing golden color - totally believable and I&#x27;ve had a TON of people ask if its natural - most people think it is.  Its not a fake platinum or brassy tone.  Its quite lovely.  I love this stuff.  My only complaint - and I hate to call it that - is that I&#x27;ve had 2 bottles recently that &amp;#34;cracked&amp;#34; when the volume was low and since the vacuum was broken it became impossible to get the rest out.  Not a huge deal, but kinda crappy.  Update:  After using this product for a few years, it really did destroy my hair.  It turned it into such a lovely blonde, but it was stiff, straw-like, and dead.  I ended up having to cut close to 11&amp;#34; off and start over.  Broke my heart.  I&#x27;m still in search of a good replacement that can lighten hair at home and not destroy it.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says.  I have medium dark brown hair and added highlights to face frame my face.  The product made very nice, natural looking, caramel highlights.  It did not turn my hair red or brassy looking as some have posted.  I think if someone already has  base red pigments in their hair this product may turn it even more on the red side?  Overall, I am very pleased as it not only lightens, but works as a styling gel ....wondering if anyone has had experience on gray hair regrowth?  Was wondering if this product can delay my trips to the salon for touch ups? Please post if you have any suggestions!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and in a week, it has gradually gotten lighter and lighter to a light brown with caramel highlights...I get compliments all the time and it doesn&#x27;t look fake at all. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wow, I cannot believe how effective this product is! It literally works like a charm and lightens hair significantly even after only one day&#x27;s use!    Now, the bottle specifically says that it is not intended for use on chemically treated hair. However, I did a strand test and it was fine. In fact, I had dyed my natural dark brown/soft black hair to a neutral light-ish brown color about 4 weeks prior to use. So a good 1/3 of an inch of roots were already showing.     Anyway, I applied a generous amount of gel after dampening my hair. It was about 75 degrees Fahrenheit outside--perfect for getting sunlight. I spent a total of 2-3 hours out in the sun while coming back inside every 30 minutes to wet my hair a little and add more La Bella Lightning gel. Miraculously, after I washed, shampooed, and dried my hair I noticed that my roots actually matched the color of the rest of my hair!     Honestly, I was stunned to see how much lighter my dark hair got in such a short time. Not to mention the fact that I&#x27;ll never have to dye my hair again! This product is extremely satisfactory both in price and in quality. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants lighter hair without having to dye it!</li>
            <li> Having a salt-and-pepper beard in my 60s I don&#x27;t care to color it dark.  La Bella gel works well to lighten the \\&quot;pepper\\&quot; even though the directions say it&#x27;s not recommended for course hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always nervous about putting stuff on my midium blond hair, but wanted a sun streaked look without an entire dye job.    This did the trick in 3-4 uses. Do be very careful and heed the warning. It does contain hydrogen peroxide and should be washed out each day.    But my hair feels and looks great. My brother even used it on vacation and looks better than his girlfriend&#x27;s $100 highlights.</li>
            <li> Finally lightened my hair! For a dramatic difference, i only used it twice a day under a lot of sun. I went from dark brown to strawberry blonde in 4 days.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, works wonders, I hope amazon dont stop selling it! I brought this gel last summer and I am a woman of color which it says \\&quot;Not recommended for Woman of color\\&quot; but I took a chance and glad I did. I worked immediately my co-workers made complitments when they noticed the golden brown color in my hair!</li>
            <li> This item has some very positive ratings, so I gave it a try.  It was for my son who used to have very blond hair, but it has darkened over the years.  The first time he tried it, he put the gel on all over his hair and left it on overnight, even though the back of the bottle says to wash it out and not leave it overnight.  Didn&#x27;t matter though, because there was no change in his hair color.    We thought maybe it has to be used over a period of time to see results, so he tried it 2 or 3 times, after he washed his hair.  I really could see no difference at all.    As a hair gel, it works okay I guess.  But as a hair lightener, it did not work on my son&#x27;s hair.  Oh well, it was worth a try and it didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with how well this gel works and how incredibly affordable it is! I have medium blonde hair that lightens in the summer and gets dark in the winter. It looks like I have roots come December because my summer hair has begun to grow in and it drives me nuts! I had great luck with John Frieda beach blonde but they discontinued it. I&#x27;ve been using Sun-In in the meantime but just don&#x27;t get the blonde I&#x27;m looking for...enter LaBella! I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times and am thrilled with my natural looking results. Not a trace of damage either! Great stuff I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally drab brown hair - not dark, not light, just blah.  I&#x27;ve highlighted my hair for years and am willing to pay whatever it takes for natural looking highlights that go all the way through my hair.  My current stylist, however, has become lazy and started highlighting only the top layer.  I ended up with too light hair painted on top and solid brown hair underneath - the skunk look.  On my last visit, I asked the stylist to give me highlights all the way through ... so she put a few chunky, too white stripes in the bottom layer.  Yuck!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a new stylist (obviously) and, in the meantime, decided to give this gel a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to apply the gel to wet hair then style (because it&#x27;s a styling gel as well as a lightener).  However, I find it much easier to section my hair when it&#x27;s dry.  So, I&#x27;ve sectioned my hair and applied the product to the roots and dark sections of my dry hair at bedtime.  I&#x27;ve slept with the gel in my hair and washed my hair in the morning.  After I washed my hair, I applied the gel again to the dark sections before styling.  The gel formula allows me to target exactly the areas I want without getting the gel on areas I don&#x27;t want.  I used the gel twice a day for seven days and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.  The product lightens the hair gradually, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about any drastic results.  Because my hair is brown, the sections I&#x27;ve applied the gel to have lightened to a coppery tone.  My dark hair is blending much better with the lighter sections now and the overall look is much more pleasing to me.  A few reviewers have complained about hair dryness and gel odor, but the gel has not dried out my hair and I cannot discern any noticeable odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seven days of twice daily use I used about 1/3 of a bottle.  I plan to use the remainder of the bottle for root maintenance.  I think the bottle will last quite a while.  Not a bad deal!  $150 for lousy salon highlights vs. $4.00 for a bottle of lightning gel?  Hmmm ... I&#x27;m not ready to say that I&#x27;ll never get highlights again, but I really like this product and those numbers definitely get my attention!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this gel would work, so I only applied it to select strands of damp hair first. I made sure to keep applying the gel to the same strands, and after only 2 days i noticed a difference! Now it&#x27;s been a week (i applied almost every day, maybe 4 days out of 7) and there&#x27;s a definite difference! You can apply this gel all over to lighten your hair, or on select strands for highlights. After only a few days, I have caramel strands in my DARK brown hair. (I have dark brown hair, almost black. This stuff WORKS.) It&#x27;s amazing, and gorgeous, and my hair isn&#x27;t damaged. Also, I didn&#x27;t even sit out in the sun at all.     So if you are planning on lounging in the sun after putting in this gel, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get the great results even faster! By the waym, I hear that Sun-In doesn&#x27;t work for brunettes (turns hair red/orange), so all you girls with dark brown hair looking for some lightening- try this! I feel like it was a great deal. Also, the bottle is huge. It will last a good amount of time. And since the change is somewhat gradual (the more you put on the faster it will work, and i put globs of gel on the strands-which is why it began to show in only 2 days), you can feel in control of how dramatic/subtle the end result will be! :)</li>
            <li> When I was married I made the mistake of dying my hair jet black for my exhusband. For four years. I was afraid to bleach it because if I did that I could end up with a scary orange head for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really pale and I have very long hair.. about 22 1/2 inches long and incredibly thick. I was tired of being told I look like the girl from the grudge everytime I brushed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give La Bella a try as opposed to sun in - which I do plan to use later after it lightens. The process is very effective yet gradual. I have to say that I was quite impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I have only used this for two days, the ends of my hair that have been dyed continuously are having trouble fading but it mostly fades through so my hair is not blotchy. I actually like it. My hair has turned a dark auburn color already, and under my hair where I have not dyed has changed a light brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind this is not to say that I look like a giraffe at all but rather like I had my hair done by a ridiculously over priced salonist streaking my hair. I did find while watching my hair the water had run a dark gray color. I assumed at first that the gel had just made my hair really dirty, but after drying my hair I found my hair to become even lighter, and I believe it was the hair dye leaving my hair like an exorcism. (Darkness... be gone..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, what I&#x27;m trying to say is that I am back to buy more soon. The product works and it is wonderful. I plan on using my blow dryer to help lighten the hair more but I have yet to try this. I intend to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until then my remedy for this was pile it on thick and nice after washing my hair, and I usually place it in a french  braid because.. well it looks cute when I take it out the next morning and it&#x27;s the only hair style I know. I also prefer to sleep on a towel or an old cloth because I am afraid that it will bleach the pillowcases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s pretty sweet and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a week and I have to say that my hair is already a few shades lighter.&lt;br /&gt;As a child I used to have blonde hair that got darker and duller over the years.&lt;br /&gt;After just one application of this gel I could already notice the difference and now my hair is golden brown with blonde highlights.&lt;br /&gt;It does exactly what I wanted: gradually and discreetly lighten my locks without damaging them.</li>
            <li> My hair is dark brown, dark enough to look black unless I am in the sun or under a light.  After using the gel for roughly a week, my hair has become much lighter with almost caramel colored highlights.  I left it in when I went on hikes so I was also getting some sun.  Overall, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things. I had been a fan of John Freida&#x27;s beach blonde and have been looking for years to find a replacement. This is it! It is a very true \\&quot;day at the beach\\&quot; lightener. It looks sunkissed - not orange, and each day you use it -  just looks like you had a longer vacation! :)</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I am SO happy with this product! I no longer need to go to my hairdresser for color or highlights. I have dark blonde hair that only took 3 applications to get to golden blonde. After a shampoo, just put the gel in your hair (I work it into the roots with my fingers and hands and then comb out to the ends), and leave on to dry. No grease. No stiff hair. No mess. No rinsing! Inexpensive!! The bottle is big and will last a long time, but I&#x27;m ordering a spare now since summer is coming. This took no more effort than a leave-in conditioner and my hair is very healthy and shiny. This product is the best!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  It brings out the natural highlights of your hair without making it dull like bleaching would.  Hair remains shiny and it doesn&#x27;t wash out or fade.  You can decide how light you want your hair by choosing how many times you want to apply the gel.</li>
            <li> This lightning gel works like described and lightened my hair where i placed it. Buy it if you want lightened hair for summer or whenever.</li>
            <li> I had dyed \\&quot;natural medium brown\\&quot; hair prior to using this.  I have used the product a total of 4 times over a 10 day period, and my hair is now a very light golden/coppery brown.  It appears I have reached a plateau and my hair won&#x27;t go any lighter, as the last two times I&#x27;ve used it I have not noticed a difference.  It did dry the ends of my hair out considerably, so make sure you use a deep conditioner a few times afterwards.  I would recommend this for someone who wants to gradually lighten their hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for something with a little \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;, this wouldn&#x27;t be it.</li>
            <li> Great for lightening your locks:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel since almost forever and I absolutely love it! It hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair at all and I have fairly thin hair. Also, my hair is naturally a medium brown color and use this to lighten it slightly. I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my hair for being so soft and shiny, so I have no worries about drying out my hair. I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different though, so it might be too strong for some people.   Every time you use it, however, your hair will get lighter, so I suggest once you get your desired color, only touch up your roots. If you do your whole head every time you need to touch up your roots you&#x27;re hair will just get lighter and lighter and not stay the same color. I&#x27;ve tried reaching platinum blonde with this and I was able to get a very bright blonde but it was a bit brassy. I would suggest a toner after if you&#x27;re trying to achieve platinum blonde hair color. Overall, this is a great product and I&#x27;m confident that you wont be disappointed with it... it&#x27;s a great bleach alternative. One bottle lasts me several months!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. I&#x27;ve been using Sun in for many, many years, and without the sun element to lighten the hair, it usually takes me enough uses to go through an entire bottle with a hair blow dryer to see the difference. But this stuff really, really, really works! In the winter with no sun to lighten my darker roots, I start to look silly come February with light blonde hair from the summer with dark roots! Not any more - I wet down my hair, rub the gel in and let it dry over night. It took 3 uses for my roots to go from from dark brown to platinum blonde. I wasn&#x27;t intending to go that blonde, so take note that it works very well and it doesn&#x27;t take much to go too far. I will be stocking up on this stuff - good buy $100 hair do&#x27;s at the salon!</li>
            <li> This product will strip your hair color no doubt about it, the bottle is large and will last a long time, unless you strip your hair often, and that is unlikely. I have dark brown hair and it came out almost straw colored, easy to color over,  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Naturally my hair is a light-ash brown with blonde highlights. I used this product for about 4 days straight...my hair turned into a dark to medium blonde...look at Dorothea Barth Jorgensen&#x27;s hair color for reference. Once a week I use it only at my roots to touch up. As long as this product is avalable I will be purchasing!</li>
            <li> This is a good gel. With that in mind, i have blonde hair. It is not white and not even close to brown. I used this product to lighten my hair during the winter. It turned my blonde hair an orange tint.. I looked like a junior high kid trying to bleach his dark brown hair! It also smells terrible!! You can smell the bleach in the product!! I would not recommend this unless you dont mind the smell and use alot of it.. It does change your color fast! I must not have used enough!</li>
            <li> I first got this product last summer. I was blonde as a child, but around high school my hair got to be really dark brown and I absolutely hated it. I was afraid of dying my hair, or using other products like Sun-In that might make my hair orange, but I finally decided to buy this product and I was so glad I did. Within three weeks of constant use (I overdid this product - I coated my head 5 days a week, 8 hours a day, for 3 weeks) and now my hair is blonde. Not beach blonde, mind you, but definitely a nice blonde shade. This definitely takes some maintenance - now that I have the color I like I use it 8 hours a day every other Sunday, or more at the roots if they begin to show through. The only thing is you need to be especially careful with the undersides and back of your hair - the back can be very hard to reach and you might have dark streaks in the back of it, or underneath your hair, if you&#x27;re not careful. Doing the method I described above will definitely make your hair very dry though. My hair wasn&#x27;t brittle, but it was definitely dry and got a lot of split ends so I made sure to get deep conditioning treatments at my local salon to keep my hair in shape. If you are a brunette and desperately want blonde hair without going to a salon or worrying about turning your hair orange, then I would definitely recommend this product to you.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use if you have dark brown hair.. turned my hair red orange completely sucking the natural color out of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using La Bella Lightning Gel for a little over a week now and the results are spectacular! I started with dirty blonde curly hair that was much closer to brunette than blonde (never color treated before). I saw a change in my hair color immediately after the first use, and as I kept going my hair got more and more golden. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments for my hair, and my boyfriend says that my hair is so much more blonde now that he doesn&#x27;t immediately recognize me when he sees me. I would definitely recommend it!    I have to say that it does smell a little rancid in the hair (I confused the smell of my hair with the smell of someone&#x27;s feet, so it&#x27;s not a pleasant smell). I think the smell dissipates after a while (or maybe I got used to it), but it&#x27;s not so strong that someone sitting next to you would smell it (only if they&#x27;re directly sniffing your hair). That said, if you&#x27;re willing to suffer through smelling not great for a while, I promise it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s a nice gradual lightener, and I think being in the sun helps the effect along faster.     What is also nice about the gel is that it doesn&#x27;t stick my hair together so much that it crunches to the touch. My hair still feels touchable and soft, but just in case, every time I was I make sure to use a lot of conditioner. The softness is, however, after my hair is already dry (when the gel is just put into wet hair, it feels really sticky). I should note also that you have to be careful to get the gel on your roots and evenly dispersed through the hair, because fixes unevenness or uneven roots is tough when the hair is significantly lightened (and the feel of globs of gel on your scalp isn&#x27;t the most pleasant feeling, but when the gel dries it&#x27;s not noticeable).    I haven&#x27;t tried blowing out or straightening my hair with a straightening iron in terms of whether that speeds up the lightening, but my expectation is that it probably would. I&#x27;m not sure how much speeding up is really necessary though, because this gel works pretty fast.     In sum, I highly recommend it. If you&#x27;re looking for a gentle but efficient hair lightener, this is it. It won&#x27;t ruin your hair, but it will definitely brighten it! Cheers to getting golden blonde!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product after a good amount of research on lighteners and reviews about La Bella was pretty good.  I have light brown hair (used to be blond). I tried it first indoors, without the sun, using a blow dryer and it worked fine. It changed from kind of orange to dark blond on each application.   However, I applied it on my hair on the beach for a while and now it looks amazing! I have great gold shades (I applied different amounts on different parts to have several tones).   I have people on the streets asking me who my hairdresser is! I can&#x27;t believe I found such an effective product for such great price!   It just can dry your hair out after daily use but I put lots of conditioner after shower to balance the moisture.     I totally recommend La Bella for golden shades that are pretty hard to get!</li>
            <li> I used this over the course of a couple months and, while it lightened my hair as expected, it also somehow straightened my naturally curly hair. I&#x27;m fine with it, considering that I was warned by other reviews of its possible effects on curls, but know that you&#x27;ve been warned as well.</li>
            <li> Very rarely in life do we come across cheap products that work better than the expensive ones. This one is frankly considered even lower than store brand but don&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover-or go ahead more for me! This product works and doesn&#x27;t harm you hair. If your hair gets dry, it&#x27;s just holding the color and you will see that proof later when you wash and condition your hair. Any drier? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheer Go Blonder has the same effect but using the Go Blonder is an event! If you have long hair this and have used this than you know what I mean. That little spray bottle and I have it out and are battling while the hour and a half of sweating and heat induced color spritzes my face. Yummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This entails: No heat, no light, no smell, no wearing gloves, and having your boyfriend cringe when you are about to use it because he knows what the bathroom is going to look like, and most of all it&#x27;s cheap! Half of you who even read this are not going to get this bottle to test it out either because it says, \\&quot;I was purchased at the dollar store and am just the kind of product that would do something girls cry over in the movies.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That means more for me and my friends, perfect little gift to because these go away for a while. I bought 7 and might get some more to stock. Cheap long lasting products are priceless, but these are cheap. I wish this kind of thing would happen more often \\&quot;the secret product that works better than the brand.\\&quot; La Bella Lightening sounds like a horses name you wouldn&#x27;t bet on but I am glad I do because I look better with it.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before - so you should know this product is worth the effort :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 22 years old with very long, naturally dark brown hair - almost black - that I have never used dye on in the past (not for coloring or highlighting). I&#x27;ve always been pretty terrified to damage it with those kinds of chemicals... emotionally attached, if you will. ;) The only color-altering product I had used in the past was sun-in just for the summertime and that gave me \\&quot;okay\\&quot; results... definitely brought out the reddish tint in my hair but nothing drastic. I somehow stumbled upon La Bella&#x27;s Lightning Gel, researched it to exhaustion, and finally gave in to purchase a bottle from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my honest review: I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another hair lightning product as long as this one is still available. I LOVE it. The first use, my hair was noticeably lighter, but not brassy like the sun-in results. After using it for about 2 months, I have received a very nice light caramel color. My hair grows about an inch a month (SO fast, it drives me crazy) and when I notice the darker roots coming in, I just apply the product to my roots and it fixes it right up. Then I apply it all over to lighten it a little bit more. LOVE it. I actually think my hair is softer after using it, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use it, I slightly dampen my hair (not too soaked - don&#x27;t want to dilute the product too much) and apply the product all over. I then use my hair dryer to speed up the process a bit, and it turns out beautifully. My hair is thick and long and the bottle I have has lasted me 2 months of use (i&#x27;m getting towards the bottom now). However, I am currently purchasing the 3-bottle shipment. Never want to run out of this stuff, it is truly great. I would highly recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> It really changed my hair color. I actually slept with it overnight but it made my hair so gorgeous, with highlights and also when I wanted a new color overall, it switched my haircolor to a nice brown overall.</li>
            <li> I have medium blond hair, which you could call dirty blond. I used this product and it actually lighten my hair in more like golden blond which I am aiming to get. I do not want my hair to get more lighter and more platinum which I doubt it will lighten my hair like that, though. I am satisfied with color in my hair. I usually lighten my hair during summer. For the good price, it is a great product to get for any people who want to lighten their hair during season. I will continue purchasing it when I need it.</li>
            <li> This crap (with a s) completely fried my hair.  I had 12-13 inches of hair and practically all of it broke off.It left my hair feeling like cheap doll hair.My hair became rubber band like and  responded VERY poorly to heat.My hair was healthy prior to using this product.  I am still recovering from it.  My advise would be to stay far away from this.  Either go to the salon or try a box kit.</li>
            <li> I WOULD LIKE TO BUY 3 OF THIS I HAVE BEING USING IT  FOR OVER 30 YEARS I LOVE LOVE IT LOVE IT I HOPE YOU BRING IT BACK ALSO I HAVE OTHER FRIENDS AND FAMILILY WOULD LIKE TO ORDER AS WELL THANK YOU IF I HAVE TO BUY MORE I CAN YO LET ME KNOW L I JUST HOPE IT COMES BACK. BEFORE SUMMERS THANKS YOU AGAIN</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and have gotten great results and lots of compliments. The bottle says not recommended for African American hair, but I am African American and it worked perfectly for me.  However, I never used the gel more than two days. I would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I checked as many online reviews as I could find to make sure this was a product that did what it said it would do AND not turn my hair any shade of orange.    I have naturally dark blonde hair now (from very light blonde as a child) that will lighten some under bright sunlight. After 23 years, I was tired of getting highlights (my hair grows fast), and wanted an easier and less expensive way to lighten my hair. I believe I have found the product I was looking for.    La Bella Lightning Gel does lift hair color gradually -- very gradually in my case, and that&#x27;s okay. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair is harder to lift into lighter shades of gold blonde, so I can end up with orange or reddish tones. Sun-In and all its versions can do this. The first generation of John Frieda&#x27;s lightening products for blondes were pretty good, but they&#x27;re probably never coming back, so I&#x27;ll be using this gel from now on.    Plus sun exposure now lightens my hair a little more quickly that I&#x27;ve used this product. I hope LaBella continues to make it and amazon.com always will offer it.</li>
            <li> The gel does lighten your hair, even the gray. Been using it for at least a year now, using it once every 2 weeks or so. Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair red. Before that it was brown, I get bored of my brown hair easily. I had dyed it before then too though. The La Bella worked GREAT on my roots. If you have undyed hair then this will be FANTASTIC on your hair. It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair at all. The smell was light and even then it didn&#x27;t stay around. I loaded in my hair. I bought 3 bottles cause my hair is long and dyed, plus I&#x27;m very impatient. But I LOVE THIS. I bleached my hair recently though, because i am unpatient, and i will use la bella on my roots when they start coming out &lt;3</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and very hard to find it. They use to sell in kmart but haven&#x27;t in years. Works good and quickly, wish i could find more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde but have to use lighteners to keep my hair from going to that mousy blonde color we all hate. I&#x27;ve had good luck with spray-in sun lighteners, but reached a point where I don&#x27;t get much time outside (full time work and full time school, I&#x27;m always at my computer!). I tried LaBella because it does not require sun or a hair dryer to lift the color. I first noticed its effect after 2 or 3 days and the lightening continued gradually. I pay attention to getting the gel to my roots so that the new hair is lightened as it grows in. I am delighted to say (no pun intended) that not only does LaBella lift my hair color, but it is also a darn good styling gel. I use it nearly every day and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s diffcult to find a product that actually fits it&#x27;s price, and even more so to find one that exceeds expectations. La Bella Lightning Gel did this for me. I read the reviews, and am pleased to say my results match the general consensus. Like many of you, I was blond as a child and my hair would practically turn white when I spent my summers outdoors. My hair darkrned to dirty blond in the winters. And as I grew older it turned naturally mousy brown. I used this product rather intensely for two days and have had significant lightning of my mouse brown hair. It has a golden shade to it now, I might even call it a dark blond. I may even try the lightning gel to take it down another shade or two soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many positive things about this product. It not only works, but for those of us who are either trying for a more natural lightning or sun-kissed look to our hair, or those of us who are just not ready to go drastically lighter too quickly, this product is perfect! Right now my hair looks as if I&#x27;ve spent the summer out in the sun with natural highlights. I didn&#x27;t even spend a moment out in the sun while using this product! Which for anyone who has sensitive skin like me, avoiding sunlight is usually recommended. The gel is easy to use, and can make your hair feel stiff and gritty, but it looked nice when I styled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I&#x27;d say is definitely condition your hair very well after you&#x27;re finished using the gel and have rinsed it from your hair if you intend to use it frequently or as intensely for a couple of days like I did because it can dry your hair out. My hair is strong, moderately thick, and can get oily and even I needed to add a bit of conditioner to it. The second time I used the La Bella Lightning Gel, I added a little jojoba oil about an hour before I planned to wash the lightning gel out of my hair and it helped keep my hair from drying out. I just combed the jojoba oil through my hair and after I washed, shampooed, and let it air dry, I found that it made my hair shiny and feel silky, which is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a terrific product and I will definitely be using again. I&#x27;ll probably buy more bottles, but I have still have plenty left right now!</li>
            <li> As some previous reviewer said \\&quot;it is rare when something cheap works\\&quot; but this product does. I have ash color hairs and blond highlights . I hate when my roots become visible but I don&#x27;t like to spend $100 just to make my roots so I was looking for something what help me between my hairstylist visits. I used this product twice. I kept is through the night and wash it in the morning. I did make brake three days between each appliance because it makes my hairs dry. However after deep conditioning treatment its fine and I know that if I would do my highlights in hair salon I would have to do conditioning too but it would cost me much more:)</li>
            <li> it definitely lightens! worked on my dyed hair as well to take the too dark brown to a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> After applying it for 2 days I have noticed a huge differnce. And i was always dying my hair pitch black. And the gel lightened it to a brown no more pitch black. so awesome. Better than using bleach or going to a salon. Now i can color my hair whatever lighter color i want. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works. My wife wanted it &amp; couldn&#x27;t find it, so we turned to the good old interweb to find it and we did! She has used the product for years &amp; loves it &amp; still loves it.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work but it&#x27;s hard to keep away from skin and my skin is sensitive so it got on my skin and burnt it a little.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color might be referred to as &amp;#34;dishwater&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; blonde.  It&#x27;s got some nice natural undertones, but it&#x27;s kinda mousy without extra help.  I really hate the idea of coloring my hair because I don&#x27;t want to contend with roots or become &amp;#34;dependent&amp;#34; on a colorist to keep it looking natural as my hair grows.  I have been getting professional highlights, but this is expensive and limited: usually it&#x27;s only a few thin strands of much-brighter hair amongst the mousy backdrop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this La Bella Lightning Gel when I&#x27;d go out rollerblading around the local lakes and trails.  It&#x27;s very handy that this is a gel, because I can pull my hair back and use this product to hold it in place during my exercise.  Because I used it repeatedly, and in different places, it resulted in all-over brightness and nice dimension and it doesn&#x27;t look like it came from a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as if the sun naturally colored my hair while I was out doing natural outdoorsy stuff, which is exactly how I think hair coloring should look.  This product just let me give it a boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not much of a hair gel person when it comes to day-to-day styling.  I would find this too &#x27;crusty&#x27; if I tried to use it before going to work or something, but it&#x27;s great for outdoor sports, going to the beach, or other situations where you can enjoy the sun.  Because it&#x27;s a gel, you know exactly where it&#x27;s going and you can control where does its work.</li>
            <li> This is really good. My black hair truned to brown clair after 3 times usage of this gel... Over all great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is just what I was looknig for.  I have medium blonde hair and it lightens it a couple of shades where I apply it.  Easy highlitghts.</li>
            <li> It works but after a while you do get the brassy look on your hair, not as bad as with other products like sun in though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the sprays. This was the cream of the crop.  I even called the company to complain. Guess I was in a minority fan club!</li>
            <li> Put it on my roots for two days every 4-6 weeks.  Keeps my roots lightened.  I have dark blonde hair that I keep lightened, with the silver/gray highlights that I don&#x27;t want to cover up.</li>
            <li> This gel works as it claims. I have natural dark brown hair. I applied the gel to parts of my hair and then flat ironed it. By 2nd application, I could see the hair was lighter. I haven&#x27;t used the gel for a while, but those parts of my hair are still visibly lighter. It does dry your hair though and obviously damages it. ( If you are a brunette, it will make your hair color a shade of amber/copper).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year and still have nearly half of the bottle left.  It works perfectly on my medium brown hair and lets me lighten my hair slowly and with excellent precision. I did not want to go from my old hair color to highlighted over night (ie, I did not want everybody to know I was highlighting my hair) and this allowed that slow lightening to happen.  It has not damaged my hair at all. I use the same conditioner that I used before this. No additional split ends, or flyaway hairs. No difference in the texture of my hair at all. Just nice natural-looking highlights.  I got this because I really wanted to skip paying $80 for professional highlighting, and it has done that perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lightener I have ever used.  I am a 40 yo guy in Atlanta with dark strawberry/ash blonde hair and despise the way the sun lightens my hair in spring.  As the ash blonde lightens faster than the strawberry I get lots of copper highlights turning me into a Ginger and this took a good majority of the copper color out in a couple treatments.  My hair didn&#x27;t dry out and looks very natural.  I have only used about two tablespoons of this product in 5 applications as my hair is not long and I will not need it again unless I see it getting too strawberry.  This is the best product I have ever used, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like peroxide either.  It would completely strip my hair to light almost white ash blonde if I kept using it if that is your goal.  My hair looks healthy and natural without too much copper tint.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product, which has allowed my hair to gradually lighten over the course of a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> BACKGROUND INFO- I was very blonde as a young child, but over the years my hair has darkened to a light, somewhat mousy brown.  I get gorgeous highlights in the summer, but wanted to lighten my hair to a golden blonde with dying it. I considered buying the [[ASIN:B004DK7DVC John Frieda Sheer Blonde Go Blonder Controlled Lightening Spray, 3.5 Ounce]] but the bad reviews of users who had experienced hair loss convinced me to look for something else. I was a little bit apprehensive about buying this product because of the hydrogen peroxide, but my results speak for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USAGE- I have used this around 5 times in a variety of ways, and my bottle is now almost empty  because I have put on a large amount each time on my hair, which is about 4 inches past my shoulders and average thickness. I have applied the gel and sat outside for a few hours twice, applied and kept in on for a few hours while inside, and slept with it in my hair. I would have thought sitting in the sun with the gel in my hair would have caused it to process faster but I did not notice a big difference in results between sitting in the sun and sitting inside with this gel.  Everytime I have washed it out immediately after the period of having it in my hair. The gel made my hair rather crunchy while it was in it, but after washing it out my hair was back to it&#x27;s old self. I have deep conditioned each time after usage, which I think is important because hydrogen peroxide is essentially bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS- My hair has lightened about 2 shades, not counting the multiple golden highlights. Both friends and my mother have commented on the new color without being prompted. I was expecting the gel to work a bit faster, but I am pleased with the results, especially because my hair is still healthy and the price is so cheap. I just ordered another bottle. In conclusion, I am very pleased with this product, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great value for the amount received, AND it really looks like natural highlights/lightener!  I only use about once every two weeks during winter months and once or twice a week during Spring/Summer.  I have light to medium brown hair with quite a bit of red  (naturally occurring) and this lightens even without blow drying or going outside if used consistently...works much better than the spray-in I used on and off for several years.  I cannot speak for how well this would work with colored/highlighted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/03/12&lt;br /&gt;I still have 3/4 of this last bottle left!!  I will use more again during summer months, but...what a bargain!!!</li>
            <li> No longer made, but this stuff was fantastic for lightening your hair where you want to. Just don&#x27;t get it mixed up with the hubs normal hair gel. :)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think the product would work well on my already color treated hair but worked fast but turned my dark brown hair a coppery color which I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair and this has given me blonde highlights around my face. It hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair. It has parabens in it which I do not like and I&#x27;m hoping to find another kind that works as well without these added chemicals.</li>
            <li> faster than using honey or chamomile tea or lemon juice. doesnt really have a smell and can be done with a blow dryer on a cold day. i tested strands from my brush first to see what color my hair would change. also great if you dont wanna bleach your hair before dying it. ive had this almost 3 years and it can be used for the ombre effect or for natural highlights. give it a try you wont be sorry as long as you rinse it out daily and test your strands from a brush or comb first. truly great stuff and cheap.</li>
            <li> This gel is great. I bought it a year ago to lighten my hair, and I used it again this year to lighten the roots that grew out. Worked like a charm and I keep getting compliments on my hair color. Love this gel, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
            <li> It definitely does what it says... You apply little, your hair changes a little. Just watch out though, if you do apply lots of it, it will definitely bring out the shine, lighter side of your hair. Works like a charm. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I used this until the bottle was gone and my dark brown hair was lightened to a medium golden brown. People definitely noticed a difference. I was hoping for a lighter color. Didn&#x27;t notice any damage.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. It did wonders with my dishwater blonde hair, but kept its shine, making it look natural. Touching up roots is quick and easy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dye my hair, I have natural highlights from sun. My hair color is ash brown, between light and medium, closer to medium. In the morning, I put this gel to a comb, and brushed my dry hair. Then I used the blow dryer for a couple of minutes. I washed at night. The first day, yes, the first day I had very nice caramel highlights. I repeated next day, and after two applications I&#x27;m done, I have the most natural highlights (see pics). Considering that the bottle is huge, this is enough for me for my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you should be careful about hydrogen peroxide. A 2009 research shows that aging hair turns gray because it builds up too much hydrogen peroxide. Frequent use could affect your hair irreversibly.</li>
            <li> I had brunette hair, and using this gel generously with the John Frieda Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner turned me blonde over 1 month in summer 2012. When going blonde, keep in mind that the best season to do it is spring/summer because the sun will help you immensely to achieve a desirable color. Since winter has come, it has turned brassy so I&#x27;m using John Frieda Go Blonder Tone Correcting shampoo and conditioner thrice a week and it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, La Bella discontinued this product even before the company was sold to Newhall Laboratories, its corporate buyer. It seems that it was discontinued within the last 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most similar alternative to this product would probably be Sun-In gel.</li>
            <li> I had my deep brown hair ombre-d and I didn&#x27;t love the way it came out in the salon. It didn&#x27;t fade, it was more two colors... but it wasn&#x27;t horrible. There&#x27;s no need to have your roots done with an ombre so I didn&#x27;t want to have to keep going in to the salon to get it redyed each time it turned orangey (how blonde tends to look on brunettes after time). Which I lived in Los Angeles at the time where the water is pretty gross so after 6 weeks it was looking orange. After tying toners, and purple shampoos which only neutralize the orange color for a few days I decided to look in to lightening gels and this was the only one with decent reviews. It&#x27;s pretty much amazing. It&#x27;s great for pulling out the orange color on the bleached ends of my hair and it also fades my hair so nicely. I started putting the gel just above the line in my hair and out to the ends to try and get my hair to have more of a fade than a line which worked perfectly! Now about once a month I&#x27;ve been putting it all over my wet hair focusing on what areas are dark, generally underneath my hair where the sun doesn&#x27;t fade it, I brush it through with a comb and then blow dry it and go about my day. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to have it dyed in the salon to maintain my ombre anymore, which saves me massive amounts of money. I don&#x27;t think you could really create an ombre from scratch with this but it&#x27;s great for maintenance. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any drying of my hair, but my hair is really healthy and using this gel has to better on my hair than going to have the ends bleached every 3 months. Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh this tends to lift the color to what your natural base is so if you kind of think about what your hair does when it fades in the summer, that&#x27;s pretty much what this does. The more you use it the lighter it gets.</li>
            <li> your hair might turn out brassy.. it did for me, but this was healthier than lightening my hair at once.. mix it with something hydrating like serum, oil or creme if you don&#x27;t want your hair to turn into a witch&#x27;s broom.. I used this on my roots between touching up my highlights and would get compliments.. when I would go back to the salon to get more highlights my hair looked even better than before when I wouldn&#x27;t pre-lighten..</li>
            <li> This product will help you accomplish the sun kissed hair affect. It&#x27;s gel, so it does not run - essy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with how i recieved the gel. When i opened the box the product was all over the box, and as i picked up one of he bottles..it burned my hand and i had a white rash on my hand for the rest of the day. Im so disgusted with the outcome that tlas of today they still sit in the box As i refuse to touch it again</li>
            <li> i WEAR MY HAIR VERY SHORT SO THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT VERY KEEPING MY HAIR BLONDE EVEN AT MYADVANCED AGE OF 78.</li>
