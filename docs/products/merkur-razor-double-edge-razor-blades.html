            <li>Good price,work great...</li>
            <li>I do love my Merkur razor though :D</li>
            <li>There are much better items on the market, and it&#x27;d be best to do some searching before settling on these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For safety razor blades, the best from Japan, Russia, and India are much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>Good blade.</li>
            <li>I used 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5+1 blades for 20 years before I realized that all I needed was 1 good blade.  </li>
            <li>If you need a good blade man up and buy Feather.  </li>
            <li>Good quality product,</li>
            <li>One razor is good for about a month so 10 blades?</li>
            <li>Had one years ago and remembered how good it worked.</li>
            <li>It snagged and nicked me and just didn&#x27;t give me a good shave like my Feather blades.</li>
            <li>I have had good results with blades maufactured by Merkur, Feather, and Gilette 7 O&#x27;clock.</li>
            <li>They work good</li>
            <li>These are good for a noob but don&#x27;t give quite as close shave as the feather blades</li>
            <li>Good value if you like safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li>Good quality blades at a good price.</li>
            <li>A good product.  </li>
            <li>Disposable razors and even supposedly good razors with replaceable blades couldn&#x27;t even come close.  </li>
            <li>All Good</li>
            <li>I found these razors weren&#x27;t as good as the feather</li>
            <li>Gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>A good choice that I will continue to make.</li>
            <li>Durable good blade.  </li>
            <li>Good bargain.</li>
            <li>Along with the razor device itself, these blades are superior.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a shave this good in years.</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>Best razor blades I&#x27;ve used gives me a baby smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It was good for the things i had to use it for</li>
            <li>so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Superior construction.  </li>
            <li>It feels good to have located this razor.</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t had any problems with these causing irritation for him except when his face was sunburned, even though he has fairly sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth cut and best of all no nicks or cuts .</li>
            <li>These provide a wonderful smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li>good razors.  </li>
            <li>Razors good for a week usage (6X)</li>
            <li>These blades give me a good shave, but it tugs a lot on my hair, causing a substantial amount of irritation.</li>
            <li>My understanding was that they would be good for 3-5 shaves</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>] bucks on a razor, splurge and get the good blades.</li>
            <li>Good blade</li>
            <li>UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the Feathers for about 3 weeks now and although they&#x27;re good</li>
            <li>Good blades for the price</li>
            <li>Does deliver a close shave so that part is good</li>
            <li>Good blades.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>try others to see what is a good match.</li>
            <li>I thought Murker made good blades.</li>
            <li>These razors seemed to perform just as good as any others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>He loved it all.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re particularly good blades, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try others, since a scar from surgery on my throat makes double-edge shaving impractical.</li>
            <li>This is a high-quality blade and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>~5 good shaves from 1 blade.  </li>
            <li>Fair blades.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Feather blades.</li>
            <li>Exceptional.</li>
            <li>good quality  nice gift with a good razor</li>
            <li>shipped quick and arrived in excellent shape.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the shave.  </li>
            <li>They are worth experimenting with, but not the best blade out there.</li>
            <li>These blades help make shaving a very enjoyable experience for me.</li>
            <li>The shave from these razors is very smooth!</li>
            <li>love this great quality</li>
            <li>The packaging is great and the fact that they are made in Germany makes me feel much better about the quality.</li>
            <li>While the Merkur blades are really good, they certainly aren&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li>For fun, I conducted my own consumer test on a variety of blades to see which provided (A) the best shave and (B) lasted the longest.</li>
            <li>I find like most others using a good silver tip badger brush , pre shave oil and a good shave cream also helps.</li>
            <li>I bought the product first time 2 years ago and they are great ever!</li>
            <li>Not any more!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>The best choice seems pretty self-evident to this reviewer.</li>
            <li>My favorite blades!  </li>
            <li>And I love his face after he shaves with it- nice!</li>
            <li>I really love this blade and will always keep it in my rotation!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love these blades!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Merkur blades since the first one installed with the razor.</li>
            <li>I love the Merkur-Razor Blades!</li>
            <li>First set of blades after changing over from a multi blade cartrige and I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>Love the shave!</li>
            <li>razor is outstanding!</li>
            <li>I am sure he will use these blades from now on!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to Feathers from now on!</li>
            <li>They are good quality and do a great job of giving me a clean cut shave.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blade are great if you break out easy or get razor bumps.</li>
            <li>Great price and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, these are still a good blade, but not nearly the best that I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li>This product was absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>The price for the quality was amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the sharpness.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that I was paying $7.50 for 10 blades, so this was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>That price is more than fair for the quality of these blades.  </li>
            <li>These give a nice cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaves skin more than hair..not a good quality..will throw away and go mack to mach 3</li>
            <li>They shave nicely and don&#x27;t take off any flesh</li>
            <li>Provides a nice shave with ample durability.  </li>
            <li>Each face and safety razor will have it&#x27;s own blade.  </li>
            <li>These are good blades, but not my top choice.</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for the great customer experience!</li>
            <li>I never know what kind of blades to buy.</li>
            <li>From reading, this is where merkur comes from, and the city is known for making the best straight edge razors.</li>
            <li>If I have any kind of stubble, they don&#x27;t do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I found I still get a closer shave with my electric razor.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May try another Merkur as it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li>Packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice blades, provide a nice shave too.</li>
            <li>The absolute best shaving razor blade ever!!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone thinking about doing any kind of shaving.</li>
            <li>High quality and great materials makes a blade that gives a great shave every time.  </li>
            <li>perfect blade for a high end razor.</li>
            <li>(You know the Germans always make good stuff right? :p)</li>
            <li>I prefer a mild, smooth shave and Merkur is one of the three blades I use and the best of the three.</li>
            <li>If you are new get a sampler of blades and see what works best for you.</li>
            <li>are a great and cheap option that in my opinion ends up much better for the consumer and the environment.</li>
            <li>Fits your hand very easily.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and change blades</li>
            <li>Good blade for price and shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li>It makes it so easy and much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>The blade is very good to my skin and it is very forgiving if you get sloppy/careless in your technique in shaving.  </li>
            <li>I own and love my Merkur Razor.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!!</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>By far the cheapest and best shave I have had.</li>
            <li>These razors are great , awesome quality and much cheaper than buying a modern razor.</li>
            <li>Wonderful choice of blade that offers up a level of skin protection that some others don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these for most guys ,but use a good pre-shave oil and a light amount of shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had much better success with Feather, Astro, and recently happy with Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock SharpEdge.</li>
            <li>Good and Clean shave, the blades do no nick, cut or anything.</li>
            <li>The first blade was great -- sharper than the Personna brand (from Wal-Mart)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the first blade and it works great.  </li>
            <li>As a first time DE shaver, these were great to start with.  </li>
            <li>Not bad but not that good.</li>
            <li>The description posted was very accurate.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;These blades offer a very comfortable shave for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and close shaving when used with Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>provide a very smooth shave</li>
            <li>Some people may find them more suitable to their shaving style, so try several brands and choose the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li>Good quality and reasonably price!!</li>
            <li>but I recall getting better shaves when I 1st started using these.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I need to get better.  </li>
            <li>I hear these blades can be unforgiving, and in a more aggressive razor I would believe it.</li>
            <li>Holds an edge better than feathers.</li>
            <li>After that, most of them never got used.  </li>
            <li>I love these blades.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t get as many shaves out of them as I would like.</li>
            <li>and yet they provide a close shave that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>I love LOVE love</li>
            <li>and I have not shaved with this style razor in many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>These blades were better than the Shark blades I was using before.</li>
            <li>I do not know why America can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t make quality consumer products any more</li>
            <li>Not one face cut and most strokes don&#x27;t have to be repeated and my beard is like wire.</li>
            <li>Will not buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>Best values per shave overall.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to them you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about Merkur&#x27;s great reputation that I knew there must have been a mistake.</li>
            <li>Price was excellent compared to traditional store.</li>
            <li>They may work for some people, but another brand works better for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I remembered to order the blades.</li>
            <li>These bladed work with my face much better</li>
            <li>Would buy more of these though.</li>
            <li>any help would be great thanks.</li>
            <li>I have now started using the Merkur blades and they seem to work better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still better than the mach 3 cartridges I use to buy that were like $8+ for four.  </li>
            <li>but I have found that I like the feather blades better.  </li>
            <li>They are sharper, give a better shave, and hold their edge better than these Merkurs,</li>
            <li>These blades are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Probably the best I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different safety razors</li>
            <li>And, much better than a $45.00 four pack of blades</li>
            <li>What more can one say about razorblades?</li>
            <li>Make sure you.</li>
            <li>Cheap if you ask me!</li>
            <li>These are nice blades, be careful, take your time and they give an excellent shave</li>
            <li>These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>plan to try Feather blades next time, as I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re even sharper, but these are great and you won&#x27;t regret buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting to many cuts on my face</li>
            <li>so you cant ask for more.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they are much better for me than Derbys which are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>At this point I think feather are my favorite</li>
            <li>It could be my whiskers more than the blade</li>
            <li>but I thought I should get more shaves per blade than what I do.</li>
            <li>just nice and smooth close shaves.</li>
            <li>What more do you need out of a razor blade?</li>
            <li>Blades are not included with most razors.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>If you never shave with a DE razor you will have to learn to take your time,but you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>These are way better than what one can buy at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>i feel this blade could be better.</li>
            <li>I found the Astra better based on number of blades.</li>
            <li>They provide an ultra close shave and were shipped promptly, packaged well, and better than advertised.</li>
            <li>use to cut myself more often with thess blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more competative price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>He had forgotten how much better a shave he gets with these~</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>He is considering getting a sampler when he runs out so he can see if sharper or duller is better for him.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the razor blades that I ordered.  </li>
            <li>but I have learned you can get more life out of them by taking apart your razor and drying the parts off.  </li>
            <li>nice and cheap.  </li>
            <li>There are much better blades out there.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s perfect as an outside to</li>
            <li>I get much better results with the no-name blades that CVS sells and Wilkinson Sword sold by Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also platinum coated like Gilette, can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>Six issues was the most I would get out of a blade before it started hacking my face</li>
            <li>These Merkur DE blades seem to be okay.</li>
            <li>These razors work well, but there are better and cheaper options out there for the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely One of the best blades that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still testing different blades and haven&#x27;t settled on which one is going to work best for me.  </li>
            <li>I believe my favorite is another German-made blade, the Wilkinson Sword.  </li>
            <li>Top rate razors.</li>
            <li>and this is the only blade that is flawless after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor is definitely better than some on the market, but not the make or break or razors.</li>
            <li>but wished they lasted more than 2 to 3 shaves.</li>
            <li>And if you can get 5 or more shaves from a FEATHER then that too is a better deal than these blades.  </li>
            <li>You must also spend more time prepping your beard with hotter water if you decide to use the Merkur blades.  </li>
            <li>If you want blades that provide the most shaves per blade, try Astra or Personna Med Prep.  </li>
            <li>He loves it &amp; will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m just one ridiculously handsome man ... ...  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure there may be better out there.</li>
            <li>Wilkinson Sword works much better for me and my razor.</li>
            <li>Love the weight of the razoras well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with my decision and purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve totally changed my opinion of these blades, and think they are GREAT!  </li>
            <li>and I think there are better values out there for the price.  </li>
            <li>Now I will say this - they are more forgiving than the Feather</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I started, as many do, with a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will be better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many others but I will soon and update.</li>
            <li>After so many years of the marketing ploys of 2 blades then 3 now 5 blades for the closest shave.</li>
            <li>I really like these blades, and the cost is great.</li>
            <li>I kid you not, a YEAR or more.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Gives the best shave possible at a way more affordable price than the  fancy razors you buy for $5-$10/each at the market or drug stores.</li>
            <li>but I get better shaves with the Dorco and dollar store blades.</li>
            <li>that is OK with the price I got them for.</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased a Merkur Futur safety razor along with these blades and am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Bought these along side the razor, love that replacing a blade is all that is required.</li>
            <li>I will buy more...</li>
            <li>All of those cost at most $25 to $35 per hundred delivered to your door.  </li>
            <li>While the feathers work a bit better, I find the Merkurs work almost as well in my Merkur 34C HD.</li>
            <li>the more you get used to it the faster you get</li>
            <li>I love the 2 pass BBS shave I get with feathers, the lack of dragging on my neck and lack of irritation.</li>
            <li>Double Edge Razor Blades are the best.</li>
            <li>But I willno longer pay top dollar for Merkurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is great, shipping was fast, and they arrived in appropriate packaging.</li>
            <li>I tried these blades in my Merkur 43C and really love them.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>For the price, there are better blades.</li>
            <li>I feel that there are much better options for the price;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with these</li>
            <li>Worked much better with the Derby extras.  </li>
            <li>He has had many cuts on his head and thinking of returning.</li>
            <li>Even though my technique isn&#x27;t very refined, I&#x27;m yet to cut myself and I&#x27;m getting great shaves with them.</li>
            <li>You can even flip them over and use them a couple more times</li>
            <li>Worth a try though, good blade to learn technique.</li>
            <li>Great blades they came fast</li>
            <li>Good blades, not as sharp as Gillette or Feather, but still a good blade and a good value.  </li>
            <li>Combine these blades with a nice Merkur handle, some good shaving cream, and a decent badger hair brush</li>
            <li>Although my Merkur Safety Razor came with its original blade, I changed it today and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>The Merkurs are FAR superior!</li>
            <li>Great price for blades and they seems to do a decent job shaving.</li>
            <li>These razor blades work great with my Merkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li>Blades are ultra high quality and are a great price.</li>
            <li>High quality and great value.</li>
            <li>Merkur double edge blades are in my opinion the best on the market - their staying power is incredible lasting shave after shave - couple these blades with the Merkur razor and you have a winning combination .</li>
            <li>Its been good and consistent since then.</li>
            <li>These are very nice, high quality blades.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a point of reference in order to compare them to other blades but they fit perfectly into my Merkur safety razor and give me a nice shave.</li>
            <li>the quality of these bladed proves it!!</li>
            <li>These blades work great and came with my new Merkur Razor.  </li>
            <li>I feel as though I&#x27;ve experienced a dullness from newly installed razors.</li>
            <li>If you want something that&#x27;s a good combination of sharpness and smoothness that is cheap buy the Astras which rarely exceed $11 per hundred.  </li>
            <li>I bought him these as replacements and am sure that they will be just as easy to use as the one that came with it.</li>
            <li>and I think they are better than Dorcos and even Astras, but just very mild and give an inconsistent spotty shave compared to Feathers on my face.</li>
            <li>Good blades, good price gotta love double edged blades so cheap and so much better for shaving.</li>
            <li>I am not sure what more to post on these, great price, great product.</li>
            <li>All of the blades were wrapped in their parrafin wrappers, but I was not too impressed to get a loose pack of blades with no outer covering.</li>
            <li>Very good quality double edge razor</li>
            <li>but I have to say I was surprised by what a great shave I get with these razors.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok but not as smooth and as close as others like Wilkinson, Shark, and Astra for me.</li>
            <li>These blades are so much better than today&#x27;s so called advanced technology multi-blades.</li>
            <li>Do want to spend one dollar a month for blades and enjoy close safe shaves?</li>
            <li>Great Razors for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save money, have better skin, smell nicer, and actually enjoy shaving, instead of looking at it as a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far they are working great.  </li>
            <li>Great blade so far.  </li>
            <li>Tried a lot of razors, these hold their edge, reasonably priced, and are consistently good shaves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their other tools are great though!!</li>
            <li>Let me warn you they are PERFECT really SHARP</li>
            <li>kids can&#x27;t get to them easily...</li>
            <li>My shave was closer than before and very quick, even when I went against the grain .However</li>
            <li>The next day I tried a fresh blade in the pack and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Easy to install in safety razor.  </li>
            <li>No pulling just an easy glide across my face.</li>
            <li>Seems to easily dig into my skin regardless of my angle or pressure.  </li>
            <li>I love shaving now, takes a bit more time, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Love the Mercur Razor and blades its the best quality heavy dont buy any cheaper razor or blade.</li>
            <li>Packaged well and easy to use...not just layer in a box.</li>
            <li>My neck is easily irritated, so this is a winner for me.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>The dispenser box makes it easy to use</li>
            <li>Good product, Cheap price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to load them into the razor.</li>
            <li>Merkur blades are very mild.</li>
            <li>This razor was great until it became locked up and couldn&#x27;t turn the handle to open the top to replace the razor.  </li>
            <li>Received very quickly.....</li>
            <li>These razor blades have made shaving an easy endeavor.</li>
            <li>I still get a decent shave, but not as good as the 1st.  </li>
            <li>Lather up really well using a good brush and get a smooth shave with these quality blades.</li>
            <li>Good contemporary option for the safety razor.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Feather, but decent.</li>
            <li>perfect fit in the red sleeve, unlike the full size dovo blades which don&#x27;t seem to fit well at all.</li>
            <li>Works great, price is right, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp for a great price.</li>
            <li>These are good blades, perfect for someone just starting with a Double Edge razor.  </li>
            <li>Excellent (very sharp) razor blades.</li>
            <li>These razors are fine.</li>
            <li>would like to add that Merkur makes exceptionally fine razors as well as blades.</li>
            <li>cream (Proraso and Cremo both work fine).</li>
            <li>hey at the price that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>These seem to be working just fine for me.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a easy smooth shve for men or women, this is the blade for you.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li>Should have read the fine print.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>However, I am less than impressed with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li>it wrong&amp;#34; — and with one-day&#x27;s gristle these blades work fine — </li>
            <li>If you want the very best combination of smoothness and sharpness, I&#x27;d recommend the Gillette Silver Blues, Polsilver, Gillette Platinum or Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Black.  </li>
            <li>And there are better options out there if you are looking for a mild blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great razors,, smooth i&#x27;ve tried other double edge razor and found the Merkur to be very good... will be buying more</li>
            <li>They last nearly a week of perfect shaves before dulling for me, so they are definitely easy on the budget!</li>
            <li>These Merkur blades will certainly make do in a pinch, but if you want a good nexus of sharpness, durability and low cost, try the Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li>Super sharp Blades that work perfect!</li>
            <li>By far the best performing blade I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>More than I expected, great value and will be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cut and pull hair either -- a huge problem I&#x27;ve had with the hair on my chin.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of these blades.</li>
            <li>There was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>nice blades, really cuts smooth, and close.  </li>
            <li>Work very well, give a nice smooth shave</li>
            <li>However the DE89 isn&#x27;t very aggressive, so it matches nicely with these blades, giving me a close shave with fewer passes.</li>
            <li>light, smooth strokes</li>
            <li>These blades really give a nice close shave</li>
            <li>The Schick Quattro blades are also available, package of 8, for $21.99.</li>
            <li>The Merkur seems to fit me best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a master now and the shave is baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I bought these to go along with the Merkur Double Edge #34C razor and they work great.</li>
            <li>These things shave smooth as butter.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone wanting a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>i like coz they cheap</li>
            <li>Holds its edge and provides for a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Both shave great, but value is key here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so cheap sometimes)</li>
            <li>I have a light to medium beard</li>
            <li>Smooth and aggressive all in one.</li>
            <li>but I wished it would fit snuggly in holder.</li>
            <li>Having returned to a double edge razor after years and years of using the multi-blade types I am extremely happy with these blades.  </li>
            <li>They give me a close, comfortable shave</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Cuts smooth and even.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t seem as smooth.  </li>
            <li>An exceptionally smooth shave once I got into the rhythm of shaving with a safety razor again.</li>
            <li>Hold the blade lightly against the skin.</li>
            <li>Lather up with a quality shave cream (I use Dreadnought) and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Not quite as smooth as the \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; brand blades</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Giving a closes smooth shave always.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But unless your Father in Law has an enormous stash then you&#x27;ll be happy with these.</li>
            <li>He has a light beard and raves about these blades.</li>
            <li>I tried and tried but it never got as close as the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>and I thoroughly enjoy shaving with them.</li>
            <li>(I got Merkur blades to test for free).</li>
            <li>but once i tightened it again, smooth shaving returned.</li>
            <li>My second favorites were Feather, from Japan, and until something else really great comes along</li>
            <li>I enjoy the shave they give.  </li>
            <li>I got a close baby smooth shave without any cuts.</li>
            <li>Provided a smooth shave with no razor burn, cuts, etc.</li>
            <li>I purchased these to fit a razor I bought for my husband from The Art Of Shaving.</li>
            <li>And they last a great deal longer as well.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell how good they and how many shaves</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>This product is a good quality and value, but I have found that Astra has better performance for the same price.  </li>
            <li>, these don&#x27;t have a safety wire wrapped around them, so take slower, more controlled strokes, and make sure to pull the razor exactly straight across your skin</li>
            <li>I use , so far so good .</li>
            <li>Such a good price for so many.</li>
            <li>Still using the first blade, supposedly should be able to get 6 shaves out of each, I&#x27;m at 4 and still going strong.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the merkur blades, very easy to shave with and so far I have used the same blade for a month, getting ready to order more.</li>
            <li>Kind of remind one how clean cut this kind of blade does for facial hair!</li>
            <li>Good blades, nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>But overall my 1st shave with these blades were very nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had one experience using these razor blades, but they were very effective</li>
            <li>Merkur blades are decent, as each blade works differently for everyone I can&#x27;t say they won&#x27;t be the best for you.</li>
            <li>Merkur Blade gives me a smooth and clean shave, even against the grain.</li>
            <li>Great razors,, im a true believer in german engineering and</li>
            <li>NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] that I had were still the best that I have used.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally began with these blades because I also purchased a Merkur brand razor.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend ordering anything from CashCo1000 unless you are willing to wait the better part of a month to receive it.</li>
            <li>The quality of these blades is a lot better than the name brand 2-5 blade ones being marketed at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li>My original review is below, and as someone who reads and appreciates feedback, I needed to send in an updated review.  </li>
            <li>Once again,these German made, like most things German, are flawless.</li>
            <li>It was great, but it takes a long time to shave with.  </li>
            <li>Admitting that, I found this blade to cause a significant amount of knicks and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>After all the reviews I was excited for these to come in the mail.</li>
            <li>It is a process, but still excited about the advantages of saving money with it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad these were my first experience.  </li>
            <li>These are the first blades I&#x27;ve tried as a DE shaver, and I&#x27;m glad I started with these.</li>
            <li>Cuts my fine mustache hairs and delicate nose hairs flawlessly.</li>
            <li>At the price that they are, I could probably afford to replace them much more often, but I don&#x27;t really see the need because they seem to be working fine.</li>
            <li>The best brand of double edge razor blazes so far.</li>
            <li>These blades are well made and give me a clean close shave every time.</li>
            <li>I usually clean the blades well after shaving to preserve the edges.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean (probably in part because it has no gummy &#x27;lubricants&#x27; clogging things up...).</li>
            <li>He loves shaving with them, and they give him an affordable, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Gives a clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li>Take out and clean</li>
            <li>The clear best double edge blade on the market.</li>
            <li>These are good for about two shaves and then they drag and nick me if I use them any more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe you can get a much closer, more comfortable shave than with the Merkur razor blade.  </li>
            <li>but you learn how to use them quickly with no cuts or abrasions and just make sure you soften your skin with hot water and lather up ......</li>
            <li>Not very expensive, and warm and comfortable after the first use.</li>
            <li>The packaging was the right size and the razors come out of the holders easily.</li>
            <li>Shaving using a single blade may seems really old school and requires good shaving skills, but it does give a good clean shave, and for the price paid, nothing else come close.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>These are excellent blades and sometimes hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li>They also last longer so the price difference is not as great as it first appears.</li>
            <li>Bout some with my first DE razor assuming they would be great because they are German made</li>
            <li>great if your starting out straight razor shaving too!</li>
            <li>The blades I think are good quality and last about 5 shaves</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really blame this on Merkur alone, is that I can&#x27;t shave against the grain with a DE razor which means I have to shave more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad i ditched the gillette razors and went with a Merkur straight razor and safety razor</li>
            <li>I have to say that I have never had such a good shave.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the switch from modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li>Good price, last 3-4 shaves</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think these blades could be any better than they already are.</li>
            <li>I just started DE shaving and even though I am enjoying the whole process</li>
            <li>I could really use either blade, but like the Feathers slightly better.  </li>
            <li>In the interest of full disclosure here though, it takes me about three days do grow visible stubble.</li>
            <li>and so glad he received the whole shaving set</li>
            <li>Bought this because of the reviews stating that they are just as good as the double or triple bladed counterparts.  </li>
            <li>I love these platinum coated stainless steel blades and I suggest you replace the blades after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>I really like my Merkur razors and am really enjoying \\&quot;shaving with a brush\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li>Sweet safety razor blades</li>
            <li>I have gotten a much better shave from blades that are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Not as good as feather but a close second.</li>
            <li>do a good job and keeping my 5&#x27;oclock shadow from coming back 2 hours after I&#x27;ve shaved.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it more than anything else, because nothing gives you a shave quite like a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>The case is nice because you can put your old blades in the bottom when you are done.</li>
            <li>Razors last for a good number of shaves.</li>
            <li>Here it was - a true test.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my boyfriend, they are his absolute favorite blades for shaving his face.</li>
            <li>Overall good comfort.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more than 3 weeks, but that&#x27;s about as much as I get out of these blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor and am happy so far.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t take any longer to shave with, as you never have to go over areas multiple times, but you will spend more time getting everything nice and clean on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>I find that shaving with a single edge blade after years of using a multi - bladed razor is challenging to get the best out of the shaving experience with these single blades.</li>
            <li>These are sharp and give a great shave.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality steel, has lasted me several shaves on the first blade so far.  </li>
            <li>They are neither exceptionally sharp nor especially smooth.  </li>
            <li>Last for a good long time when paired with a good razor.</li>
            <li>These are as good or possibly better than your drug store blades, although a little pricey.</li>
            <li>My husband says these razors work so much better than all these new razors with 2, 3 and 4 blades!  </li>
            <li>Good price, very sharp, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Super blades.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and quick.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use a dot of cocoa butter lotion with the lucky tiger</li>
            <li>Seems too mild with the merkur safety blade, which I understand to be on the milder side amongst DE razor options.</li>
            <li>Both are very satisfactory and very cost effective.</li>
            <li>These blades are good so far as I have gotten a very close shave.</li>
            <li>They are decent for learning but I can&#x27;t get more than two days of shaving out of them before they start tearing up my face something fierce.</li>
            <li>The sales associate at my local mall touted these as &#x27;the best double edge razors on the market&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be better the next time.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Later reviews will quantitatively compare different blades on a 1 to 10 scale with 10 being best.  </li>
            <li>Many reviewers have given these blades high review.</li>
            <li>These work very good at cutting and nice and smooth shave, but-</li>
            <li>Love the double edged blades, the are great and perform and out last the othger blades</li>
            <li>You could feel the change from the very first shave.</li>
            <li>These blades are pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li>With that said, I think its done my skin good for the long run.</li>
            <li>I was just wondering if someone who has used could just let me know how long the blades are good for before you need to change them?</li>
            <li>Not only is it as good, but it is in some instances better since I am able to purchase more razors for far less cost, the razor makes for a closer and more confidant shave, and the product exudes far more confidence.</li>
            <li>Precisely made with easy application and ease of removing and replacing with new blade.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>; shave better than a new cut rate blade.</li>
            <li>Love these blades with my new Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>Nice to have the blades available when purchasing the long handled safety razor.  </li>
            <li>VERY close shave!!</li>
            <li>Just be aware, this is just 10 blades!</li>
            <li>very fussy....FIVE STARS!!</li>
            <li>A little pre-info, I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL razor and EJ best badger brush with Lucky Tiger aftershave, and either proraso sensitive shaving soap or Dr Harris Lavender shaving soap (I like them both).  </li>
            <li>great buy, wish they were a little cheaper</li>
            <li>My favorite blades, pretty sharp, glides over face nicely, leaves me with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li>They are not the sharpest (I would go with Feathers or Sharks if you want really sharp), but they seem to work pleasantly in my Merkur razor.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the razor we ordered previously and was very happy that we could order the same blades that originally came with the razor..</li>
            <li>Maybe not the best choice for a beginner, as there are others blades that are less sharp and more forgiving.  </li>
            <li>A great deal and last a good while, maybe about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves before they get too dull</li>
            <li>Double edge safety razors take a bit longer to shave with but the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>quality product fit is perfect..how much can you say about razor blades</li>
            <li>but it gives a really close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>He also feels that it&#x27;s more economical because beyond the initial purchase of the metal razor the blades are relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>Better than what is available locally.</li>
            <li>So far my favorite blade used feather as well.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased so far with Merkur.     </li>
            <li>Wish they were cheaper but worth it.  </li>
            <li>Nice German razor blades.</li>
            <li>The individual wrapping is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I love this razor, like shaving with straight razor, very close shave....</li>
            <li>Worth a try if you like a blade.</li>
            <li>Using the search engine of your choice, seek out the several popular shaving blogs and online vendors.</li>
            <li>Overall it was not the most comfortable</li>
            <li>She has had so much fun with it both indoors and out.  </li>
            <li>I will say that since everyone&#x27;s face/beard is different you may have better results with another brand, so try several different types to see what suits you best.</li>
            <li>But certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li>The razors last more than 2 weeks each, and give a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>He really liked them, and I will be ordering these in the future!</li>
            <li>OK AS FAR AS BLADES GO</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, so far they are just OK.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty sweet when you do.</li>
            <li>They seem ok so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a lot calmer and more soothing to shave this way, and possibly even a touch faster, and the result is superior.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a fun idea at the time.</li>
            <li>Quality craftsmanship and so worth the price.</li>
            <li>Work great for my sensitive skin and can be considered middle of the road blades...</li>
            <li>You can find far sharper and smoother blades than these at a much better price (Personna Blue, Astra Superior Platinum, Feather Hi Stainless) here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The blades are a little more pricy than other blades however, in comparison to the latest 5 blade razor they are still a great deal.</li>
            <li>Has remained sharp even after a dozen uses, will be interesting to see how many uses I get before I have to change the blade.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with these blades as they give a very good cut with nicks, bumps nor razor burn on my face after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are sharp but not as sharp as feathers of course but give a clean and soft cut.</li>
            <li>The Astra or Derby Blades in particular give a better smoother shave and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>good item i like better than does gillets at walmart to much money in ordinary razors</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to stay with the Merkur that seem to be sharp and do a good job for me.</li>
            <li>Just right</li>
            <li>The blades came in on time and worked splendidly right out of the box.</li>
            <li>once you found the right blade to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Yes that&#x27;s right two weeks</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t the right blade for my skin type.</li>
            <li>They provide just the right balance for my needs, not to aggressive.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>after use i take them out of the razor, wash in warm water, dry and put back in the handy &amp;#34;drawer&amp;#34; each box has, remember-water-sweat (salt) and oxygen cause corrosion, so i remove 2.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who requires a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>These blades are excellent, except when I order them a couple weeks ago they were $3 less than the current</li>
            <li>: Solid performer, I don&#x27;t like them quite as much as the personna reds but they are better for me than merkur and the ones I choose to purchase because they are wicked cheap on a lot of sites.  </li>
            <li>Loads up too quickly and requires very frequent cleaning with hot water to clean and continue to shave.</li>
            <li>super sharp amazing blades</li>
            <li>I love the Merkir blades, they are both sharp and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>But these are great blades and stay sharp for a good amount of time ( I dont have a really thick beard)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy  my barber recommended these, bc i have not used a single other blade since.  </li>
            <li>These blades aren&#x27;t bad but not the best, Personna DE blades are better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>If you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors.</li>
            <li>urge you to try a few different kinds to see what works best for your skin type.  </li>
            <li>I bought them because I have a Merkur razor which I like very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Astra: I didn&#x27;t like these very much.  </li>
            <li>and, they are very much closer and the skin is</li>
            <li>Some were sharp and smooth, some seemed to rip my skin more than others.</li>
            <li>So far they seem to be working just fine.  </li>
            <li>I do make sure to clean them off after every shave though, which probably helps (rinse them off under water and then carefully wipe off any debris with a finger.</li>
            <li>These blades are priced above many reputable brands, but aren&#x27;t particularly sharp, smooth, or durable.  </li>
            <li>Good blade for a beginner, not sharp enough</li>
            <li>I got one regular Merkur blade with a new razor and it is not as good as the super by far.</li>
            <li>Good quality but handle was a little short and would prefer a better method of changing out blades.</li>
            <li>It was still a huge step up from my old Mach 3</li>
            <li>No nicks, scratches, bumps or irritation or burn on my first shave.  </li>
            <li>i like these blades as much as any others!</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive about using a DE razor at first</li>
            <li>This was my first set of razor blades.</li>
            <li>I do not know how many shaves I may get from this blade but the first shave was terrific.  </li>
            <li>I bought these when I first started using a DE razor.  </li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Need to try different blades to find one that better suits my face.</li>
            <li>Still great blades, but I have a thick jungle of a beard</li>
            <li>First I do a pass in the direction of hair growth, then rinse lather and repeat against the grain.  </li>
            <li>the switch will pay for itself in under a year, clearing up lots of extra cash for interesting stuff like books or CDs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately they&#x27;re not expensive at all</li>
            <li>But like I said my first time even use it.</li>
            <li>I love the razors though if you do some research you can find different prices.</li>
            <li>However, I have gone back to the Gillette blades because they really do give a far superior shave.  </li>
            <li>Because this is the first DE blade I&#x27;ve used in forever, I have to cut this some slack.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>I was a newbie using it in a Merkur Futur, which has a pretty steep learning curve&lt;</li>
            <li>Serves the purpose for a short period of time, but the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock is a better blade.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried so many blades, and not all are equal.  </li>
            <li>American made blades are OK</li>
            <li>This is the first brand I have tested</li>
            <li>Merkurs were the first blades I bought for DE shaving.</li>
            <li>But I will come back for more.</li>
            <li>This one blade does a much better job then the 5 blade units that are sold to make you believe that is the only way to a close shave.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li>Especially like the way you can dispose the used blades in the container to keep them safe.</li>
            <li>His skin is just smooth and soft after shaving with these and his C.O. Bigelow shaving cream(the tube, not the can).</li>
            <li>This is the first de blade that I used.  </li>
            <li>but I think is appropriate so you can get a feel for how this specific blade performs or stacks up to the competition.</li>
            <li>I bought the soap style shaving cream and didn&#x27;t cut myself the first three times.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Gillette Silver Blue, BIC or Wilkinson sword hold up much better.</li>
            <li>nice and heavy for a smooth glide without needing much pressure.</li>
            <li>2 star rating more because of the price (especially if you include shipping!).</li>
            <li>At first I was scared by the amount of choice I had in blades</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li>I recently took the plunge as many would say into DE razors and figured to try these blades first.</li>
            <li>, It got all the hair on both legs the first time.</li>
            <li>These are the first razors I&#x27;ve purchased for my Merkur safety razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all personal, but for me there are better blades.</li>
            <li>Razors seem to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness for that because when I used the Merkur blade for my first shave just to give it a try, it did not reduce my beard at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure my blade preferences will change as I try different brands of blades and become more-experienced using my safety razor.  </li>
            <li>For me most of the blades are similar...</li>
            <li>Product as described, shipped fast, would do it again!</li>
            <li>An overall okay shave.</li>
            <li>First go at using a double-edged safety razor</li>
            <li>Merkur is one of the most reliable for actual razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user and did not have difficulty using them.</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li>These were included with a razor I purchased, but I&#x27;ll most likely buy them again.  </li>
            <li>And NOT expensive.  </li>
            <li>Consistent quality throughout the package.</li>
            <li>Consistently close shave.</li>
            <li>First shave was on a #4 setting and will try to dial it back and see if it gets better.  </li>
            <li>must first note that these blades did not come in the blister pack that is shown.</li>
            <li>Makes me wonder where exactly they came</li>
            <li>These blades are just okay - especially after you have tried the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>Switched to a double-edge safety razor for the first time at age 56.</li>
            <li>Will be buying again soon, thanks!</li>
            <li>Got my first safety razor and needed blades to go with it.</li>
            <li>Excellent blades but way too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine there is a better Double Edge razor on the market</li>
            <li>Very happy to return to the double edge razor vice the multiple edge models currently on the market.</li>
            <li>Went back to wet shaving and found these blades to be perfect for an old fashioned shave with brush and lather.</li>
            <li>But comparing yourself to Gillette and claiming that it can do a similar or better job is misleading.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using merkur blades</li>
            <li>and and overall pleased with the edge, cost and durability.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the Gillette Platinum (blue box) blades any more, and these were a close</li>
            <li>6 of them off one blade to be exact.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i need.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I suspect I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or more different safety razor blade brands and none compare to the Merkur.</li>
            <li>These are the BEST alternative to expensive razor blades like the gilette fusion or Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Bought these with a Meker handle, my first Sr.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>Here good for a few uses on each blade.</li>
            <li>These blades fit perfectly on my Merkur 34C and last approximately one week for me, shaving 5 days a week.  </li>
            <li>Great blades;sharp, last a long time!</li>
            <li>My old used Astras are better than these new blades.</li>
            <li>In my experience the blade on the Wilkinson Sword seems to cut smoother, with less irritation and provides me with a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades are nice and sharp, and last me a week or more.</li>
            <li>I am new to the whole old-school wetshaving thing, and like many of the other reviewers here, I am actually enjoying shaving for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp blades get a closer shave with my Merkur C handle.</li>
            <li>I have a tough beard and they are the best by far</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li>Neat, clean cut on this course curly beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave that often (maybe every 2 weeks) and my hair is thick and this razor cuts through it with no problem after many shaves (a 10 pack lasted more than a year).  </li>
            <li>I think these are also just as good as the sharper Japanese Double Edge Razor Blades.</li>
            <li>Shaving was very time consuming and required multiple strokes and more pressure that I&#x27;d prefer to use on my face with a razor.</li>
            <li>I tried some different blades (Feather &amp; Personna) to go in my Merkur DE safety razor, and these Merkur blades give me the best shave with the least irritation.</li>
            <li>Not only do they provide a close shave, but they also last for fair amount of time.</li>
            <li>I bought these blades and razors and they get nowhere near as smooth as a modern razor.</li>
            <li>People who use these regularly say you&#x27;re going for beard reduction and not a close shave - well then the product is actually not that good.</li>
            <li>To be honest I think Merkur are equal in quality if not a little bit smoother in the shave.</li>
            <li>I believe the trick with a DE razor is to make sure you buy a good one and make should it is closed tightly.</li>
            <li>I really like being able to re-use these blades over and over, I just like being able to know that the blades are not going to get dull after one shave</li>
            <li>These are great blades for my sensitive skin + coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>They were delivered remarkably fast in a first class envelope.</li>
            <li>Smooth, sharp and provides a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>After to much research I was scared the first time I picked up my DE razor with these blades.</li>
            <li>These Merkur blades are as much an improvement over Derby as the safety razor was over cartridges in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is cheap, but it is not as sharp and smooth as my 5 blade shaver.</li>
            <li>downside is the replacement blades are so reasonable that the shipping costs make them higher than they should be.</li>
            <li>He told me he never experienced such a safe, smooth, gliding precise shave!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been testing different blades now after becoming accustomed to Feathers.</li>
            <li>I will comment on sharpness, durability, and comfort for each blade, but since this is the first modern DE blade i have tried, my comments here will be qualitative.  </li>
            <li>They are far more economical then constantly ordering disposable razors and he swears by their effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I love my merkur double edged razor but their replacement blades didn&#x27;t really work very well for me.</li>
            <li>NIce blades but not worth this steep price when Astras are 10 bucks for a pack of 100.</li>
            <li>The blades are probably good but they are too small for the razor.</li>
            <li>I bought the King 47506 1000/6000 combination to sharpen my own blades, takes a lot of technique to get it down</li>
            <li>So they arrived and I immediately put a new razor blade fresh into my Merkur Adjustable Safety Razor.</li>
            <li>and I found the shaving experience less than amazing.</li>
            <li>The second shave still smooth but nothing like the first.</li>
            <li>They come individually wrapped and easy to snap on my razor.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and simple design.</li>
            <li>The shave is nice and close and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Better than the shavers I was using previously from Gillette.</li>
            <li>Very pleased, and I am not easy to please.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfort - There is slightly more drag feel than with the ProGlide Turbos, but it is not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>Have to very careful you will cut your self very easily.  </li>
            <li>good shave but doesn&#x27;t last long compared to Derby in my opinion</li>
            <li>Just go slow, use lots of good hot water and a quality shave</li>
            <li>my be better on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;definitely high quality, i notice only a slight difference between these and feather but a huge difference to the cheap ones at super markets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to find this razor blades in my country, but it&#x27;s great to know that for a small price, I can get them now to use with my safety razor.</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy, and quick to use.</li>
            <li>Dont seem to last more then 2 shaves, though my beard is pretty corse so not totaly unexpected.</li>
            <li>I used to get bumps, cuts, and irritation no matter what I did, but now that I use these very sharp blades with my safety razor, I don&#x27;t get any irritation and I rarely cut myself!!!</li>
            <li>The anticipation of my previous great shaves was immense.</li>
            <li>There is great variation in DE razor blades and really, it will come down to your personal preference.</li>
            <li>Dorko and Gilette were decent - lasted about a week each and rarely cut up the face; shave was decently close.</li>
            <li>I like these because while not as sharp as Feathers they seem to be more consistent than Feathers.  </li>
            <li>This product works just fine, it seems a bit larger than the safety razor that holds it.</li>
            <li>, I think they would last alot longer with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>I will say they are very smooth blades and don&#x27;t drag as much as the Astras or the Dorcos</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use a straight razor and don&#x27;t want to invest in the premium ones, this is definitely a close second best (and a lot less work, since you won&#x27;t need to keep your blade honed).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for first time safety razor shavers.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so a razor that is sharp and only requires 1-2 passes is great.</li>
            <li>They seem to last a reasonable number of shaves and are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>The fact that each of these razors can last months before replacement, and each of these go about 73c each (which is huge compared to $5 for cartridge razor heads).</li>
            <li>I could not get a very close shave, and when I tried, I ended up hacking my face.  </li>
            <li>and the shipping was fast from the company that sold them.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t very confortable</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>These blades cut beard hair very well without looking like a you were just in a hack and slash film.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the real wet-shaving ritual for about a month now, and with my order of the Merkur 1904 \\&quot;#48\\&quot; safety razor came one of the Merkur Supers.</li>
            <li>Product was as described, highly recommend seller!</li>
            <li>Bought these razor from the Art of Shaving store in Crabtree Mall in Raleigh, very dissapointed, rash showed before I could finish shaving and permanently scared my face.</li>
            <li>so I really cannot compare them.</li>
            <li>and they were priced reasonably</li>
            <li>These blades feel sharper, and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Hi stainless.</li>
            <li>If you have never shaved with a real razor then get one and use these blades.</li>
            <li>Not so with a real safety razor.</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>The Israeli blades are very forgiving, but the shave is not as close.  </li>
            <li>He really likes these blades,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve replaced it with a quattro razor and cartidge that works much to my liking.</li>
            <li>I recommend to everyone who wants to try this time tested type of shaving.</li>
            <li>The shave is really close</li>
            <li>an off-the-shelf plastic straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>:  After having used the personnas and the derby&#x27;s off and on for a year (the derby ones are just so cheap sometimes) I have to admit that the derby have grown on me, not only because of the price, but also because I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to their shave.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I just changed to a double edged razor and really enjoy shaving with these blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very unimpressed with these blades.</li>
            <li>i have light facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Both cut much smoother and closer.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like them.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it immensely.</li>
            <li>and it is very affordable to do so.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this blade.</li>
            <li>I received a smooth effortless shave even after the fourth use.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Platinum, stainless steel?</li>
            <li>A much nicer shave, he says.</li>
            <li>VERY well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>price is reasonable when comparing merkur blades to lessor quality blades.  </li>
            <li>I found a Henckel straight razor.  </li>
            <li>It has the delicacy and precision of a straight razor combined with the ease of a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I get such a close smooth shave</li>
            <li>I went straight in to shave and</li>
            <li>These razor blades work very well.</li>
            <li>I get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>WOuld really recomend them...</li>
            <li>After years of using Mach3  that I still like, but 18 bucks for 5 blades is really getting out of hand.</li>
            <li>I guess from all the reviews I&#x27;ve read, you really have to try and try and try to find what works for you.</li>
            <li>is how I feel after having used up all 5 packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather: Definitely the sharpest by far, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I like these blades when they work, the problem is quality control with at least one or two blades per pack not having or holding a good edge.</li>
            <li>Had a bit of trouble getting right under my nose, but getting better with practice.</li>
            <li>just isnt adequate enough to provide the quality shave I received the first 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li>What is not to love, cheap, sharp, and solid well made blades.</li>
            <li>Plenty of other similarly priced blades out there that are way more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is my first set of razors with my new safety razor.  </li>
            <li>As for these blades, they&#x27;re the first I used with my new set-up, post-Gillette.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and these were the first blades I tried.</li>
            <li>I got way more nics with these than any other blade I&#x27;ve used and my face would be very tender after a shave.  </li>
            <li>These are nice and sharp blades, but I&#x27;m surprised by their durability.</li>
            <li>With some work I can get a good shave with them, but after only 3 shaves they were significantly duller than other cheaper blades such as the LORD Platinum.  </li>
            <li>The Dorco blades tend to dull quickly, but if you have soft and sensitive skin, it&#x27;s probably a good compromise.</li>
            <li>They give me a better shave and stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li>I consider them more razor dependent than other blades.</li>
            <li>extremely sharp - razor just glides - never had a better shave</li>
            <li>Better than any other blade I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I find that I run through these more since they don&#x27;t start as sharp.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as Feather, but I think I get a better shave from these.</li>
            <li>More shaves and smoother than any other.</li>
            <li>Additionally, these are pretty easy to cut yourself with compared to some other blade brands.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it interesting that big ticket items such as home computers and digital cameras continue to drop in price, making them available to everyone at a reasonable cost, while all the &#x27;Shaving Systems&#x27; and attendant accoutrements continue to skyrocket into the stratosphere?</li>
            <li>These blades works very well paired with the Merkur Classic, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I have used Schick trac 2 blades in the past, but this combination works so much better that it was worth the effort to learn to shave over.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for these razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this blade to anyone that is looking for a close shave at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li>A little too much resistance but all around solid blade if you get a good price</li>
            <li>nice and sharp!!!</li>
            <li>Best shave ever on my delicate black skin</li>
            <li>Depending on your shaving needs a single razor could last you upward of one month for effective use.</li>
            <li>The blades are smooth and sharp on the first shave.  </li>
            <li>These Merkur blades are better than others, but I would say fairly average for my beard.</li>
            <li>Does not perform any better than any average Gillette blade,</li>
            <li>However, compared to every cartridge razor I have ever used these are hands down so much better.  </li>
            <li>down favorite.</li>
            <li>New blade pulls and just about comes to a stop on beard!</li>
            <li>But then again, I am new to DE razors so maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much.</li>
            <li>Good because they don&#x27;t slice up my face quite as much, bad because they need changing slightly more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought blades at Wal-Mart for less that were better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, I am saving money, by getting more shaves on less costly blades and I am receiving closer</li>
            <li>Derby&#x27;s were recently my favorite (till trying Merkur) -- close shave, lasted about a week and a half, and almost never nicked the skin.</li>
            <li>I will most likely upgrade to an adjustable in the future.</li>
            <li>If you use a double edge safety razor, these are definitely one of the top brands to buy.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I would say this is a decent blade.  </li>
            <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it a five star rating is because I thought that the razor would last more than just four shaves before I felt</li>
            <li>I bought a few stack of these for my lovely face, which really appreciates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still looking for decently priced blades though.</li>
            <li>really really worth it to anyone with thick beard hair. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple of different brands and will most likely go to others before buying this one again, however, for a beginner just learning how to shave, this works ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 or 3 decent shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>Merkur, without a shadow of a doubt is far superior to all the competitors (at least those in my experiement).</li>
            <li>The main reason I switched from disposable cartridges to this was the cost.</li>
            <li>Because they shave better, and are cheaper, your skin will look better as you won&#x27;t be using an expensive razor 2 weeks longer than you should have, which will decrease irritation, ingrown hairs, and infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Classic product.</li>
            <li>It will take a while to get back to DE for more than one pass, so I still use the mach 3 for a cross grain after using the DE.</li>
            <li>It was obvious from my very first shave that the blades had changed as well.</li>
            <li>Even the highest quality blade can easily be rendered useless in a poorly designed razor so finding one that has the perfect blade exposure can be difficult but the Shaving Factory Heavy Metal Straight Razor meets all my expectations and is the perfect companion for these fine blades.</li>
            <li>:  I highly recommend the product.     </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend these if you decide to go with a safety razor</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these blades</li>
            <li>Given the high ratings for this razor, I opted to buy a pack.  </li>
            <li>The blades are exceptionally high quality</li>
            <li>Came highly recommended.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Most of other people&#x27;s observatons vis-a-vis aggressiveness seem to match my experience so far.  </li>
            <li>I love shaving with a single blade razor because they are so much cheaper and do the same as those 10x blade razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That does not mean that this&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a little better.</li>
            <li>I have only used this razor blade once so far, but it cut my whiskers cleanly with no razor burn on the skin.</li>
            <li>Razor are sharp and in a protective case so they are easy to store and</li>
            <li>IIndividually wrapped, easy to handle and install and quite sharp.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and cut easily.</li>
            <li>This way the mach 3 is a nice finish up and it will get a lot of mileage and I won&#x27;t cut myself on those hard to get spots that you have to go over and over.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much like the old Gillette &#x27;Spoiler&#x27; to my memory.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference between these blades and my old ones.</li>
            <li>Expensive but great blades.</li>
            <li>True, there is a small learning curve (how I wish the fathers of my generation had not been conned into the \\&quot;multi-blade revolution\\&quot; and had been able to teach us to shave properly).  </li>
            <li>Love the blades, these will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>These work so much better than the standard safety razors (as long as you DON&#x27;T try to take them on flight)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t probably squeze out a few more shaves</li>
            <li>These blades are okay but harsh.  </li>
            <li>Able to tackle heavy beards</li>
            <li>These are at best average blades or worse.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is that you can try a lot of different brands in small lot&#x27;s and not spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn.</li>
            <li>From my first Atra to my last Fusion, I succeeded primarily in scraping off half my face before razor-burned first dates and family photos.  </li>
            <li>Then, rooting around in my top drawer, I found an old half used pack of Merkurs from before the grab bag experiment.</li>
            <li>All most the same as other razor that don&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
            <li>Never would I have thought that a single blade would be able to do the same job as the multi-blade razors that I am used to.</li>
            <li>I found out with saftey razors, you have to try different blades to find the right fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They tug at day old stubble because they are not sharp enough fresh out of the wrapper on the first use.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, and hold a nice edge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>However, as I got older, now 64, I discovered that these disposal razors would only last 1 1/2 shaves, possibly due to my whiskers becoming more coarse and thicker.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a huge difference between these and any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Came of the pack sharp and shaved smoothly.</li>
            <li>he says they are exceptionally sharp and he gets a reliably smooth shave with every use.</li>
            <li>These blades are smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>They are cheap, and sharp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with my new Merkur safety razor for about 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re up 15 to 20 bucks every time you buy new blades</li>
            <li>My husband LOVES his new razor.</li>
            <li>The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the new style razors.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s new to the safety razor world, and he likes them.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving try a variety of blades.  </li>
            <li>B001G5FOLI Feather New Hi-Stainless]]</li>
            <li>They live in CA</li>
            <li>I might have to buy a new pack of blades about once a year.</li>
            <li>I am new to safety razor shaving and purchased these blades with a new Merkur 33C style</li>
            <li>These were like brand new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at this type of shaving but</li>
            <li>My boyfriend, who was, at first, a bit reluctant to try such precise, sharp blades along with his new Merur razor, was very pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li>But when i started looking around for replacement blades I saw that for I can get other brands with 10x more blades for only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>If you (like myself) initially came to Amazon first in starting your entry into DE safety razor shaving, STOP right now.</li>
            <li>I get a smoother, more constant shave than I could have ever expected.    </li>
            <li>My facial hair is not long or coarse, so I figured I could and should be able to get 2 shaves out of one blade.  </li>
            <li>The first shave was amazingly smooth along with several nicks here and there due to the fact that I just started.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very gentle blades on your face; they allow for multiple passes.  </li>
            <li>The associate also emphasized the fact that they&#x27;re made in Germany, so \\&quot;clearly they are of high quality.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li>I have no complaints, but noticed that the Feather Razor Blades (which are Japanese Stainless) seem to provide me with a little better shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very sharp, fine blades.</li>
            <li>We will see how long they last just got them so far so good can&#x27;t be more expensive than disposable razors</li>
            <li>I like them better than my usual Shark blades.</li>
            <li>These are the first double edge razor blades I have ever used</li>
            <li>If the Feathers turn out to be too sharp, I will most likely stick with Merkur.</li>
            <li>more likely to cut than any other brand I tried.</li>
            <li>I will not go back to modern blades!</li>
            <li>I always give a blade multiple shaves to see if it gets better, but usually know on the first pass if I like it or not.  </li>
            <li>These blades shave very well, though part of their success is due to the razor in which it is used.</li>
            <li>They are the exact same thing except they didn&#x27;t come in the plastic packaging for just $5.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re decent blades with not so great cutting power</li>
            <li>The cost, when compared to buying refills for disposable blades is hands down, fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Bought these along with the Merkur long handled razor as the main components of my first kit.</li>
            <li>I am getting a close shave for at least as long as the best selling four blade cartridges, and for a lot less money</li>
            <li>Very reasonable blade, though kind of expensive given alternatives.</li>
            <li>Change your blades once or twice a week - the blades are very sharp, but so cheap in comparison to the carts that they practically give them away,</li>
            <li>Very sharp and does the job on making my face stubble free.</li>
            <li>I was only shaving my face though and did not experiment on any other more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean, don&#x27;t rust and are very economical compared to Gillette Blades and they shave better without irritating or cutting my skin.</li>
            <li>Using Single Edge razors is a bit tricky but fun once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Not bad, sharp out of the package.</li>
            <li>He definitely got a better shave than with the previous blades he had.</li>
            <li>the Merkur Razor Double Edge Razor and this little box of blades is great because it comes with a little slot on the bottom side where you can put your old used blades!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind throwing your blade out every few shaves, these are fine for the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exactly what I wanted - super sharp</li>
            <li>These are sharp and I get a super close shave with these, but not too close.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp, each blade lasts 5-6 days.</li>
            <li>These blades are very high quality and seems to last longer than those made in America.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to go all out and get some genuine Merkur blades to see if I was missing out.  </li>
            <li>Feather are the sharpest blades so far.</li>
            <li>my old razors never did that.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had been using the old Mach 3 blades and razor and this has completely changed my morning routine.</li>
            <li>They are far cheaper than the cheapest multi-blade or \\&quot;plastic</li>
            <li>Yes, you might suffer one or two minor nicks that require a dab of cotton over the first year of using it, until you get the knack.   </li>
            <li>If you have spare time do your wallet a favor and calculate how much money you will save by switching to double edge razors.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been trying to get through the Astra blades as fast as possible</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve tried this one and Wilkinson Sword Blades.</li>
            <li>The mechanical set up means you have to remove the head completely before you can get to the blade.  </li>
            <li>Having recently migrated back to double edge blades from the multis, I found this blade to be comfortable, reliable, and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>old school shaving equiptment</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; razors over these.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting the professional style soap.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find safety razor blades on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to find them anywhere for that matter.</li>
            <li>i wish i never wasted my money.</li>
            <li>old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>I was much happier with the Astra blades, although I used these as my double edge razor starter set.</li>
            <li>I like that there&#x27;s a place on the underside of the container for used blades- so that they&#x27;re not tossed directly into the trash (to avoid split bags and any harm to trash</li>
            <li>but if you shave frequently, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for a couple of years and shave after a shower with my boar-bristle brush and sensitive shaving cream and still got some razor burn.  </li>
            <li>These razors have been doing the job for a couple months now, and I am happily surprised.</li>
            <li>I fell for the &amp;#34;you need multiple blades in order to get a real close shave&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So there blades are a bit more on the harsh-size (for me at least).</li>
            <li>So far they are performing well.  </li>
            <li>Of note, I have fairly soft skin that is rather sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Given my skin, my razor blade of choice is currently the Dorco Stainless Steel Razor Blades, which is $8 for a pack of 100 blades.  </li>
            <li>I use an old gillette razor and they go will together.</li>
            <li>like it very much so far.  </li>
            <li>and I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far these are my preferred blades.</li>
            <li>but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li>Perhaps, Merkur does this on purpose to introduce newbies to the old fashioned safety razor without being too aggressive of a cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Durability - I noticed no decrease in sharpness or comfort over 4 shaves, so it appears to be very durable and can likely be used</li>
            <li>So far the Astras come close</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE razors since the early 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I rotate them currently, but not afraid to go back to them.</li>
            <li>The razor blades in this pack are very sharp, very resistant to tear and wear and very economic.  </li>
            <li>I fell like they get dull pretty quickly</li>
            <li>They are long lasting and do not corrode easily when stored properly.  </li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s sharp enough to leave me with a shave that&#x27;s close enough to challenge most cartridge razors.</li>
            <li>I used to get razor burn every time I shaved, but these blades are so sharp that&#x27;s not really a problem any more.  </li>
            <li>These are great, sharp, and thin razors.</li>
            <li>It gives a close, comfortable shave and the blades stay sharp for several shaves.</li>
            <li>German made blades that scream quality and make all my other blades seem cheap.</li>
            <li>Every blade has delivered consistent results and I have not suffered a single nick with a month of shaving.  </li>
            <li>They seem super sharp!  </li>
            <li>Last a long time and gives several comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li>While not as sharp as other blades, they are great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The rewards for taking the time to learn to shave properly are certainly worth the risks of a few stray nicks at first.  </li>
            <li>I use these with my Merkur long handled safety razor and they give you a close smooth shave with minimal irritation, and they are far cheaper than any disposable razor or cartridges have ever been.</li>
            <li>and I rarely nick myself, compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>As far as double edge razor blades go, I think these are pretty standard.  </li>
            <li>They would only give me 4-5 decent shaves.  </li>
            <li>Several strokes in different directions and techniques trying to get the blade to cut, only left my face sore and far from smooth.</li>
            <li>No knicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the blue 3-blade disposal razors for the past 30 yrs and had been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I say try any Gillette blades, particularly the Silver Blue or the 7 o clock.</li>
            <li>This blade was supplied with my Merkur Heavy Duty Stainless DE razor, so it was the first I tried out.  </li>
            <li>These give you a much closer shave, and just cut better; they&#x27;re so sharp I can dry shave my face (minus mustache area) without any discomfort</li>
            <li>High quality that you expect from German products!</li>
            <li>These high quality blades are the longest lasting blades I have found.</li>
            <li>These blades are so smooth, and so sharp -- as long as you are dropping [...</li>
            <li>This is apparently the standard baseline that all razor blades are compared to, I&#x27;m assuming because most people get a Merkur HD to start and this usually comes bundled with all Merker safety razors.</li>
            <li>This is, in my opinion, never a good sign for your favorite product.</li>
            <li>I expected quality, and that is exactly what i got.</li>
            <li>Certainly hold up for at least a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.</li>
            <li>They are long lasting and very high quality!</li>
            <li>Dull, would not cut even a one one days growth of my beard constantly pulled and scraped, switch to a better blade</li>
            <li>Each one last me about a week or two, and then I get to throw them out for a brand new one for about a nickel.</li>
            <li>I like the memories the new safety razor brings back, and I get as close a shave with one blade as I did 4!</li>
            <li>So I went back to the new blades.</li>
            <li>&quot;  People have said that these blades are a mite unforgiving to beginners still learning to properly use a double edged razor, but I never had much of a problem.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will never go back to bloated overpriced and not nearly as effective \\&quot;shave</li>
            <li>and this blade seems to be gentle enough so that I&#x27;m not left with razor burn,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave that much and this box of razors will last me a solid year.</li>
            <li>Remember that nothing in the way of quality is the same as it was decades ago when a blade really was a blade in the commercial market.</li>
            <li>but they still perform very well when I use them in my Shaving Factory Heavy Metal Straight Razor.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these blades because I have been unable to find good double edge razor blades in the stores.  </li>
            <li>Since they stay so sharp for so long, after a few weeks, I&#x27;d just rather use a fresh blade then worry about the light rust.</li>
            <li>I am now a Feather only guy as I need a razor that is super sharp and will not drag.</li>
            <li>I will be looking for something a little more sharp.</li>
            <li>Also, these are of a much higher quality than other singles.</li>
            <li>With my new Double Edge Razor and double edge blades, I now get up to 6 or 7 complete shaves</li>
            <li>These bad boys are sharp and best part of all, they aren&#x27;t plastic disposable razors that get tossed in a landfill to sit for eternity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a classic double edged razor (also made by Merkur) for about a year now; and I have to say that I&#x27;ll never go back to \\&quot;shaving systems.\\</li>
            <li>I have a very thick beard, but I have been able to use a blade for two or three weeks.</li>
            <li>The blades (enclosed) are super sharp and despite some heavy use haven&#x27;t lost much sharpness.  </li>
            <li>I tried the \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; blades due to all the positive reviews, but they tore up my face by shaving layers of skin off.  </li>
            <li>started wondering if my memories of great shaves were created by the scores of really bad blades I had just been through.</li>
            <li>I only tried one so far</li>
            <li>They do not last like the old ones</li>
            <li>He back shaving the old way</li>
            <li>However the cost saving versus Gillette products is considerable, so even if it only lasts 5 shaves instead of 7</li>
            <li>Maybe I expected too much</li>
            <li>only word of caution- unlike American multi-bladed razors meant to be ripped across your face as fast as possible</li>
            <li>Definitely overpriced as far as blades go.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only tested this set.  </li>
            <li>Of course, as far as I know, it&#x27;s all personal preference.</li>
            <li>I have learned a lot being a noob to safety razors, like having your facial hair hot and wet before shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have had electric, blades and all the trendy razors, all expensive and did not work.</li>
            <li>Like many others I was tired of paying through the nose for cartrige-style blades and wanted another option.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m guessing they are just not very sharp.</li>
            <li>but after a few shaves the merkur is still like new and the Astra not so much...</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is new to DE shaving and this is the blade that came with his Merkur long handled razor.</li>
            <li>Got these with my new Merkur 180 long handle razor.  </li>
            <li>hair stubble that grown from single blade such as this produced a much sharper end.</li>
            <li>These Merkur blades just aren&#x27;t sharp, consistent, or durable enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>With disposable razors, after shaving the first leg, the razor is never as sharp for the second leg.</li>
            <li>You do have to be a little more careful simply because they are so sharp, but that&#x27;s really the only drawback.  </li>
            <li>They can and will last a long time as long as you clean rinse and dry them after every use.  </li>
            <li>great starter blades but a little expensive.</li>
            <li>Sharp and ready to go</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how they stack up against other DE brands, but I&#x27;m getting a much closer shave than I was with the Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li>They are of course sharp and the also seem to hold their edge really well.</li>
            <li>When thinking about a razor I like mine sharp not to much rust.</li>
            <li>I get a bit too much irritation from this brand and other German-made blades.</li>
            <li>Super sharp - just as expected.</li>
            <li>It was seriously tugging at my beard rather than smoothly shaving.</li>
            <li>I wanted to return to my earlier year with the old Gillette double edge razor...</li>
            <li>There are multiple choices for razor blades from all over the world (England/Russia/India/Pakistan/Turkey/Japan) and multiple vendors selling sample packs to help you in your search, prices range from $0.10 to $0.50 per blade with shipping, so choose wisely young shaving Jedi.</li>
            <li>I have went through multiple different brands and styles of razor blades all with nicks and burns as i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this blades for the last 6 months and no complaints so far, I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I do have a soft spot for german made stuff because quality is a given, so I have bought several containers of these blades.</li>
            <li>They are pretty sharp and last about 3 times for my husband, but he has a very coarse beard</li>
            <li>There are some reviews that are not so positive about these blades, especially when they are compared to other blades such as &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Overall 5 stars for Merkur&#x27;s blades and 5 stars for Merkur in general.</li>
            <li>Sharpest blades and they last much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li>These work well are sharp and last a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>The Merkur Double Edge Blades are very durable and sharp.  </li>
            <li>They create a close shave and as long as you rinse the razor out frequently, they will not cut your face.</li>
            <li>After some months I came back and tried them again with a marked improvement but found in a Open Comb razor these things are actually usable.</li>
            <li>I got a few burns with this razor blade in my Merkur 23c but it was my first time shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>My only minor complaint is just that one can easily cut oneself on the edge of the blade when removing it from the package.</li>
            <li>This blade is not sharp enough for my beard, especially on the reverse pull, it sticks and rips the roots.</li>
            <li>I am new to wet shaving, so I have nothing to compare them to as of yet.</li>
            <li>These are high quality blades that have an exceptionally sharp edge.</li>
            <li>I will also update this review later.&lt;br /&gt;Sharpness - seemed sharp, but the amount of hair removed in each pass was not as high as I expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These can be snapped in half and used with disposable blade straight razor handles.</li>
            <li>The blade seems sharper and it seems to hold it&#x27;s edge much longer than the ones I was using previously.  </li>
            <li>My facial hair grows out ridiculously even, that it actually feels smooth because it grows out so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since used the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand razors, which are much sharper and cause much less irritation for me.  </li>
            <li>I am new to the double edge blade and wet shaving</li>
            <li>I have a very tough beard, these razors weren&#x27;t very sharp for me, it took two or three of these blades just to get one good shave, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these blades.</li>
            <li>Easy to install, last longer than regular blades, gives a balanced shave for my tough facial hairs.</li>
            <li>I change my blades every week, shaving every other day, and even brand new, these blades cause irritation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just changed the blade after 2 1/2 weeks and said it was still sharp but wanted to see if he could shave closer with a new blade.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating due to how well this blade works with my new Merkur 34c safety razor &amp; my vintage Hoffritz (Merkur) slant &amp; Hoffritz</li>
            <li>Seem to be sharp enough and I got several shaves out of them before having to get a new one.</li>
            <li>They are beyond imagination sharp and hold their edge for at least one to two weeks easily.  </li>
            <li>To be fair I have heard the Merkur DE razors can have a bad rep on the Badger and Blade forums.</li>

            <li> For safety razor blades, the best from Japan, Russia, and India are much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good blade.</li>
            <li> I used 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5+1 blades for 20 years before I realized that all I needed was 1 good blade.  </li>
            <li> If you need a good blade man up and buy Feather.  </li>
            <li> Good quality product,</li>
            <li> One razor is good for about a month so 10 blades?</li>
            <li> Had one years ago and remembered how good it worked.</li>
            <li> It snagged and nicked me and just didn&#x27;t give me a good shave like my Feather blades.</li>
            <li> I have had good results with blades maufactured by Merkur, Feather, and Gilette 7 O&#x27;clock.</li>
            <li> They work good</li>
            <li> These are good for a noob but don&#x27;t give quite as close shave as the feather blades</li>
            <li> Good value if you like safety razor shaving.  </li>
            <li> Good quality blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> A good product.  </li>
            <li> Disposable razors and even supposedly good razors with replaceable blades couldn&#x27;t even come close.  </li>
            <li> All Good</li>
            <li> I found these razors weren&#x27;t as good as the feather</li>
            <li> Gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li> A good choice that I will continue to make.</li>
            <li> Durable good blade.  </li>
            <li> Good bargain.</li>
            <li> Along with the razor device itself, these blades are superior.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a shave this good in years.</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> Best razor blades I&#x27;ve used gives me a baby smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It was good for the things i had to use it for</li>
            <li> so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Superior construction.  </li>
            <li> It feels good to have located this razor.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t had any problems with these causing irritation for him except when his face was sunburned, even though he has fairly sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth cut and best of all no nicks or cuts .</li>
            <li> These provide a wonderful smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li> good razors.  </li>
            <li> Razors good for a week usage (6X)</li>
            <li> These blades give me a good shave, but it tugs a lot on my hair, causing a substantial amount of irritation.</li>
            <li> My understanding was that they would be good for 3-5 shaves</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> ] bucks on a razor, splurge and get the good blades.</li>
            <li> Good blade</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the Feathers for about 3 weeks now and although they&#x27;re good</li>
            <li> Good blades for the price</li>
            <li> Does deliver a close shave so that part is good</li>
            <li> Good blades.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> try others to see what is a good match.</li>
            <li> I thought Murker made good blades.</li>
            <li> These razors seemed to perform just as good as any others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> He loved it all.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re particularly good blades, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try others, since a scar from surgery on my throat makes double-edge shaving impractical.</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality blade and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> ~5 good shaves from 1 blade.  </li>
            <li> Fair blades.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Exceptional.</li>
            <li> good quality  nice gift with a good razor</li>
            <li> shipped quick and arrived in excellent shape.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the shave.  </li>
            <li> They are worth experimenting with, but not the best blade out there.</li>
            <li> These blades help make shaving a very enjoyable experience for me.</li>
            <li> The shave from these razors is very smooth!</li>
            <li> love this great quality</li>
            <li> The packaging is great and the fact that they are made in Germany makes me feel much better about the quality.</li>
            <li> While the Merkur blades are really good, they certainly aren&#x27;t the best.</li>
            <li> For fun, I conducted my own consumer test on a variety of blades to see which provided (A) the best shave and (B) lasted the longest.</li>
            <li> I find like most others using a good silver tip badger brush , pre shave oil and a good shave cream also helps.</li>
            <li> I bought the product first time 2 years ago and they are great ever!</li>
            <li> Not any more!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> The best choice seems pretty self-evident to this reviewer.</li>
            <li> My favorite blades!  </li>
            <li> And I love his face after he shaves with it- nice!</li>
            <li> I really love this blade and will always keep it in my rotation!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love these blades!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Merkur blades since the first one installed with the razor.</li>
            <li> I love the Merkur-Razor Blades!</li>
            <li> First set of blades after changing over from a multi blade cartrige and I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> Love the shave!</li>
            <li> razor is outstanding!</li>
            <li> I am sure he will use these blades from now on!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to Feathers from now on!</li>
            <li> They are good quality and do a great job of giving me a clean cut shave.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blade are great if you break out easy or get razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Great price and shipped very quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, these are still a good blade, but not nearly the best that I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> The price for the quality was amazing.</li>
            <li> I liked the sharpness.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I was paying $7.50 for 10 blades, so this was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> That price is more than fair for the quality of these blades.  </li>
            <li> These give a nice cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaves skin more than hair..not a good quality..will throw away and go mack to mach 3</li>
            <li> They shave nicely and don&#x27;t take off any flesh</li>
            <li> Provides a nice shave with ample durability.  </li>
            <li> Each face and safety razor will have it&#x27;s own blade.  </li>
            <li> These are good blades, but not my top choice.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for the great customer experience!</li>
            <li> I never know what kind of blades to buy.</li>
            <li> From reading, this is where merkur comes from, and the city is known for making the best straight edge razors.</li>
            <li> If I have any kind of stubble, they don&#x27;t do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I found I still get a closer shave with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May try another Merkur as it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> Packaged nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice blades, provide a nice shave too.</li>
            <li> The absolute best shaving razor blade ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone thinking about doing any kind of shaving.</li>
            <li> High quality and great materials makes a blade that gives a great shave every time.  </li>
            <li> perfect blade for a high end razor.</li>
            <li> (You know the Germans always make good stuff right? :p)</li>
            <li> I prefer a mild, smooth shave and Merkur is one of the three blades I use and the best of the three.</li>
            <li> If you are new get a sampler of blades and see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> are a great and cheap option that in my opinion ends up much better for the consumer and the environment.</li>
            <li> Fits your hand very easily.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and change blades</li>
            <li> Good blade for price and shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li> It makes it so easy and much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> The blade is very good to my skin and it is very forgiving if you get sloppy/careless in your technique in shaving.  </li>
            <li> I own and love my Merkur Razor.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!!</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> By far the cheapest and best shave I have had.</li>
            <li> These razors are great , awesome quality and much cheaper than buying a modern razor.</li>
            <li> Wonderful choice of blade that offers up a level of skin protection that some others don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for most guys ,but use a good pre-shave oil and a light amount of shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had much better success with Feather, Astro, and recently happy with Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock SharpEdge.</li>
            <li> Good and Clean shave, the blades do no nick, cut or anything.</li>
            <li> The first blade was great -- sharper than the Personna brand (from Wal-Mart)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the first blade and it works great.  </li>
            <li> As a first time DE shaver, these were great to start with.  </li>
            <li> Not bad but not that good.</li>
            <li> The description posted was very accurate.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;These blades offer a very comfortable shave for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and close shaving when used with Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> provide a very smooth shave</li>
            <li> Some people may find them more suitable to their shaving style, so try several brands and choose the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li> Good quality and reasonably price!!</li>
            <li> but I recall getting better shaves when I 1st started using these.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I need to get better.  </li>
            <li> I hear these blades can be unforgiving, and in a more aggressive razor I would believe it.</li>
            <li> Holds an edge better than feathers.</li>
            <li> After that, most of them never got used.  </li>
            <li> I love these blades.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get as many shaves out of them as I would like.</li>
            <li> and yet they provide a close shave that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I love LOVE love</li>
            <li> and I have not shaved with this style razor in many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> These blades were better than the Shark blades I was using before.</li>
            <li> I do not know why America can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t make quality consumer products any more</li>
            <li> Not one face cut and most strokes don&#x27;t have to be repeated and my beard is like wire.</li>
            <li> Will not buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> Best values per shave overall.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to them you&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> I had heard so much about Merkur&#x27;s great reputation that I knew there must have been a mistake.</li>
            <li> Price was excellent compared to traditional store.</li>
            <li> They may work for some people, but another brand works better for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I remembered to order the blades.</li>
            <li> These bladed work with my face much better</li>
            <li> Would buy more of these though.</li>
            <li> any help would be great thanks.</li>
            <li> I have now started using the Merkur blades and they seem to work better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still better than the mach 3 cartridges I use to buy that were like $8+ for four.  </li>
            <li> but I have found that I like the feather blades better.  </li>
            <li> They are sharper, give a better shave, and hold their edge better than these Merkurs,</li>
            <li> These blades are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Probably the best I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different safety razors</li>
            <li> And, much better than a $45.00 four pack of blades</li>
            <li> What more can one say about razorblades?</li>
            <li> Make sure you.</li>
            <li> Cheap if you ask me!</li>
            <li> These are nice blades, be careful, take your time and they give an excellent shave</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> plan to try Feather blades next time, as I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re even sharper, but these are great and you won&#x27;t regret buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting to many cuts on my face</li>
            <li> so you cant ask for more.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are much better for me than Derbys which are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> At this point I think feather are my favorite</li>
            <li> It could be my whiskers more than the blade</li>
            <li> but I thought I should get more shaves per blade than what I do.</li>
            <li> just nice and smooth close shaves.</li>
            <li> What more do you need out of a razor blade?</li>
            <li> Blades are not included with most razors.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> If you never shave with a DE razor you will have to learn to take your time,but you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> These are way better than what one can buy at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> i feel this blade could be better.</li>
            <li> I found the Astra better based on number of blades.</li>
            <li> They provide an ultra close shave and were shipped promptly, packaged well, and better than advertised.</li>
            <li> use to cut myself more often with thess blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more competative price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> He had forgotten how much better a shave he gets with these~</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> He is considering getting a sampler when he runs out so he can see if sharper or duller is better for him.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the razor blades that I ordered.  </li>
            <li> but I have learned you can get more life out of them by taking apart your razor and drying the parts off.  </li>
            <li> nice and cheap.  </li>
            <li> There are much better blades out there.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s perfect as an outside to</li>
            <li> I get much better results with the no-name blades that CVS sells and Wilkinson Sword sold by Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also platinum coated like Gilette, can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Six issues was the most I would get out of a blade before it started hacking my face</li>
            <li> These Merkur DE blades seem to be okay.</li>
            <li> These razors work well, but there are better and cheaper options out there for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely One of the best blades that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still testing different blades and haven&#x27;t settled on which one is going to work best for me.  </li>
            <li> I believe my favorite is another German-made blade, the Wilkinson Sword.  </li>
            <li> Top rate razors.</li>
            <li> and this is the only blade that is flawless after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor is definitely better than some on the market, but not the make or break or razors.</li>
            <li> but wished they lasted more than 2 to 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> And if you can get 5 or more shaves from a FEATHER then that too is a better deal than these blades.  </li>
            <li> You must also spend more time prepping your beard with hotter water if you decide to use the Merkur blades.  </li>
            <li> If you want blades that provide the most shaves per blade, try Astra or Personna Med Prep.  </li>
            <li> He loves it &amp; will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m just one ridiculously handsome man ... ...  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure there may be better out there.</li>
            <li> Wilkinson Sword works much better for me and my razor.</li>
            <li> Love the weight of the razoras well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with my decision and purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve totally changed my opinion of these blades, and think they are GREAT!  </li>
            <li> and I think there are better values out there for the price.  </li>
            <li> Now I will say this - they are more forgiving than the Feather</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I started, as many do, with a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will be better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others but I will soon and update.</li>
            <li> After so many years of the marketing ploys of 2 blades then 3 now 5 blades for the closest shave.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades, and the cost is great.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, a YEAR or more.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Gives the best shave possible at a way more affordable price than the  fancy razors you buy for $5-$10/each at the market or drug stores.</li>
            <li> but I get better shaves with the Dorco and dollar store blades.</li>
            <li> that is OK with the price I got them for.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased a Merkur Futur safety razor along with these blades and am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought these along side the razor, love that replacing a blade is all that is required.</li>
            <li> I will buy more...</li>
            <li> All of those cost at most $25 to $35 per hundred delivered to your door.  </li>
            <li> While the feathers work a bit better, I find the Merkurs work almost as well in my Merkur 34C HD.</li>
            <li> the more you get used to it the faster you get</li>
            <li> I love the 2 pass BBS shave I get with feathers, the lack of dragging on my neck and lack of irritation.</li>
            <li> Double Edge Razor Blades are the best.</li>
            <li> But I willno longer pay top dollar for Merkurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is great, shipping was fast, and they arrived in appropriate packaging.</li>
            <li> I tried these blades in my Merkur 43C and really love them.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> For the price, there are better blades.</li>
            <li> I feel that there are much better options for the price;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with these</li>
            <li> Worked much better with the Derby extras.  </li>
            <li> He has had many cuts on his head and thinking of returning.</li>
            <li> Even though my technique isn&#x27;t very refined, I&#x27;m yet to cut myself and I&#x27;m getting great shaves with them.</li>
            <li> You can even flip them over and use them a couple more times</li>
            <li> Worth a try though, good blade to learn technique.</li>
            <li> Great blades they came fast</li>
            <li> Good blades, not as sharp as Gillette or Feather, but still a good blade and a good value.  </li>
            <li> Combine these blades with a nice Merkur handle, some good shaving cream, and a decent badger hair brush</li>
            <li> Although my Merkur Safety Razor came with its original blade, I changed it today and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> The Merkurs are FAR superior!</li>
            <li> Great price for blades and they seems to do a decent job shaving.</li>
            <li> These razor blades work great with my Merkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor.  </li>
            <li> Blades are ultra high quality and are a great price.</li>
            <li> High quality and great value.</li>
            <li> Merkur double edge blades are in my opinion the best on the market - their staying power is incredible lasting shave after shave - couple these blades with the Merkur razor and you have a winning combination .</li>
            <li> Its been good and consistent since then.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, high quality blades.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a point of reference in order to compare them to other blades but they fit perfectly into my Merkur safety razor and give me a nice shave.</li>
            <li> the quality of these bladed proves it!!</li>
            <li> These blades work great and came with my new Merkur Razor.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though I&#x27;ve experienced a dullness from newly installed razors.</li>
            <li> If you want something that&#x27;s a good combination of sharpness and smoothness that is cheap buy the Astras which rarely exceed $11 per hundred.  </li>
            <li> I bought him these as replacements and am sure that they will be just as easy to use as the one that came with it.</li>
            <li> and I think they are better than Dorcos and even Astras, but just very mild and give an inconsistent spotty shave compared to Feathers on my face.</li>
            <li> Good blades, good price gotta love double edged blades so cheap and so much better for shaving.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what more to post on these, great price, great product.</li>
            <li> All of the blades were wrapped in their parrafin wrappers, but I was not too impressed to get a loose pack of blades with no outer covering.</li>
            <li> Very good quality double edge razor</li>
            <li> but I have to say I was surprised by what a great shave I get with these razors.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok but not as smooth and as close as others like Wilkinson, Shark, and Astra for me.</li>
            <li> These blades are so much better than today&#x27;s so called advanced technology multi-blades.</li>
            <li> Do want to spend one dollar a month for blades and enjoy close safe shaves?</li>
            <li> Great Razors for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save money, have better skin, smell nicer, and actually enjoy shaving, instead of looking at it as a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far they are working great.  </li>
            <li> Great blade so far.  </li>
            <li> Tried a lot of razors, these hold their edge, reasonably priced, and are consistently good shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their other tools are great though!!</li>
            <li> Let me warn you they are PERFECT really SHARP</li>
            <li> kids can&#x27;t get to them easily...</li>
            <li> My shave was closer than before and very quick, even when I went against the grain .However</li>
            <li> The next day I tried a fresh blade in the pack and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Easy to install in safety razor.  </li>
            <li> No pulling just an easy glide across my face.</li>
            <li> Seems to easily dig into my skin regardless of my angle or pressure.  </li>
            <li> I love shaving now, takes a bit more time, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the Mercur Razor and blades its the best quality heavy dont buy any cheaper razor or blade.</li>
            <li> Packaged well and easy to use...not just layer in a box.</li>
            <li> My neck is easily irritated, so this is a winner for me.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> The dispenser box makes it easy to use</li>
            <li> Good product, Cheap price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and it was easy to load them into the razor.</li>
            <li> Merkur blades are very mild.</li>
            <li> This razor was great until it became locked up and couldn&#x27;t turn the handle to open the top to replace the razor.  </li>
            <li> Received very quickly.....</li>
            <li> These razor blades have made shaving an easy endeavor.</li>
            <li> I still get a decent shave, but not as good as the 1st.  </li>
            <li> Lather up really well using a good brush and get a smooth shave with these quality blades.</li>
            <li> Good contemporary option for the safety razor.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Feather, but decent.</li>
            <li> perfect fit in the red sleeve, unlike the full size dovo blades which don&#x27;t seem to fit well at all.</li>
            <li> Works great, price is right, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp for a great price.</li>
            <li> These are good blades, perfect for someone just starting with a Double Edge razor.  </li>
            <li> Excellent (very sharp) razor blades.</li>
            <li> These razors are fine.</li>
            <li> would like to add that Merkur makes exceptionally fine razors as well as blades.</li>
            <li> cream (Proraso and Cremo both work fine).</li>
            <li> hey at the price that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> These seem to be working just fine for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a easy smooth shve for men or women, this is the blade for you.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not super impressed.</li>
            <li> Should have read the fine print.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> However, I am less than impressed with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> it wrong&amp;#34; — and with one-day&#x27;s gristle these blades work fine — </li>
            <li> If you want the very best combination of smoothness and sharpness, I&#x27;d recommend the Gillette Silver Blues, Polsilver, Gillette Platinum or Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Black.  </li>
            <li> And there are better options out there if you are looking for a mild blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great razors,, smooth i&#x27;ve tried other double edge razor and found the Merkur to be very good... will be buying more</li>
            <li> They last nearly a week of perfect shaves before dulling for me, so they are definitely easy on the budget!</li>
            <li> These Merkur blades will certainly make do in a pinch, but if you want a good nexus of sharpness, durability and low cost, try the Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li> Super sharp Blades that work perfect!</li>
            <li> By far the best performing blade I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> More than I expected, great value and will be a repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut and pull hair either -- a huge problem I&#x27;ve had with the hair on my chin.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of these blades.</li>
            <li> There was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> nice blades, really cuts smooth, and close.  </li>
            <li> Work very well, give a nice smooth shave</li>
            <li> However the DE89 isn&#x27;t very aggressive, so it matches nicely with these blades, giving me a close shave with fewer passes.</li>
            <li> light, smooth strokes</li>
            <li> These blades really give a nice close shave</li>
            <li> The Schick Quattro blades are also available, package of 8, for $21.99.</li>
            <li> The Merkur seems to fit me best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a master now and the shave is baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth and close shave.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I bought these to go along with the Merkur Double Edge #34C razor and they work great.</li>
            <li> These things shave smooth as butter.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone wanting a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> i like coz they cheap</li>
            <li> Holds its edge and provides for a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Both shave great, but value is key here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so cheap sometimes)</li>
            <li> I have a light to medium beard</li>
            <li> Smooth and aggressive all in one.</li>
            <li> but I wished it would fit snuggly in holder.</li>
            <li> Having returned to a double edge razor after years and years of using the multi-blade types I am extremely happy with these blades.  </li>
            <li> They give me a close, comfortable shave</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Cuts smooth and even.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem as smooth.  </li>
            <li> An exceptionally smooth shave once I got into the rhythm of shaving with a safety razor again.</li>
            <li> Hold the blade lightly against the skin.</li>
            <li> Lather up with a quality shave cream (I use Dreadnought) and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Not quite as smooth as the \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; brand blades</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Giving a closes smooth shave always.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But unless your Father in Law has an enormous stash then you&#x27;ll be happy with these.</li>
            <li> He has a light beard and raves about these blades.</li>
            <li> I tried and tried but it never got as close as the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> and I thoroughly enjoy shaving with them.</li>
            <li> (I got Merkur blades to test for free).</li>
            <li> but once i tightened it again, smooth shaving returned.</li>
            <li> My second favorites were Feather, from Japan, and until something else really great comes along</li>
            <li> I enjoy the shave they give.  </li>
            <li> I got a close baby smooth shave without any cuts.</li>
            <li> Provided a smooth shave with no razor burn, cuts, etc.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to fit a razor I bought for my husband from The Art Of Shaving.</li>
            <li> And they last a great deal longer as well.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell how good they and how many shaves</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> This product is a good quality and value, but I have found that Astra has better performance for the same price.  </li>
            <li> , these don&#x27;t have a safety wire wrapped around them, so take slower, more controlled strokes, and make sure to pull the razor exactly straight across your skin</li>
            <li> I use , so far so good .</li>
            <li> Such a good price for so many.</li>
            <li> Still using the first blade, supposedly should be able to get 6 shaves out of each, I&#x27;m at 4 and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the merkur blades, very easy to shave with and so far I have used the same blade for a month, getting ready to order more.</li>
            <li> Kind of remind one how clean cut this kind of blade does for facial hair!</li>
            <li> Good blades, nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> But overall my 1st shave with these blades were very nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one experience using these razor blades, but they were very effective</li>
            <li> Merkur blades are decent, as each blade works differently for everyone I can&#x27;t say they won&#x27;t be the best for you.</li>
            <li> Merkur Blade gives me a smooth and clean shave, even against the grain.</li>
            <li> Great razors,, im a true believer in german engineering and</li>
            <li> NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] that I had were still the best that I have used.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I originally began with these blades because I also purchased a Merkur brand razor.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend ordering anything from CashCo1000 unless you are willing to wait the better part of a month to receive it.</li>
            <li> The quality of these blades is a lot better than the name brand 2-5 blade ones being marketed at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li> My original review is below, and as someone who reads and appreciates feedback, I needed to send in an updated review.  </li>
            <li> Once again,these German made, like most things German, are flawless.</li>
            <li> It was great, but it takes a long time to shave with.  </li>
            <li> Admitting that, I found this blade to cause a significant amount of knicks and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> After all the reviews I was excited for these to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> It is a process, but still excited about the advantages of saving money with it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad these were my first experience.  </li>
            <li> These are the first blades I&#x27;ve tried as a DE shaver, and I&#x27;m glad I started with these.</li>
            <li> Cuts my fine mustache hairs and delicate nose hairs flawlessly.</li>
            <li> At the price that they are, I could probably afford to replace them much more often, but I don&#x27;t really see the need because they seem to be working fine.</li>
            <li> The best brand of double edge razor blazes so far.</li>
            <li> These blades are well made and give me a clean close shave every time.</li>
            <li> I usually clean the blades well after shaving to preserve the edges.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean (probably in part because it has no gummy &#x27;lubricants&#x27; clogging things up...).</li>
            <li> He loves shaving with them, and they give him an affordable, clean shave.  </li>
            <li> Gives a clean shave every time.  </li>
            <li> Take out and clean</li>
            <li> The clear best double edge blade on the market.</li>
            <li> These are good for about two shaves and then they drag and nick me if I use them any more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you can get a much closer, more comfortable shave than with the Merkur razor blade.  </li>
            <li> but you learn how to use them quickly with no cuts or abrasions and just make sure you soften your skin with hot water and lather up ......</li>
            <li> Not very expensive, and warm and comfortable after the first use.</li>
            <li> The packaging was the right size and the razors come out of the holders easily.</li>
            <li> Shaving using a single blade may seems really old school and requires good shaving skills, but it does give a good clean shave, and for the price paid, nothing else come close.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> These are excellent blades and sometimes hard to find in the store.  </li>
            <li> They also last longer so the price difference is not as great as it first appears.</li>
            <li> Bout some with my first DE razor assuming they would be great because they are German made</li>
            <li> great if your starting out straight razor shaving too!</li>
            <li> The blades I think are good quality and last about 5 shaves</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really blame this on Merkur alone, is that I can&#x27;t shave against the grain with a DE razor which means I have to shave more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad i ditched the gillette razors and went with a Merkur straight razor and safety razor</li>
            <li> I have to say that I have never had such a good shave.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the switch from modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Good price, last 3-4 shaves</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think these blades could be any better than they already are.</li>
            <li> I just started DE shaving and even though I am enjoying the whole process</li>
            <li> I could really use either blade, but like the Feathers slightly better.  </li>
            <li> In the interest of full disclosure here though, it takes me about three days do grow visible stubble.</li>
            <li> and so glad he received the whole shaving set</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the reviews stating that they are just as good as the double or triple bladed counterparts.  </li>
            <li> I love these platinum coated stainless steel blades and I suggest you replace the blades after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I really like my Merkur razors and am really enjoying \\&quot;shaving with a brush\\&quot; again.</li>
            <li> Sweet safety razor blades</li>
            <li> I have gotten a much better shave from blades that are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not as good as feather but a close second.</li>
            <li> do a good job and keeping my 5&#x27;oclock shadow from coming back 2 hours after I&#x27;ve shaved.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it more than anything else, because nothing gives you a shave quite like a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> The case is nice because you can put your old blades in the bottom when you are done.</li>
            <li> Razors last for a good number of shaves.</li>
            <li> Here it was - a true test.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend, they are his absolute favorite blades for shaving his face.</li>
            <li> Overall good comfort.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more than 3 weeks, but that&#x27;s about as much as I get out of these blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor and am happy so far.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t take any longer to shave with, as you never have to go over areas multiple times, but you will spend more time getting everything nice and clean on the first pass.  </li>
            <li> I find that shaving with a single edge blade after years of using a multi - bladed razor is challenging to get the best out of the shaving experience with these single blades.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and give a great shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality steel, has lasted me several shaves on the first blade so far.  </li>
            <li> They are neither exceptionally sharp nor especially smooth.  </li>
            <li> Last for a good long time when paired with a good razor.</li>
            <li> These are as good or possibly better than your drug store blades, although a little pricey.</li>
            <li> My husband says these razors work so much better than all these new razors with 2, 3 and 4 blades!  </li>
            <li> Good price, very sharp, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Super blades.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and quick.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a dot of cocoa butter lotion with the lucky tiger</li>
            <li> Seems too mild with the merkur safety blade, which I understand to be on the milder side amongst DE razor options.</li>
            <li> Both are very satisfactory and very cost effective.</li>
            <li> These blades are good so far as I have gotten a very close shave.</li>
            <li> They are decent for learning but I can&#x27;t get more than two days of shaving out of them before they start tearing up my face something fierce.</li>
            <li> The sales associate at my local mall touted these as &#x27;the best double edge razors on the market&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be better the next time.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Later reviews will quantitatively compare different blades on a 1 to 10 scale with 10 being best.  </li>
            <li> Many reviewers have given these blades high review.</li>
            <li> These work very good at cutting and nice and smooth shave, but-</li>
            <li> Love the double edged blades, the are great and perform and out last the othger blades</li>
            <li> You could feel the change from the very first shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li> With that said, I think its done my skin good for the long run.</li>
            <li> I was just wondering if someone who has used could just let me know how long the blades are good for before you need to change them?</li>
            <li> Not only is it as good, but it is in some instances better since I am able to purchase more razors for far less cost, the razor makes for a closer and more confidant shave, and the product exudes far more confidence.</li>
            <li> Precisely made with easy application and ease of removing and replacing with new blade.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> ; shave better than a new cut rate blade.</li>
            <li> Love these blades with my new Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the blades available when purchasing the long handled safety razor.  </li>
            <li> VERY close shave!!</li>
            <li> Just be aware, this is just 10 blades!</li>
            <li> very fussy....FIVE STARS!!</li>
            <li> A little pre-info, I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL razor and EJ best badger brush with Lucky Tiger aftershave, and either proraso sensitive shaving soap or Dr Harris Lavender shaving soap (I like them both).  </li>
            <li> great buy, wish they were a little cheaper</li>
            <li> My favorite blades, pretty sharp, glides over face nicely, leaves me with no razor burn.  </li>
            <li> They are not the sharpest (I would go with Feathers or Sharks if you want really sharp), but they seem to work pleasantly in my Merkur razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the razor we ordered previously and was very happy that we could order the same blades that originally came with the razor..</li>
            <li> Maybe not the best choice for a beginner, as there are others blades that are less sharp and more forgiving.  </li>
            <li> A great deal and last a good while, maybe about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves before they get too dull</li>
            <li> Double edge safety razors take a bit longer to shave with but the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> quality product fit is perfect..how much can you say about razor blades</li>
            <li> but it gives a really close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> He also feels that it&#x27;s more economical because beyond the initial purchase of the metal razor the blades are relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> Better than what is available locally.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite blade used feather as well.</li>
            <li> but I am pleased so far with Merkur.     </li>
            <li> Wish they were cheaper but worth it.  </li>
            <li> Nice German razor blades.</li>
            <li> The individual wrapping is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I love this razor, like shaving with straight razor, very close shave....</li>
            <li> Worth a try if you like a blade.</li>
            <li> Using the search engine of your choice, seek out the several popular shaving blogs and online vendors.</li>
            <li> Overall it was not the most comfortable</li>
            <li> She has had so much fun with it both indoors and out.  </li>
            <li> I will say that since everyone&#x27;s face/beard is different you may have better results with another brand, so try several different types to see what suits you best.</li>
            <li> But certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> The razors last more than 2 weeks each, and give a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> He really liked them, and I will be ordering these in the future!</li>
            <li> OK AS FAR AS BLADES GO</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, so far they are just OK.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty sweet when you do.</li>
            <li> They seem ok so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a lot calmer and more soothing to shave this way, and possibly even a touch faster, and the result is superior.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a fun idea at the time.</li>
            <li> Quality craftsmanship and so worth the price.</li>
            <li> Work great for my sensitive skin and can be considered middle of the road blades...</li>
            <li> You can find far sharper and smoother blades than these at a much better price (Personna Blue, Astra Superior Platinum, Feather Hi Stainless) here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The blades are a little more pricy than other blades however, in comparison to the latest 5 blade razor they are still a great deal.</li>
            <li> Has remained sharp even after a dozen uses, will be interesting to see how many uses I get before I have to change the blade.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these blades as they give a very good cut with nicks, bumps nor razor burn on my face after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are sharp but not as sharp as feathers of course but give a clean and soft cut.</li>
            <li> The Astra or Derby Blades in particular give a better smoother shave and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> good item i like better than does gillets at walmart to much money in ordinary razors</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to stay with the Merkur that seem to be sharp and do a good job for me.</li>
            <li> Just right</li>
            <li> The blades came in on time and worked splendidly right out of the box.</li>
            <li> once you found the right blade to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Yes that&#x27;s right two weeks</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t the right blade for my skin type.</li>
            <li> They provide just the right balance for my needs, not to aggressive.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> after use i take them out of the razor, wash in warm water, dry and put back in the handy &amp;#34;drawer&amp;#34; each box has, remember-water-sweat (salt) and oxygen cause corrosion, so i remove 2.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who requires a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> These blades are excellent, except when I order them a couple weeks ago they were $3 less than the current</li>
            <li> : Solid performer, I don&#x27;t like them quite as much as the personna reds but they are better for me than merkur and the ones I choose to purchase because they are wicked cheap on a lot of sites.  </li>
            <li> Loads up too quickly and requires very frequent cleaning with hot water to clean and continue to shave.</li>
            <li> super sharp amazing blades</li>
            <li> I love the Merkir blades, they are both sharp and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> But these are great blades and stay sharp for a good amount of time ( I dont have a really thick beard)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy  my barber recommended these, bc i have not used a single other blade since.  </li>
            <li> These blades aren&#x27;t bad but not the best, Personna DE blades are better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> If you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors.</li>
            <li> urge you to try a few different kinds to see what works best for your skin type.  </li>
            <li> I bought them because I have a Merkur razor which I like very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Astra: I didn&#x27;t like these very much.  </li>
            <li> and, they are very much closer and the skin is</li>
            <li> Some were sharp and smooth, some seemed to rip my skin more than others.</li>
            <li> So far they seem to be working just fine.  </li>
            <li> I do make sure to clean them off after every shave though, which probably helps (rinse them off under water and then carefully wipe off any debris with a finger.</li>
            <li> These blades are priced above many reputable brands, but aren&#x27;t particularly sharp, smooth, or durable.  </li>
            <li> Good blade for a beginner, not sharp enough</li>
            <li> I got one regular Merkur blade with a new razor and it is not as good as the super by far.</li>
            <li> Good quality but handle was a little short and would prefer a better method of changing out blades.</li>
            <li> It was still a huge step up from my old Mach 3</li>
            <li> No nicks, scratches, bumps or irritation or burn on my first shave.  </li>
            <li> i like these blades as much as any others!</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about using a DE razor at first</li>
            <li> This was my first set of razor blades.</li>
            <li> I do not know how many shaves I may get from this blade but the first shave was terrific.  </li>
            <li> I bought these when I first started using a DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Need to try different blades to find one that better suits my face.</li>
            <li> Still great blades, but I have a thick jungle of a beard</li>
            <li> First I do a pass in the direction of hair growth, then rinse lather and repeat against the grain.  </li>
            <li> the switch will pay for itself in under a year, clearing up lots of extra cash for interesting stuff like books or CDs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately they&#x27;re not expensive at all</li>
            <li> But like I said my first time even use it.</li>
            <li> I love the razors though if you do some research you can find different prices.</li>
            <li> However, I have gone back to the Gillette blades because they really do give a far superior shave.  </li>
            <li> Because this is the first DE blade I&#x27;ve used in forever, I have to cut this some slack.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> I was a newbie using it in a Merkur Futur, which has a pretty steep learning curve&lt;</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose for a short period of time, but the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock is a better blade.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried so many blades, and not all are equal.  </li>
            <li> American made blades are OK</li>
            <li> This is the first brand I have tested</li>
            <li> Merkurs were the first blades I bought for DE shaving.</li>
            <li> But I will come back for more.</li>
            <li> This one blade does a much better job then the 5 blade units that are sold to make you believe that is the only way to a close shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
            <li> Especially like the way you can dispose the used blades in the container to keep them safe.</li>
            <li> His skin is just smooth and soft after shaving with these and his C.O. Bigelow shaving cream(the tube, not the can).</li>
            <li> This is the first de blade that I used.  </li>
            <li> but I think is appropriate so you can get a feel for how this specific blade performs or stacks up to the competition.</li>
            <li> I bought the soap style shaving cream and didn&#x27;t cut myself the first three times.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Gillette Silver Blue, BIC or Wilkinson sword hold up much better.</li>
            <li> nice and heavy for a smooth glide without needing much pressure.</li>
            <li> 2 star rating more because of the price (especially if you include shipping!).</li>
            <li> At first I was scared by the amount of choice I had in blades</li>
            <li> Otherwise I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I recently took the plunge as many would say into DE razors and figured to try these blades first.</li>
            <li> , It got all the hair on both legs the first time.</li>
            <li> These are the first razors I&#x27;ve purchased for my Merkur safety razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all personal, but for me there are better blades.</li>
            <li> Razors seem to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness for that because when I used the Merkur blade for my first shave just to give it a try, it did not reduce my beard at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure my blade preferences will change as I try different brands of blades and become more-experienced using my safety razor.  </li>
            <li> For me most of the blades are similar...</li>
            <li> Product as described, shipped fast, would do it again!</li>
            <li> An overall okay shave.</li>
            <li> First go at using a double-edged safety razor</li>
            <li> Merkur is one of the most reliable for actual razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user and did not have difficulty using them.</li>
            <li> Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> These were included with a razor I purchased, but I&#x27;ll most likely buy them again.  </li>
            <li> And NOT expensive.  </li>
            <li> Consistent quality throughout the package.</li>
            <li> Consistently close shave.</li>
            <li> First shave was on a #4 setting and will try to dial it back and see if it gets better.  </li>
            <li> must first note that these blades did not come in the blister pack that is shown.</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder where exactly they came</li>
            <li> These blades are just okay - especially after you have tried the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Switched to a double-edge safety razor for the first time at age 56.</li>
            <li> Will be buying again soon, thanks!</li>
            <li> Got my first safety razor and needed blades to go with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades but way too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine there is a better Double Edge razor on the market</li>
            <li> Very happy to return to the double edge razor vice the multiple edge models currently on the market.</li>
            <li> Went back to wet shaving and found these blades to be perfect for an old fashioned shave with brush and lather.</li>
            <li> But comparing yourself to Gillette and claiming that it can do a similar or better job is misleading.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using merkur blades</li>
            <li> and and overall pleased with the edge, cost and durability.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the Gillette Platinum (blue box) blades any more, and these were a close</li>
            <li> 6 of them off one blade to be exact.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i need.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I suspect I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or more different safety razor blade brands and none compare to the Merkur.</li>
            <li> These are the BEST alternative to expensive razor blades like the gilette fusion or Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Bought these with a Meker handle, my first Sr.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Here good for a few uses on each blade.</li>
            <li> These blades fit perfectly on my Merkur 34C and last approximately one week for me, shaving 5 days a week.  </li>
            <li> Great blades;sharp, last a long time!</li>
            <li> My old used Astras are better than these new blades.</li>
            <li> In my experience the blade on the Wilkinson Sword seems to cut smoother, with less irritation and provides me with a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are nice and sharp, and last me a week or more.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole old-school wetshaving thing, and like many of the other reviewers here, I am actually enjoying shaving for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp blades get a closer shave with my Merkur C handle.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard and they are the best by far</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> Neat, clean cut on this course curly beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave that often (maybe every 2 weeks) and my hair is thick and this razor cuts through it with no problem after many shaves (a 10 pack lasted more than a year).  </li>
            <li> I think these are also just as good as the sharper Japanese Double Edge Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> Shaving was very time consuming and required multiple strokes and more pressure that I&#x27;d prefer to use on my face with a razor.</li>
            <li> I tried some different blades (Feather &amp; Personna) to go in my Merkur DE safety razor, and these Merkur blades give me the best shave with the least irritation.</li>
            <li> Not only do they provide a close shave, but they also last for fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades and razors and they get nowhere near as smooth as a modern razor.</li>
            <li> People who use these regularly say you&#x27;re going for beard reduction and not a close shave - well then the product is actually not that good.</li>
            <li> To be honest I think Merkur are equal in quality if not a little bit smoother in the shave.</li>
            <li> I believe the trick with a DE razor is to make sure you buy a good one and make should it is closed tightly.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to re-use these blades over and over, I just like being able to know that the blades are not going to get dull after one shave</li>
            <li> These are great blades for my sensitive skin + coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> They were delivered remarkably fast in a first class envelope.</li>
            <li> Smooth, sharp and provides a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> After to much research I was scared the first time I picked up my DE razor with these blades.</li>
            <li> These Merkur blades are as much an improvement over Derby as the safety razor was over cartridges in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is cheap, but it is not as sharp and smooth as my 5 blade shaver.</li>
            <li> downside is the replacement blades are so reasonable that the shipping costs make them higher than they should be.</li>
            <li> He told me he never experienced such a safe, smooth, gliding precise shave!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing different blades now after becoming accustomed to Feathers.</li>
            <li> I will comment on sharpness, durability, and comfort for each blade, but since this is the first modern DE blade i have tried, my comments here will be qualitative.  </li>
            <li> They are far more economical then constantly ordering disposable razors and he swears by their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I love my merkur double edged razor but their replacement blades didn&#x27;t really work very well for me.</li>
            <li> NIce blades but not worth this steep price when Astras are 10 bucks for a pack of 100.</li>
            <li> The blades are probably good but they are too small for the razor.</li>
            <li> I bought the King 47506 1000/6000 combination to sharpen my own blades, takes a lot of technique to get it down</li>
            <li> So they arrived and I immediately put a new razor blade fresh into my Merkur Adjustable Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> and I found the shaving experience less than amazing.</li>
            <li> The second shave still smooth but nothing like the first.</li>
            <li> They come individually wrapped and easy to snap on my razor.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and simple design.</li>
            <li> The shave is nice and close and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Better than the shavers I was using previously from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, and I am not easy to please.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfort - There is slightly more drag feel than with the ProGlide Turbos, but it is not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Have to very careful you will cut your self very easily.  </li>
            <li> good shave but doesn&#x27;t last long compared to Derby in my opinion</li>
            <li> Just go slow, use lots of good hot water and a quality shave</li>
            <li> my be better on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;definitely high quality, i notice only a slight difference between these and feather but a huge difference to the cheap ones at super markets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to find this razor blades in my country, but it&#x27;s great to know that for a small price, I can get them now to use with my safety razor.</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy, and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Dont seem to last more then 2 shaves, though my beard is pretty corse so not totaly unexpected.</li>
            <li> I used to get bumps, cuts, and irritation no matter what I did, but now that I use these very sharp blades with my safety razor, I don&#x27;t get any irritation and I rarely cut myself!!!</li>
            <li> The anticipation of my previous great shaves was immense.</li>
            <li> There is great variation in DE razor blades and really, it will come down to your personal preference.</li>
            <li> Dorko and Gilette were decent - lasted about a week each and rarely cut up the face; shave was decently close.</li>
            <li> I like these because while not as sharp as Feathers they seem to be more consistent than Feathers.  </li>
            <li> This product works just fine, it seems a bit larger than the safety razor that holds it.</li>
            <li> , I think they would last alot longer with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.</li>
            <li> I will say they are very smooth blades and don&#x27;t drag as much as the Astras or the Dorcos</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use a straight razor and don&#x27;t want to invest in the premium ones, this is definitely a close second best (and a lot less work, since you won&#x27;t need to keep your blade honed).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for first time safety razor shavers.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so a razor that is sharp and only requires 1-2 passes is great.</li>
            <li> They seem to last a reasonable number of shaves and are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The fact that each of these razors can last months before replacement, and each of these go about 73c each (which is huge compared to $5 for cartridge razor heads).</li>
            <li> I could not get a very close shave, and when I tried, I ended up hacking my face.  </li>
            <li> and the shipping was fast from the company that sold them.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very confortable</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> These blades cut beard hair very well without looking like a you were just in a hack and slash film.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the real wet-shaving ritual for about a month now, and with my order of the Merkur 1904 \\&quot;#48\\&quot; safety razor came one of the Merkur Supers.</li>
            <li> Product was as described, highly recommend seller!</li>
            <li> Bought these razor from the Art of Shaving store in Crabtree Mall in Raleigh, very dissapointed, rash showed before I could finish shaving and permanently scared my face.</li>
            <li> so I really cannot compare them.</li>
            <li> and they were priced reasonably</li>
            <li> These blades feel sharper, and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Hi stainless.</li>
            <li> If you have never shaved with a real razor then get one and use these blades.</li>
            <li> Not so with a real safety razor.</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> The Israeli blades are very forgiving, but the shave is not as close.  </li>
            <li> He really likes these blades,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced it with a quattro razor and cartidge that works much to my liking.</li>
            <li> I recommend to everyone who wants to try this time tested type of shaving.</li>
            <li> The shave is really close</li>
            <li> an off-the-shelf plastic straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> :  After having used the personnas and the derby&#x27;s off and on for a year (the derby ones are just so cheap sometimes) I have to admit that the derby have grown on me, not only because of the price, but also because I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to their shave.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I just changed to a double edged razor and really enjoy shaving with these blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unimpressed with these blades.</li>
            <li> i have light facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Both cut much smoother and closer.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really like them.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy it immensely.</li>
            <li> and it is very affordable to do so.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this blade.</li>
            <li> I received a smooth effortless shave even after the fourth use.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Platinum, stainless steel?</li>
            <li> A much nicer shave, he says.</li>
            <li> VERY well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> price is reasonable when comparing merkur blades to lessor quality blades.  </li>
            <li> I found a Henckel straight razor.  </li>
            <li> It has the delicacy and precision of a straight razor combined with the ease of a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I get such a close smooth shave</li>
            <li> I went straight in to shave and</li>
            <li> These razor blades work very well.</li>
            <li> I get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> WOuld really recomend them...</li>
            <li> After years of using Mach3  that I still like, but 18 bucks for 5 blades is really getting out of hand.</li>
            <li> I guess from all the reviews I&#x27;ve read, you really have to try and try and try to find what works for you.</li>
            <li> is how I feel after having used up all 5 packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather: Definitely the sharpest by far, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I like these blades when they work, the problem is quality control with at least one or two blades per pack not having or holding a good edge.</li>
            <li> Had a bit of trouble getting right under my nose, but getting better with practice.</li>
            <li> just isnt adequate enough to provide the quality shave I received the first 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> What is not to love, cheap, sharp, and solid well made blades.</li>
            <li> Plenty of other similarly priced blades out there that are way more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of razors with my new safety razor.  </li>
            <li> As for these blades, they&#x27;re the first I used with my new set-up, post-Gillette.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and these were the first blades I tried.</li>
            <li> I got way more nics with these than any other blade I&#x27;ve used and my face would be very tender after a shave.  </li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp blades, but I&#x27;m surprised by their durability.</li>
            <li> With some work I can get a good shave with them, but after only 3 shaves they were significantly duller than other cheaper blades such as the LORD Platinum.  </li>
            <li> The Dorco blades tend to dull quickly, but if you have soft and sensitive skin, it&#x27;s probably a good compromise.</li>
            <li> They give me a better shave and stay sharp longer.</li>
            <li> I consider them more razor dependent than other blades.</li>
            <li> extremely sharp - razor just glides - never had a better shave</li>
            <li> Better than any other blade I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I find that I run through these more since they don&#x27;t start as sharp.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as Feather, but I think I get a better shave from these.</li>
            <li> More shaves and smoother than any other.</li>
            <li> Additionally, these are pretty easy to cut yourself with compared to some other blade brands.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it interesting that big ticket items such as home computers and digital cameras continue to drop in price, making them available to everyone at a reasonable cost, while all the &#x27;Shaving Systems&#x27; and attendant accoutrements continue to skyrocket into the stratosphere?</li>
            <li> These blades works very well paired with the Merkur Classic, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have used Schick trac 2 blades in the past, but this combination works so much better that it was worth the effort to learn to shave over.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for these razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this blade to anyone that is looking for a close shave at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> A little too much resistance but all around solid blade if you get a good price</li>
            <li> nice and sharp!!!</li>
            <li> Best shave ever on my delicate black skin</li>
            <li> Depending on your shaving needs a single razor could last you upward of one month for effective use.</li>
            <li> The blades are smooth and sharp on the first shave.  </li>
            <li> These Merkur blades are better than others, but I would say fairly average for my beard.</li>
            <li> Does not perform any better than any average Gillette blade,</li>
            <li> However, compared to every cartridge razor I have ever used these are hands down so much better.  </li>
            <li> down favorite.</li>
            <li> New blade pulls and just about comes to a stop on beard!</li>
            <li> But then again, I am new to DE razors so maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much.</li>
            <li> Good because they don&#x27;t slice up my face quite as much, bad because they need changing slightly more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought blades at Wal-Mart for less that were better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, I am saving money, by getting more shaves on less costly blades and I am receiving closer</li>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s were recently my favorite (till trying Merkur) -- close shave, lasted about a week and a half, and almost never nicked the skin.</li>
            <li> I will most likely upgrade to an adjustable in the future.</li>
            <li> If you use a double edge safety razor, these are definitely one of the top brands to buy.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I would say this is a decent blade.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it a five star rating is because I thought that the razor would last more than just four shaves before I felt</li>
            <li> I bought a few stack of these for my lovely face, which really appreciates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still looking for decently priced blades though.</li>
            <li> really really worth it to anyone with thick beard hair. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of different brands and will most likely go to others before buying this one again, however, for a beginner just learning how to shave, this works ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 or 3 decent shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> Merkur, without a shadow of a doubt is far superior to all the competitors (at least those in my experiement).</li>
            <li> The main reason I switched from disposable cartridges to this was the cost.</li>
            <li> Because they shave better, and are cheaper, your skin will look better as you won&#x27;t be using an expensive razor 2 weeks longer than you should have, which will decrease irritation, ingrown hairs, and infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Classic product.</li>
            <li> It will take a while to get back to DE for more than one pass, so I still use the mach 3 for a cross grain after using the DE.</li>
            <li> It was obvious from my very first shave that the blades had changed as well.</li>
            <li> Even the highest quality blade can easily be rendered useless in a poorly designed razor so finding one that has the perfect blade exposure can be difficult but the Shaving Factory Heavy Metal Straight Razor meets all my expectations and is the perfect companion for these fine blades.</li>
            <li> :  I highly recommend the product.     </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend these if you decide to go with a safety razor</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these blades</li>
            <li> Given the high ratings for this razor, I opted to buy a pack.  </li>
            <li> The blades are exceptionally high quality</li>
            <li> Came highly recommended.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Most of other people&#x27;s observatons vis-a-vis aggressiveness seem to match my experience so far.  </li>
            <li> I love shaving with a single blade razor because they are so much cheaper and do the same as those 10x blade razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That does not mean that this&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a little better.</li>
            <li> I have only used this razor blade once so far, but it cut my whiskers cleanly with no razor burn on the skin.</li>
            <li> Razor are sharp and in a protective case so they are easy to store and</li>
            <li> IIndividually wrapped, easy to handle and install and quite sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and cut easily.</li>
            <li> This way the mach 3 is a nice finish up and it will get a lot of mileage and I won&#x27;t cut myself on those hard to get spots that you have to go over and over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much like the old Gillette &#x27;Spoiler&#x27; to my memory.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell the difference between these blades and my old ones.</li>
            <li> Expensive but great blades.</li>
            <li> True, there is a small learning curve (how I wish the fathers of my generation had not been conned into the \\&quot;multi-blade revolution\\&quot; and had been able to teach us to shave properly).  </li>
            <li> Love the blades, these will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> These work so much better than the standard safety razors (as long as you DON&#x27;T try to take them on flight)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t probably squeze out a few more shaves</li>
            <li> These blades are okay but harsh.  </li>
            <li> Able to tackle heavy beards</li>
            <li> These are at best average blades or worse.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is that you can try a lot of different brands in small lot&#x27;s and not spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn.</li>
            <li> From my first Atra to my last Fusion, I succeeded primarily in scraping off half my face before razor-burned first dates and family photos.  </li>
            <li> Then, rooting around in my top drawer, I found an old half used pack of Merkurs from before the grab bag experiment.</li>
            <li> All most the same as other razor that don&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
            <li> Never would I have thought that a single blade would be able to do the same job as the multi-blade razors that I am used to.</li>
            <li> I found out with saftey razors, you have to try different blades to find the right fit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They tug at day old stubble because they are not sharp enough fresh out of the wrapper on the first use.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, and hold a nice edge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> However, as I got older, now 64, I discovered that these disposal razors would only last 1 1/2 shaves, possibly due to my whiskers becoming more coarse and thicker.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a huge difference between these and any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Came of the pack sharp and shaved smoothly.</li>
            <li> he says they are exceptionally sharp and he gets a reliably smooth shave with every use.</li>
            <li> These blades are smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li> They are cheap, and sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with my new Merkur safety razor for about 2 weeks now.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re up 15 to 20 bucks every time you buy new blades</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES his new razor.</li>
            <li> The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the new style razors.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s new to the safety razor world, and he likes them.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving try a variety of blades.  </li>
            <li> B001G5FOLI Feather New Hi-Stainless]]</li>
            <li> They live in CA</li>
            <li> I might have to buy a new pack of blades about once a year.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razor shaving and purchased these blades with a new Merkur 33C style</li>
            <li> These were like brand new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at this type of shaving but</li>
            <li> My boyfriend, who was, at first, a bit reluctant to try such precise, sharp blades along with his new Merur razor, was very pleasantly surprised!!</li>
            <li> But when i started looking around for replacement blades I saw that for I can get other brands with 10x more blades for only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> If you (like myself) initially came to Amazon first in starting your entry into DE safety razor shaving, STOP right now.</li>
            <li> I get a smoother, more constant shave than I could have ever expected.    </li>
            <li> My facial hair is not long or coarse, so I figured I could and should be able to get 2 shaves out of one blade.  </li>
            <li> The first shave was amazingly smooth along with several nicks here and there due to the fact that I just started.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very gentle blades on your face; they allow for multiple passes.  </li>
            <li> The associate also emphasized the fact that they&#x27;re made in Germany, so \\&quot;clearly they are of high quality.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> I have no complaints, but noticed that the Feather Razor Blades (which are Japanese Stainless) seem to provide me with a little better shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very sharp, fine blades.</li>
            <li> We will see how long they last just got them so far so good can&#x27;t be more expensive than disposable razors</li>
            <li> I like them better than my usual Shark blades.</li>
            <li> These are the first double edge razor blades I have ever used</li>
            <li> If the Feathers turn out to be too sharp, I will most likely stick with Merkur.</li>
            <li> more likely to cut than any other brand I tried.</li>
            <li> I will not go back to modern blades!</li>
            <li> I always give a blade multiple shaves to see if it gets better, but usually know on the first pass if I like it or not.  </li>
            <li> These blades shave very well, though part of their success is due to the razor in which it is used.</li>
            <li> They are the exact same thing except they didn&#x27;t come in the plastic packaging for just $5.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent blades with not so great cutting power</li>
            <li> The cost, when compared to buying refills for disposable blades is hands down, fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Bought these along with the Merkur long handled razor as the main components of my first kit.</li>
            <li> I am getting a close shave for at least as long as the best selling four blade cartridges, and for a lot less money</li>
            <li> Very reasonable blade, though kind of expensive given alternatives.</li>
            <li> Change your blades once or twice a week - the blades are very sharp, but so cheap in comparison to the carts that they practically give them away,</li>
            <li> Very sharp and does the job on making my face stubble free.</li>
            <li> I was only shaving my face though and did not experiment on any other more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean, don&#x27;t rust and are very economical compared to Gillette Blades and they shave better without irritating or cutting my skin.</li>
            <li> Using Single Edge razors is a bit tricky but fun once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Not bad, sharp out of the package.</li>
            <li> He definitely got a better shave than with the previous blades he had.</li>
            <li> the Merkur Razor Double Edge Razor and this little box of blades is great because it comes with a little slot on the bottom side where you can put your old used blades!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind throwing your blade out every few shaves, these are fine for the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exactly what I wanted - super sharp</li>
            <li> These are sharp and I get a super close shave with these, but not too close.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp, each blade lasts 5-6 days.</li>
            <li> These blades are very high quality and seems to last longer than those made in America.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to go all out and get some genuine Merkur blades to see if I was missing out.  </li>
            <li> Feather are the sharpest blades so far.</li>
            <li> my old razors never did that.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had been using the old Mach 3 blades and razor and this has completely changed my morning routine.</li>
            <li> They are far cheaper than the cheapest multi-blade or \\&quot;plastic</li>
            <li> Yes, you might suffer one or two minor nicks that require a dab of cotton over the first year of using it, until you get the knack.   </li>
            <li> If you have spare time do your wallet a favor and calculate how much money you will save by switching to double edge razors.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been trying to get through the Astra blades as fast as possible</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve tried this one and Wilkinson Sword Blades.</li>
            <li> The mechanical set up means you have to remove the head completely before you can get to the blade.  </li>
            <li> Having recently migrated back to double edge blades from the multis, I found this blade to be comfortable, reliable, and long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> old school shaving equiptment</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; razors over these.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the professional style soap.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find safety razor blades on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to find them anywhere for that matter.</li>
            <li> i wish i never wasted my money.</li>
            <li> old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> I was much happier with the Astra blades, although I used these as my double edge razor starter set.</li>
            <li> I like that there&#x27;s a place on the underside of the container for used blades- so that they&#x27;re not tossed directly into the trash (to avoid split bags and any harm to trash</li>
            <li> but if you shave frequently, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for a couple of years and shave after a shower with my boar-bristle brush and sensitive shaving cream and still got some razor burn.  </li>
            <li> These razors have been doing the job for a couple months now, and I am happily surprised.</li>
            <li> I fell for the &amp;#34;you need multiple blades in order to get a real close shave&amp;#34</li>
            <li> So there blades are a bit more on the harsh-size (for me at least).</li>
            <li> So far they are performing well.  </li>
            <li> Of note, I have fairly soft skin that is rather sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Given my skin, my razor blade of choice is currently the Dorco Stainless Steel Razor Blades, which is $8 for a pack of 100 blades.  </li>
            <li> I use an old gillette razor and they go will together.</li>
            <li> like it very much so far.  </li>
            <li> and I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far these are my preferred blades.</li>
            <li> but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> Perhaps, Merkur does this on purpose to introduce newbies to the old fashioned safety razor without being too aggressive of a cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Durability - I noticed no decrease in sharpness or comfort over 4 shaves, so it appears to be very durable and can likely be used</li>
            <li> So far the Astras come close</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE razors since the early 60&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I rotate them currently, but not afraid to go back to them.</li>
            <li> The razor blades in this pack are very sharp, very resistant to tear and wear and very economic.  </li>
            <li> I fell like they get dull pretty quickly</li>
            <li> They are long lasting and do not corrode easily when stored properly.  </li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s sharp enough to leave me with a shave that&#x27;s close enough to challenge most cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I used to get razor burn every time I shaved, but these blades are so sharp that&#x27;s not really a problem any more.  </li>
            <li> These are great, sharp, and thin razors.</li>
            <li> It gives a close, comfortable shave and the blades stay sharp for several shaves.</li>
            <li> German made blades that scream quality and make all my other blades seem cheap.</li>
            <li> Every blade has delivered consistent results and I have not suffered a single nick with a month of shaving.  </li>
            <li> They seem super sharp!  </li>
            <li> Last a long time and gives several comfortable shaves.</li>
            <li> While not as sharp as other blades, they are great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The rewards for taking the time to learn to shave properly are certainly worth the risks of a few stray nicks at first.  </li>
            <li> I use these with my Merkur long handled safety razor and they give you a close smooth shave with minimal irritation, and they are far cheaper than any disposable razor or cartridges have ever been.</li>
            <li> and I rarely nick myself, compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> As far as double edge razor blades go, I think these are pretty standard.  </li>
            <li> They would only give me 4-5 decent shaves.  </li>
            <li> Several strokes in different directions and techniques trying to get the blade to cut, only left my face sore and far from smooth.</li>
            <li> No knicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the blue 3-blade disposal razors for the past 30 yrs and had been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I say try any Gillette blades, particularly the Silver Blue or the 7 o clock.</li>
            <li> This blade was supplied with my Merkur Heavy Duty Stainless DE razor, so it was the first I tried out.  </li>
            <li> These give you a much closer shave, and just cut better; they&#x27;re so sharp I can dry shave my face (minus mustache area) without any discomfort</li>
            <li> High quality that you expect from German products!</li>
            <li> These high quality blades are the longest lasting blades I have found.</li>
            <li> These blades are so smooth, and so sharp -- as long as you are dropping [...</li>
            <li> This is apparently the standard baseline that all razor blades are compared to, I&#x27;m assuming because most people get a Merkur HD to start and this usually comes bundled with all Merker safety razors.</li>
            <li> This is, in my opinion, never a good sign for your favorite product.</li>
            <li> I expected quality, and that is exactly what i got.</li>
            <li> Certainly hold up for at least a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.</li>
            <li> They are long lasting and very high quality!</li>
            <li> Dull, would not cut even a one one days growth of my beard constantly pulled and scraped, switch to a better blade</li>
            <li> Each one last me about a week or two, and then I get to throw them out for a brand new one for about a nickel.</li>
            <li> I like the memories the new safety razor brings back, and I get as close a shave with one blade as I did 4!</li>
            <li> So I went back to the new blades.</li>
            <li> &quot;  People have said that these blades are a mite unforgiving to beginners still learning to properly use a double edged razor, but I never had much of a problem.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you will never go back to bloated overpriced and not nearly as effective \\&quot;shave</li>
            <li> and this blade seems to be gentle enough so that I&#x27;m not left with razor burn,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave that much and this box of razors will last me a solid year.</li>
            <li> Remember that nothing in the way of quality is the same as it was decades ago when a blade really was a blade in the commercial market.</li>
            <li> but they still perform very well when I use them in my Shaving Factory Heavy Metal Straight Razor.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these blades because I have been unable to find good double edge razor blades in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Since they stay so sharp for so long, after a few weeks, I&#x27;d just rather use a fresh blade then worry about the light rust.</li>
            <li> I am now a Feather only guy as I need a razor that is super sharp and will not drag.</li>
            <li> I will be looking for something a little more sharp.</li>
            <li> Also, these are of a much higher quality than other singles.</li>
            <li> With my new Double Edge Razor and double edge blades, I now get up to 6 or 7 complete shaves</li>
            <li> These bad boys are sharp and best part of all, they aren&#x27;t plastic disposable razors that get tossed in a landfill to sit for eternity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a classic double edged razor (also made by Merkur) for about a year now; and I have to say that I&#x27;ll never go back to \\&quot;shaving systems.\\</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard, but I have been able to use a blade for two or three weeks.</li>
            <li> The blades (enclosed) are super sharp and despite some heavy use haven&#x27;t lost much sharpness.  </li>
            <li> I tried the \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; blades due to all the positive reviews, but they tore up my face by shaving layers of skin off.  </li>
            <li> started wondering if my memories of great shaves were created by the scores of really bad blades I had just been through.</li>
            <li> I only tried one so far</li>
            <li> They do not last like the old ones</li>
            <li> He back shaving the old way</li>
            <li> However the cost saving versus Gillette products is considerable, so even if it only lasts 5 shaves instead of 7</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected too much</li>
            <li> only word of caution- unlike American multi-bladed razors meant to be ripped across your face as fast as possible</li>
            <li> Definitely overpriced as far as blades go.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only tested this set.  </li>
            <li> Of course, as far as I know, it&#x27;s all personal preference.</li>
            <li> I have learned a lot being a noob to safety razors, like having your facial hair hot and wet before shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have had electric, blades and all the trendy razors, all expensive and did not work.</li>
            <li> Like many others I was tired of paying through the nose for cartrige-style blades and wanted another option.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m guessing they are just not very sharp.</li>
            <li> but after a few shaves the merkur is still like new and the Astra not so much...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is new to DE shaving and this is the blade that came with his Merkur long handled razor.</li>
            <li> Got these with my new Merkur 180 long handle razor.  </li>
            <li> hair stubble that grown from single blade such as this produced a much sharper end.</li>
            <li> These Merkur blades just aren&#x27;t sharp, consistent, or durable enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> With disposable razors, after shaving the first leg, the razor is never as sharp for the second leg.</li>
            <li> You do have to be a little more careful simply because they are so sharp, but that&#x27;s really the only drawback.  </li>
            <li> They can and will last a long time as long as you clean rinse and dry them after every use.  </li>
            <li> great starter blades but a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Sharp and ready to go</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how they stack up against other DE brands, but I&#x27;m getting a much closer shave than I was with the Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li> They are of course sharp and the also seem to hold their edge really well.</li>
            <li> When thinking about a razor I like mine sharp not to much rust.</li>
            <li> I get a bit too much irritation from this brand and other German-made blades.</li>
            <li> Super sharp - just as expected.</li>
            <li> It was seriously tugging at my beard rather than smoothly shaving.</li>
            <li> I wanted to return to my earlier year with the old Gillette double edge razor...</li>
            <li> There are multiple choices for razor blades from all over the world (England/Russia/India/Pakistan/Turkey/Japan) and multiple vendors selling sample packs to help you in your search, prices range from $0.10 to $0.50 per blade with shipping, so choose wisely young shaving Jedi.</li>
            <li> I have went through multiple different brands and styles of razor blades all with nicks and burns as i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blades for the last 6 months and no complaints so far, I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I do have a soft spot for german made stuff because quality is a given, so I have bought several containers of these blades.</li>
            <li> They are pretty sharp and last about 3 times for my husband, but he has a very coarse beard</li>
            <li> There are some reviews that are not so positive about these blades, especially when they are compared to other blades such as &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Overall 5 stars for Merkur&#x27;s blades and 5 stars for Merkur in general.</li>
            <li> Sharpest blades and they last much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> These work well are sharp and last a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur Double Edge Blades are very durable and sharp.  </li>
            <li> They create a close shave and as long as you rinse the razor out frequently, they will not cut your face.</li>
            <li> After some months I came back and tried them again with a marked improvement but found in a Open Comb razor these things are actually usable.</li>
            <li> I got a few burns with this razor blade in my Merkur 23c but it was my first time shaving with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is just that one can easily cut oneself on the edge of the blade when removing it from the package.</li>
            <li> This blade is not sharp enough for my beard, especially on the reverse pull, it sticks and rips the roots.</li>
            <li> I am new to wet shaving, so I have nothing to compare them to as of yet.</li>
            <li> These are high quality blades that have an exceptionally sharp edge.</li>
            <li> I will also update this review later.&lt;br /&gt;Sharpness - seemed sharp, but the amount of hair removed in each pass was not as high as I expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These can be snapped in half and used with disposable blade straight razor handles.</li>
            <li> The blade seems sharper and it seems to hold it&#x27;s edge much longer than the ones I was using previously.  </li>
            <li> My facial hair grows out ridiculously even, that it actually feels smooth because it grows out so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since used the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand razors, which are much sharper and cause much less irritation for me.  </li>
            <li> I am new to the double edge blade and wet shaving</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard, these razors weren&#x27;t very sharp for me, it took two or three of these blades just to get one good shave, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, last longer than regular blades, gives a balanced shave for my tough facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I change my blades every week, shaving every other day, and even brand new, these blades cause irritation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just changed the blade after 2 1/2 weeks and said it was still sharp but wanted to see if he could shave closer with a new blade.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating due to how well this blade works with my new Merkur 34c safety razor &amp; my vintage Hoffritz (Merkur) slant &amp; Hoffritz</li>
            <li> Seem to be sharp enough and I got several shaves out of them before having to get a new one.</li>
            <li> They are beyond imagination sharp and hold their edge for at least one to two weeks easily.  </li>
            <li> To be fair I have heard the Merkur DE razors can have a bad rep on the Badger and Blade forums.</li>
            <li> The  main reason I switched to a butterfly razor system over a year ago was that the cost of shaving with a Trac 2 or these other fancy 5 blade systems was becoming outrageously expensive....</li>
            <li> Draggy and dull right out of the box.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also my first set of DE razors used as I&#x27;m new to the Safe-T razor game.</li>
            <li> first shave with this razor, and it felt very harsh.  </li>
            <li> Their edge holds up to my stiff wiry beard very well.</li>
            <li> Also, since they are double-edged blades, I can use one side and my wife can use the other (they&#x27;re marked with a &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;II&#x27; on the edge of the blade</li>
            <li> Does its job, sharp and to the point, direct replacedment for the shaver that I purchased it for</li>
            <li> So you most likely won&#x27;t nick yourself badly with them unless you are totally new to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I have to take the blade out of the razor after each shave and dry all the moisture from the blade and then apply a thin coat of light oil such as baby oil or olive oil to the blade to prolong its use.</li>
            <li> A standard blade that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unaware how long these blades usually last.  </li>
            <li> if my skin is feeling particularly dry (but usually I like that lucky tiger does not leave much moisturizing behind though as my skin is typically not dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I ordered the Merkur Heavy Classic razor, I ordered the Merkur blades to go with it.  </li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and it takes a little getting used to using them at first.</li>
            <li> going to come back to this blade after I evaluate a few more, but just starting out it cut me up pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to wet shaving and had been using the ONLY double-edged blades I could find at my local wally world.  </li>
            <li> The Shaving Barons have ripped me off for long enough!  </li>
            <li> they seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The blades dont last long and you cant get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of trimming up long stubble before shaving and with this type of safety-razor blade you can eliminate that step.</li>
            <li> They last long</li>
            <li> Will definitely save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> These last a long time and cost 1/2 of what I&#x27;d pay for the newer type of blades.</li>
            <li> Last week I had  a minor cut with a feather.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razors, and with a little patience, I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> While razor blades can be terrifying for most thirteen year old girls; when it comes to my 40 year old husbands facestache these blades really cut through the rough exterior and leave him feeling like a hairless German loverboy.</li>
            <li> Bought a few packs of these to go with the new Merkur shaver.</li>
            <li> I noticed a different feel to the skin after shaving, a kind of sensitivity but not bothersome or painful.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and once I get the full technique down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used single blade, double-blade, etc etc, razors, and they simply don&#x27;t compare.  </li>
            <li> The only razors I will use for my single blade.</li>
            <li> I knew to begin my transition into shaving from a single to double blade razor.</li>
            <li> B0006M56BK Wilkinson Sword Double Edge single Razor Cartridge, 5 blades]].  </li>
            <li> I bought these bad boys for my first double edged safety razor, and they worth the investment.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razorblades and they&#x27;re sharp - which is apparently all my husband needs in a set of razors for his razor blade.</li>
            <li> They are not as sharp as other blades I have tried since getting these but good to prevent cutting</li>
            <li> I did feel a slight tugging on shaving with the grain at the first few strokes.</li>
            <li> Making the switch to an old school double edged razor kit may seem prohibitively expensive at first, but in the long run you&#x27;ll save a bundle.</li>
            <li> I still intend to sample many blades, and especially see if I can like the less expensive blades (derby, astra, etc)</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t yet tried other brands such as Feather or Derby (I&#x27;ve recently ordered a sample pack.)</li>
            <li> These blades are definitely sharp and last several shaves.  </li>
            <li> The blades remain sharp with simple cleaning and proper storage.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this left me feeling raw.  </li>
            <li> They last twice as long as other similar products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issues with them and enjoy the simplistic and inexpensive nature of these razors.</li>
            <li> I had month long shaving irritation and razor burn from these things.</li>
            <li> I used them after purchasing the long handled merkur safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor and it came with one of those blades.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use these razors for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Works well but wish I had ordered a long handle model.</li>
            <li> The one that came with the razor when I bought it lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> They tugged on my hairs and cut my face apart in my Merkur long handle.</li>
            <li> Long</li>
            <li> both my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> The third shave, now this one was rough just as I found my groove and how to hold the razor and the direction</li>
            <li> my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> I use this with my merkur long handled safety razor</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected each to last longer than 4 shaves.</li>
            <li> Been a long time since using blades like this.</li>
            <li> I will use these blades as long as I can.</li>
            <li> these seem too stiff and not nearly sharp enough.</li>
            <li> I tried very little pressure and used a new blade every 2-3 uses but</li>
            <li> And then it&#x27;s less than $1 a blade from that point forward (even if you buy the most expensive</li>
            <li> But a year and a half later I finally used them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only issue i had (user error) was not tightening the handle down enough and the blade was loose.  </li>
            <li> The good news and bad news for these blades is the same- less sharp than Feather blades.</li>
            <li> But the sharp edge did not last as long, and the rest of the package was variable in quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they do not cut as well or last as long.</li>
            <li> Sharp and long lasting.</li>
            <li> but I am a little disappointed as each blade is good for only two shaves.</li>
            <li> these last so long that the 5 packs of  10 that I bought might last me a few years.</li>
            <li> --I never looked back to the other \\&quot;shaving systems\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> -mart had other no-name blades that didn&#x27;t last either</li>
            <li> For me the feather blades were actually too sharp and cut me up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and always go back to these.</li>
            <li> There are cheaper razor blades and there are other methods of shaving, but I promise you, once you&#x27;ve used a Merkur safety-razor you won&#x27;t want to go back.</li>
            <li> I change my blade once a week on Sunday and shave every day occasionally every other day .</li>
            <li> No rash or any other problems (note that I don&#x27;t use after shave, only a moisturizer).  </li>
            <li> I find these blades to be of medium sharpness, but very rough, producing multiple nicks per shave.  </li>
            <li> On average I can shave 4-6 times before replacing blade as long as it&#x27;s cleaned and left to dry on stand.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say, other than I have never had a closer shave than when using these particular blades.</li>
            <li> Very sharp long lasting.</li>
            <li> You can buy them as a single</li>
            <li> Nothing special, nothing wrong.</li>
            <li> This Merkur gets the job done, but of the limited number of blades I&#x27;ve tried at this point I would not characterize this as one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> but this does not change the fact that it is still a single blade that can not reach all areas (under the nose).</li>
            <li> These last me six months on average</li>
            <li> With disposables, I often have to make multiple passes, and cartridges lasts about a week a piece on average.</li>
            <li> I have a really thick coarse beard (think Fred Flintstone) and the Merkurs only last me 3 shaves, but</li>
            <li> I have to use a Feather or Bluebird blade for a week before it gets as dull as a new Merkur.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, think I am going to go with Feathers or Gillette Silver Blue in the long run.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough to last for multiple shaves through thick beard, these will save money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck and these razors seem a bit too dull.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and are lasting along time.</li>
            <li> Other double edge blades I&#x27;ve tried just didn&#x27;t measure up and did not have the sharp precision blade of a Merkur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less tugging on the hairs.    </li>
            <li> My face appreciates the slight extra expense and effort to get these blades.  </li>
            <li> The Merkur blade would get the job done, but the shave was not super close, and it would occasionally pull my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have only nicked myself once or twice with them; actually less often than with the multi blade types.  </li>
            <li> One half of the blade will last between 4 and 6 shaves before it starts tugging</li>
            <li> This morning I switched back to Merkur and noticed an obvious closer shave that came with a few knicks!</li>
            <li> These blades get the job done but are not particularly noteworthy in any one area.</li>
            <li> Then, about a year and a half ago I bought several &amp;#34;grab bag&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was the same exact sort of shave</li>
            <li> As a teen and early twenty-something, I had pretty bad acne</li>
            <li> Merkur was my choice due to recommendation of a friend who&#x27;s been using them for long time now.</li>
            <li> And stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> The new Merkur blades were no better than an average blade from the grab bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> New to DE wet shaving, I&#x27;ve only tried these and Feathers for my fairly tough beard.</li>
            <li> Not long afterward, Wal-Mart started carrying Wilkinson blades made in Germany for less than $2.00 for ten blades, and they were at least the equal of the Merkur.</li>
            <li> i have already saved every penny i spent on 2 boxes of these blades over the 4-5 blade disposable aluminum foil brands, and i have used only half a box.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how many new blades you add; the flashy colors and tacky gimmicks fail to impress me any longer.</li>
            <li> I tried a 10 pack of Feather blades and even after the 5th shave I was still cutting myself BAD (even more than I ever did when I first started shaving with a disposable razor) and not getting near as close a shave as the Merkurs, I threw the other 9 blades away</li>
            <li> The blade is very sharp (IMO not as sharp as a feather, which is not my go to), but left my skin irritated.  </li>
            <li> Do you find yourself forced to choose between buying decent razor blades or putting a down payment on a home?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to switch from conventional multi blade razors.</li>
            <li> (if you pull a little diagonal, there&#x27;s a slightly greater risk of cutting yourself, but not much).  </li>
            <li> hard to find double edge razor blades in local stores.amazon delivered them in 2 days</li>
            <li> The Astra blades aren&#x27;t bad I quality or anything, these Merkur are better for my hair type and face.</li>
            <li> I figured okay, I got a bad razor.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you&#x27;re a newbee shaving with razors as they will cut your skin without any effort.</li>
            <li> If you have not tried shaving with a double edge your missing out.</li>
            <li> Everything is I expected.</li>
            <li> With these I will typically only replace my blade every few months (shaving once per week).</li>
            <li> I really do not know whether it&#x27;s my miss using or the quality of the product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way the drag on my face feels or the shave I get from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always have your skin wet with this shaver.</li>
            <li> What dulls your blade the quickest is rust on the edge, hence drying it off between uses.  </li>
            <li> They pull and drag something fierce</li>
            <li> I thought all of the blades made in Asia were unusable, quite rough.</li>
            <li> I understand that blade performance is heavily dependent on the individual&#x27;s skin and shaving practice</li>
            <li> Not much to say about the razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Bought a sampler pack from west coast shaving a few years back.</li>
            <li> They work, but tend to drag across your face.</li>
            <li> Works with my merkur razor well and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Not a very forgiving blade.  </li>
            <li> Astras didn&#x27;t drag or pull at all and are a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to carve up your face like a turkey.</li>
            <li> These work as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands from drug stores and none of them compared to Merkur.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is thick, coarse man hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li> The down side is the price which does not make much sense since they are not incredibly superior blades.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades, almost too sharp sometimes at least with my particular razor.</li>
            <li> With that said, the Feather blades don&#x27;t seem to hold their razor edge as long (i.e. less shaves per blade).  </li>
            <li> (I still recommend using brushed-on shaving cream, however), and unlike the expensive multi-bladed razors you use for WAY to long because they&#x27;re such a rip-off, these are cheap as heck, so as soon as they lose any of their edge, you guiltlessly throw them away.  </li>
            <li> not as sharp as I expected</li>
            <li> , the major cause of poor lasting edge is the rust u don&#x27;t c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being inexperienced with other blades of this type we are giving it a four star because he has had nothing yet to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Be careful, these blades are sharp, as they should be.</li>
            <li> It was not as bad as the Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum razor blades, as those blades were so sharp I looked like a 13-year old attempting to shave for the first time.  </li>
            <li> A little more expensive though and hard to get on amazon</li>
            <li> I tried a blade I found at Walgreens hidden behind about twenty packs of the multi blade housed in plastic that cost to much and gave them a try.</li>
            <li> Really sharp and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I bet those other blades are as jagged as they feel.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any of the other double-edge blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice DE shaver and while I cannot compare these blades to other brands, I can say that I have never cut my face with these</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other brand...</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as feather blades</li>
            <li> They are sharp but hurt my face for a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some hassle and get a box of supremely sharp Feathers instead.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, durable and you can recycle them after you are done.  </li>
            <li> I bought some other blades made in Russia then these.</li>
            <li> Sharp and silky.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare to other brands.  </li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other brands</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, razor sharp.</li>
            <li> sharp blade.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand of blade in my razor.</li>
            <li> all sharp, no defects.</li>
            <li> I have a sharp jawline</li>
            <li> I have found that I prefer Feather blades due to their sharpness.</li>
            <li> Try it out you wont be disappointed works better than fusion or Shick</li>
            <li> I am going to order a in a 100 pack yet, but I recommend checking out these for sampling other blades.</li>
            <li> I should have just order it from The Art of Shaving or some other respected seller and been done with it.  </li>
            <li> Sharp as heck.</li>
            <li> It seems like one edge sticks out a bit farther than the other.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp but don&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> All of the other blades made my face feel like it was on fire.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had already read about other razor blades and ordered a set of Derby blades with my order.</li>
            <li> I feel like these are sharper out of the box and stay sharper than other double-edge razors.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and affordable.  </li>
            <li> I bought 5-packs of Personna Reds, Blues, Derby, Gilette, Merkur, and Dorko and compared them against each other over months.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend usually uses the Gillette brand double edge razors, but after I ordered these online</li>
            <li> These blades are not as sharp as they should be.</li>
            <li> No more spending big bucks for replacement blades.</li>
            <li> These are just not as sharp.</li>
            <li> sharper than any other blade I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I have had other people look at it</li>
            <li> An added bonus, it was here before I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v tried other blades</li>
            <li> I have yet to use any other razors as I&#x27;ve yet to run out of these.</li>
            <li> WAY SHARP.</li>
            <li> I use a Merkur razor and wouldn&#x27;t use any other blade.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted  sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought these razors years back because I ran out of my usual Feather razors</li>
            <li> For expensive as Feather razor blades are, these are even MORE expensive and they have the \\&quot;benefit\\&quot; of German manufacturing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other blades</li>
            <li> their sharp?  </li>
            <li> Way to sharp.</li>
            <li> and they are really sharp no bumps or cuts</li>
            <li> These things are crazy cheap and crazy sharp, so you should only use these if you absolutely have your technique down.  </li>
            <li> Double edge razor blades, they work and are sharp; lasting approximately 6 days.</li>
            <li> I was so tired of paying $20 for replacement blades on the new style razors.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you&#x27;re cutting a much thicker growth you won&#x27;t get 4-6 shaves from a blade.</li>
            <li> I got into the DE razor shaving fad for a few weeks; I really loved the price and really hated the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> These are alright for a beginner who is afraid of slicing their face up but after the first few shaves you can tell the are middle of the road blades and</li>
            <li> The only issue is that I need to be really careful and slow down</li>
            <li> Not sure how long one razor lasts, because he is changing them every other shave.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and found these blades to be sort of inferior to a lot of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> When I was shaving my head, these are the ones that wouldn&#x27;t dull on my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different when it comes to shaving, but these blades struck me as dull.  </li>
            <li> The safety razors I could make last for 3 or 4 weeks, but they cost me an arm and a leg and let&#x27;s face it, I was using them dull for a while.</li>
            <li> They last about seven shaves, one a day, but I have a red beard, turned grey, which, from my understanding, is tough to shave, and hard to cut.</li>
            <li> I tried sharpening these but for the price maybe not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Average sharpness.  </li>
            <li> The only negative comment is that the razor has to be disassemble to insert/remove the blade.</li>
            <li> They are of average quality for my use.</li>
            <li> difficult for me to measure how much I like</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, and quit using those expensive multi bladed razors that don&#x27;t even give you a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made razor although expensive.</li>
            <li> They are also durable enough to handle my thick beard.  </li>
            <li> Most of them were crap.</li>
            <li> These last very long considering their price and how thin they are.</li>
            <li> , so any pull slows me down and stops my movement.</li>
            <li> Break the cost down on a per basis and see what you find.</li>
            <li> That comes down to about 1 pack a year.</li>
            <li> handlers/scavengers down the road).</li>
            <li> and I need to use a pre-shave oil to prevent razor burn, so they are sharp!</li>
            <li> These blades are incredibly sharp!  </li>
            <li> maybe just a little too sharp for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Beats the other guys multi-blade approach, hands down!</li>
            <li> I have tried Derby, Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Green, Black, and Yellow, Gillette Silver Blues, Blue bird, Astra, Shark, Feather, and Dorko blades and none were near as bad as this one.</li>
            <li> I tried one a few times and it done the job just not as sharp as I thought</li>
            <li> They are very sharp</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricey but they are very sharp and  well worht the money.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and they stay that way.</li>
            <li> Very sharp bouble edge razor blades.</li>
            <li> After only a few shaves it tugs, pulls and feels a bit dull.</li>
            <li> I used to use the typical three blade $20 razors.  </li>
            <li> slightly thicker then feather and</li>
            <li> Typical razor blades.</li>
            <li> I used it several times and found it difficult to properly shave.  </li>
            <li> I get a closer shave for much less money than ever before.</li>
            <li> This razor was bought for my husband who has been complaining about not getting a close shave with the typical plastic razor.</li>
            <li> I reviewed the razor previously.</li>
            <li> They come in a black package and are made in Korea.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful with these blades since the slightest pressure will to lead to small cuts.  </li>
            <li> Like the Germans, these blades are little stiff; however, sharp.</li>
            <li> They are not too expensive for how long they last</li>
            <li> and they caused me irritation if I went against the grain or they would pull the hairs leaving little blood dots.</li>
            <li> They are a little thicker than some razors.</li>
            <li> or I will nick a little slice of the skin.  </li>
            <li> With a little patience you will not nick yourself</li>
            <li> The case they come in a little tricky, but works well.  </li>
            <li> The cost is a little bit steep for that amount of blades but still cheaper than the disposables we had been purchasing.</li>
            <li> Fewer nicks than other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I just wish they were a little sharper.  </li>
            <li> Gets the job done but is a little ruff on my face.</li>
            <li> some are a little sharper than others</li>
            <li> My husband said his Gillette seemed to shave a little closer</li>
            <li> It may take you a little longer to get the job done</li>
            <li> But they are causing little weepers and spots of irritation on my face and don&#x27;t give me the BBS shave I get with Feathers in two passes.</li>
            <li> Because that little nick with the feather I am inclined to suggest Merkur over Feather</li>
            <li> The price point on here is pretty bad compared to other options though.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Merkur blades, they were rough and dull.  </li>
            <li> Really slides through the hair but makes my skin feel unhappy</li>
            <li> I was missing out.    </li>
            <li> The blades also have to be switched every few (2-5) shaves.</li>
            <li> Try these blades with the Merkur heavy duty razor.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll find out if the few nicks were in my learning curve or just a byproduct of the aggressiveness of the blade.    </li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t over think it, just go slow and be careful.</li>
            <li> and he doesn&#x27;t need to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Heavy and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> ; I have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Try a few brands to determine what suits your technique, products and beard.</li>
            <li> It only felt like I was passing a thin edge over my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> They hold up for quite a few shaves before I have to replace the blades.  </li>
            <li> Did not fit the razor</li>
            <li> IMO it wasn&#x27;t an aggressive shave, but was a harsh blade on my skin.</li>
            <li> I had a few days on my beard, so it was heavy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> well i waste them all</li>
            <li> Not smooth.</li>
            <li> Seriously picked these up because I wanted to remove the idea of single use plastics from my life and these blades in conjunction with the metal handle</li>
            <li> very sharp blades!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other blades to be less irritating, even when sharper or not as sharp.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have to throw them out due to a small tinge of rust in the middle of the blade, but never near the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> My beard is average, not super thick</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and stay that way even after a few shaves!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not good eith single bkade</li>
            <li> used other blades that are deemed &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; via forums but would rank this right along side them.</li>
            <li> The fist few times I cut myself up pretty badly.</li>
            <li> If anyone  thinks that by using this type of shaving system is &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; expensive as the more conventional way, they will be highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad, however I&#x27;ve found that they do get rusty quicker than some of the higher quality brands.</li>
            <li> I think the first blade I used must have been a bad one because since trying another blade, these have been my \\&quot;go to.\\</li>
            <li> But I will say that I had a pretty bad time shaving with blades, lots of irritation and tugging.</li>
            <li> They immediately gave me an ultra close shave, but with a few small nicks and no burn at all.  </li>
            <li> I decided to use in a can shaving cream to see the difference, a few small cuts.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Not only is the shave off a safety razor less irritating, the cost of those environmentally disastrous huge disposable blades is absurd....  and all marketing.  </li>
            <li> Some have said that the Astras are no good when you have a longer beard, but because I shave every other day</li>
            <li> Not sure what changed</li>
            <li> These blades are head &amp; shoulders over the lame ones you&#x27;ll get at your local discount store.  </li>
            <li> Merkur makes OK razors but their blades are terrible.</li>
            <li> I usually get about 10 passes across my face for each blade.</li>
            <li> You can also purchase this blade in small quantities.  </li>
            <li> only problem I had was the first blade in the pack was horrible for some reason.</li>
            <li> Plus, you feel rooted to the past, planted with both feet on the ground.</li>
            <li> This is a small yet telling way to become an agrarian.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I could say about these.</li>
            <li> These blades are difficult find locally.</li>
            <li> I paid the higher price to get these but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t care for the shave I got with a double edge razor.</li>
            <li> I should have returned these blades as well as the razor but got lazy and didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It  shaves well but also very heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> Thin, sharp and do the job with no effort</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t at first and cut the crap out of my face.  </li>
            <li> With the Feather and/or Derby blades I can easily cut through over a weeks growth with no irritation and at worst 1-2 nicks if I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Feather blades seem to be less irritating for me.</li>
            <li> While Merkur makes fine razors (I&#x27;ve used a 180/23c for years), their blades are horrible.</li>
            <li> Sometime in the past two years, Merkur made a decision to seriously downgrade their production quality.</li>
            <li> Razor goes dull after one shave</li>
            <li> Hard to find though ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;after even 2 shaves, it begans to dull.  </li>
            <li> I keep the razor in a cup of mineral oil which keeps them lubed and prevents any deposits from hard water.  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to leave a review on any DE blade.</li>
            <li> I found them to be rather dull.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a dull blade (snagging on my hair/skin) -</li>
            <li> When handling them, I don&#x27;t need to take extra care to avoid cutting my fingers.</li>
            <li> Despite their sharpness, the only cutting they do is on hair.</li>
            <li> After the 3rd blade I got tired of painful shaving and threw the other 7 blades out.</li>
            <li> I mean systems.</li>
            <li> No more wasting $ on razor blades at the store!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few and they can&#x27;t compare!!</li>
            <li> This is a little dangerous as the blade is naturally very sharp.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty uncomfortable and sort of painful.</li>
            <li> They are very thin and sharp, they seem durable and they lock in well</li>
            <li> Very thin, flexible, and exceptionally sharp.  </li>
            <li> These are not good razors at least for this face.</li>
            <li> and I have very heavy course hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different blades and I must say that these are horrible.</li>
            <li> ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Either of these feel like there&#x27;s no blade in the razor compared to the Merkurs and are much less expensive.</li>
            <li> For me, these are tops and much less expensive to boot.</li>
            <li> Blades are very thin and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Not good at all</li>
            <li> but definitely not as good.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy</li>
            <li> Not a good shave for me.</li>
            <li> For a small object, I was charged $12.00 for shipping, which is way to expensive.  </li>
            <li> And then throw out those useless mach1 and other useless 3 blade razors.</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first blades came from the drug store and were dreadful.</li>
            <li> No more expensive disposables.</li>
            <li> He gets plenty of shaves and ha d a relatively tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and these razors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying for razor blades at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Will reorder when this package is exhausted.  </li>
            <li> pull &amp; tug the crap out of my facial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s insane how much cheaper it is to use these blades compared to the multi-bladed razors.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Not because they are bad - I just want a really sharp blade.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable shave even with my Merkur 34C heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Personna Reds and Blues were worst for me -- short lived and too edgy for my face --</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t ever get sick to my stomach when I walk down the shaving aisle again.</li>
            <li> a few months ago, in jubilation at having used up all the bad blades, I ordered 50 of my prized Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shave got progressively worse as I continued to go through them.</li>
            <li> They sent the wrong type of blade</li>
            <li> these left my face all bloody!</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot go wrong, and you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Wrong.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who suggests using these blades is expensive or will cut up your face is probably an agent of the competition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Word could is lame.</li>
            <li> Use it with the Merkur safety razor and you will never want to use the expensive shaving products that are on the market.  </li>
            <li> Bye Bye expensive replacement heads for the 3 blade ones.</li>
            <li> For me these blades had a bit of an uncomfortable \\&quot;pull\\&quot; to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Stick with these and you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> Anybody else have any suggestions if I am doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> I decided to try razor blade shaving and give up the expensive replacement blades.  </li>
            <li> Mediocre and overpriced.  </li>
            <li> Had to use a pliers, but unfortunately the bit inside it broke.  </li>
            <li> Useless now.  </li>
            <li> Mediocre shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (legs, sorry gents, I can&#x27;t speak to how this does on faces).</li>
            <li> And whoever it was at Merkur who made this production decision has disappointed an entire customer base.</li>
            <li> At least for me to date!!!</li>
            <li> #disappointing</li>
            <li> But the performance of these razor blades is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> However, it felt like it was pulling each hair out rather than cutting.</li>
            <li> , I think Merkur blades are sharper (call me crazy</li>
            <li> bam disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Allot of my troubles has being scared of cutting my self.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to try Feather,</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> merkur blades r too expensive to boot!  </li>
            <li> the personna&#x27;s u cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable blade for my face.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch?[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Ancient razor gets you a really bad shave.</li>
            <li> And then, my genetic background would not allow me to throw these bad blades away.</li>
            <li> Well, some were so bad I did.</li>
            <li> Stay away from those guys! :(</li>
            <li> He has not had any issues cutting himself while shaving with this blade and has had no razor burn or bumps!</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I started to hate shaving and dreading it when I had my mach 4.</li>
            <li> The price point these are at is a very bad deal</li>
            <li> Thus, I remain a very disappointed Amazon user!</li>
            <li> I was so disgusted with them.  </li>
            <li> awful shave!</li>
            <li> These blades are terrible!</li>
            <li> Popped a blade in and had one of the worst shaves of my life.</li>
            <li> so I bought a bunch -- AND THEY WERE TERRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They aren&#x27;t horrible blades</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, the recipient loves them. No complaints about the razors.</li>
            <li> Not sure what changed but I recall getting better shaves when I 1st started using these. They seem to last quite a while if you flip the blade every week.</li>
            <li> It literally doesn&#x27;t work at all. I do have course hair and a double edge razor. I had to buy a different blade because this product was inneffective.</li>
            <li> super sharp amazing blades</li>
            <li> the storage box that the blades come in is a great idea. After I use a blade I can stick it at the bottom and then throw out the entire thing when they have all been used. The blades I think are good quality and last about 5 shaves</li>
            <li> these last so long that the 5 packs of  10 that I bought might last me a few years. love it</li>
            <li> I do not have anything to compare these blades too at this point.  I never tried Safety Razor until today.  I did feel a slight tugging on shaving with the grain at the first few strokes. But went away after stroke 2 or 3.  I think may been my technique.  I need to get better.  But overall my 1st shave with these blades were very nice.  A lot nicer and smoother than my Mach3 Gillette.  No nicks, scratches, bumps or irritation or burn on my first shave.  I felt I got a closer and smoother shave than I ever did on my Gillette mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally use these but my husband has been using them in his razor for years and loves them. They are far more economical then constantly ordering disposable razors and he swears by their effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Good blade. Came of the pack sharp and shaved smoothly.</li>
            <li> The best brand of double edge razor blazes so far. Sharpest blades and they last much longer than other brands.</li>
            <li> I liked the sharpness. Really sharp and no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I hear these blades can be unforgiving, and in a more aggressive razor I would believe it. However the DE89 isn&#x27;t very aggressive, so it matches nicely with these blades, giving me a close shave with fewer passes.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally. Just what was needed. Recommend to anyone needing blades. Better than what is available locally. Just right</li>
            <li> Love the double edged blades, the are great and perform and out last the othger blades</li>
            <li> Sharp and ready to go</li>
            <li> Holds an edge better than feathers.</li>
            <li> These can be snapped in half and used with disposable blade straight razor handles. Great blades that hold their edge for lots of shaves. When I was shaving my head, these are the ones that wouldn&#x27;t dull on my coarse hair. If you&#x27;re going to use a straight razor and don&#x27;t want to invest in the premium ones, this is definitely a close second best (and a lot less work, since you won&#x27;t need to keep your blade honed). Other double edge blades I&#x27;ve tried just didn&#x27;t measure up and did not have the sharp precision blade of a Merkur. I&#x27;d like to compare the Merkur with others under a microscope. I bet those other blades are as jagged as they feel.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to wet shaving and had been using the ONLY double-edged blades I could find at my local wally world.  It was still a huge step up from my old Mach 3 but I decided to go all out and get some genuine Merkur blades to see if I was missing out.  I was missing out.    These blades are head &amp; shoulders over the lame ones you&#x27;ll get at your local discount store.  I&#x27;ve cut myself twice while shaving with these blades, but only because I was trying to rush myself.  The blade seems sharper and it seems to hold it&#x27;s edge much longer than the ones I was using previously.  I&#x27;ve definitely noticed less tugging on the hairs.    Aside from the blade upgrade, the next best thing I did was buying grapeseed oil to replace my expensive art of shaving pre-shave, and buying some poraso shaving cream to replace my expensive art of shaving cream.    I&#x27;ve been shaving for almost 15 years and I&#x27;m just NOW getting the best (and cheapest) shaves of my life.  GET THESE!</li>
            <li> Everyone is different when it comes to shaving, but these blades struck me as dull.  I could not get a very close shave, and when I tried, I ended up hacking my face.  After that, most of them never got used.  I bought them because I have a Merkur razor which I like very much.</li>
            <li> i like these blades as much as any others! great buy, wish they were a little cheaper</li>
            <li> My husband loves the razor we ordered previously and was very happy that we could order the same blades that originally came with the razor..</li>
            <li> Double edge razor blades, they work and are sharp; lasting approximately 6 days.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp for a great price. These blades last me about 3-5 shaves before I like to change them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even muster up a 2 star rating on these. Merkur makes OK razors but their blades are terrible. New blade pulls and just about comes to a stop on beard! Feather are the sharpest blades so far.</li>
            <li> So far my favorite blade used feather as well. Stay away from those guys! :(</li>
            <li> These razors are great. They beat the $20 pack of 6 from the mainstream razors.</li>
            <li> great razors,, smooth i&#x27;ve tried other double edge razor and found the Merkur to be very good... will be buying more</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about using a DE razor at first but I have to say I was surprised by what a great shave I get with these razors. I have to admit, I haven&#x27;t yet tried other brands such as Feather or Derby (I&#x27;ve recently ordered a sample pack.) but I am pleased so far with Merkur.     One of the downsides for me personally, and I can&#x27;t really blame this on Merkur alone, is that I can&#x27;t shave against the grain with a DE razor which means I have to shave more often. With that said, I think its done my skin good for the long run.</li>
            <li> This blade is not sharp enough for my beard, especially on the reverse pull, it sticks and rips the roots. I will try the Derby and if that does not work then Feather.</li>
            <li> Razor goes dull after one shave</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried any of the other double-edge blades.  These work well are sharp and last a reasonable amount of time.  And they don&#x27;t tear up my face. No complaints</li>
            <li> anyone having complaints with these blades must not be using them correctly. in a good razor these blades are the best.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these blades.</li>
            <li> All most the same as other razor that don&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
            <li> I purchased these blades because I have been unable to find good double edge razor blades in the stores.  However, these wer no sharper than the drugstore brands I had been using.    About 4 weeks ago I ordered a different brand of double edge blades:  Schick/Wilkinson.  They sent the wrong type of blade so I contacted them and they said they were mailing out the correct order.  This was 2 weeks ago and I have not received the correct order.  Several efforts to contact them have been futile.  Thus, I remain a very disappointed Amazon user!</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  I don&#x27;t shave that often (maybe every 2 weeks) and my hair is thick and this razor cuts through it with no problem after many shaves (a 10 pack lasted more than a year).  I tried a 10 pack of Feather blades and even after the 5th shave I was still cutting myself BAD (even more than I ever did when I first started shaving with a disposable razor) and not getting near as close a shave as the Merkurs, I threw the other 9 blades away I was so disgusted with them.  The Merkurs are FAR superior!</li>
            <li> I used 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5+1 blades for 20 years before I realized that all I needed was 1 good blade.  For the price of 1 8-pack of 5+1 blades from that well-known blade/razor manufacturer, you can buy a double-edged razor and 10 blades that will last months.  And then it&#x27;s less than $1 a blade from that point forward (even if you buy the most expensive ones).&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever get sick to my stomach when I walk down the shaving aisle again.</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;m a twice a week shaver and bought a pack almost a year ago. I&#x27;m only on my third blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought blades at Wal-Mart for less that were better.  I own and love my Merkur Razor.  Their blades are garbage.  They tug at day old stubble because they are not sharp enough fresh out of the wrapper on the first use.  If you need a good blade man up and buy Feather.  It seems that the Germans are all about recycled steel and their knives and Razor blades show it.  The best knives and Razor blades are coming out of Japan these days.</li>
            <li> pfft! these are low quality - ugh! awful shave! these left my face all bloody! my old razors never did that. #disappointing</li>
            <li> What is not to love, cheap, sharp, and solid well made blades. I&#x27;m so glad i ditched the gillette razors and went with a Merkur straight razor and safety razor</li>
            <li> Love the weight balance ratio and the handle has an excellent grip. client.  However, it is not as close a shave as I would like.  I will most likely upgrade to an adjustable in the future.</li>
            <li> Best shave ever on my delicate black skin</li>
            <li> I bought them to my father and he loves! He always ask to me the same brand. He likes the precision that he can do his beard.  I bought the product first time 2 years ago and they are great ever!</li>
            <li> Good quality product, but I don&#x27;t get as many shaves out of them as I would like.</li>
            <li> These are great blades for my sensitive skin + coarse facial hair. I&#x27;m a novice DE shaver and while I cannot compare these blades to other brands, I can say that I have never cut my face with these and yet they provide a close shave that I&#x27;m satisfied with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI you are buying 10 packs of 10 for a total of 100 blades. I was under the impression that I was paying $7.50 for 10 blades, so this was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Razor are sharp and in a protective case so they are easy to store and kids can&#x27;t get to them easily...</li>
            <li> My husband has a safety razor and has always used these blades. They are not too expensive for how long they last and the shipping was fast from the company that sold them. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other brand... these are the best.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very confortable</li>
            <li> Great blades. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as feather blades</li>
            <li> This was my first set of razor blades. I have sensitive skin and they caused me irritation if I went against the grain or they would pull the hairs leaving little blood dots. The blades also have to be switched every few (2-5) shaves. I switched to sharper Feather blades and problems went away, they also last longer (5-10) shaves.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what more to post on these, great price, great product. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> A standard blade that doesn&#x27;t last long.  Fits my Merkur razor perfectly thought.  I will be looking for something a little more sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a classic double edged razor (also made by Merkur) for about a year now; and I have to say that I&#x27;ll never go back to \\&quot;shaving systems.\\&quot;  People have said that these blades are a mite unforgiving to beginners still learning to properly use a double edged razor, but I never had much of a problem.  True, there is a small learning curve (how I wish the fathers of my generation had not been conned into the \\&quot;multi-blade revolution\\&quot; and had been able to teach us to shave properly).  The rewards for taking the time to learn to shave properly are certainly worth the risks of a few stray nicks at first.  Try them for a year in a well made razor and I&#x27;m sure you will never go back to bloated overpriced and not nearly as effective \\&quot;shave scams\\&quot;...er I mean systems.</li>
            <li> These things are crazy cheap and crazy sharp, so you should only use these if you absolutely have your technique down.  I didn&#x27;t at first and cut the crap out of my face.  But, now I&#x27;ve gotten used to them and only cut myself a couple times per shave.  I wish I was joking.</li>
            <li> For a small object, I was charged $12.00 for shipping, which is way to expensive.  I will never buy these again.</li>
            <li> This is a great blade. I usually get about 10 passes across my face for each blade. I get a smoother, more constant shave than I could have ever expected.    There is a learning curve. The fist few times I cut myself up pretty badly. And last night, girlfriend found out the same thing.    That being said, once I got the hang of it--light, smooth strokes--I never looked back to the other \\&quot;shaving systems\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know why you need 4 or 5 blades when one does the trick so well.</li>
            <li> If you use a double edge safety razor, these are definitely one of the top brands to buy.  High quality and great materials makes a blade that gives a great shave every time.  They are long lasting and do not corrode easily when stored properly.  For the price, you cannot go wrong, and you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Very high quality. Use both sides and you have 20 razor sides.</li>
            <li> I love LOVE love the Merkur Razor Double Edge Razor and this little box of blades is great because it comes with a little slot on the bottom side where you can put your old used blades! So awesome.</li>
            <li> I selected this blade based on the very good reviews that have been made.  I only tried one so far and my shave was perfect.  I did not have any nicks and I have not shaved with this style razor in many years.  I do not know how many shaves I may get from this blade but the first shave was terrific.  You can also purchase this blade in small quantities.  If, in the unlikely event it does not work for you, you will have not made a substantial initial investment and can try another manufacturer without much more expense.</li>
            <li> I bought these when I first started using a DE razor.  Excellent shave and no weeping after I&#x27;m done.  I shave with and against the grain daily with these and my skin feels great.  I tried the \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; blades due to all the positive reviews, but they tore up my face by shaving layers of skin off.  I&#x27;ll be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> They are sharp but hurt my face for a couple of times. Would they be safer?</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.  Shipped promptly upon payment.  Thank you</li>
            <li> They do the job. One razor is good for about a month so 10 blades? 10 months of not worrying about razorblades.</li>
            <li> Good blades, good price gotta love double edged blades so cheap and so much better for shaving. Need to try different blades to find one that better suits my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with my new Merkur safety razor for about 2 weeks now.  Knowing the precision blades that have come out of Solingen Germany, I thought this would this would be the perfect add on.  The blades are smooth and sharp on the first shave.  My facial hair is not long or coarse, so I figured I could and should be able to get 2 shaves out of one blade.  However, with this blade, the 2nd shave drags and pulls a bit.  I still get a decent shave, but not as good as the 1st.  I just ordered the Astra Platinum blades to provide a comparison.  All in all, I would say this is a decent blade.  I am new to safety razors, and with a little patience, I haven&#x27;t had any nicks or cuts with the Merkur blades.</li>
            <li> Great blade to get started with.  Highly recommend for first time safety razor shavers.</li>
            <li> I had been using the old Mach 3 blades and razor and this has completely changed my morning routine. Totally worth it! The blades came in on time and worked splendidly right out of the box.</li>
            <li> These blades were better than the Shark blades I was using before.My shave was closer than before and very quick, even when I went against the grain .However I am still looking for a closer shave still.I would recommend these for most guys ,but use a good pre-shave oil and a light amount of shaving soap.</li>
            <li> These blades are well made and give me a clean close shave every time. I bought a pack of 10, shave about 3 times a week and have had the same 10 for going on 16 months, no cuts or nicks.</li>
            <li> These blades seem very good. They create a close shave and as long as you rinse the razor out frequently, they will not cut your face.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades with a Merkur Safety Razor.  I have to say that I have never had such a good shave.  I used to use the typical three blade $20 razors.  Not any more!</li>
            <li> Had one years ago and remembered how good it worked. I have had electric, blades and all the trendy razors, all expensive and did not work. I do not know why America can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t make quality consumer products any more and I really don&#x27;t care. if they don&#x27;t want my business I will go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> We will see how long they last just got them so far so good can&#x27;t be more expensive than disposable razors</li>
            <li> These blades cut beard hair very well without looking like a you were just in a hack and slash film.  Not one face cut and most strokes don&#x27;t have to be repeated and my beard is like wire.</li>
            <li> These razors sliced my head and my face up. I had month long shaving irritation and razor burn from these things. My neck and head got cut up. Your milage may vary. If you have soft facial fair then by all means use these razors. My facial hair is thick, coarse man hair. If you have my type of hair use the feather razors.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades, almost too sharp sometimes at least with my particular razor. A great deal and last a good while, maybe about a week&#x27;s worth of shaves before they get too dull</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable shave even with my Merkur 34C heavy duty. Will not buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> These blades are great. I am still using the sample bade which comes with the razor...   No nicks. No cuts. No razor burn. This is probably something I will purchase again.  I would advise you to try these as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the real wet-shaving ritual for about a month now, and with my order of the Merkur 1904 \\&quot;#48\\&quot; safety razor came one of the Merkur Supers. I had also ordered a sample pack from Amazon and traded some of these for some that my roommate bought as well. Without a doubt, the Merkur blades hold the finest in my opinion. For a solid shave and blade longevity, I would suggest these. They are not the sharpest (I would go with Feathers or Sharks if you want really sharp), but they seem to work pleasantly in my Merkur razor. Just a side note, for blades I&#x27;ve used that are similar, try Lord, Big Ben, and even Bic Chromes. Overall 5 stars for Merkur&#x27;s blades and 5 stars for Merkur in general.</li>
            <li> I bought a package of these from my barber for about $7.50. The first blade was great -- sharper than the Personna brand (from Wal-Mart) I had tried before. But the sharp edge did not last as long, and the rest of the package was variable in quality. Some were sharp and smooth, some seemed to rip my skin more than others. Not long afterward, Wal-Mart started carrying Wilkinson blades made in Germany for less than $2.00 for ten blades, and they were at least the equal of the Merkur.</li>
            <li> These blades really give a nice close shave and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with nicks. I like them better than my usual Shark blades. They give me a better shave and stay sharp longer. They were delivered remarkably fast in a first class envelope. I wish I had started out with a sampler pack of various blades instead of buying 200 Sharks. Oh,well only a hundred or so to go. I got one regular Merkur blade with a new razor and it is not as good as the super by far.</li>
            <li> Best values per shave overall. I switched to double edge safety razors to save money on shaving. Nowadays we end up paying money for the traditional plastic razors - I remember going to Costco and spending up to 50.00 for refills during the year. I decided to go back in time - asked my dad to teach me how to use a safety razor. I can get a months shave out of one pack. I usually clean the blades well after shaving to preserve the edges. The best price is on Amazon for these after searching. I think these are also just as good as the sharper Japanese Double Edge Razor Blades.</li>
            <li> These work great as a starter blade.  I used them after purchasing the long handled merkur safety razor.  I am eager to try the fearther blades after this pack runs out.  I have a thick beard and once I get the full technique down I think it will be time to move on.  Still great blades, but I have a thick jungle of a beard, so any pull slows me down and stops my movement.</li>
            <li> These razors are fine. They are a little thicker than some razors.I use persona razors now because they are cheaper, sharper, and made in america.</li>
            <li> Super blades. Love the blades, these will last me a long time. I can&#x27;t wait to buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> These blades are priced above many reputable brands, but aren&#x27;t particularly sharp, smooth, or durable.  I made the mistake of thinking that since I bought a Merkur razor, I should put high-quality Merkur blades in it.  Wrong.  Save yourself some hassle and get a box of supremely sharp Feathers instead.</li>
            <li> I shave with these and they work great. The packaging was the right size and the razors come out of the holders easily.</li>
            <li> Shaved 4 times using the same blade, alternating sides, still produces a close shave. Well priced.</li>
            <li> Merkur was my choice due to recommendation of a friend who&#x27;s been using them for long time now. Blades don&#x27;t disappoint. They are somewhat sharper then the ones I used before. Just be careful if you&#x27;re a newbee shaving with razors as they will cut your skin without any effort. Once you get used to them you&#x27;ll be ok. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of paying for razor blades at the grocery store.  These are good (not the best, but VERY good), and a fraction of the cost of grocery store</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this blade seems to be gentle enough so that I&#x27;m not left with razor burn, yet it&#x27;s sharp enough to leave me with a shave that&#x27;s close enough to challenge most cartridge razors. The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it a five star rating is because I thought that the razor would last more than just four shaves before I felt I had to replace it. But then again, I am new to DE razors so maybe I&#x27;m expecting too much.</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent, except when I order them a couple weeks ago they were $3 less than the current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was the first blade in the pack was horrible for some reason. It snagged and nicked me and just didn&#x27;t give me a good shave like my Feather blades. I think it was a dud. I had heard so much about Merkur&#x27;s great reputation that I knew there must have been a mistake. The next day I tried a fresh blade in the pack and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Product was as described, highly recommend seller!</li>
            <li> good shave but doesn&#x27;t last long compared to Derby in my opinion</li>
            <li> Anyone who suggests using these blades is expensive or will cut up your face is probably an agent of the competition. They are far cheaper than the cheapest multi-blade or \\&quot;plastic disposable\\&quot; alternative. Yes, you might suffer one or two minor nicks that require a dab of cotton over the first year of using it, until you get the knack.   The feeling, both while shaving, and afterwards, is great. Plus, you feel rooted to the past, planted with both feet on the ground. This is a small yet telling way to become an agrarian.</li>
            <li> Bought these razor from the Art of Shaving store in Crabtree Mall in Raleigh, very dissapointed, rash showed before I could finish shaving and permanently scared my face.</li>
            <li> They do their job. Inexpensive and quick. Last for a good long time when paired with a good razor. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> not as sharp as I expected but it works.I tried one a few times and it done the job just not as sharp as I thought</li>
            <li> These are excellent blades and sometimes hard to find in the store.  Price was excellent compared to traditional store.</li>
            <li> Short:  I highly recommend the product.     These are great razors at a great price.  I analyzed prices found on the Internet and it sounds like you will be paying 50 cents per blade.  That price is more than fair for the quality of these blades.  They are sharp, durable and you can recycle them after you are done.  Can you do the same with Mach-3 cartridges? Tip -- buy them in bulk.     If you have spare time do your wallet a favor and calculate how much money you will save by switching to double edge razors.  I can&#x27;t believe I used to spend $120+ per year on Mach-3 systems!</li>
            <li> Bought a few packs of these to go with the new Merkur shaver. Blades are ultra high quality and are a great price.</li>
            <li> These blades don&#x27;t seem to agree with my face. They may work for some people, but another brand works better for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades. Last a long time and gives several comfortable shaves. Definitely out lasts a disposable or multi blade razor. If you have not tried shaving with a double edge your missing out.</li>
            <li> You folks said you could not ship this item to me... problem, but I have  not seen the refund posted to my account yet??? Please send me a copy  via email of my reufnd, date and time and where exacly sent to.    Thank you.  Dave Peterson</li>
            <li> No complaints. These seem to be working quite well. Everything is I expected. I&#x27;m glad I remembered to order the blades.</li>
            <li> Great baldes.  I bought this extra pack cause I&#x27;m unaware how long these blades usually last.  They seem super sharp!  Love them!</li>
            <li> I bought some other blades made in Russia then these. These bladed work with my face much better and I&#x27;ve been trying to get through the Astra blades as fast as possible so I can orders these again. The Astra blades aren&#x27;t bad I quality or anything, these Merkur are better for my hair type and face.</li>
            <li> I get a great shave with these blades.</li>
            <li> Sharp and silky. Mmm. I bought a few stack of these for my lovely face, which really appreciates it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word could is lame.</li>
            <li> These are the first double edge razor blades I have ever used so I can&#x27;t compare to other brands.  However, compared to every cartridge razor I have ever used these are hands down so much better.  These blades provide the closest shave I have ever achieved.  First I do a pass in the direction of hair growth, then rinse lather and repeat against the grain.  Double edge safety razors take a bit longer to shave with but the results are amazing.  Combine these blades with a nice Merkur handle, some good shaving cream, and a decent badger hair brush and you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> These blades stay sharp. With these I will typically only replace my blade every few months (shaving once per week). I do make sure to clean them off after every shave though, which probably helps (rinse them off under water and then carefully wipe off any debris with a finger.</li>
            <li> Forget about those disposable five blades razors.  This is just like what my Godfather used, and he knew how to shave.  This blade is simple and it gives me the closest shave (every 3-day) without nicks, cuts, in-grown hair, or razor bumps.  Hard to find though ...</li>
            <li> Do you find yourself forced to choose between buying decent razor blades or putting a down payment on a home? Isn&#x27;t it interesting that big ticket items such as home computers and digital cameras continue to drop in price, making them available to everyone at a reasonable cost, while all the &#x27;Shaving Systems&#x27; and attendant accoutrements continue to skyrocket into the stratosphere? Gillete&#x27;s Mach 3 blades are sold on Amazon in packs of 8 ($17.99) and in packs of 12 ($28.99.) The Schick Quattro blades are also available, package of 8, for $21.99. Twenty to thirty bucks for a pack of razor blades? Have you people taken leave of your senses? I don&#x27;t care how many new blades you add; the flashy colors and tacky gimmicks fail to impress me any longer. The Shaving Barons have ripped me off for long enough!  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These blades offer a very comfortable shave for a fraction of the price. Making the switch to an old school double edged razor kit may seem prohibitively expensive at first, but in the long run you&#x27;ll save a bundle. If you&#x27;re up 15 to 20 bucks every time you buy new blades the switch will pay for itself in under a year, clearing up lots of extra cash for interesting stuff like books or CDs. The best choice seems pretty self-evident to this reviewer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I would like to add that Merkur makes exceptionally fine razors as well as blades. If you are contemplating taking the plunge I recommend checking out their product line further. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Great price for blades and they seems to do a decent job shaving. I have not tried any other brands so I really cannot compare them. Would buy more of these though.</li>
            <li> Best blades you&#x27;ll ever buy!! container they rest in is awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought a Merkur Long Handle Safety Razor and it came with one of those blades. So far I&#x27;ve tried this one and Wilkinson Sword Blades. With the Wilkinsons I had quite a bunch of razor bumps. The Merkur seems to fit me best.&lt;br /&gt;That does not mean that this&#x27;ll work for you. I found out with saftey razors, you have to try different blades to find the right fit.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately they&#x27;re not expensive at all and you&#x27;re gonna be a very happy camper once you found the right blade to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;This Merkur Blade gives me a smooth and clean shave, even against the grain.</li>
            <li> Do the job and last......easy to order with razor...quality product fit is perfect..how much can you say about razor blades</li>
            <li> Just tried my merkur razor and blades. Have to say never used a razor like this before but it gives a really close smooth shave. But like I said my first time even use it. I was just wondering if someone who has used could just let me know how long the blades are good for before you need to change them? any help would be great thanks.</li>
            <li> The quality manifests itself in the shave.  I will continue to use these razors for a long time.  They are beyond imagination sharp and hold their edge for at least one to two weeks easily.  The only issue is that I need to be really careful and slow down or I will nick a little slice of the skin.  I&#x27;m a master now and the shave is baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li> I have had my Merkur DE (Double-Edge) razor for over a year now.  Like many others I was tired of paying through the nose for cartrige-style blades and wanted another option.  I did nick myself learning to use it properly, but it really is no big deal.  Just go slow, use lots of good hot water and a quality shave cream (Proraso and Cremo both work fine). Change your blades once or twice a week - the blades are very sharp, but so cheap in comparison to the carts that they practically give them away, esp. if you buy in bulk.  I have had good results with blades maufactured by Merkur, Feather, and Gilette 7 O&#x27;clock.</li>
            <li> They work good They do not last like the old ones I really do not know whether it&#x27;s my miss using or the quality of the product</li>
            <li> Excellent Razor Blades</li>
            <li> I believe the trick with a DE razor is to make sure you buy a good one and make should it is closed tightly. I have a Merkur razor and blades and never got a closer shave. Still looking for decently priced blades though.</li>
            <li> Well-built; solid; simple.  The blades (enclosed) are super sharp and despite some heavy use haven&#x27;t lost much sharpness.  It rinses clean (probably in part because it has no gummy &#x27;lubricants&#x27; clogging things up...). This is light-years better than the sorry three and five blade  &#x27;razors&#x27; I was buying in the local drugstore!</li>
            <li> Bought these extra blades to go with the razor I purchased .. I got them qiuckly and they were priced reasonably</li>
            <li> I gave my husband the Merkur razor and blades for Christmas.  He loves shaving with them, and they give him an affordable, clean shave.  No more wasting $ on razor blades at the store!</li>
            <li> Smooth and close shave.  Wish they were cheaper but worth it.  You only have one face!</li>
            <li> I use a Merkur Hefty DE razor, and I use to use Feather blades.  I have now started using the Merkur blades and they seem to work better.  I have a really thick coarse beard (think Fred Flintstone) and the Merkurs only last me 3 shaves, but hey at the price that&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s still better than the mach 3 cartridges I use to buy that were like $8+ for four.  They would only give me 4-5 decent shaves.  I like these because while not as sharp as Feathers they seem to be more consistent than Feathers.  Every blade is the same sharpness and quality.</li>
            <li> Once you try a safety razor shave with a quality shave cream or gel, you&#x27;ll never go back to those overpriced cartridge razors. Try these blades with the Merkur heavy duty razor.</li>
            <li> The mechanical set up means you have to remove the head completely before you can get to the blade.  This is a little dangerous as the blade is naturally very sharp.  Also, the system does not work well with gel-based shaving cremes.  Loads up too quickly and requires very frequent cleaning with hot water to clean and continue to shave.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for these razor blades.  But the performance of these razor blades is a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am choosing this rating because the razor doesn&#x27;t work well. It doesn&#x27;t give a close shave at all. I would not recommend this product to anyone that actually has facial hair. I tried it several times before finally giving up.</li>
            <li> I love the razors though if you do some research you can find different prices. Break the cost down on a per basis and see what you find. You can buy them as a single (I do the subscribe and save which seems to be the best deal) or in bundles.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to try them out.  They are very sharp but I have found that I like the feather blades better.  These are good for a noob but don&#x27;t give quite as close shave as the feather blades</li>
            <li> These blades are so-so. Do yourself a favor and go with Gillette Silver Blues instead. They are sharper, give a better shave, and hold their edge better than these Merkurs,</li>
            <li> By far the best performing blade I&#x27;ve used so far. Sure they are expensive, however, they hold up. I specifically use this blade to shave my head. Handles the job like a champ.</li>
            <li> Good value if you like safety razor shaving.  However, I have gone back to the Gillette blades because they really do give a far superior shave.  They also last longer so the price difference is not as great as it first appears.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these blades. he says they are exceptionally sharp and he gets a reliably smooth shave with every use. They are long lasting and very high quality!</li>
            <li> Good quality blades at a good price. They seem to last a reasonable number of shaves and are comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> These blades are nice and sharp, and last me a week or more. I get a nicer three-pass shave with them than I get with the Mach-3 blades I used to use. These blades feel sharper, and are much cheaper. I would recommend buying the blades in bulk if you can, however.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the blades available when purchasing the long handled safety razor.  My husband still getting use to the feel of it.  VERY close shave!!</li>
            <li> Because this is the first DE blade I&#x27;ve used in forever, I have to cut this some slack.&lt;br /&gt;1) My technique may have needed refinement.&lt;br /&gt;2) I was a newbie using it in a Merkur Futur, which has a pretty steep learning curve&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to come back to this blade after I evaluate a few more, but just starting out it cut me up pretty bad.</li>
            <li> A good product.  Serves the purpose for a short period of time, but the Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock is a better blade.</li>
            <li> These blades are fantastic!  I bought them along with the Merkur Long-Handled Safety Razor #180.  There&#x27;s a huge difference between these and any other razor I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve used single blade, double-blade, etc etc, razors, and they simply don&#x27;t compare.  This went through a 3-day growth of beard without a problem.  Disposable razors and even supposedly good razors with replaceable blades couldn&#x27;t even come close.  I used to get razor burn every time I shaved, but these blades are so sharp that&#x27;s not really a problem any more.  You do have to be a little more careful simply because they are so sharp, but that&#x27;s really the only drawback.  Also, since they are double-edged blades, I can use one side and my wife can use the other (they&#x27;re marked with a &#x27;I&#x27; and &#x27;II&#x27; on the edge of the blade so you know which side you&#x27;re using.)</li>
            <li> So far so good!! All Good</li>
            <li> I found these razors weren&#x27;t as good as the feather Hi stainless. I got nicks with these and as a result I still haven&#x27;t used all of them. If you get the merkur model 180, you get one or two of these blades and I would suggest buying a different brand to compare.</li>
            <li> These blades are terrible! While Merkur makes fine razors (I&#x27;ve used a 180/23c for years), their blades are horrible. Draggy and dull right out of the box. I have to use a Feather or Bluebird blade for a week before it gets as dull as a new Merkur.</li>
            <li> These are high quality blades that have an exceptionally sharp edge. Not much more to say, other than I have never had a closer shave than when using these particular blades.</li>
            <li> Yes, it removed hair from my face, so I can&#x27;t give it one star. However, it felt like it was pulling each hair out rather than cutting. I only used these because I ran out of Feathers, and would rather go scruffy than use these blades again.</li>
            <li> I use a Merkur razor so I tried their blades.  They&#x27;re ok but not as smooth and as close as others like Wilkinson, Shark, and Astra for me.</li>
            <li> IIndividually wrapped, easy to handle and install and quite sharp.  Highly recommend to anyone who requires a smooth shave.  They last longer than the big box store brands as well.</li>
            <li> These razor blades work great with my Merkur Model 178 Classic Safety Razor.  Gives a good shave.  I have enjoyed the switch from modern multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Probably the best I&#x27;ve used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different safety razors</li>
            <li> Very good blades. Smooth shave. And, much better than a $45.00 four pack of blades</li>
            <li> If we all went back the big companies would lower their prices. With a little patience you will not nick yourself</li>
            <li> I bought these to go along with the Merkur Double Edge #34C razor and they work great. they seem to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Merkur blades are decent, as each blade works differently for everyone I can&#x27;t say they won&#x27;t be the best for you. Good price, last 3-4 shaves</li>
            <li> Work as advertised.  The case they come in a little tricky, but works well.  The blades are sharp and cut easily.</li>
            <li> Good blade for a beginner, not sharp enough</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried so many blades, and not all are equal.  I&#x27;m very happy  my barber recommended these, bc i have not used a single other blade since.  i am now a merkur loyalist for life.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair and found these blades to be sort of inferior to a lot of the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve had much better success with Feather, Astro, and recently happy with Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock SharpEdge. These Merkur blades just aren&#x27;t sharp, consistent, or durable enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first set of razors with my new safety razor.  So far they seem to be working just fine.  I read a bunch of reviews about different razors.  Some sharper than others etc...  These seem to be working just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Works well but wish I had ordered a long handle model. Very high quality and easy to maintain. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> amazing product, wont be wasting $$ on disposables anymore!  really really worth it to anyone with thick beard hair. :)</li>
            <li> What does one expect from razor blades? They&#x27;re sharp, razor sharp. Nothing special, nothing wrong. What more can one say about razorblades?</li>
            <li> Having recently migrated back to double edge blades from the multis, I found this blade to be comfortable, reliable, and long-lasting.  A good choice that I will continue to make.</li>
            <li> Like the Germans, these blades are little stiff; however, sharp.</li>
            <li> If you have never shaved with a real razor then get one and use these blades. American made blades are OK but nothing seems to compare to a Merkur. These things shave smooth as butter. I used to use the two and three blade razors but all they did was butcher my face. Not so with a real safety razor. Very nice indeed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a point of reference in order to compare them to other blades but they fit perfectly into my Merkur safety razor and give me a nice shave. The price is on par with 10 pack blades that I&#x27;ve seen at local retail stores.  Zero complaints.</li>
            <li> sharp blade. works very well</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole old-school wetshaving thing, and like many of the other reviewers here, I am actually enjoying shaving for the first time ever.  From my first Atra to my last Fusion, I succeeded primarily in scraping off half my face before razor-burned first dates and family photos.  Utter garbage from Gillette and Schick.      Now I find myself geeking  out, checking out soap vs. cream, Portuguese vs. Italian vs. English vs. American creams, and, finally, different blades in my Merkur HD razor with my badger brush.  Most of other people&#x27;s observatons vis-a-vis aggressiveness seem to match my experience so far.  The Israeli blades are very forgiving, but the shave is not as close.  I&#x27;m waiting for my shipment of Feather blades from Japan to see if they are as aggressive as they say.    As for these blades, they&#x27;re the first I used with my new set-up, post-Gillette.  They immediately gave me an ultra close shave, but with a few small nicks and no burn at all.  I am going back to them after discarding my current blade, a crappy American-made blade I bought in the grocery store for $2 for 10.  So I&#x27;ll find out if the few nicks were in my learning curve or just a byproduct of the aggressiveness of the blade.    I am not anti-capitalist nor anti-big business.  I am, though, anti-big marketing firms that mold people&#x27;s perceptions in order to sell mass quantities of crap to the \\&quot;great unwashed\\&quot;.  I am now well-washed.  And shaven..</li>
            <li> My favorite blades!  These are sharp and give a great shave. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand of blade in my razor.</li>
            <li> Nice German razor blades. I started to hate shaving and dreading it when I had my mach 4. I have the Merkur razor too. These give a nice cut. My facial hair grows out ridiculously even, that it actually feels smooth because it grows out so even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for over a month now.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with them and enjoy the simplistic and inexpensive nature of these razors.</li>
            <li> My favs, plus they&#x27;re made in Germany. The krauts have skillz, these are no exception. Here good for a few uses on each blade.</li>
            <li> slightly thicker then feather and my be better on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;definitely high quality, i notice only a slight difference between these and feather but a huge difference to the cheap ones at super markets.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality of blade.  Gives a clean shave every time.  Easy to install in safety razor.  Would recommend to anyone wanting a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth, sharp and provides a smooth shave.  Easy to install, last longer than regular blades, gives a balanced shave for my tough facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Durable good blade.  Make sure you. Take out and clean well however after each shaving session. Achieve a nice close shave!</li>
            <li> These last very long considering their price and how thin they are. I only shave a couple times a week because my girlfriend likes to see my scruff even though my employer doesn&#x27;t! These last me about 6-8 shaves before I feel like they should be replaced. That comes down to about 1 pack a year. Cheap if you ask me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used worse blades, but this one definetly needs several extra passes to get baby smooth skin. Additionally, these are pretty easy to cut yourself with compared to some other blade brands.</li>
            <li> After to much research I was scared the first time I picked up my DE razor with these blades. it&#x27;s shaving people, don&#x27;t over think it, just go slow and be careful. These are nice blades, be careful, take your time and they give an excellent shave</li>
            <li> Typical razor blades. Cut well. Good bargain. I don&#x27;t shave that much and this box of razors will last me a solid year.</li>
            <li> Blades for safety razor.  Only time will tell how good they and how many shaves I can get out of one.  Only shaved 3 times with the blade so must wait and see.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic!  I had tried Derby blades before, which I thought were great at the time.  These Merkur blades are as much an improvement over Derby as the safety razor was over cartridges in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to try Feather blades next time, as I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re even sharper, but these are great and you won&#x27;t regret buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think these blades could be any better than they already are. Their edge holds up to my stiff wiry beard very well. The individual wrapping is a nice touch. They flex and bend as needed to accommodate my de razor.</li>
            <li> Trautz auf deutsch fabrik, es ist zu schreckt (read bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after even 2 shaves, it begans to dull.  i can only get about 12 - 15 shaves vs.&lt;br /&gt;no name K-mart lasting 35 shaves.  and i wipe any moisture off the blades for both,&lt;br /&gt;the no-name brand and the merkur despite the latter reads no need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;remember, the major cause of poor lasting edge is the rust u don&#x27;t c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the merkur blades r too expensive to boot!  i won&#x27;t buy it again.  Warning:&lt;br /&gt;K-mart had other no-name blades that didn&#x27;t last either but this last one bought&lt;br /&gt;about 4 months ago is still bood, blade after blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sei nicht kaufen das merkur blade!!!</li>
            <li> blades work great on my face. all sharp, no defects. used other blades that are deemed &amp;#34;higher quality&amp;#34; via forums but would rank this right along side them.</li>
            <li> Not good at all i will keep looking</li>
            <li> Got these to try out with my guys razor because he read somewhere they were one of the best blades. He definitely got a better shave than with the previous blades he had. The cost is a little bit steep for that amount of blades but still cheaper than the disposables we had been purchasing. He really likes these blades,</li>
            <li> I wanted to return to my earlier year with the old Gillette double edge razor...this looked like a perfect answer.  I used it several times and found it difficult to properly shave.  I&#x27;ve replaced it with a quattro razor and cartidge that works much to my liking.</li>
            <li> Along with the razor device itself, these blades are superior. I recommend to everyone who wants to try this time tested type of shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting the shave I want and I&#x27;m getting to many cuts on my face</li>
            <li> Does its job, sharp and to the point, direct replacedment for the shaver that I purchased it for so you cant ask for more.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a easy smooth shve for men or women, this is the blade for you.  A great Shaving Soap /squareup.com/market/hive-and-honey-beepothecary/tangerine-and-rosemary-shaving-soap</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. Bout some with my first DE razor assuming they would be great because they are German made but I&#x27;m not super impressed. I don&#x27;t think they are much better for me than Derbys which are a lot cheaper. At this point I think feather are my favorite but everyone&#x27;s different. If you are new get a sampler of blades and see what works best for you.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard, these razors weren&#x27;t very sharp for me, it took two or three of these blades just to get one good shave, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> They can and will last a long time as long as you clean rinse and dry them after every use.  I expect this box of razors to last a year.  Stick to Merkur or Gillette platinum razors.</li>
            <li> This blade left me with razor burn, and my face being sore for a couple of days. DO NOT Recommend.</li>
            <li> No pulling just an easy glide across my face. I shave with &amp; against the whisker grain. Smoothest shave; result in baby butt smoothness</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried others for my razor but I ordered these and I use one about every two weeks. Yes that&#x27;s right two weeks and I use it a minimum of six times a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for a while. I have a very thick beard, but I have been able to use a blade for two or three weeks.</li>
            <li> Does not do what it advertises&lt;br /&gt;Shaves skin more than hair..not a good quality..will throw away and go mack to mach 3</li>
            <li> Has remained sharp even after a dozen uses, will be interesting to see how many uses I get before I have to change the blade. Best value in blades I have ever found.</li>
            <li> I use these in my Merkur long-handle safety razor. The one that came with the razor when I bought it lasted a really long time. These repalcements are the same that come with the razor when you buy it. You will get months of high-quality and long-lasting, close shaves with this pack of Merkur double edge razor blades.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used so far. Fewer nicks than other brands I&#x27;ve used in the past. Great price as well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only razors I will use for my single blade.</li>
            <li> This is the first brand I have tested but I am a little disappointed as each blade is good for only two shaves. It could be my whiskers more than the blade but I thought I should get more shaves per blade than what I do.</li>
            <li> Just be aware, this is just 10 blades! Should have read the fine print.</li>
            <li> Super sharp - just as expected. Gives a great shave in the Merkur safety razor.</li>
            <li> These blades are smooth and sharp. I have had no nicks or cuts, just nice and smooth close shaves. I haven&#x27;t had a shave this good in years.</li>
            <li> Merkurs were the first blades I bought for DE shaving. They tugged on my hairs and cut my face apart in my Merkur long handle. After some months I came back and tried them again with a marked improvement but found in a Open Comb razor these things are actually usable. I consider them more razor dependent than other blades.</li>
            <li> Just went back to a double edged blade. I tried sharpening these but for the price maybe not worth the hassle. I&#x27;ll work on it. But I will come back for more.</li>
            <li> These work very good at cutting and nice and smooth shave, but- they are a bit pricey and they last along time before you have to change to blade again.</li>
            <li> Sharp, and hold a nice edge for a long time.  What more do you need out of a razor blade?</li>
            <li> Great blades! Although my Merkur Safety Razor came with its original blade, I changed it today and the difference is amazing. Also, with a good lather you can achieve a great shave. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is a solid product. I have not used a safety razor for years. But I received one as a present that contained these blades. I have used Merkurs, Feathers and Gillettes with it. I cannot decide between these and the Feathers which I like best. They both shave about the same with the same results. I have to take my time with the Feathers as they seem a bit sharper but the results are about the same with these two brands.</li>
            <li> I purchased these razors for my husband for the Merkur Model 180 Long and they are great. The shave is really close and he doesn&#x27;t need to shave everyday. Not sure how long one razor lasts, because he is changing them every other shave.</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin. A good buy. Very good value for money. Will buy again and stick to it. Great it&#x27;s an add on.</li>
            <li> I have tried Derby, Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Green, Black, and Yellow, Gillette Silver Blues, Blue bird, Astra, Shark, Feather, and Dorko blades and none were near as bad as this one. Very uncomfortable blade for my face. My buddy gave me a pack and after one shave with these I have zero desire to try another go with these horrid blades.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this brand.  Well made and gives an excellent shave without skipping or tugging your skin.</li>
            <li> A must have for a safety razors.  Blades are not included with most razors.  Great for a close shave .</li>
            <li> This is the Wusthof of shaving blades.  Use it with the Merkur safety razor and you will never want to use the expensive shaving products that are on the market.  This one blade does a much better job then the 5 blade units that are sold to make you believe that is the only way to a close shave.</li>
            <li> Very good quality double edge razor</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;Fits both my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NL0T1G/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3&lt;br /&gt;and an off-the-shelf plastic straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this brand of blades again. Cuts my fine mustache hairs and delicate nose hairs flawlessly.</li>
            <li> old school shaving equiptment</li>
            <li> I love this razor, like shaving with straight razor, very close shave....I love it. Shave last for days .....great job</li>
            <li> Work great. Especially like the way you can dispose the used blades in the container to keep them safe.</li>
            <li> Best razor blades I&#x27;ve used gives me a baby smooth shave. If you never shave with a DE razor you will have to learn to take your time,but you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> good item i like better than does gillets at walmart to much money in ordinary razors i like coz they cheap</li>
            <li> Great product . Holds its edge and provides for a comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to others looking for a great shaving experience .</li>
            <li> Not the best blade for your buck.  I noticed a big difference between these and ASTRA blades.  Definitly pick ASTRA over therse!</li>
            <li> These are great, sharp, and thin razors. These are way better than what one can buy at Sally&#x27;s. I will sign up for the refills every 3 months.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES his new razor. And I love his face after he shaves with it- nice! Thank you for having it.</li>
            <li> I just started DE shaving and even though I am enjoying the whole process i feel this blade could be better. Seems to pull a lot at my hairs trying the Derby extras next</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is new to DE shaving and this is the blade that came with his Merkur long handled razor. Being inexperienced with other blades of this type we are giving it a four star because he has had nothing yet to compare it to. I bought him these as replacements and am sure that they will be just as easy to use as the one that came with it. He has not had any issues cutting himself while shaving with this blade and has had no razor burn or bumps! His skin is just smooth and soft after shaving with these and his C.O. Bigelow shaving cream(the tube, not the can). Lather up really well using a good brush and get a smooth shave with these quality blades.</li>
            <li> The Mercur blades are great for one/two shaves. I found the Astra better based on number of blades. Both shave great, but value is key here.&lt;br /&gt;**Update** Once I relearned how to shave with this type of blade, I get five shaves vs the one/two before.</li>
            <li> This is the first de blade that I used.  I have tried a couple of different brands and will most likely go to others before buying this one again, however, for a beginner just learning how to shave, this works ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can actually hear the hair getting cut which also adds to the pulling and tugging of the hairs.  I tried very little pressure and used a new blade every 2-3 uses but even as my technique improved, the results of pulling and tugging were the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying a sample pack before committing to one blade or another.</li>
            <li> It was good for the things i had to use it for</li>
            <li> These blades are so much better than today&#x27;s so called advanced technology multi-blades. Also, these are of a much higher quality than other singles. They provide an ultra close shave and were shipped promptly, packaged well, and better than advertised.</li>
            <li> These blades aren&#x27;t bad but not the best, Personna DE blades are better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> These blades work great and came with my new Merkur Razor.  I have no complaints, but noticed that the Feather Razor Blades (which are Japanese Stainless) seem to provide me with a little better shave.&lt;br /&gt;I urge you to try a few different kinds to see what works best for your skin type.  I could really use either blade, but like the Feathers slightly better.  With that said, the Feather blades don&#x27;t seem to hold their razor edge as long (i.e. less shaves per blade).  Not that this is such a big deal - the blade packs are rather affordably priced.</li>
            <li> The Feather blades gives a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to cut myself more often with thess blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad but...</li>
            <li> Cheaper than cartridges and I highly recommend these if you decide to go with a safety razor these blades are a must.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I could say about these. They shave nicely and don&#x27;t take off any flesh so I guess that&#x27;s good. Numerous shaves and I&#x27;m still on the same one with no perceptible decrease in performance. In the interest of full disclosure here though, it takes me about three days do grow visible stubble.</li>
            <li> Good contemporary option for the safety razor. Probably comparable to the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock blades. Remember that nothing in the way of quality is the same as it was decades ago when a blade really was a blade in the commercial market.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these blades as they give a very good cut with nicks, bumps nor razor burn on my face after the first week.&lt;br /&gt;These blades are sharp but not as sharp as feathers of course but give a clean and soft cut.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck and these razors seem a bit too dull.  I&#x27;ve since used the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; brand razors, which are much sharper and cause much less irritation for me.  If you have sensitive skin, I would recommend the &amp;#34;Feather&amp;#34; razors over these.</li>
            <li> I am revewing 5 different DE blades in one which seems off topic yeah... but I think is appropriate so you can get a feel for how this specific blade performs or stacks up to the competition. A little pre-info, I use an Edwin Jagger DE89BL razor and EJ best badger brush with Lucky Tiger aftershave, and either proraso sensitive shaving soap or Dr Harris Lavender shaving soap (I like them both).  Sometimes I use a dot of cocoa butter lotion with the lucky tiger if my skin is feeling particularly dry (but usually I like that lucky tiger does not leave much moisturizing behind though as my skin is typically not dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to the review.  I purchased a variety pack containing blades from the following: merkur,  personna platinum israeli red version, astra premium platinum, derby, and feather hi stainless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is how I feel after having used up all 5 packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather: Definitely the sharpest by far, but not my favorite. Seems to easily dig into my skin regardless of my angle or pressure.  Really slides through the hair but makes my skin feel unhappy after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Merkur: Very middle ground.  A little too much resistance but all around solid blade if you get a good price or they are your only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra: I didn&#x27;t like these very much.  Didn&#x27;t like the way the drag on my face feels or the shave I get from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personna Red Israeli version:  My favorite blades, pretty sharp, glides over face nicely, leaves me with no razor burn.  A little more expensive though and hard to get on amazon sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby: Solid performer, I don&#x27;t like them quite as much as the personna reds but they are better for me than merkur and the ones I choose to purchase because they are wicked cheap on a lot of sites.  I would only choose the personnas over thesee if I could find the personnas for a more competative price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  After having used the personnas and the derby&#x27;s off and on for a year (the derby ones are just so cheap sometimes) I have to admit that the derby have grown on me, not only because of the price, but also because I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to their shave.  I&#x27;ve actually decided to exclusively use derby blades since this review.st so cheap sometimes) I have to admit that the derby have grown on me, not only because of the price, but also because I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to their shave.  I&#x27;ve actually decided to exclusively use derby blades since this review.</li>
            <li> So far so good My husband loves this product. He back shaving the old way and so glad he received the whole shaving set I bought him for one of his Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great, it&amp;#34;s the closest shave I have ever had. I bought the soap style shaving cream and didn&#x27;t cut myself the first three times. I decided to use in a can shaving cream to see the difference, a few small cuts. I recommend getting the professional style soap. The shaver is set to the perfect angle. Had a bit of trouble getting right under my nose, but getting better with practice. To use this shaver it&#x27;s best to use a slower stroke. Always have your skin wet with this shaver. Bye Bye expensive replacement heads for the 3 blade ones. I love shaving now, takes a bit more time, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Popped a blade in and had one of the worst shaves of my life. These are not good razors at least for this face. My beard is average, not super thick and I shave daily so no, would not suggest you buy this.</li>
            <li> Got these razors to work with my Merkur razor. Let me tell you that you will save a bunch on these razors and the work great!</li>
            <li> Provides a nice shave with ample durability.  Will reorder when this package is exhausted.  Worth a try if you like a blade.</li>
            <li> These are very nice, high quality blades. They are a bit pricey but they are very sharp and  well worht the money.</li>
            <li> Very best blade for my beard.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Merkur safety razor for about a year now. I have tried several different blades and I must say that these are horrible. Compared to Feather or Derby blades (my favorites) these seem too stiff and not nearly sharp enough. I have a sharp jawline and I must say these blades do not conform to it at all. Several strokes in different directions and techniques trying to get the blade to cut, only left my face sore and far from smooth. With the Feather and/or Derby blades I can easily cut through over a weeks growth with no irritation and at worst 1-2 nicks if I&#x27;m in a hurry. Spend the extra dollar and pick up some feather blades, or spend the same and grab a pack of quality Derby blades.</li>
            <li> Excelente un filo extraordinario</li>
            <li> Excellent service.   Fast delivery. I was surprised to find safety razor blades on Amazon.  I was surprised to find them anywhere for that matter. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Superior construction.  Heavy and sturdy.  Fits your hand very easily.  No knicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the blue 3-blade disposal razors for the past 30 yrs and had been satisfied.  However, as I got older, now 64, I discovered that these disposal razors would only last 1 1/2 shaves, possibly due to my whiskers becoming more coarse and thicker.  With my new Double Edge Razor and double edge blades, I now get up to 6 or 7 complete shaves and, they are very much closer and the skin is smoother!!!&lt;br /&gt;So, I am saving money, by getting more shaves on less costly blades and I am receiving closer shaves!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I prefer a mild, smooth shave and Merkur is one of the three blades I use and the best of the three. I get about 3 - 4 shaves per blade, seldom any nicks or cuts and if I do it&#x27;s &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;, not the blade, never any irritation. It&#x27;s much like the old Gillette &#x27;Spoiler&#x27; to my memory.  Perhaps a little better. I really love this blade and will always keep it in my rotation!</li>
            <li> Love the Mercur Razor and blades its the best quality heavy dont buy any cheaper razor or blade. It saves a fortune is disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Love it! My husband finally shaves daily instead of weekly. 😃 It feels good to have located this razor. Superb!</li>
            <li> I love my merkur double edged razor but their replacement blades didn&#x27;t really work very well for me. Couple this with the fact they are among the most expensive on Amazon and steering away from these seems like a no brainier. Seems too mild with the merkur safety blade, which I understand to be on the milder side amongst DE razor options.</li>
            <li> I have a light to medium beard and I get 2 or 3 decent shaves per blade. Gillette Silver Blue, BIC or Wilkinson sword hold up much better.</li>
            <li> Great product with a very good value. Have tried others, but I keep going back to these blades. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smooth and aggressive all in one.</li>
            <li> These work so much better than the standard safety razors (as long as you DON&#x27;T try to take them on flight) I get a closer shave for much less money than ever before. Each one last me about a week or two, and then I get to throw them out for a brand new one for about a nickel. The safety razors I could make last for 3 or 4 weeks, but they cost me an arm and a leg and let&#x27;s face it, I was using them dull for a while.</li>
            <li> These blades are definitely sharp and last several shaves.  I just changed to a double edged razor and really enjoy shaving with these blades.</li>
            <li> My face appreciates the slight extra expense and effort to get these blades.  Cheaper blades at my drugstore and elsewhere are simply and only that -- cheaper ....  but definitely not as good.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy maybe it was the razor but I would not recommend these for any reason unless well nope can&#x27;t think of one</li>
            <li> Works Ok.  These blades are difficult find locally.</li>
            <li> My husband says these razors work so much better than all these new razors with 2, 3 and 4 blades!  He had forgotten how much better a shave he gets with these~</li>
            <li> This razor was bought for my husband who has been complaining about not getting a close shave with the typical plastic razor. I saw this razor and purchased it for Father&#x27;s Day for him, and he loves it! It gives him a closer shave then the double and triple blade razors that he&#x27;s been buying. He also feels that it&#x27;s more economical because beyond the initial purchase of the metal razor the blades are relatively cheap. You are also not using plastic and throwing it away in the garbage so for the ecology it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unimpressed with these blades. Won&#x27;t buy again.Shaving was very time consuming and required multiple strokes and more pressure that I&#x27;d prefer to use on my face with a razor.</li>
            <li> Do want to spend one dollar a month for blades and enjoy close safe shaves?</li>
            <li> Works well but I&#x27;m not good eith single bkade</li>
            <li> This product works just fine, it seems a bit larger than the safety razor that holds it. I would recommend this product but I wished it would fit snuggly in holder.</li>
            <li> Good and Clean shave, the blades do no nick, cut or anything.</li>
            <li> Bought several packages to compare Merkur with Wilkinson Sword. Both are very satisfactory and very cost effective. I prefer the Sensor Excel system for ease of use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t quite meet my expectations.  The shave wasn&#x27;t as close as the new style razors.  My neck always got nicked too and I only had it set on #2.  I donated it to the Goodwill.</li>
            <li> I use these with my Merkur long handled safety razor and they give you a close smooth shave with minimal irritation, and they are far cheaper than any disposable razor or cartridges have ever been. Depending on your shaving needs a single razor could last you upward of one month for effective use.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband for his birthday. He&#x27;s new to the safety razor world, and he likes them. He is considering getting a sampler when he runs out so he can see if sharper or duller is better for him. He hasn&#x27;t had any problems with these causing irritation for him except when his face was sunburned, even though he has fairly sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li> These last forever, and are so inexpensive.  Not only is the shave off a safety razor less irritating, the cost of those environmentally disastrous huge disposable blades is absurd....  and all marketing.  Go back to these blades and a safety razor - your face and pocket book will thank you.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - great quality - perfect for the job and really easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I wanted - super sharp</li>
            <li> Exceptional. Great shaves. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to switch from conventional multi blade razors. Very easy to use and change blades</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the razor blades that I ordered.  They work well and I will order them again when needed.</li>
            <li> Bought this because of the reviews stating that they are just as good as the double or triple bladed counterparts.  The blades dont last long and you cant get a close shave.  i wish i never wasted my money.</li>
            <li> perfect. nice and heavy for a smooth glide without needing much pressure. simple is the way to go. also purchased refill blades</li>
            <li> If you (like myself) initially came to Amazon first in starting your entry into DE safety razor shaving, STOP right now. Using the search engine of your choice, seek out the several popular shaving blogs and online vendors. Do your homework before you reach for that credit card and read, read, read before making your choices. Merkur makes excellent DE razors that are well liked by novices and experts alike but their blades are only middle of the road in their performance but are priced above their value point. There are multiple choices for razor blades from all over the world (England/Russia/India/Pakistan/Turkey/Japan) and multiple vendors selling sample packs to help you in your search, prices range from $0.10 to $0.50 per blade with shipping, so choose wisely young shaving Jedi.</li>
            <li> hard to find double edge razor blades in local stores.amazon delivered them in 2 days</li>
            <li> The good news and bad news for these blades is the same- less sharp than Feather blades. Good because they don&#x27;t slice up my face quite as much, bad because they need changing slightly more often. However the cost saving versus Gillette products is considerable, so even if it only lasts 5 shaves instead of 7 it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is my second order for my safety razor.  These last me six months on average but I have learned you can get more life out of them by taking apart your razor and drying the parts off.  What dulls your blade the quickest is rust on the edge, hence drying it off between uses.  I have learned a lot being a noob to safety razors, like having your facial hair hot and wet before shaving.  It makes it so easy and much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> These were perfect for getting started with. They are not as sharp as other blades I have tried since getting these but good to prevent cutting</li>
            <li> Really good blades ,a must have !!!</li>
            <li> Blades are very thin and very sharp.</li>
            <li> I find these blades to be of medium sharpness, but very rough, producing multiple nicks per shave.  You can find far sharper and smoother blades than these at a much better price (Personna Blue, Astra Superior Platinum, Feather Hi Stainless) here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These blades are good so far as I have gotten a very close shave. I&#x27;m new to using a safety razor and am happy so far.</li>
            <li> Great blades to go with their shaver. Smooth cut and best of all no nicks or cuts . And stay sharp for a long time. Package the blades and shaver and you&#x27;re all set. And then throw out those useless mach1 and other useless 3 blade razors.</li>
            <li> Dull, would not cut even a one one days growth of my beard constantly pulled and scraped, switch to a better blade</li>
            <li> Cheaper blades out there</li>
            <li> Closer shave than disposables</li>
            <li> 10 blades for under $6.00.  These provide a wonderful smooth close shave.  You get 10 for the price of one.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use anything but a standard safety razor.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving try a variety of blades.  These are alright for a beginner who is afraid of slicing their face up but after the first few shaves you can tell the are middle of the road blades and the amazon price is a bit steep compared to what you can find on shaving supply websites.  Each face and safety razor will have it&#x27;s own blade.  2 star rating more because of the price (especially if you include shipping!).</li>
            <li> Excellent blades to go with an excellent razor. These are as good or possibly better than your drug store blades, although a little pricey.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and it takes a little getting used to using them at first. I bought the razor for my hubby and he loves it. Best investment I made!</li>
            <li> good razors.  nice and cheap.  i have light facial hair.  shaving once a week.  these guys are all i need.</li>
            <li> I love these platinum coated stainless steel blades and I suggest you replace the blades after a couple of uses. This is just a trial size, I currently invest in the combo pack.</li>
            <li> These are good blades, but not my top choice. I have found that I prefer Feather blades due to their sharpness. These Merkur blades are better than others, but I would say fairly average for my beard.</li>
            <li> Work great and perfect with the Merkur Model 180 Razor. Try it out you wont be disappointed works better than fusion or Shick</li>
            <li> I originally began with these blades because I also purchased a Merkur brand razor. At first I was scared by the amount of choice I had in blades so I stuck with the brand I knew to begin my transition into shaving from a single to double blade razor. The Merkur blade would get the job done, but the shave was not super close, and it would occasionally pull my hair. Overall it was not the most comfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this pack I have moved onto trying these [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI Feather New Hi-Stainless]] and [[ASIN:B0006M56BK Wilkinson Sword Double Edge]]. I haven&#x27;t picked which one I am going to order a in a 100 pack yet, but I recommend checking out these for sampling other blades. Both cut much smoother and closer.</li>
            <li> There are much better blades out there. Everyone&#x27;s face is different but I don&#x27;t really like them.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, think I am going to go with Feathers or Gillette Silver Blue in the long run.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my 5 yr. old granddaughter.  She has had so much fun with it both indoors and out.  They live in CA so it&#x27;s perfect as an outside to she can spend lots of time on.</li>
            <li> extremely sharp - razor just glides - never had a better shave</li>
            <li> I like these blades when they work, the problem is quality control with at least one or two blades per pack not having or holding a good edge. Otherwise I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li> I placed a simple order for 1 box (10) Merkur replacement blades on December 4, 2010.  It is now December 26, 2010 and I still have not received my order....ridiculous.  I should have just order it from The Art of Shaving or some other respected seller and been done with it.  I would not recommend ordering anything from CashCo1000 unless you are willing to wait the better part of a month to receive it.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy these blades until the day I die, or they stop making them. They are cheap, and sharp. They seem to last me anywhere from 3-6 weeks depending on how often I shave. I might have to buy a new pack of blades about once a year. At the price that they are, I could probably afford to replace them much more often, but I don&#x27;t really see the need because they seem to be working fine. The quality of these blades is a lot better than the name brand 2-5 blade ones being marketed at a much higher cost.</li>
            <li> I really like my Merkur razors and am really enjoying \\&quot;shaving with a brush\\&quot; again. However, I am less than impressed with the Merkur blades. They pull and drag something fierce - I&#x27;m guessing they are just not very sharp. Maybe I just got a bad batch?[[ASIN:B000NCMMBA Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor Blades- 3 Pack of 10 Blades]]    I get much better results with the no-name blades that CVS sells and Wilkinson Sword sold by Wal-Mart. Either of these feel like there&#x27;s no blade in the razor compared to the Merkurs and are much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Very gentle blades on your face; they allow for multiple passes.  Remember to re-lather in between passes...</li>
            <li> Great blades;sharp, last a long time!</li>
            <li> Sharp as heck. Both edges. It seems like one edge sticks out a bit farther than the other. I call that one the &amp;#34;murder&amp;#34; side.</li>
            <li> I recently took the plunge as many would say into DE razors and figured to try these blades first. The first shave was amazingly smooth along with several nicks here and there due to the fact that I just started. The second shave still smooth but nothing like the first. The third shave, now this one was rough just as I found my groove and how to hold the razor and the direction I&#x27;m supposed to shave. Unfortunately the shave got progressively worse as I continued to go through them. Any advice?</li>
            <li> Having returned to a double edge razor after years and years of using the multi-blade types I am extremely happy with these blades.  They give me a close, comfortable shave and I have only nicked myself once or twice with them; actually less often than with the multi blade types.  I&#x27;ve tried Feather, Derby and Gillette blades, but for me these are the best.  I will say that since everyone&#x27;s face/beard is different you may have better results with another brand, so try several different types to see what suits you best. For me, these are tops and much less expensive to boot.</li>
            <li> Shaving using a single blade may seems really old school and requires good shaving skills, but it does give a good clean shave, and for the price paid, nothing else come close. The blades remain sharp with simple cleaning and proper storage. It&#x27;s also platinum coated like Gilette, can&#x27;t ask for more. lol. And had noticed the difference in the shaving results. hair stubble that grown from single blade such as this produced a much sharper end. Kind of remind one how clean cut this kind of blade does for facial hair!</li>
            <li> I am still undecided on the Merkur Double Edge Blades.  I know I put a 3 star rating but I am leaning towards 4 stars.  The Merkur Double Edge Blades are very durable and sharp.  I just wish they were a little sharper.  The blade is very good to my skin and it is very forgiving if you get sloppy/careless in your technique in shaving.  I am new to the double edge blade and wet shaving and I enjoy it immensely.</li>
            <li> More than I expected, great value and will be a repeat buyer. Packaged well and easy to use...not just layer in a box.</li>
            <li> I love these blades! They are excellent! They last twice as long as other similar products. They&#x27;re easy to clean, don&#x27;t rust and are very economical compared to Gillette Blades and they shave better without irritating or cutting my skin.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased the Merkur Razor and these blades were just what I needed. They come individually wrapped and easy to snap on my razor.  I try and replace my blade about every two weeks and it is very affordable to do so.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> With disposable razors, after shaving the first leg, the razor is never as sharp for the second leg. I have to go over spots again and again. With my Merkur-Razor, I didn&#x27;t have to do that, It got all the hair on both legs the first time. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have already saved every penny i spent on 2 boxes of these blades over the 4-5 blade disposable aluminum foil brands, and i have used only half a box. each blade lasts a month of daily shaving, but i care for the blades. after use i take them out of the razor, wash in warm water, dry and put back in the handy &amp;#34;drawer&amp;#34; each box has, remember-water-sweat (salt) and oxygen cause corrosion, so i remove 2. i&#x27;m sure you could get them to last longer stored in a nitrogen chamber, but that is just silly</li>
            <li> Gets the job done but is a little ruff on my face. Maybe I expected too much but I will keep using them for a while to see if my face gets use to them and the save improves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the razor or the blades</li>
            <li> Very good blades.  Great shave @ a great price.</li>
            <li> Razors good for a week usage (6X); I have a heavy beard.  Average sharpness.  Maybe not the best choice for a beginner, as there are others blades that are less sharp and more forgiving.  Try a few brands to determine what suits your technique, products and beard.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the best out there.  Watch out those first few shaves!</li>
            <li> Good price,work great...what else can I say....Good deal!!!!</li>
            <li> My go to blade for a close shave!</li>
            <li> These are the first razors I&#x27;ve purchased for my Merkur safety razor. They are decent for learning but I can&#x27;t get more than two days of shaving out of them before they start tearing up my face something fierce.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all personal, but for me there are better blades. I&#x27;ve found other blades to be less irritating, even when sharper or not as sharp.</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had in years!!  I will never go back to disposable ones! !  Good quality and reasonably price!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and simple design. Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product.  I didn&#x27;t buy the feather blades that everyone raves about, but I will.</li>
            <li> I bought this 10-pack with my Merkur 34C DE Safety Razor. The sales associate at my local mall touted these as &#x27;the best double edge razors on the market&#x27;. The associate also emphasized the fact that they&#x27;re made in Germany, so \\&quot;clearly they are of high quality.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe the hype. While the Merkur blades are really good, they certainly aren&#x27;t the best. There is great variation in DE razor blades and really, it will come down to your personal preference. These blades give me a good shave, but it tugs a lot on my hair, causing a substantial amount of irritation. I change my blades every week, shaving every other day, and even brand new, these blades cause irritation on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just me though. Many reviewers have given these blades high review. Personally, I use Astra blades as they cause no irritation whatsoever and work well with my skin. Some have said that the Astras are no good when you have a longer beard, but because I shave every other day this isn&#x27;t an issue for me. Buy a sampler pack and figure out what razor blade works best for you and don&#x27;t buy into anyone selling you one type of brand. It will come with trial and error to figure out what blade gives you the best shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, these are still a good blade, but not nearly the best that I&#x27;ve experienced.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and close shaving when used with Merkur razor. I will use only Merkur-Razor double edge razor blades with my Merkur Long Handled Safety Razor.</li>
            <li> Quality blades; I use them with my Merkur 178. The blades are sharp but don&#x27;t cause any irritation. They don&#x27;t cut and pull hair either -- a huge problem I&#x27;ve had with the hair on my chin. I use them both with and against the grain for a closer shave and I haven&#x27;t had any cuts. These razors have no cons. When handling them, I don&#x27;t need to take extra care to avoid cutting my fingers. Despite their sharpness, the only cutting they do is on hair.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and use these to shave my legs and underarms. They are very good blades. Gives me a nice close shave. I replace mine every 19-30 days.</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent quality. Better than any other blade I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a safety razor for about three years now. Finding a beautiful vintage razor in a yard sale prompted me to buy blades and give the razor a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first blades came from the drug store and were dreadful. While looking on Amazon I found an assorted pack of blades; several different manufacturers in one package. I thought all of the blades made in Asia were unusable, quite rough. Wilkinson blades were also included, they are also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Wilkinson blades my face never felt abraded after shaving. All of the other blades made my face feel like it was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rate the Merkur blades a cut above the Wilkinson blades. If you use a safety razor, I&#x27;d urge you to try these blades.</li>
            <li> These are totally unremarkable blades. I was much happier with the Astra blades, although I used these as my double edge razor starter set. Six issues was the most I would get out of a blade before it started hacking my face and I found the shaving experience less than amazing. I do love my Merkur razor though :D</li>
            <li> Not a good shave for me. I am now a Feather only guy as I need a razor that is super sharp and will not drag.</li>
            <li> Razors seem to work pretty well.  My understanding was that they would be good for 3-5 shaves but I haven&#x27;t found it to be the case.  But certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Had some initial difficulty getting blades out of container.  What type of blades can I get at a local drug store to use as replacement</li>
            <li> This product is a good quality and value, but I have found that Astra has better performance for the same price.  I understand that blade performance is heavily dependent on the individual&#x27;s skin and shaving practice so take this with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> These Merkur DE blades seem to be okay. I am new to wet shaving, so I have nothing to compare them to as of yet. Maybe they will be my go to blade or maybe they won&#x27;t. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> These razors work well, but there are better and cheaper options out there for the price.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of these blades when I bought my Merkur Razor Handle. I had already read about other razor blades and ordered a set of Derby blades with my order. Thank goodness for that because when I used the Merkur blade for my first shave just to give it a try, it did not reduce my beard at all. It only felt like I was passing a thin edge over my face. I immediately switched over to the Derby and had a wonderful experience. Merkur blades definately did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Everything was great but the raser.</li>
            <li> I tried some different blades (Feather &amp; Personna) to go in my Merkur DE safety razor, and these Merkur blades give me the best shave with the least irritation. My neck is easily irritated, so this is a winner for me.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about the razor blades.  They do the job, but need to replace the blade after two shaves.</li>
            <li> Double Edged for her pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not as well known as feather, 7&#x27;oclock, astra, etc... but I really like this blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with the Merkur blades since the first one installed with the razor.</li>
            <li> Great blades. I perfer these blades and the feather blades when shaving.</li>
            <li> Excellent blades for a clean and close shave!!</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of trimming up long stubble before shaving and with this type of safety-razor blade you can eliminate that step. Sharp enough to last for multiple shaves through thick beard, these will save money in the long run. Cuts smooth and even.</li>
            <li> Sweet safety razor blades, i&#x27;ll use one a week shaving daily. I like that there&#x27;s a place on the underside of the container for used blades- so that they&#x27;re not tossed directly into the trash (to avoid split bags and any harm to trash handlers/scavengers down the road). These are my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shaving blade of choice.</li>
            <li> prefect, just what i needed.great shipping, product was as described.</li>
            <li> Great blades.  I&#x27;ve tried several brands of razor blades, and these are among my favorites.  I use this with my merkur long handled safety razor and I find it to be a perfect match.  These razor blades last about 7-8 shaves with 2 passes each.  I can&#x27;t probably squeze out a few more shaves but they don&#x27;t seem as smooth.  These are also at a great price.</li>
            <li> Definitely One of the best blades that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Best there is! Neat, clean cut on this course curly beard and sensitive skin. WOOHOO!</li>
            <li> Bought a sampler pack from west coast shaving a few years back. Tried a lot of razors, these hold their edge, reasonably priced, and are consistently good shaves.</li>
            <li> I love the Merkur-Razor Blades! They work well with my Merkur or my Parker double edge safety razors!</li>
            <li> These razor blades are way overpriced. I have gotten a much better shave from blades that are much cheaper. The Astra or Derby Blades in particular give a better smoother shave and are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have only used this razor blade once so far, but it cut my whiskers cleanly with no razor burn on the skin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razorblades and they&#x27;re sharp - which is apparently all my husband needs in a set of razors for his razor blade.</li>
            <li> Great Razors for sensitive skin. Love them</li>
            <li> I now remember the cuts before Mach 3 blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still testing different blades and haven&#x27;t settled on which one is going to work best for me.  This Merkur gets the job done, but of the limited number of blades I&#x27;ve tried at this point I would not characterize this as one of my favorites.  For me these blades had a bit of an uncomfortable \\&quot;pull\\&quot; to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this stage in my tests of blades I believe my favorite is another German-made blade, the Wilkinson Sword.  [[ASIN:B0006M56BK Wilkinson Sword Double Edge single Razor Cartridge, 5 blades]].  In my experience the blade on the Wilkinson Sword seems to cut smoother, with less irritation and provides me with a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure my blade preferences will change as I try different brands of blades and become more-experienced using my safety razor.  Merkur blades obviously have a big following and I don&#x27;t regret having given them a try.</li>
            <li> They did not work well with my beard.  It left my face with multiple nicks and cuts.  They ended up in the trashcan.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades I&#x27;ve used.  They last for about a month each before I have to switch them out.</li>
            <li> These blades are okay but harsh.  I got way more nics with these than any other blade I&#x27;ve used and my face would be very tender after a shave.  I have thick coarse facial hair.  I will not buy again but they might be great for someone else.</li>
            <li> For me most of the blades are similar...some are a little sharper than others but you learn how to use them quickly with no cuts or abrasions and just make sure you soften your skin with hot water and lather up ......The  main reason I switched to a butterfly razor system over a year ago was that the cost of shaving with a Trac 2 or these other fancy 5 blade systems was becoming outrageously expensive....So I thought back to what my dad used and when I looked on line they were there...No Regrets.....paid itself off in a year....</li>
            <li> Product as described, shipped fast, would do it again!</li>
            <li> I received a smooth effortless shave even after the fourth use.  The only negative comment is that the razor has to be disassemble to insert/remove the blade.</li>
            <li> I find that shaving with a single edge blade after years of using a multi - bladed razor is challenging to get the best out of the shaving experience with these single blades. Because of the expense of these specialized blades that can only now be purchased through places like Amazon.Com I have to take the blade out of the razor after each shave and dry all the moisture from the blade and then apply a thin coat of light oil such as baby oil or olive oil to the blade to prolong its use. If anyone  thinks that by using this type of shaving system is &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; expensive as the more conventional way, they will be highly disappointed. In hind sight if I had it to do again, I would not invest in this vintage way of shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to find this razor blades in my country, but it&#x27;s great to know that for a small price, I can get them now to use with my safety razor.</li>
            <li> cleanest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of these blades.</li>
            <li> I use these razor blades with the Dovo shavette (red blade holder) that I bought from FGP.  I get a great shave with them every time.  One half of the blade will last between 4 and 6 shaves before it starts tugging and I need to swap it out.</li>
            <li> Good blade for price and shipped quickly!  My husband said his Gillette seemed to shave a little closer but he is still happy.  Just changed the blade after 2 1/2 weeks and said it was still sharp but wanted to see if he could shave closer with a new blade. He has been shaving for over 35 years and said the 2nd blade was about the same.  Thanks Amazon for the great customer experience!</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Item as Described.</li>
            <li> Top rate razors. I feel like these are sharper out of the box and stay sharper than other double-edge razors. Merkur doesn&#x27;t do themselves favors by making such a long-lasting product, but they will always have my business.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and affordable.  The. End.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t bad, however I&#x27;ve found that they do get rusty quicker than some of the higher quality brands. If you don&#x27;t mind throwing your blade out every few shaves, these are fine for the money but if you shave frequently, you might want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> They work, but tend to drag across your face. I&#x27;ve switched to another brand.</li>
            <li> good quality  nice gift with a good razor</li>
            <li> I have went through multiple different brands and styles of razor blades all with nicks and burns as i have sensitive skin and this is the only blade that is flawless after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear by them...</li>
            <li> First set of blades after changing over from a multi blade cartrige and I am very impressed.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have tried these and the feather blades. For me the feather blades were actually too sharp and cut me up. These blades are perfect and work great!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This product is cheap, but it is not as sharp and smooth as my 5 blade shaver.</li>
            <li> Very sharp long lasting.</li>
            <li> These blades works very well paired with the Merkur Classic, I have no complaints. They last nearly a week of perfect shaves before dulling for me, so they are definitely easy on the budget!</li>
            <li> Great product. easy to use. shipped quick and arrived in excellent shape.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not that good. Feather blades seem to be less irritating for me. Good price but thats about it.</li>
            <li> Great shaving blades !</li>
            <li> An overall okay shave. I have been shaving for a couple of years and shave after a shower with my boar-bristle brush and sensitive shaving cream and still got some razor burn.  This razor is definitely better than some on the market, but not the make or break or razors.</li>
            <li> First go at using a double-edged safety razor so I don&#x27;t know how they stack up against other DE brands, but I&#x27;m getting a much closer shave than I was with the Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li> I use a [[ASIN:B000JPKLUU Merkur Solingen Futur Adjustable Double Edge Safety Razor]], and have been using the Merkur Blades, and I was very pleased with the shave.  Then our Rite-Aid when out of business and was selling generic blades at clearance prices so I bought a bunch -- AND THEY WERE TERRIBLE.  Compared to the Merkur blades, they were rough and dull.  There was a huge difference.  These blades are so smooth, and so sharp -- as long as you are dropping [...] bucks on a razor, splurge and get the good blades.</li>
            <li> They are of average quality for my use. Looking for blades that are a bit sharper.</li>
            <li> These blades are great I get a great shave from merkur blades. I shave my face and my head and I get 7 shaves out of one blade.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Gillette were much better than these that I purchased.</li>
            <li> The fact that each of these razors can last months before replacement, and each of these go about 73c each (which is huge compared to $5 for cartridge razor heads). They also give the best shave I&#x27;ve had, and you can tell that there is great detail going into each razor. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Brings back the simpler, easier, cheaper shave of yesterday... works great with my Merkur razor. Love the shave!</li>
            <li> Good blade but wished they lasted more than 2 to 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> I am getting a close shave for at least as long as the best selling four blade cartridges, and for a lot less money</li>
            <li> I never know what kind of blades to buy. Platinum, stainless steel? Just buy from a known company.  Merkur is one of the most reliable for actual razor. Blades made in Solingen Germany. From reading, this is where merkur comes from, and the city is known for making the best straight edge razors.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the Feathers for about 3 weeks now and although they&#x27;re good, I think Merkur blades are sharper (call me crazy I know). This morning I switched back to Merkur and noticed an obvious closer shave that came with a few knicks! Both are great blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its difficult for me to measure how much I like these blades,...don&#x27;t get me wrong they&#x27;re great. They&#x27;re also my first set of DE razors used as I&#x27;m new to the Safe-T razor game. I have an order of Feather blades on deck next, so time will definitely tell. I will say this about Merkur, it gives a close shave and I need to use a pre-shave oil to prevent razor burn, so they are sharp! If the Feathers turn out to be too sharp, I will most likely stick with Merkur.</li>
            <li> Razor blades have become an obsession of mine since getting a safety razor. For fun, I conducted my own consumer test on a variety of blades to see which provided (A) the best shave and (B) lasted the longest. I bought 5-packs of Personna Reds, Blues, Derby, Gilette, Merkur, and Dorko and compared them against each other over months. Personna Reds and Blues were worst for me -- short lived and too edgy for my face -- more likely to cut than any other brand I tried. Dorko and Gilette were decent - lasted about a week each and rarely cut up the face; shave was decently close. Derby&#x27;s were recently my favorite (till trying Merkur) -- close shave, lasted about a week and a half, and almost never nicked the skin. Merkur, without a shadow of a doubt is far superior to all the competitors (at least those in my experiement). The razors last more than 2 weeks each, and give a smooth and close shave. I&#x27;m open to trying others (please comment on this review if you have suggestions), but for the time being, Merkurs will be my only blade from now on.</li>
            <li> I used all 10 of these and played around with my technique.  With some work I can get a good shave with them, but after only 3 shaves they were significantly duller than other cheaper blades such as the LORD Platinum.  And if you can get 5 or more shaves from a FEATHER then that too is a better deal than these blades.  They are worth experimenting with, but not the best blade out there.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend usually uses the Gillette brand double edge razors, but after I ordered these online he said that they seemed like they gave a closer shave. He really liked them, and I will be ordering these in the future!</li>
            <li> Very nice cut with these razor blades.  I&#x27;m a first time user and did not have difficulty using them.</li>
            <li> OK AS FAR AS BLADES GO</li>
            <li> They are very thin and sharp, they seem durable and they lock in well but they seem to be a bit too short for a close shave.</li>
            <li> The Merkur blades are excellent. Forget the Gillettes, I did and I could not be happier. They last long and they work well.</li>
            <li> The blades are a little more pricy than other blades however, in comparison to the latest 5 blade razor they are still a great deal. Don&#x27;t be lured into buying blades that are $15.00 for a 100. Cheaper blades will rip your face off. These blade are great if you break out easy or get razor bumps.</li>
            <li> These blades get the job done but are not particularly noteworthy in any one area. You must also spend more time prepping your beard with hotter water if you decide to use the Merkur blades.  If you want the sharpest blades, check out Feathers from Japan.  If you want blades that provide the most shaves per blade, try Astra or Personna Med Prep.  These Merkur blades will certainly make do in a pinch, but if you want a good nexus of sharpness, durability and low cost, try the Astra Superior Platinum.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves these.  Just need to get used to the double edge razor again.  A much nicer shave, he says.</li>
            <li> By far the cheapest and best shave I have had. I will not go back to modern blades! Thanks a bunch!</li>
            <li> Very thin, flexible, and exceptionally sharp.  These were included with a razor I purchased, but I&#x27;ll most likely buy them again.  They have lasted through 10 shaves with no noticeable degradation of sharpness.  I keep the razor in a cup of mineral oil which keeps them lubed and prevents any deposits from hard water.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with these razors.</li>
            <li> These razors work great for me.  They hold up for quite a few shaves before I have to replace the blades.  They are also durable enough to handle my thick beard.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and always go back to these.</li>
            <li> The great accessory for the Merkur razor that I purchased for my husband for Christimas.  He loves it &amp; will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I would recommend them. The shave is nice and close and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Better than the shavers I was using previously from Gillette.</li>
            <li> Great razors at an affordable price</li>
            <li> The clear best double edge blade on the market. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they do not cut as well or last as long.</li>
            <li> When it comes to RAZORS,  MERKUR IS KING - ( in my opinion, ) ...  but what do I know, ... i&#x27;m just one ridiculously handsome man ... ...  with one ridiculously great shave ...  YES INDEED  !!!</li>
            <li> I got these blades for my Merkur razor. They were my initial blades, and I thought it a plus that I was getting razors made by the same brand as the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, so far they are just OK. They don&#x27;t slice you up, so I think there&#x27;s no concern you need have there; in fact, the issue is whether they cut *enough*. I feel as though I&#x27;ve experienced a dullness from newly installed razors. If I have any kind of stubble, they don&#x27;t do a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accept that I may be &amp;#34;doing it wrong&amp;#34; — and with one-day&#x27;s gristle these blades work fine — but that is my experience so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these, but I may try another brand as an informal comparison test when I&#x27;ve used up the 10 in this pack.</li>
            <li> Good blades for the price, I&#x27;m sure there may be better out there. These quality bades do just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Rambo</li>
            <li> The guy at The Art of Shaving recommended these blades and they are alright. I fell like they get dull pretty quickly so i change after 4 shaves</li>
            <li> Works with my merkur razor well and exactly as expected. Sharp and long lasting. The dispenser box makes it easy to use</li>
            <li> as reported by my son, who is using it with the Merkur razor. He gets plenty of shaves and ha d a relatively tough beard.</li>
            <li> These blades are not as sharp as they should be. Wilkinson Sword works much better for me and my razor.</li>
            <li> Good quality but handle was a little short and would prefer a better method of changing out blades. Does deliver a close shave so that part is good</li>
            <li> I love shaving with a single blade razor because they are so much cheaper and do the same as those 10x blade razors. Stick with these and you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> 1st time I have used thses razors. They are of course sharp and the also seem to hold their edge really well.</li>
            <li> These razors have been doing the job for a couple months now, and I am happily surprised. Never would I have thought that a single blade would be able to do the same job as the multi-blade razors that I am used to. Not only is it as good, but it is in some instances better since I am able to purchase more razors for far less cost, the razor makes for a closer and more confidant shave, and the product exudes far more confidence.</li>
            <li> (See the &amp;#34;razor review&#x27; from my husband....he was in the razor/surgical instrument business and worked closely with German manufacturers....very fussy....FIVE STARS!!</li>
            <li> Great blades. Men around the world need to learn to shave with a safety razor again. And when they do, Merkur is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used one of these since Grandpa taught me to shave! The main reason I switched from disposable cartridges to this was the cost. I like the memories the new safety razor brings back, and I get as close a shave with one blade as I did 4! Love the weight of the razoras well. Great product!</li>
            <li> Seem to be sharp enough and I got several shaves out of them before having to get a new one. I was only shaving my face though and did not experiment on any other more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Decided to go back to the way my dad and granddad use to do it. I fell for the &amp;#34;you need multiple blades in order to get a real close shave&amp;#34; hook that the mega-manufacturers put in the adds. Truth from my experience, single-blade safety razors shave just as close if not closer than the 3-4-5 blade gimicks that are on the market now. And outside the initial cost of the safety razor itself, it&#x27;s a ton cheaper (you can find these blades some places for 50 cents each opposed to $12-$18 for 4-8 cartridge heads. I&#x27;ve been extremely pleased with my decision and purchase.</li>
            <li> When I ordered the Merkur Heavy Classic razor, I ordered the Merkur blades to go with it.  Made sense.  And NOT expensive.  I&#x27;m on the first blade and it works great.  No more spending big bucks for replacement blades.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into safety razor shaving, this is the blade for you. Consistent quality throughout the package. Consistently close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been DE shaving for a couple of years now and these are my razor of choice.  They last the longest and I rarely nick myself, compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Good blades, nice and sharp.  Able to tackle heavy beards</li>
            <li> Not bad, sharp out of the package. Dont seem to last more then 2 shaves, though my beard is pretty corse so not totaly unexpected.</li>
            <li> This is apparently the standard baseline that all razor blades are compared to, I&#x27;m assuming because most people get a Merkur HD to start and this usually comes bundled with all Merker safety razors. It&#x27;s not bad, but not my cup of tea. After only a few shaves it tugs, pulls and feels a bit dull. So there blades are a bit more on the harsh-size (for me at least). I say try any Gillette blades, particularly the Silver Blue or the 7 o clock. Also the generic drug store brand works well, which you can find at CVS/Wallgreen&#x27;s/Walmart. I think those are Personna Reds just with a different logo and packaging. Those work VERY well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as with anything related to shaving, your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful with these blades since the slightest pressure will to lead to small cuts.  Work well.</li>
            <li> Did not fit the razor</li>
            <li> Can save money by going back to razor and blades. These are the BEST!</li>
            <li> The blades were a suggestion to purchase along with the razor on Amozon, and I like it because it is a product of Germany</li>
            <li> Definitely would not purchase these blades again.  Does not perform any better than any average Gillette blade,</li>
            <li> Great blades, great price. Beats the other guys multi-blade approach, hands down!</li>
            <li> Just do it. These things are great. Husband loves them and I bought another pack and am considering getting myself a safety razor and shaving my legs with it. Will definitely save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Got these with my new Merkur 180 long handle razor.  An exceptionally smooth shave once I got into the rhythm of shaving with a safety razor again. Hold the blade lightly against the skin. Lather up with a quality shave cream (I use Dreadnought) and enjoy.</li>
            <li> My original review is below, and as someone who reads and appreciates feedback, I needed to send in an updated review.  I&#x27;ve totally changed my opinion of these blades, and think they are GREAT!  I think the first blade I used must have been a bad one because since trying another blade, these have been my \\&quot;go to.\\&quot;  These are sharp and I get a super close shave with these, but not too close.  (Feathers are too close for me).  These deserved another try in my shave routine and have now become part of the regular rotation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shave with this razor, and it felt very harsh.  I have sensitive skin and this left me feeling raw.  I always give a blade multiple shaves to see if it gets better, but usually know on the first pass if I like it or not.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of razors and I think there are better values out there for the price.  The blade is very sharp (IMO not as sharp as a feather, which is not my go to), but left my skin irritated.  I haven&#x27;t cut myself in a while, but had a couple of nicks with this blade.  Not a very forgiving blade.  I use a Gillette 1962 Slim adjustable.  First shave was on a #4 setting and will try to dial it back and see if it gets better.  Every DE shaver has an opinion on what works well for them.  IMO it wasn&#x27;t an aggressive shave, but was a harsh blade on my skin. Just two passes today, WTG and XTG...2 hours later and still feeling a burn.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand because I bought the merker razor and it came with one sample, no nicks or cuts or anything to complain about. Awesome value!</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razor shaving and purchased these blades with a new Merkur 33C style razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must first note that these blades did not come in the blister pack that is shown. They came in just the plastic box with no shrink wrap or anything. All of the blades were wrapped in their parrafin wrappers, but I was not too impressed to get a loose pack of blades with no outer covering. Makes me wonder where exactly they came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used one of these blades for a week. No complaints about the performance. Nothing special, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Very good razor blades and are among the best!</li>
            <li> These blades are just okay - especially after you have tried the Feather blades. These are just not as sharp. Now I will say this - they are more forgiving than the Feather but I find that I run through these more since they don&#x27;t start as sharp. I won&#x27;t use these again since I found the Feather blades. Not because they are bad - I just want a really sharp blade. I have to do 3-4 passes with these and I don&#x27;t get what I do with 2-3 passes with the Feather.</li>
            <li> Not quite as smooth as the \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; brand blades but they still perform very well when I use them in my Shaving Factory Heavy Metal Straight Razor.  Even the highest quality blade can easily be rendered useless in a poorly designed razor so finding one that has the perfect blade exposure can be difficult but the Shaving Factory Heavy Metal Straight Razor meets all my expectations and is the perfect companion for these fine blades.</li>
            <li> nice blades, really cuts smooth, and close.  price is reasonable when comparing merkur blades to lessor quality blades.  thank you.</li>
            <li> Switched to a double-edge safety razor for the first time at age 56. These blades help make shaving a very enjoyable experience for me. One blade will last me for about ten shaves.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave. Excellent!!</li>
            <li> Good blades. A bit on the pricey side though.</li>
            <li> sharper than any other blade I have ever tried.  love it.</li>
            <li> Great product and service from Amazon!!!!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all with this product.  But, in fairness, it may be because of the razor it is being used in.  The razor I also reviewed.  Honestly, I found I still get a closer shave with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> Not as good as feather but a close second.</li>
            <li> I use these razors daily for shaving.  They are good quality and do a great job of giving me a clean cut shave.  I have very thick hair and these razors do a good job and keeping my 5&#x27;oclock shadow from coming back 2 hours after I&#x27;ve shaved.  Great price and shipped very quickly.  Would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Works great, price is right, fast shipping.  My only minor complaint is just that one can easily cut oneself on the edge of the blade when removing it from the package.</li>
            <li> Once again,these German made, like most things German, are flawless. Giving a closes smooth shave always.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these blades</li>
            <li> I started, as many do, with a cartridge razor.  As a teen and early twenty-something, I had pretty bad acne and I finally figured out that the razor was to blame.  I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore and so I decided to look backwards for answers.  I found a Henckel straight razor.  It was great, but it takes a long time to shave with.  I recommend it more than anything else, because nothing gives you a shave quite like a straight razor.  For daily use however, a Merkur safety razor is the only way to go!  It has the delicacy and precision of a straight razor combined with the ease of a cartridge razor.  These blades, the Merkur platinum double edge razor blades, are the only acceptable choice!  There are cheaper razor blades and there are other methods of shaving, but I promise you, once you&#x27;ve used a Merkur safety-razor you won&#x27;t want to go back.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality steel, has lasted me several shaves on the first blade so far.  Will be buying again soon, thanks!</li>
            <li> The razor blades in this pack are very sharp, very resistant to tear and wear and very economic.  What else can you ask for?</li>
            <li> These work great.  I will never buy another disposable blade for the rest of my life.  I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> Super sharp, each blade lasts 5-6 days. I bought the King 47506 1000/6000 combination to sharpen my own blades, takes a lot of technique to get it down but it&#x27;s pretty sweet when you do.</li>
            <li> Now I only used it once and I&#x27;m sure it will be better. I had a few days on my beard, so it was heavy. I&#x27;m sure it will be better the next time.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have tried many others but I will soon and update. But these are great blades and stay sharp for a good amount of time ( I dont have a really thick beard)</li>
            <li> So far they are performing well.  Good product.  I have been using them for several weeks now and still getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> Prefer different  brand of blades. Different brand seems to last longer. If I had not experience with this type of blade I would not have known what to do with used blades.</li>
            <li> I get such a close smooth shave and I have very heavy course hair! After so many years of the marketing ploys of 2 blades then 3 now 5 blades for the closest shave. You realize that its all hype&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is outstanding! would recommend to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the replacement blades are so reasonable that the shipping costs make them higher than they should be.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Work well.  My Father in Law stole about 5000 razor blades so I&#x27;m set for life now though. But unless your Father in Law has an enormous stash then you&#x27;ll be happy with these.</li>
            <li> Got these when I entered the world of wet-shaving.  They seem ok so far.  Certainly hold up for at least a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades, and the cost is great. I was so tired of paying $20 for replacement blades on the new style razors. These last a long time and cost 1/2 of what I&#x27;d pay for the newer type of blades.</li>
            <li> Great shave.  Worried about going back to double edge razor.  No problem!  And a great shave.</li>
            <li> They work great. not all blades are the same so try others to see what is a good match. I like these razors</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re decent blades with not so great cutting power&lt;br /&gt;They pull &amp; tug the crap out of my facial hair. There are much better items on the market, and it&#x27;d be best to do some searching before settling on these.&lt;br /&gt;Their other tools are great though!!</li>
            <li> This was part of a gift for my brother. He has a light beard and raves about these blades. They last a couple of shaves.</li>
            <li> Given the high ratings for this razor, I opted to buy a pack.  Of note, I have fairly soft skin that is rather sensitive.  Admitting that, I found this blade to cause a significant amount of knicks and razor burn.  It was not as bad as the Feather Hi-Stainless Platinum razor blades, as those blades were so sharp I looked like a 13-year old attempting to shave for the first time.  Given my skin, my razor blade of choice is currently the Dorco Stainless Steel Razor Blades, which is $8 for a pack of 100 blades.  The Dorco blades tend to dull quickly, but if you have soft and sensitive skin, it&#x27;s probably a good compromise.</li>
            <li> Got my first safety razor and needed blades to go with it. Got the job done, and they last about 5-6 shaves. very happy, would buy again</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, and quit using those expensive multi bladed razors that don&#x27;t even give you a really close shave.  These give you a much closer shave, and just cut better; they&#x27;re so sharp I can dry shave my face (minus mustache area) without any discomfort (I still recommend using brushed-on shaving cream, however), and unlike the expensive multi-bladed razors you use for WAY to long because they&#x27;re such a rip-off, these are cheap as heck, so as soon as they lose any of their edge, you guiltlessly throw them away.  Because they shave better, and are cheaper, your skin will look better as you won&#x27;t be using an expensive razor 2 weeks longer than you should have, which will decrease irritation, ingrown hairs, and infections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and purchase a $25 badger hair brush, and the brush on european style shaving cream; the brush lasts a lifetime, and each of the $12 tubs of cream will last you, I kid you not, a YEAR or more.  You&#x27;ll save money, have better skin, smell nicer, and actually enjoy shaving, instead of looking at it as a chore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only word of caution- unlike American multi-bladed razors meant to be ripped across your face as fast as possible, these don&#x27;t have a safety wire wrapped around them, so take slower, more controlled strokes, and make sure to pull the razor exactly straight across your skin (if you pull a little diagonal, there&#x27;s a slightly greater risk of cutting yourself, but not much).  They don&#x27;t take any longer to shave with, as you never have to go over areas multiple times, but you will spend more time getting everything nice and clean on the first pass.  It&#x27;s actually a lot calmer and more soothing to shave this way, and possibly even a touch faster, and the result is superior.</li>
            <li> very sharp blades! I can really tell the difference between these blades and my old ones. I use an old gillette razor and they go will together.</li>
            <li> Definitely overpriced as far as blades go. I thought I was purchasing a hundred pack, but that&#x27;s my fault for incorrectly reading. NIce blades but not worth this steep price when Astras are 10 bucks for a pack of 100.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I thought Murker made good blades. I paid the higher price to get these but was disappointed. My old used Astras are better than these new blades. Drags ands and pulls. Astras didn&#x27;t drag or pull at all and are a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> they are blades they do blade things mine happen to sit in a drawer and occasionally gets called up to be used in a razor</li>
            <li> Gives the best shave possible at a way more affordable price than the  fancy razors you buy for $5-$10/each at the market or drug stores.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and does the job on making my face stubble free. Would highly recommend this blade to anyone that is looking for a close shave at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> Good price, very sharp, easy to clean. Slot in the back for used ones. Can&#x27;t be beat at about 50 cents per blade. Still using the first blade, supposedly should be able to get 6 shaves out of each, I&#x27;m at 4 and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Works great for the shaver</li>
            <li> After all the reviews I was excited for these to come in the mail. It was like Xmas morning when they arrived. I went straight in to shave and bam disappointment.  Maybe its just me but I get better shaves with the Dorco and dollar store blades. I tried and tried but it never got as close as the cheap ones. I wont buy again. Not worth the money. Anybody else have any suggestions if I am doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> Excellent blades but way too expensive for what you get. I went with Merkur blades to match the safety razor kit I got last summer. But when i started looking around for replacement blades I saw that for I can get other brands with 10x more blades for only a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Holds it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I had irdered a case of ten packages but that is OK with the price I got them for.</li>
            <li> Good product, Cheap price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s insane how much cheaper it is to use these blades compared to the multi-bladed razors. These work about as well. The case is nice because you can put your old blades in the bottom when you are done.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and they stay that way. I sometimes have to throw them out due to a small tinge of rust in the middle of the blade, but never near the cutting edge. Since they stay so sharp for so long, after a few weeks, I&#x27;d just rather use a fresh blade then worry about the light rust. I couldn&#x27;t imagine there is a better Double Edge razor on the market so I haven&#x27;t ever tried any others.</li>
            <li> When thinking about a razor I like mine sharp not to much rust. These were like brand new. Give them a try</li>
            <li> I bought several brands of blade to use with my Merkur DE razor.  So far I&#x27;ve only tested this set.  I&#x27;m new at this type of shaving but like it very much so far.  Using Single Edge razors is a bit tricky but fun once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Great razors,, im a true believer in german engineering and the quality of these bladed proves it!! Sharpest ones ive had,, and ive had them all,,, between the merkurs and the personna&#x27;s u cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> Paired this with the Merker Safety Razor as a gift and my husband loves it! Definitely something we will continue to purchase in the future!</li>
            <li> I decided to try razor blade shaving and give up the expensive replacement blades.  It may take you a little longer to get the job done but I like the results and the money I will be saving on those 4-5 blade throwaways.  I say give it a try you might like it,</li>
            <li> These are good for about two shaves and then they drag and nick me if I use them any more that that. Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Very happy to return to the double edge razor vice the multiple edge models currently on the market. Provides a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Truth be told I prefer the shave I get from the Gillette twin blade razor and that includes multi blade razors</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Very sharp bouble edge razor blades. Nice close shave. These razor blades work very well. I will always shave with these razor blades...</li>
            <li> These blades are incredibly sharp!  I have recently switched over to safety razor shaving as an attempt to get a smoother shave and not have to work a second job to afford replacement blades.  These blades fit perfectly on my Merkur 34C and last approximately one week for me, shaving 5 days a week.  The cost, when compared to buying refills for disposable blades is hands down, fantastic.  The shave from these razors is very smooth!</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased a Merkur Futur safety razor along with these blades and am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am learning how to use it.  Allot of my troubles has being scared of cutting my self.  Also I have found out shaving cream works best.  It is a process, but still excited about the advantages of saving money with it.</li>
            <li> The blades are probably good but they are too small for the razor. I wasn&#x27;t going to send anything back just throw it away but if you are sending me blades every month I can&#x27;t use them, please stop them. I will send you everything back and you will see what I am talking about. I don&#x27;t want anything exchanged. I took the bottom plate off the razor and tried it that way. I cut the s*** out of my face. I have had other people look at it and they said the same thing. I have bought a lot of things from amazon but this is a disgrace. I hope you will send me shipping instructions as I don&#x27;t want to deal with this. Somebody in amazon missed the boat with this</li>
            <li> Bought these along side the razor, love that replacing a blade is all that is required. No more expensive disposables.</li>
            <li> A great razor blade. Went back to wet shaving and found these blades to be perfect for an old fashioned shave with brush and lather.</li>
            <li> This product was absolutely amazing. The description posted was very accurate. The price for the quality was amazing. An added bonus, it was here before I expected! A very happy buying experience.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the merkur blades, very easy to shave with and so far I have used the same blade for a month, getting ready to order more.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend, who was, at first, a bit reluctant to try such precise, sharp blades along with his new Merur razor, was very pleasantly surprised!! He told me he never experienced such a safe, smooth, gliding precise shave!!  It was a pleasure to use these blades and is very happy with them!! I am sure he will use these blades from now on!</li>
            <li> As far as double edge razor blades go, I think these are pretty standard.  They are pretty sharp and last about 3 times for my husband, but he has a very coarse beard, I think they would last alot longer with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to DE shaving and these were the first blades I tried. Very reasonable blade, though kind of expensive given alternatives. I&#x27;ve had some of my smoothest shaves yet with these. No cuts or burn with these for me and I have somewhat sensitive skin. I rotate them currently, but not afraid to go back to them.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and I&#x27;m very happy. Very sharp and are lasting along time. I have a Merkur Razor and its perfect and very easy on my face. I will buy more...</li>
            <li> I find it hard to leave a review on any DE blade. But I will say that I had a pretty bad time shaving with blades, lots of irritation and tugging. Plenty of other similarly priced blades out there that are way more comfortable.</li>
            <li> These razors seemed to perform just as good as any others that I have tried.  They may be a step up from some of the Lords that I have had, but I think the [[ASIN:B001G5FOLI 10 Feather Razor Blades NEW Hi-stainless Double Edge]] that I had were still the best that I have used. Of course, as far as I know, it&#x27;s all personal preference.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the razor or the blades. I reviewed the razor previously. Ancient razor gets you a really bad shave.</li>
            <li> Mediocre and overpriced.  These are at best average blades or worse.  They are neither exceptionally sharp nor especially smooth.  If you care about sharpness above all else, get a Feather from Japan.  If you want something that&#x27;s a good combination of sharpness and smoothness that is cheap buy the Astras which rarely exceed $11 per hundred.  If you want the very best combination of smoothness and sharpness, I&#x27;d recommend the Gillette Silver Blues, Polsilver, Gillette Platinum or Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Black.  All of those cost at most $25 to $35 per hundred delivered to your door.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34; tag.  For safety razor blades, the best from Japan, Russia, and India are much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Feather, but decent.</li>
            <li> So far these are my preferred blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are some of the best out there. I bought these bad boys for my first double edged safety razor, and they worth the investment. Not only do they provide a close shave, but they also last for fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I bought these blades and razors and they get nowhere near as smooth as a modern razor. Terrible.</li>
            <li> I chose these because it&#x27;s the brand razor I use , so far so good . I change my blade once a week on Sunday and shave every day occasionally every other day .</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a sharper blade from Germany teamed with a razor from the same company. Not the closest of shaves. I&#x27;ll be trying others, like Wilkenson or Gillette, before I buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought these with the double edge razor, stand, brush and soap for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day. He loved it all.</li>
            <li> I paid around $8.00 for a bunch of blades. I received the $1.29 version. :( I am not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Every man&#x27;s beard reacts differently to different blades. New to DE wet shaving, I&#x27;ve only tried these and Feathers for my fairly tough beard. While the feathers work a bit better, I find the Merkurs work almost as well in my Merkur 34C HD.</li>
            <li> I understand if you would sell this product and not compare yourself to anyone else. But comparing yourself to Gillette and claiming that it can do a similar or better job is misleading. i tried both and there&#x27;s no way this razor can get close to Gillette, i gave myself 3 weeks to get used to it. i was bleeding like hell. the more you get used to it the faster you get but this does not change the fact that it is still a single blade that can not reach all areas (under the nose). I stopped using it after 3 weeks and reverted back to my Gillette where i could shave my beard in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had one experience using these razor blades, but they were very effective and it was easy to load them into the razor. I&#x27;ll definitely refill my razor with these.</li>
            <li> High quality that you expect from German products! Didn&#x27;t work well for me but my skin is sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v tried other blades but I&#x27;ll stick with thies</li>
            <li> Good quality. Timely shipping</li>
            <li> I got these razor blades because they were made in Germany and not china.  The blades are exceptionally high quality and I thoroughly enjoy shaving with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this blades for the last 6 months and no complaints so far, I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These razors are great , awesome quality and much cheaper than buying a modern razor. Such a good price for so many. I would recommend this product !</li>
            <li> nice and sharp!!! perfect fit in the red sleeve, unlike the full size dovo blades which don&#x27;t seem to fit well at all. great if your starting out straight razor shaving too!</li>
            <li> I have experimented with various blades since I returned to DE shaving. Derby, Shark, Astra, Feather... The Merkur is the best blade BAR NONE. It gives a close, comfortable shave and the blades stay sharp for several shaves.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and stay that way even after a few shaves!  On average I can shave 4-6 times before replacing blade as long as it&#x27;s cleaned and left to dry on stand.  Obviously if you&#x27;re cutting a much thicker growth you won&#x27;t get 4-6 shaves from a blade.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard. With disposables, I often have to make multiple passes, and cartridges lasts about a week a piece on average. This was my first time using merkur blades and I was disappointed. I don&#x27;t see how anyone could get nicks with these blades. I found them to be rather dull. Perhaps, Merkur does this on purpose to introduce newbies to the old fashioned safety razor without being too aggressive of a cut. I don&#x27;t know for sure, but I&#x27;ll be sticking to Feathers from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing different blades now after becoming accustomed to Feathers. I love the 2 pass BBS shave I get with feathers, the lack of dragging on my neck and lack of irritation. This isn&#x27;t a review about the great feathers, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Merkur blades are very mild. So you most likely won&#x27;t nick yourself badly with them unless you are totally new to DE shaving. The price point on here is pretty bad compared to other options though. I will say they are very smooth blades and don&#x27;t drag as much as the Astras or the Dorcos I&#x27;ve used. But they are causing little weepers and spots of irritation on my face and don&#x27;t give me the BBS shave I get with Feathers in two passes. The price point these are at is a very bad deal (I got Merkur blades to test for free). And there are better options out there if you are looking for a mild blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t horrible blades and I think they are better than Dorcos and even Astras, but just very mild and give an inconsistent spotty shave compared to Feathers on my face.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected each to last longer than 4 shaves. Seems as though after the third shave the edge just isnt adequate enough to provide the quality shave I received the first 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> These Merkur razors are the way to go for the safety shaver!  I have a tough beard and they are the best by far</li>
            <li> These blades shave very well, though part of their success is due to the razor in which it is used. They last about seven shaves, one a day, but I have a red beard, turned grey, which, from my understanding, is tough to shave, and hard to cut. I have used Schick trac 2 blades in the past, but this combination works so much better that it was worth the effort to learn to shave over. Very pleased, and I am not easy to please.  Ray</li>
            <li> perfect blade for a high end razor. Precisely made with easy application and ease of removing and replacing with new blade.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to re-use these blades over and over, I just like being able to know that the blades are not going to get dull after one shave</li>
            <li> Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades are the best. period. I can shave 3 or 4 times before changing. I get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> great starter blades but a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Thin, sharp and do the job with no effort</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re particularly good blades, but I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try others, since a scar from surgery on my throat makes double-edge shaving impractical.</li>
            <li> Bought these along with the Merkur long handled razor as the main components of my first kit. I have yet to use any other razors as I&#x27;ve yet to run out of these. Not a nick or cut yet and and overall pleased with the edge, cost and durability. I would definitely purchase these again, however I would try to find them a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> These blades are very high quality and seems to last longer than those made in America.  Maybe just my imagination.</li>
            <li> This razor was great until it became locked up and couldn&#x27;t turn the handle to open the top to replace the razor.  Had to use a pliers, but unfortunately the bit inside it broke.  Useless now.  Not sure why this occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, there is nothing else like a double edge razor.  Smoothest shave ever!  No toxic plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May try another Merkur as it&#x27;s really nice.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find the Gillette Platinum (blue box) blades any more, and these were a close favorite.&lt;br /&gt;So far they are working great.  I shave my face daily and use them to shave my head 2-3 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;They provide a very smooth shave and I get about 2 weeks out of them (10 face shaves, 3-4 head shaves)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue i had (user error) was not tightening the handle down enough and the blade was loose.  I thought it was a dull blade (snagging on my hair/skin) - but once i tightened it again, smooth shaving returned.</li>
            <li> Razors last for a good number of shaves. Just be careful not to carve up your face like a turkey.</li>
            <li> This blade used to be my hands- down favorite. I started using them about 4 years ago when I bought a Futur razor. Then, about a year and a half ago I bought several &amp;#34;grab bag&amp;#34; bunches of blades from Amazon. Blades from everywhere. It seemed like a fun idea at the time. Most of them were crap. I didn&#x27;t learn anything I didn&#x27;t already know. And then, my genetic background would not allow me to throw these bad blades away. Well, some were so bad I did. But a year and a half later I finally used them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a few months ago, in jubilation at having used up all the bad blades, I ordered 50 of my prized Merkur blades. The anticipation of my previous great shaves was immense. Then the blades arrived. The cardboard packaging was changed. This is, in my opinion, never a good sign for your favorite product. It was obvious from my very first shave that the blades had changed as well. You could feel the change from the very first shave. I tried them with my Tabac soap. I tried them with my Floris shave cream. The new Merkur blades were no better than an average blade from the grab bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started wondering if my memories of great shaves were created by the scores of really bad blades I had just been through. Or had my beard changed? Then, rooting around in my top drawer, I found an old half used pack of Merkurs from before the grab bag experiment. Here it was - a true test. A known blade from before. What happened? Great shave. 6 of them off one blade to be exact. So I went back to the new blades. Mediocre shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, it isn&#x27;t just me. There are a lot of low ratings in recent months. Sometime in the past two years, Merkur made a decision to seriously downgrade their production quality. And whoever it was at Merkur who made this production decision has disappointed an entire customer base. My second favorites were Feather, from Japan, and until something else really great comes along I guess it will be Feather for me. But I willno longer pay top dollar for Merkurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone want to buy 4 packs of 2nd rate blades?</li>
            <li> I can buy Wilkinson Blades 10 for a dollar at Walmart, and they suck.  These last 3 times longer and my &amp;#34;throw aways&amp;#34; shave better than a new cut rate blade.</li>
            <li> Super sharp Blades that work perfect!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i need. Work very well, give a nice smooth shave</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality blade and does a good job. It just isn&#x27;t the right blade for my skin type. I get a bit too much irritation from this brand and other German-made blades.</li>
            <li> I bought a razor .... and it came with some razor blades well i waste them all then i was looking for buying some blades and i found this ones.... Let me warn you they are PERFECT really SHARP i belive they are like this because they are made  in Germany......  They are perfect  WOuld really recomend them...</li>
            <li> There are sharper ones - Gilette, Astra...</li>
            <li> I have been using these for the past few years. I enjoy the shave they give.  They provide just the right balance for my needs, not to aggressive.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend, they are his absolute favorite blades for shaving his face. The price is great, shipping was fast, and they arrived in appropriate packaging. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Love these blades with my new Merkur razor. My legs need to be shaved several times a week. Delivery promptly.&lt;br /&gt;Great price. thank you</li>
            <li> love this great quality</li>
            <li> I tried these blades in my Merkur 43C and really love them.  I got a close baby smooth shave without any cuts.</li>
            <li> Excellent (very sharp) razor blades.</li>
            <li> I get 4 shaves from each side of these blades.</li>
            <li> These work as expected.  Packaged nicely.  Work as you&#x27;d expect, will re-order.</li>
            <li> saved a lot of money by using these to shave.</li>
            <li> Pulled on my facial hair.  Did not appreciate.  I bought 150 feather blades.....WAY SHARP.</li>
            <li> Be careful, these blades are sharp, as they should be. Been a long time since using blades like this. The people making blades now, all are changed, and it got to where you had to do a research even to buy razor blades at Wally World.</li>
            <li> Classic product. High quality and great value. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as Feather, but I think I get a better shave from these.</li>
            <li> Nice blades, provide a nice shave too.</li>
            <li> For the price, there are better blades. They are sharp enough with the right prep (some people claim that they drag a bit), but I&#x27;m pretty confident that they are a fraction of an millimeter longer than some other blades, and this tends to lead to a bit more razor burn. However, they do offer a close shave. I feel that there are much better options for the price; Persona (imported and domestic varieties), Derby, Feather, etc. I can use all of these interchangeably. Pretty much everything gives me a better shave, but everyone&#x27;s face is different.</li>
            <li> These are my go to razor blades. I have been buying them for the last 2 years and have had no complaints.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, fine blades. I&#x27;ve used a few different brands from drug stores and none of them compared to Merkur.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> These are good blades, perfect for someone just starting with a Double Edge razor.  While not as sharp as other blades, they are great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe you can get a much closer, more comfortable shave than with the Merkur razor blade.  I use a Merkur razor and wouldn&#x27;t use any other blade.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! It was a great Father&#x27;s Day gift! I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested!</li>
            <li> This blade was supplied with my Merkur Heavy Duty Stainless DE razor, so it was the first I tried out.  I used the blade for 4 shaves over the course of a week, sometimes using an electric razor between and sometimes accumulating 2 days of growth between DE Blade shaves.  I tried 2 pass, 3 pass, and 4 pass shaving techniques, and found I need the 4 pass, including a final against the grain pass, to achieve the same closeness I had been getting with Gillette ProGlide Turbo blades and handle.  I will comment on sharpness, durability, and comfort for each blade, but since this is the first modern DE blade i have tried, my comments here will be qualitative.  Later reviews will quantitatively compare different blades on a 1 to 10 scale with 10 being best.  I will also update this review later.&lt;br /&gt;Sharpness - seemed sharp, but the amount of hair removed in each pass was not as high as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Durability - I noticed no decrease in sharpness or comfort over 4 shaves, so it appears to be very durable and can likely be used longer.&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - There is slightly more drag feel than with the ProGlide Turbos, but it is not uncomfortable.  I only nicked myself one time, around the Adam&#x27;s apple area on my neck, which is some lumpy topography that is likely prone to nicks.  I noticed a different feel to the skin after shaving, a kind of sensitivity but not bothersome or painful.  No rash or any other problems (note that I don&#x27;t use after shave, only a moisturizer).  Overall good comfort.</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp blades, but I&#x27;m surprised by their durability. I was expecting more than 3 weeks, but that&#x27;s about as much as I get out of these blades. I shave 3-4 times per week</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted  sharp.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I suspect I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or more different safety razor blade brands and none compare to the Merkur. More shaves and smoother than any other. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the Merkir blades, they are both sharp and easy to handle. The packaging is great and the fact that they are made in Germany makes me feel much better about the quality. These are the BEST alternative to expensive razor blades like the gilette fusion or Mach 3.</li>
            <li> The price was right. I expected quality, and that is exactly what i got. Came highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt; Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Best blade for the money!</li>
            <li> Where do I start??!!! The absolute best shaving razor blade ever!!!! At least for me to date!!! I&#x27;ve tried a few and they can&#x27;t compare!! So far the Astras come close but after a few shaves the merkur is still like new and the Astra not so much... Still  haven&#x27;t tried the feather blades yet.. But I&#x27;m in no rush I&#x27;m so in love with these I may never try them!! Great product great shipping</li>
            <li> Great blade so far.  Still trying to decide on the Merkur versus the Feathers.  I used a Feather 1 week after getting the D/E and no nicks.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Not smooth.</li>
            <li> Best razors on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought these razors years back because I ran out of my usual Feather razors so I figured I&#x27;d give these a try. For expensive as Feather razor blades are, these are even MORE expensive and they have the \\&quot;benefit\\&quot; of German manufacturing (You know the Germans always make good stuff right? :p) So they arrived and I immediately put a new razor blade fresh into my Merkur Adjustable Safety Razor. I started shaving. OUCH. It was seriously tugging at my beard rather than smoothly shaving. It was pretty uncomfortable and sort of painful. I figured okay, I got a bad razor. No problem. Unfortunately this was the same exact sort of shave I had for the 2nd and 3rd blade. After the 3rd blade I got tired of painful shaving and threw the other 7 blades out. I immediately ordered another set of 50 Feather blades for my next shave. Its been good and consistent since then.</li>
            <li> Had Merkur blades when I bought my safety razor (merkur as well) and found them to be wonderful. I&#x27;ve tried other blades and I either use Merkur or Feather.</li>
            <li> Bought these with a Meker handle, my first Sr. Provided a smooth shave with no razor burn, cuts, etc. (legs, sorry gents, I can&#x27;t speak to how this does on faces). Slot for used razors in the back of the case.</li>
            <li> These high quality blades are the longest lasting blades I have found. In addition the case they come in doubles as a blade disposal device.</li>
            <li> As a first time DE shaver, these were great to start with.  I still intend to sample many blades, and especially see if I can like the less expensive blades (derby, astra, etc) but I&#x27;m glad these were my first experience.  Every blade has delivered consistent results and I have not suffered a single nick with a month of shaving.  Great blades.</li>
            <li> I got a few burns with this razor blade in my Merkur 23c but it was my first time shaving with a safety razor.  Worked much better with the Derby extras.  maybe just a little too sharp for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Wonderful choice of blade that offers up a level of skin protection that some others don&#x27;t have. Excellent delivery packaging and timing with the razor itself.</li>
            <li> German made blades that scream quality and make all my other blades seem cheap. Quality craftsmanship and so worth the price. I will use these blades as long as I can. Work great for my sensitive skin and can be considered middle of the road blades...but that&#x27;s exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly.....what else is there to say.....their sharp?  I can get ~5 good shaves from 1 blade.  Beats the overpriced blades you but in stores.</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent.Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t care for the shave I got with a double edge razor.I should have returned these blades as well as the razor but got lazy and didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These razor blades have made shaving an easy endeavor. I used to get bumps, cuts, and irritation no matter what I did, but now that I use these very sharp blades with my safety razor, I don&#x27;t get any irritation and I rarely cut myself!!! I would recommend these to anyone thinking about doing any kind of shaving.</li>
            <li> Have to very careful you will cut your self very easily.  He has had many cuts on his head and thinking of returning.</li>
            <li> These are the first blades I&#x27;ve tried as a DE shaver, and I&#x27;m glad I started with these. Even though my technique isn&#x27;t very refined, I&#x27;m yet to cut myself and I&#x27;m getting great shaves with them.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp blades get a closer shave with my Merkur C handle.</li>
            <li> Good blades, not as sharp as Gillette or Feather, but still a good blade and a good value.  Some people may find them more suitable to their shaving style, so try several brands and choose the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li> The blades are excellent. No issues at all. I also believe in the baby oil to extend the life of the blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE razors since the early 60&#x27;s and I recently purchased the Merkur adjustable model. This is a very well made razor although expensive. It  shaves well but also very heavy and bulky. For the money I don&#x27;t believe you can beat the Gillette DE adjustable model. I have since retired the Merkur and gone back to the Gillette. I gave it a four star rating because of the weight.</li>
            <li> Expensive but great blades.</li>
            <li> Only blades I will use</li>
            <li> Fair blades. Not as good as Feather blades.</li>
            <li> While razor blades can be terrifying for most thirteen year old girls; when it comes to my 40 year old husbands facestache these blades really cut through the rough exterior and leave him feeling like a hairless German loverboy. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  Excellent blades.</li>
            <li> Not very expensive, and warm and comfortable after the first use.</li>
            <li> Great blades to get a close shave.  I have very sensitive skin, so a razor that is sharp and only requires 1-2 passes is great.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to fit a razor I bought for my husband from The Art Of Shaving. At the store the blades were $12.  They are the exact same thing except they didn&#x27;t come in the plastic packaging for just $5. Will always buy them here.</li>
            <li> I got into the DE razor shaving fad for a few weeks; I really loved the price and really hated the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. People who use these regularly say you&#x27;re going for beard reduction and not a close shave - well then the product is actually not that good. To be fair I have heard the Merkur DE razors can have a bad rep on the Badger and Blade forums.</li>
            <li> After years of using Mach3  that I still like, but 18 bucks for 5 blades is really getting out of hand. So I decided to go back to DE. I tried a blade I found at Walgreens hidden behind about twenty packs of the multi blade housed in plastic that cost to much and gave them a try. They were like Samurai swords. I still don&#x27;t know the name. They come in a black package and are made in Korea. Way to sharp. I tried Wilkinson and didn&#x27;t like them, tried Derby and I have razor burn. I&#x27;m afraid to try Feather, all the reviews I&#x27;ve read on them leed me to believe that their the sharpest blade&#x27;s on the planet, so I think I&#x27;m going to stay with the Merkur that seem to be sharp and do a good job for me. I guess from all the reviews I&#x27;ve read, you really have to try and try and try to find what works for you. The good thing is that you can try a lot of different brands in small lot&#x27;s and not spend a fortune. I find like most others using a good silver tip badger brush , pre shave oil and a good shave cream also helps. It will take a while to get back to DE for more than one pass, so I still use the mach 3 for a cross grain after using the DE. This way the mach 3 is a nice finish up and it will get a lot of mileage and I won&#x27;t cut myself on those hard to get spots that you have to go over and over. Merkur for now.</li>
            <li> And they last a great deal longer as well. You can even flip them over and use them a couple more times</li>
            <li> These bad boys are sharp and best part of all, they aren&#x27;t plastic disposable razors that get tossed in a landfill to sit for eternity. Seriously picked these up because I wanted to remove the idea of single use plastics from my life and these blades in conjunction with the metal handle are a great and cheap option that in my opinion ends up much better for the consumer and the environment.</li>
            <li> Blades do the trick, but I only get two shaves per blade because of my beard.  Worth a try though, good blade to learn technique.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating due to how well this blade works with my new Merkur 34c safety razor &amp; my vintage Hoffritz (Merkur) slant &amp; Hoffritz (Merkur) DE open comb (James Bond) razors.&lt;br /&gt;Goes well in my vintage Gilletts too.</li>
            <li> There are some reviews that are not so positive about these blades, especially when they are compared to other blades such as &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34;. To be honest I think Merkur are equal in quality if not a little bit smoother in the shave. I have used them with the Merkur device and never had any nicks, cuts, skin abrasions. Last week I had  a minor cut with a feather. The down side is the price which does not make much sense since they are not incredibly superior blades. I do have a soft spot for german made stuff because quality is a given, so I have bought several containers of these blades. Because that little nick with the feather I am inclined to suggest Merkur over Feather</li>
            <li> Great blades they came fast and they are really sharp no bumps or cuts</li>
            <li> Merkur double edge blades are in my opinion the best on the market - their staying power is incredible lasting shave after shave - couple these blades with the Merkur razor and you have a winning combination . Great for keeping your beard or mustash shaped just the way you like .</li>
            <li> These blades are pretty fantastic. Sharp, easy, and quick to use.</li>
