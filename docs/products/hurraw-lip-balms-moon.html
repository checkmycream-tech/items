            <li>I love the Hurraw!</li>

            <li>Feels amazing on my lips, too.</li>
            <li>This is a great lip balm: smooth and moisturizing, though a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>Some just aren&#x27;t effective.</li>
            <li>Nice balm.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this balm.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t taste foul.</li>
            <li>This is a nice lip balm.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice.</li>
            <li>smell is very strong, smells like a candle.</li>
            <li>I would say that it smells more like chocolate than anything, but I still love it!</li>
            <li>so far, I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li>The nighttime balm chamomile vanilla mix is the perfect blend of sweet and calm to fall asleep with.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, it&#x27;s smooth and creamy and goes on easily, unlike most organic and vegan lip balms which feel like dirt when you put them on.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>My lips look and feel healthy when I use this.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s vegan.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip balm ever...</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth</li>
            <li>A better feel than chapstick.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake, it doesn&#x27;t come out of the tube, and I don&#x27;t have to reapply as often :-)</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting...</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and being chamomile great to use at bed time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything, have found this to be so much better than beeswax products.</li>
            <li>I tend to toss and turn and am a side or belly sleeper, so I often worried that most of my balms were ending up on my pillow cases, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Plus, I didn&#x27;t notice that it moisturizes any better than their &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; ones so...</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.  </li>
            <li>Love It</li>
            <li>- Use It - And Can&#x27;t wait to try more flavors</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the shape of the container, which keeps it from rolling off the nightstand.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>It has a very unique scent, for sure.</li>
            <li>Very nourishing and has a pleasant smell...</li>
            <li>But, I use the thinner lemon lip balm more because it has such a great scent.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>it is not a bad produkt, it cood be better</li>
            <li>Hands down the best lip balm I have ever bought!</li>
            <li>It applies easily, evenly, and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant and natural taste and smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, not too greasy and smells lightly of vanilla (no discernible chamomile).</li>
            <li>However, it still applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>Hurraw lip balms are great - they actually heal my chapped and cracked lips.</li>
            <li>This baml feels so smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Lips were softer and smooth.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know where I would be without this fantastic lip balm....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waxy like some lip treatments and within a few nights treatment, my lips felt great in the morning!</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li>The night balm not only smells amazing but keeps my lips hydrated and looking their best all day long.</li>
            <li>It does fade quickly, thankfully, but at night I kind of want my balm to smell nice, especially this one, since it&#x27;s concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth, and altogether I like it, the quality is great, but there&#x27;s something about the scent that sometimes bothers me and I have a hard time figuring out why.  </li>
            <li>No really it stinks!  </li>
            <li>The Blue Chamomile Vanilla has a pleasant taste as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find myself needing to reapply this nearly as often as I did the Alba, but I do reapply it because I LOVE the smell!  </li>
            <li>I do think it lasts all night, but I don&#x27;t think it does anything special.</li>
            <li>I make special trips and special orders to get them.</li>
            <li>Not bad,</li>
            <li>The scent/flavor is mild.</li>
            <li>but once I did I had to quickly wipe it off.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite nighttime lip balm.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more Hurraw!</li>
            <li>The overall scent/taste once it is on isn&#x27;t as nice as I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>It took my cracked lips and healed them right away.  </li>
            <li>Oh yea that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a wee divot in the balm itself when it&#x27;s opened the first time that seems to allow your lip to naturally hit the balm rather than the sqaured off tips of most balms in a tube.  </li>
            <li>It is loaded with good ingredients and it really works to sooth dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a good portion of my adult life looking for a decent lip balm and not being satisfied.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I bought a second tube.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d really love to stock up on this balm for those harsh winter nights, but I&#x27;d have to find a much better deal.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li>When I requested to return the item, the seller mentioned they would not be able to process the return if the product was open...</li>
            <li>but my dog found it and ate it so obviously it taste ok.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for the lips that lasts long, especially during the night.  </li>
            <li>However, the blue chamomile scent isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>Stumbled across it here on Amazon, but purchased it elsewhere (wanted that lowest price point for the first try).  </li>
            <li>I really wanted something that would be more of a heavyweight for my super chapped winter lips, but this felt a lot like any other lip balm.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m happy with the product, I’m only doing 4-stars here due to being too overpriced.</li>
            <li>and I wake up with my lips feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>But it gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>I enjoy wearing lipstick especially matte</li>
            <li>It smells great and does not make your lips addicted.</li>
            <li>I really like the design.</li>
            <li>seems to really absorb in and</li>
            <li>I like the smell, very calming.</li>
            <li>The consistency, not so much.</li>
            <li>You really have to slather it on to get the feel that I like for a nighttime balm.</li>
            <li>thanks a million</li>
            <li>My lips are really getting softer using this lip balm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even more moisturizing and thicker than the other Hurraw lip balms.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d get past it and even put some on my lips (nice consistency)</li>
            <li>This is a decent lip balm.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get any vanilla hints, mainly the chamomile and a cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several different &#x27;flavors&#x27; and love all of them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s nothing to feel worried or guilty about with such a great ingredient list, either!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s nothing to feel worried or guilty about with such a great ingredient list, either!  </li>
            <li>and this really helps them stay soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to the Green Tea balm, the Night Treatment is a bit thicker and leaves a more creamy, waxy feel on my lips as I rub them together.</li>
            <li>I live in Ohio, and in the winters my lips get chapped fiercely, sometimes to the point of bleeding.</li>
            <li>Lip balm is my new fav.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the oils used are all cold pressed (getting the most from them)</li>
            <li>It does really stay overnight, though, and I woke to lips that were still soft and unchapped for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a replacement for my Alba coconut balm since it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with smooth lips, still feeling a little layer.</li>
            <li>all 4 that I&#x27;ve tried are the same level of silkiness), leave your lips smooth, and some of the flavors bring back the  most fun memories from early childhood (think back to that first time in the 80&#x27;s that you ever had that crazy rabbits</li>
            <li>lots of natural lip balm has beewax in them.</li>
            <li>Since this is still a bit of a splurge for lip balm, I may look at some of the more expensive stuff available locally for an alternative to something that needs to be shipped.</li>
            <li>I like that these balms have no flavor or sweetener, and are all natural.</li>
            <li>This lip balm is not harsh, and does not irritate my lips.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips feel completely moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>I like the brand philosophy, but what I really like is the product.&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto this specific balm, the Night treatment.</li>
            <li>I still use it, but this might be my least favorite scent.</li>
            <li>just a really soft and healed feeling.  </li>
            <li>Likely won&#x27;t reorder, particularly in winter.</li>
            <li>is a bit different than your normal balm in that it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky or greasy feeling that some balms leave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if I agree that it has some majorly different quality that makes it &amp;#34;NIGHT&amp;#34; balm, but knowing that it is labeled as such makes me keep it on my nightstand and use it every night which does help with my chronically chapped lips.</li>
            <li>I love the results of this, it is a little thicker than their usual balms, and it really does stay on overnight.</li>
            <li>I have an allergy to bees wax that left my lips in pretty rough shape.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, its somewhat waxy and thick</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin, this has been a life saver!</li>
            <li>Hurraw&#x27;s night balm is quite thick but absorbs quickly, and I often wake up with it still on my lips in the morning.</li>
            <li>The flavors/scents are in now way overpowering (I&#x27;m super &amp;#34;Scent&amp;#34;sitive, so I have to be really careful about heavily perfumed/scented products).  </li>

            <li> This baml feels so smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Lips were softer and smooth.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know where I would be without this fantastic lip balm....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waxy like some lip treatments and within a few nights treatment, my lips felt great in the morning!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> The night balm not only smells amazing but keeps my lips hydrated and looking their best all day long.</li>
            <li> It does fade quickly, thankfully, but at night I kind of want my balm to smell nice, especially this one, since it&#x27;s concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth, and altogether I like it, the quality is great, but there&#x27;s something about the scent that sometimes bothers me and I have a hard time figuring out why.  </li>
            <li> No really it stinks!  </li>
            <li> The Blue Chamomile Vanilla has a pleasant taste as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find myself needing to reapply this nearly as often as I did the Alba, but I do reapply it because I LOVE the smell!  </li>
            <li> I do think it lasts all night, but I don&#x27;t think it does anything special.</li>
            <li> I make special trips and special orders to get them.</li>
            <li> Not bad,</li>
            <li> The scent/flavor is mild.</li>
            <li> but once I did I had to quickly wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite nighttime lip balm.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more Hurraw!</li>
            <li> The overall scent/taste once it is on isn&#x27;t as nice as I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> It took my cracked lips and healed them right away.  </li>
            <li> Oh yea that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a wee divot in the balm itself when it&#x27;s opened the first time that seems to allow your lip to naturally hit the balm rather than the sqaured off tips of most balms in a tube.  </li>
            <li> It is loaded with good ingredients and it really works to sooth dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a good portion of my adult life looking for a decent lip balm and not being satisfied.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I bought a second tube.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d really love to stock up on this balm for those harsh winter nights, but I&#x27;d have to find a much better deal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first</li>
            <li> When I requested to return the item, the seller mentioned they would not be able to process the return if the product was open...</li>
            <li> but my dog found it and ate it so obviously it taste ok.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the lips that lasts long, especially during the night.  </li>
            <li> However, the blue chamomile scent isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> Stumbled across it here on Amazon, but purchased it elsewhere (wanted that lowest price point for the first try).  </li>
            <li> I really wanted something that would be more of a heavyweight for my super chapped winter lips, but this felt a lot like any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m happy with the product, I’m only doing 4-stars here due to being too overpriced.</li>
            <li> and I wake up with my lips feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> But it gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> I enjoy wearing lipstick especially matte</li>
            <li> It smells great and does not make your lips addicted.</li>
            <li> I really like the design.</li>
            <li> seems to really absorb in and</li>
            <li> I like the smell, very calming.</li>
            <li> The consistency, not so much.</li>
            <li> You really have to slather it on to get the feel that I like for a nighttime balm.</li>
            <li> thanks a million</li>
            <li> My lips are really getting softer using this lip balm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more moisturizing and thicker than the other Hurraw lip balms.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d get past it and even put some on my lips (nice consistency)</li>
            <li> This is a decent lip balm.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get any vanilla hints, mainly the chamomile and a cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several different &#x27;flavors&#x27; and love all of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing to feel worried or guilty about with such a great ingredient list, either!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing to feel worried or guilty about with such a great ingredient list, either!  </li>
            <li> and this really helps them stay soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the Green Tea balm, the Night Treatment is a bit thicker and leaves a more creamy, waxy feel on my lips as I rub them together.</li>
            <li> I live in Ohio, and in the winters my lips get chapped fiercely, sometimes to the point of bleeding.</li>
            <li> Lip balm is my new fav.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the oils used are all cold pressed (getting the most from them)</li>
            <li> It does really stay overnight, though, and I woke to lips that were still soft and unchapped for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a replacement for my Alba coconut balm since it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I wake up with smooth lips, still feeling a little layer.</li>
            <li> all 4 that I&#x27;ve tried are the same level of silkiness), leave your lips smooth, and some of the flavors bring back the  most fun memories from early childhood (think back to that first time in the 80&#x27;s that you ever had that crazy rabbits</li>
            <li> lots of natural lip balm has beewax in them.</li>
            <li> Since this is still a bit of a splurge for lip balm, I may look at some of the more expensive stuff available locally for an alternative to something that needs to be shipped.</li>
            <li> I like that these balms have no flavor or sweetener, and are all natural.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is not harsh, and does not irritate my lips.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips feel completely moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> I like the brand philosophy, but what I really like is the product.&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto this specific balm, the Night treatment.</li>
            <li> I still use it, but this might be my least favorite scent.</li>
            <li> just a really soft and healed feeling.  </li>
            <li> Likely won&#x27;t reorder, particularly in winter.</li>
            <li> is a bit different than your normal balm in that it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky or greasy feeling that some balms leave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if I agree that it has some majorly different quality that makes it &amp;#34;NIGHT&amp;#34; balm, but knowing that it is labeled as such makes me keep it on my nightstand and use it every night which does help with my chronically chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I love the results of this, it is a little thicker than their usual balms, and it really does stay on overnight.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to bees wax that left my lips in pretty rough shape.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, its somewhat waxy and thick</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin, this has been a life saver!</li>
            <li> Hurraw&#x27;s night balm is quite thick but absorbs quickly, and I often wake up with it still on my lips in the morning.</li>
            <li> The flavors/scents are in now way overpowering (I&#x27;m super &amp;#34;Scent&amp;#34;sitive, so I have to be really careful about heavily perfumed/scented products).  </li>
            <li> This is slightly heavier than a normal lip balm and stays on all night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> But, it does stay on overnight and does seem to help with my dry lips, especially this winter.</li>
            <li> I started using it not long ago, and it&#x27;s kept my lips nice and soft during this extremely brutal winter.</li>
            <li> I read so many graeat reviews, but unfortunately this lip balm only dried my lips.</li>
            <li> After a while I started to think that the only thing that makes this a nighttime balm is that the tube is an oval and is less likely to roll off of your nightstand.</li>
            <li> My lips feel the same when I wake after using this just as they do if I use any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the image, but it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> The night treatment is a bit different from the other varieties of Hurraw!</li>
            <li> During the winter, I tend to have a rough time with chapped and dry lips</li>
            <li> It does stay on through the night as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Hurraw lip balm products and have quite a few flavors.  </li>
            <li> However, this one just tastes disgusting...like a bitter plastic taste.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs in just minutes, unlike some other balms I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about ANY of the other flavors (except for Coconut...</li>
            <li> I threw out all the Alba lip balms I owned and immediately purchased 3 other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Hurraw!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t roll off my nightstand if I knock it over while trying to find it in the dark.</li>
            <li> No more waking up with dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li> It has a slight taste but isn&#x27;t over powering at all.</li>
            <li> Perhaps because of this, it&#x27;s a little bit thicker than the other Hurraw!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re still going to leave a mess on the rim of your drinking glass though.  </li>
            <li> Though the price is a little steep.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and a little cloying.</li>
            <li> Its scent is not that bad and it just really works!</li>
            <li> I now have a lip balm that reflects my raw food lifestyle choices....</li>
            <li> No animal testing, all organic ingredients, raw and Vegan?!  </li>
            <li> No animal testing, all organic ingredients, raw and Vegan?!  </li>
            <li> Others are hard to apply evenly and wind up being rather caky.</li>
            <li> I am a burts bee die hard, until I tried this.  </li>
            <li> Negative reviews have been made regarding the smell, but I am quite used to Chamomile</li>
            <li> (you know which one I mean) cereal...remember the smell of it?  </li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a terrible balm, but it doesn&#x27;t last on my lips very long.</li>
            <li> Even worse, I bought 2 tubes of this</li>
            <li> No semi sharp hardened waxy edges on this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.  </li>
            <li> This is the WORST ONE they have.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the worst of the Hurraw line.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Goes on so smooth and feels absolutely wonderful! I now have one by my bedside, one in my makeup bag, and one in my purse. I’m good to go! :)  Although I&#x27;m happy with the product, I’m only doing 4-stars here due to being too overpriced.</li>
            <li> The best lip balm ive ever used. It has a pleasant and natural taste and smell. My lips look and feel healthy when I use this.</li>
            <li> This is a decent lip balm. I really wanted something that would be more of a heavyweight for my super chapped winter lips, but this felt a lot like any other lip balm. The scent/flavor is mild. After a while I started to think that the only thing that makes this a nighttime balm is that the tube is an oval and is less likely to roll off of your nightstand.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s vegan. lots of natural lip balm has beewax in them. Though the price is a little steep. But it gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a terrible balm, but it doesn&#x27;t last on my lips very long. It absorbs in just minutes, unlike some other balms I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s smooth, not too greasy and smells lightly of vanilla (no discernible chamomile). Likely won&#x27;t reorder, particularly in winter.</li>
            <li> smell is very strong, smells like a candle. you get used to it how ever and it does exfoliate your lips(:</li>
            <li> Love it!!! My favorite lip balm ever...it does the job, havenʻt had chapped lips since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Smells SO good. Feels amazing on my lips, too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Not waxy and not gooey. Really works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super sensitive to smells but when I opened the lid of this balm the smell turned my stomach.  I thought I&#x27;d get past it and even put some on my lips (nice consistency) but once I did I had to quickly wipe it off.  It smells rather putrid.</li>
            <li> This is the only lip balm I use when I go to sleep! I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees, but it just isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I&#x27;d prefer for a night balm. Hurraw&#x27;s night balm is quite thick but absorbs quickly, and I often wake up with it still on my lips in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is a great lip balm: smooth and moisturizing, though a bit pricey. Some complain about the smell, I love it! I do think it lasts all night, but I don&#x27;t think it does anything special. My lips feel the same when I wake after using this just as they do if I use any other lip balm. My go-to is moisture therapy balm by avon, and it&#x27;s only one dollar!</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells great, it&#x27;s smooth and creamy and goes on easily, unlike most organic and vegan lip balms which feel like dirt when you put them on. Definitely recommend this brand</li>
            <li> One star at best!!  This stuff stinks.  No really it stinks!  Nice and smooth but I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.  I had to throw it out. Yuck,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a good portion of my adult life looking for a decent lip balm and not being satisfied. Some just aren&#x27;t effective. Others are hard to apply evenly and wind up being rather caky. Not so Hurraw! lip balm. This stuff is great. It applies easily, evenly, and smoothly. And it works! I started using it not long ago, and it&#x27;s kept my lips nice and soft during this extremely brutal winter. The night treatment is a bit different from the other varieties of Hurraw! in that it&#x27;s intended to be used at night. Perhaps because of this, it&#x27;s a little bit thicker than the other Hurraw! balms. However, it still applies smoothly. The Blue Chamomile Vanilla has a pleasant taste as well. It&#x27;s definitely not overpowering, but it&#x27;s still distinctive. I&#x27;m also impressed with the fact that all Hurraw! lip balms are organic and vegan.</li>
            <li> Nice balm.  A better feel than chapstick.</li>
            <li> It says its a night balm however it works for any time. I use it daily and anytime. Its scent is not that bad and it just really works! I enjoy wearing lipstick especially matte and this really helps them stay soft and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My lips beg for this at night. I have it on my nightstand. It is loaded with good ingredients and it really works to sooth dry chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Its ok,gets the job done...it is not a bad produkt, it cood be better but I like it . I will recomend it</li>
            <li> I really liked this balm. It smells great and does not make your lips addicted. Really good for overnight.</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm addict,, and Hurraw is the BEST. It doesn&#x27;t flake, it doesn&#x27;t come out of the tube, and I don&#x27;t have to reapply as often :-)</li>
            <li> This is a good lip balm. I don&#x27;t really know if I agree that it has some majorly different quality that makes it &amp;#34;NIGHT&amp;#34; balm, but knowing that it is labeled as such makes me keep it on my nightstand and use it every night which does help with my chronically chapped lips. The smell is interesting...I like it, my husband does not. It is sort of similar to baby lotion in my opinion. I really like the design. It would be good for pockets, and I like that it can&#x27;t roll off my nightstand if I knock it over while trying to find it in the dark.</li>
            <li> This product works well to restore moisture and softness to lips over night. It smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t taste foul. I liked it so much, I bought a second tube.</li>
            <li> I have had this balm for about a week now. I have worn it to bed every night and I wake up with my lips feeling super soft. During the winter, I tend to have a rough time with chapped and dry lips so this balm is a must if you also have this problem. It goes on smooth, its somewhat waxy and thick which is what I feel helps treat your lips so well. I would say that it smells more like chocolate than anything, but I still love it! I will definitely be buying more Hurraw! in different scents/flavors!</li>
            <li> Realky like the feel of this lip balm.  It is very soothing and being chamomile great to use at bed time.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells good. It does stay on through the night as expected. Will probably buy again.  Since this is still a bit of a splurge for lip balm, I may look at some of the more expensive stuff available locally for an alternative to something that needs to be shipped.</li>
            <li> Hurraw lip balms are great - they actually heal my chapped and cracked lips. I move around a lot when I sleep so always end up smearing lip balm all over my face, and this does NOT make me break out which is great. The smell is herbal-y and almost chocolatey. I didn&#x27;t like it at first but now I do and find it calming. I like that these balms have no flavor or sweetener, and are all natural.</li>
            <li> Love this balm, feels great on my lips.</li>
            <li> I have an allergy to bees wax that left my lips in pretty rough shape. This lip balm is not harsh, and does not irritate my lips. The night balm not only smells amazing but keeps my lips hydrated and looking their best all day long. I have been telling all of my friends to try this lip balm out. I can&#x27;t wait to try more from this brand!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more moisturizing and thicker than the other Hurraw lip balms. But, I use the thinner lemon lip balm more because it has such a great scent.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe what a difference this balm has made for me. I&#x27;ve tried everything, have found this to be so much better than beeswax products. I have very dry, sensitive skin, this has been a life saver!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WAY TO GO FOR HYDRATING YOUR CHAPPED LIPS, I LOVE IT!!! FINALLY SOMETHING THAT WORKS! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> The balm overall does the chap, however does have quite an un-inviting aroma. When I requested to return the item, the seller mentioned they would not be able to process the return if the product was open...which it was (how else would I have been able to smell it?!).</li>
            <li> This is great but my dog found it and ate it so obviously it taste ok.</li>
            <li> This baml feels so smooth and creamy.  No tugging on the lip at all.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I live in Ohio, and in the winters my lips get chapped fiercely, sometimes to the point of bleeding. I needed a good nighttime balm that would heal and soothe while I slept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the Green Tea balm, the Night Treatment is a bit thicker and leaves a more creamy, waxy feel on my lips as I rub them together. It does really stay overnight, though, and I woke to lips that were still soft and unchapped for the first time in a long time. I tend to toss and turn and am a side or belly sleeper, so I often worried that most of my balms were ending up on my pillow cases, but Hurraw! seems to really absorb in and stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only been two nights, but so far, I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I like the smell, very calming. The consistency, not so much. You really have to slather it on to get the feel that I like for a nighttime balm.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lip balm. It may be a 5-star for others. I get chapped lips and only one lip balm seems to work at any given time, so I have to try several.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the lips that lasts long, especially during the night.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the Hurraw lip balm products and have quite a few flavors.  This is the WORST ONE they have.  Seriously.  I have no complaints about ANY of the other flavors (except for Coconut...but that&#x27;s just a personal flavor preference).  However, this one just tastes disgusting...like a bitter plastic taste.  Even worse, I bought 2 tubes of this and it&#x27;s the worst of the Hurraw line.  Plus, I didn&#x27;t notice that it moisturizes any better than their &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; ones so...I&#x27;d say pass on this one and get a different flavor, otherwise you&#x27;ll find yourself being grossed out in the middle of the night thinking you&#x27;re dreaming about licking on a plastic/wax lemon or something.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.  It makes my lips feel completely moisturized and soft.  Great for before bed or in the morning before applying lip products.</li>
            <li> I am a burts bee die hard, until I tried this.  It is organic.  It stays on your lips.  It took my cracked lips and healed them right away.  Love It - Use It - And Can&#x27;t wait to try more flavors</li>
            <li> The overall scent/taste once it is on isn&#x27;t as nice as I was hoping for.  But, it does stay on overnight and does seem to help with my dry lips, especially this winter.</li>
            <li> Loved how my lips felt when I woke up after putting on night treatment lip balm.Lips were softer and smooth.Love it</li>
            <li> this product is perfect, it has helped my grand-son greatly, I don&#x27;t know where I would be without this fantastic lip balm....thanks a million</li>
            <li> This lip balm is absolutely amazing! it is cheaper to buy on the Hurraw! website. Hands down the best lip balm I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> I love the Hurraw! balms. I make special trips and special orders to get them. I like the brand philosophy, but what I really like is the product.&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto this specific balm, the Night treatment. I love the results of this, it is a little thicker than their usual balms, and it really does stay on overnight. I wake up with smooth lips, still feeling a little layer. However, the blue chamomile scent isn&#x27;t my favorite. At all. It&#x27;s heavy and a little cloying. I still use it, but this might be my least favorite scent. It does fade quickly, thankfully, but at night I kind of want my balm to smell nice, especially this one, since it&#x27;s concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get any vanilla hints, mainly the chamomile and a cocoa butter. Not bad, but I&#x27;m still crossing my fingers for a different scent option one day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  Negative reviews have been made regarding the smell, but I am quite used to Chamomile and I like it.  This is slightly heavier than a normal lip balm and stays on all night.  Great vegan product from a great company!</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it every night.</li>
            <li> My new favorite nighttime lip balm. Great for keeping your lips moisturized throughout the night while you sleep. No more waking up with dry chapped lips. Plus the smell is so yummy and soothing.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery. This product is the best balm I&#x27;ve ever had. It is very smooth and not sticky at all. It has a slight taste but isn&#x27;t over powering at all. I love the shape of the container, which keeps it from rolling off the nightstand. I&#x27;ve purchased several different &#x27;flavors&#x27; and love all of them. My lips are really getting softer using this lip balm.</li>
            <li> I read so many graeat reviews, but unfortunately this lip balm only dried my lips.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is so great! Very nourishing and has a pleasant smell...almost like cake mix. My only qualm was how tiny the tube was!!! I was expecting something much bigger, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d really love to stock up on this balm for those harsh winter nights, but I&#x27;d have to find a much better deal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the taste. It goes on nice. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to have a taste but it does.  Vegan</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this lip balm. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and don&#x27;t know what I did before finding this product... Oh yea that&#x27;s right I used products that were not as good. I&#x27;ll not name drop here but I won&#x27;t be using them again. I&#x27;m a Hurraw convert. I love the fact that the oils used are all cold pressed (getting the most from them) I now have a lip balm that reflects my raw food lifestyle choices.... Thank you Hurraw!</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth, and altogether I like it, the quality is great, but there&#x27;s something about the scent that sometimes bothers me and I have a hard time figuring out why.  It has a very unique scent, for sure.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a replacement for my Alba coconut balm since it&#x27;s becoming harder and harder to find at a reasonable price.  Enter Hurraw!  This was a very happy accident.  Stumbled across it here on Amazon, but purchased it elsewhere (wanted that lowest price point for the first try).  I&#x27;m sold.  100% sold.  I will happily pay full price for this gem!  I threw out all the Alba lip balms I owned and immediately purchased 3 other &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; of Hurraw!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the shape...it&#x27;s not a tube!  It&#x27;s like a teeny tiny deodorant applicator.  Sorry for the image, but it&#x27;s true.  Perfect lip shape!  There&#x27;s a wee divot in the balm itself when it&#x27;s opened the first time that seems to allow your lip to naturally hit the balm rather than the sqaured off tips of most balms in a tube.  No semi sharp hardened waxy edges on this bad boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is incredibly silky (all 4 that I&#x27;ve tried are the same level of silkiness), leave your lips smooth, and some of the flavors bring back the  most fun memories from early childhood (think back to that first time in the 80&#x27;s that you ever had that crazy rabbits (you know which one I mean) cereal...remember the smell of it?  That&#x27;s what the Kapha smells like to me.).  The flavors/scents are in now way overpowering (I&#x27;m super &amp;#34;Scent&amp;#34;sitive, so I have to be really careful about heavily perfumed/scented products).  Hurraw! is a bit different than your normal balm in that it doesn&#x27;t leave that sticky or greasy feeling that some balms leave.  You&#x27;re still going to leave a mess on the rim of your drinking glass though.  I don&#x27;t find myself needing to reapply this nearly as often as I did the Alba, but I do reapply it because I LOVE the smell!  The nighttime balm chamomile vanilla mix is the perfect blend of sweet and calm to fall asleep with.  I don&#x27;t wake up in the morning with any greasiness on my lips...just a really soft and healed feeling.  Here on the 5th ring of the sun (Phoenix), we need all the help we can get to keep our lips from burning and chapping...I&#x27;m sold on this one to keep that from happening all year round!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing to feel worried or guilty about with such a great ingredient list, either!  No animal testing, all organic ingredients, raw and Vegan?!

            <li> Hurraw! Lip balm is my new fav. It&#x27;s not waxy like some lip treatments and within a few nights treatment, my lips felt great in the morning!</li>
