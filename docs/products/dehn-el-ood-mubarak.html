            <li>Lol I love it.</li>
            <li>I know it is their own blend</li>
            <li>Goes on very strong with an irresistible Oud smell.</li>
            <li>One lady went as far as grabbing me by the shirt collar and insisted walking me to my car after she smelled this wonderful oil.</li>
            <li>and if I could give more I would.</li>
            <li>I personally love this cologne.  </li>
            <li>i really love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will vary depending upon the person.</li>
            <li>This is not the famous Assam Oud which probably explains the inexpensive price range.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a unique smell that you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on and mildly euprohic and erotic.  </li>
            <li>More than that will be too strong.</li>
            <li>It arrived today, earlier than expected, and it is incredible how excellent the smell is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of an oil texture but does not leave a residue it&#x27;s readily absorbed.</li>
            <li>happy overall</li>
            <li>I dont think this is alcohol free my hand burned me.</li>
            <li>Love it very nice scent but not much fragrance</li>
            <li>and it strays some from the complexity of the original, but</li>
            <li>This is a light, wonderful oud with a lingering woody bass note and ever-so-slight sweet high note.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a gorgeous, heavy glass, faceted flacon, suitable for the atar it contains.</li>
            <li>Mentholated, camphoracious, sweet oud, not fecal at all.</li>
            <li>The bottle is really cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fragrance is pretty strong, with</li>
            <li>something called Jannet el Firdaus, which is most definitely not Oud.&lt;br /&gt;Everything worked out fine in the end.</li>
            <li>it is a Different smell kind of smell</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery, good oud for the price, not real of course, but</li>
            <li>Now that I have purchased this 4 times, my opinion remains the same and this fragrance remains my favorite.</li>
            <li>Have received many compliments from ppl who are totally unfamiliar with oud fragrances.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also pretty, I intend to use it for my own blends once it is empty.</li>
            <li>The downside for me is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than 5 hrs.</li>
            <li>It is a rich, woody fragrance with lasting qualities of deep forest and warm earth...</li>
            <li>I would have preferred something less sweet, with more of a dry smoke scent, but this is appealing.</li>
            <li>Rapid fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I am interested in trying new oudh fragrances.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised when I received my first bottle of Swiss Arabian Dehn El Oudh Mubarak.</li>
            <li>It initially reminds me of molasses, then develops a sweet smokey wood dimension.</li>
            <li>I purchased it mainly because of the price and the fact</li>
            <li>Long lasting smell for two straight days with powerful projection.</li>
            <li>This is complex enough on its own, and doesn&#x27;t take more than a small drop.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was clearly a mistake</li>
            <li>Woodsy, Leather, Masculine.</li>
            <li>The company ships from Florida and imports directly from UAE, so</li>
            <li>I will be excited to try other versions from here in the near future.</li>
            <li>Musky, sweet, a little spicy.</li>
            <li>Too much can be extremely over powering.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad. But it&#x27;s not wxactelly what am looking for.</li>
            <li> Five stars. and if I could give more I would. It arrived today, earlier than expected, and it is incredible how excellent the smell is. I do not know how they can make this for the price they are charging. I know it is their own blend and it strays some from the complexity of the original, but I am truly impressed by what my nose is telling me. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Beautiful authentic smelling dehn al oudh. Mentholated, camphoracious, sweet oud, not fecal at all. Blends well with spicy orientals and patchouli fragrances. Good staying power.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Its so deep. Remember that a little goes a long way. Too much can be extremely over powering. Woodsy, Leather, Masculine.</li>
            <li> This is a light, wonderful oud with a lingering woody bass note and ever-so-slight sweet high note. It comes beautifully packaged and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased and received this product yesterday. Shipping time was excellent, it was as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed with the quality of the product. It is not good quality as I expected. While applying it smells great but moments later ( 15 minutes hardly) there is no fragrance. I even applied on my shirt, my skin and there no Ood smell to be found.&lt;br /&gt;I will try some other one or this may be fake quality.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when I received my first bottle of Swiss Arabian Dehn El Oudh Mubarak. I purchased it mainly because of the price and the fact I am interested in trying new oudh fragrances. Now that I have purchased this 4 times, my opinion remains the same and this fragrance remains my favorite. It is a rich, woody fragrance with lasting qualities of deep forest and warm earth...just wonderful. I recommend this as one of the best values available for oudh oil.</li>
            <li> I Did not  think that i would like but I do it is a Different smell kind of smell but the thing about people will note the smell on you and they answer what is that smell you smell good I tell them i got is from Swiss Arabian to me you have to grow to the smell but a nice smell,lo!</li>
            <li> As the title says this is just a great buy! Goes on very strong with an irresistible Oud smell. Have received many compliments from ppl who are totally unfamiliar with oud fragrances. One lady went as far as grabbing me by the shirt collar and insisted walking me to my car after she smelled this wonderful oil. When I asked what she thought I smelled like, she inhaled deeply with her eyes in the back of her head, and said... \\&quot;A MAN!\\&quot; Lol I love it.</li>
            <li> Plesantly suprised,&lt;br /&gt;That parfume is made with real essential oils !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is pretty strong, with nigh frankincense and leather aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box and bottle itself are gorgeous ! Perfect for a gift !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is definately best aromatic oil i ever purchsed in that price range.</li>
            <li> The company ships from Florida and imports directly from UAE, so if you are shipping in US you will get your product in no time at all. Only a couple days until I received my order in Ohio.    The smell is really awesome. It&#x27;s more of an oil texture but does not leave a residue it&#x27;s readily absorbed. The smell is intoxicating just as I had hopped. I will be excited to try other versions from here in the near future.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, good oud for the price, not real of course, but i did not expect it to be pure…&lt;br /&gt;Very happy overall…&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Rapid fast delivery. A smell of opulence on the horizon. The &amp;#34;Dehn EL Ood Mubarak bottle&amp;#34; looks so exquisite and opulent. Long lasting smell for two straight days with powerful projection.</li>
            <li> Item was the wrong one.&lt;br /&gt;It was clearly a mistake&lt;br /&gt;Sent something called Jannet el Firdaus, which is most definitely not Oud.&lt;br /&gt;Everything worked out fine in the end.</li>
            <li> I personally love this cologne.  It&#x27;s a unique smell that you can&#x27;t quite put your finger on and mildly euprohic and erotic.  I&#x27;ve gotten a few comments on it.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love it very nice scent but not much fragrance i really love</li>
            <li> I would have preferred something less sweet, with more of a dry smoke scent, but this is appealing. It initially reminds me of molasses, then develops a sweet smokey wood dimension. I&#x27;m sure it will vary depending upon the person. It also blends well with other oils based on resins and gingerbread type spices - just blend with no more than one other oil. This is complex enough on its own, and doesn&#x27;t take more than a small drop. More than that will be too strong. The bottle is also pretty, I intend to use it for my own blends once it is empty. The downside for me is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than 5 hrs.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best you can get love it.</li>
            <li> This perfume is what I have been looking for all these years.. it has a sweet woody scent which is subtle ! The scent stays on for a long time!!!  The seller was prompt in shipping out these items immediately and the package received was in excellent condition with even its original plastic cover over the box.</li>
            <li> Caused me headaches whenever I smell it!</li>
            <li> I dont think this is alcohol free my hand burned me.</li>
            <li> I admire the fragrance from this SA Oud. This is not the famous Assam Oud which probably explains the inexpensive price range. Still it has an oudy punch to pack. If you&#x27;re into woody, oudy, Oriental fragrances then you&#x27;d like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a gorgeous, heavy glass, faceted flacon, suitable for the atar it contains.</li>
            <li> Musky, sweet, a little spicy. I don&#x27;t wear it very often, it can be overpowering and a little heavy. If you use just a little drop, that&#x27;s probably all is needed. The bottle is really cool.</li>
