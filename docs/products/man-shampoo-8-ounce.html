    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This shampoo is great!</li>
            <li>Add in the fact that the shampoo contains polysorbate 80 to fight DHT build-up - which can lead to hair loss - and that makes this a great product for me!</li>
            <li>Was really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect shampoo!</li>
            <li>This company has created an excellent product and does seem to work well for men as well as men who body build.</li>
            <li>and, ironically, my girlfriend uses it too and says it&#x27;s the best shampoo she&#x27;s ever used</li>
            <li>This is a very impressive product.</li>

            <li>This shampoo worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of blocking DHT with the ingredient polysorbate 80.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Lathering may be great and all, but at what expense.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and if you checkout the brand&#x27;s website it provides a ton of information for you to read.</li>
            <li>Great job guys.</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>I noticed great results.</li>
            <li>I may just be rambling now, but I just really love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this is on amazon now, because I look forward to ordering it here as soon as I run out!!</li>
            <li>Wish I could give this more than 5 stars though!!</li>
            <li>this is more like DOG SHAMPOO!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dog shampoo that smells really good</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that it has polysorbate 80 in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt make your hair feel very healthy after use.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking this for about 6 months now, and I can tell that my hair is a lot thicker and has a lot more body!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>This product is SLS free and lathers (foams) up great.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing for all hair types.</li>
            <li>but it has been a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>One, being the addition of Polysorbate 80 which effectively removes DHT from the scalp.  </li>
            <li>You just don&#x27;t require a lot of shampoo, this stuff is effective.  </li>
            <li>i purchased this product and was led to believe it smelled good and refreshing .</li>
            <li>I turn forty this year, and while I&#x27;m still doing better hair wise than a lot of my friends</li>
            <li>But I read the ingredients and was very impressed with the lack of chemicals and the benefit of all natural plant extracts.</li>
            <li>They worked great, within 2 weeks of my first bottle</li>
            <li>My hair even seems to have more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing I&#x27;d love to see it a conditioner that would help maximize volume in a healthy way.</li>
            <li>so not a terribly helpful review.</li>
            <li>My hair feels thicker and richer and there are no fabric softeners, so it&#x27;s perfect for the daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>many reviewers say it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, do an internet search and read more.</li>
            <li>So, overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product for what it has enabled me to maintain.  </li>
            <li>I have been into Body Building for many years,and have always taken supplements to enhance my workouts not thinking that it had anything to do with Hair loss...</li>
            <li>I was actually better before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loaded with healthy ingredients and has no toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>I think I got scammed:)</li>
            <li>Interesting, huh?</li>
            <li>It smells great and also leaves my hair clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this great product to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well water is pretty good at that so lets keep moving.</li>
            <li>Shampoo has a great masculine smell too it.</li>
            <li>What I got sure looks and feels like shampoo, was your bottle filled with confetti?</li>
            <li>Most importantly, though, is what this product does not contain.</li>
            <li>Guess they never thought that preventing hair thinning was a good market or something as long as their product lathered really good.  </li>
            <li>- many have significant hair loss.)</li>
            <li>Originally called &amp;#34;Bodybuilder Shampoo&amp;#34;, this shampoo is now appropriately called &amp;#</li>
            <li>I use it daily (whenever I wash my hair) and not only has it delivered as advertised it truly is a great safe healthy shampoo that has all my hair looking great.  </li>
            <li>A really easy routine that delivers results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using Man Shampoo can help men to keep their hair clean, healthy and looking</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it for a week i felt my hair is getting strong, so i replaced the shampoo from my bathroom Closet to my Gym Bag, so that i can use it after working out at my gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had always had a full head of hair for many years,and when I started showing signs of thinning hair,my wife who also is a hair stylist came home with a product kit called Nioxin..</li>
            <li>My hair dresser in LA suggested that I try this shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I started having huge issues with dandruff in which I never had before.  </li>
            <li>I had been looking for an Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair smells and feel great after daily use.</li>
            <li>, i know about Biotin, so felt comfortable and Bought</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying to find more natural products these days because I&#x27;ve noticed that I look and feel much better when I stay away from the chemical stuff that most companies sell.</li>
            <li>but they do share an important side effect if you are going to use it in a shampoo, and that is skin irritation.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this shampoo makes too much sense.</li>
            <li>So scientific research has revealed some natural products that can address the DHT accumulation issue that the makers of Man Shampoo thought was a good idea to put in a shampoo.</li>
            <li>We are trying to clean our hair and better our scalp right?</li>
            <li>A head full of hair goes great with big muscles! -John</li>
            <li>Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to high levels of 1,4-dioxane has caused vertigo, drowsiness, headache, anorexia and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs in humans.  </li>
            <li>I originally found this product from Jay Cutler&#x27;s facebook page, as I have started noticing thinning hair on my scalp and this product is supposed to help out with hair loss.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo goes on very clean and seems to have greatly slowed down my hair loss (caused by T-Therapy).  </li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best shampoo when it comes to combating male pattern baldness.</li>
            <li>All checked clean in my book.</li>
            <li>Ever felt your scalp itch and wonder why it itches when you consider yourself to be a clean person that showers every day?  </li>
            <li>One click this product right into your Amazon cart!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very good because it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh</li>
            <li>I am 61 and have always had a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 shampoos my hair was MUCH thicker and more luxurious than it has ever been.</li>
            <li>My hair feels super clean after shampooing, and I am holding on to what&#x27;s up there.</li>
            <li>I like that there is finally a product that uses all of the good elements of hair care (polysorbate 80, biotin, selenium, etc.)</li>
            <li>I saw new hairs growing where there wasn&#x27;t much hair,and I don&#x27;t lose as many hairs any more...</li>
            <li>Man Shampoo helps fight this safely and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals that can worsen hair loss but help rejuvenate growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man</li>
            <li>I have some light hair loss and was interested in trying a shampoo product.</li>
            <li>Anyone considering this product will be very pleased once they make it part of their daily shower routine!</li>
            <li>The first time i used it my scalp felt different (in a good way).  </li>
            <li>Thanks to whoever reads through my rambling of appreciation of this product!!</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, strong, and feels great.</li>
            <li>I need very little to get great lather and a fresh, clean feel after the shower.</li>
            <li>ManPoo has a great ingredient list without harsh chemicals and even block dht.</li>
            <li>So this Shampoo has many benefits for a wide range of people just wanting healthy hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo not only is free of that stuff,but contains healthy polysorbate 80, biotin, and no fragrances.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t, and that is why Man Shampoo offers benefits that so many name brand soap/shampoos can not offer.  </li>
            <li>You will feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li>Exactly as the description of the product states, this shampoo is so pure and natural, that when you use it, you can tell just how true to their word, the company is!!</li>
            <li>and my hair was strong, I rarely saw any of my hair falling out, and it was clearly thicker, fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best for your especially if your big into working out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a good choice, i didn&#x27;t liked the initial few uses, it&#x27;s not perfumed</li>
            <li>You can really tell just how much effort the company puts into their product!!</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo fellas, do not let your hard work in the gym effect that hairline, get on this.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since it was first introduced to the market.</li>
            <li>I was using Fat burning supplements ( Thermogenics) for about 2 months, in the first 2 weeks of using fat burners, i notices that i was losing lot of hair, just by shampooing and running my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li>Skeptic at first</li>
            <li>But if you take care nothing can happen and it&#x27;s absolutely a must!</li>
            <li>My first thought was, \\&quot;why isn&#x27;t this in all shampoos\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>Well first and foremost we want dirt, debris or whatever we may have been rolling around in on any given day, out of our hair.</li>
            <li>We want to basically wash the actual hair with products that will promote hair strength, growth, and regeneration on top of cleansing it.  </li>
            <li>Removing DHT from scalp tissue is critical to keeping the follicle unclogged and the hair healthy.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I only use it once per day versus the recommendation of twice.  </li>
            <li>And rightly so, because if you&#x27;re trying to keep what you&#x27;ve got or improve it, you certainly don&#x27;t want to be putting something on your scalp</li>
            <li>Regardless if you lift weights or not, this infamous hormone can interfere with the growth or thickness of your hair, which is why every guy could benefit from this awesome product!!</li>
            <li>first off it smelled just like the dog shampoo</li>
            <li>Man Shampoo is made from naturally occurring ingredients, and this is important for your scalp and your body.  </li>
            <li>the first week of March.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with bodybuilding supplements, you may have seen some of these ingredients before in fat burners and natural testosterone boosters.</li>
            <li>This is a cool product especially for those that workout frequently and want healthy hair.</li>
            <li>So all that being said, every now and then when I run out of shampoo and have to wait a couple of days because I procrastinated and waited until I actually ran out of shampoo before I ordered more, I&#x27;ll use some of my girlfriend&#x27;s high dollar stuff and notice that my hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it normally does with Man Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am an active athlete and am always involve in some kind of sports..</li>
            <li>but then I noticed my scalp was starting to be very dry,and my hair was shedding more...</li>
            <li>Everything about it seemed positive, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>When I used it the first time my scalp felt cleaner and my hair felt so much stronger.</li>
            <li>My scalp doesn&#x27;t dry out,and my hair just looks healthy again..</li>
            <li>Its very easy, take whatever shampoo you are taking currently, and swap it out for this, and you will tell a major difference!</li>
            <li>/&gt;About 4 months later, I have noticed an immense difference in my hair thickness on the top of my head, have never had any dandruff issues, and my hair feels soft and clean every time I use it!  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend ALWAYS pets my hair because she&#x27;s jealous of how soft my hair is(in the manliest of manly ways of course &amp;#62;;D), and she always wants to use my shampoo!!</li>
            <li>My first 3 bottles all of which I would have without a doubt give at minimum a high 4 star rating were a yellowish milky color.</li>
            <li>and I can really feel that my hair is cleaner.</li>
            <li>I am very cautious in what I put into my body or on my body.</li>
            <li>Thinning seems to have stopped as much as I can tell.</li>
            <li>REALLY?</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a shampoo at a very inflated price.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever because it is very concentrated.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Well, the answer is because Sodium Lauryl Sulfate causes a \\&quot;lathering\\&quot; effect which people seem to really like out of their shampoo.</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps, as I wouldn&#x27;t have taken the time to write this much about it if I didn&#x27;t like it so much.</li>
            <li>This is for any guy that wants to maintain his youthful, boyish locks while sticking to the necessities in life.</li>
            <li>Do you really want this chemical soup circulating through your body?  </li>
            <li>I did some research and realized that this shampoo was the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really think much of it and kept using the product.</li>
            <li>Why not be more target specific and add it to your shampoo and apply it directly to your target area, the scalp?</li>
            <li>at least it doesnt smell good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super picky about what in and on my body, so at first I was suspicious because the product didn&#x27;t necessarily signal &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li>Man Shampoo is very pure and natural and really leaves my hair looking good….</li>
            <li>Basically, testosterone is the primary male hormone and that high levels of testosterone</li>
            <li>I use it after working out at the gym and not only does my hair feel clean, my scalp also feels healthier.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty scary thought for any guy to lose his precious mane!!</li>
            <li>Decided to give Man Shampoo a try and over the course of a couple months, the balding slowed dramatically and new hair growth could be seen in certain areas.</li>
            <li>I continued using this product, 2 more bottles down</li>
            <li>Clever, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I highly suggest you buy it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a high quality shampoo with DHT diminishing effects this is it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended a must buy.</li>
            <li>I have DHT build up on my scalp from high testosterone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like you never really knew what clean hair felt like until you started regularly stripping the DHT off of it and achieving a truly clean scalp and hair follicles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a healthy 40 year old that still works out and likes to stay active.</li>
            <li>but you actually get your monies worth.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I have added about ten pounds of muscle and take a testosterone boosting product which is pretty much guaranteed to up the DHT in my system.</li>
            <li>have been I life long body builder and therefore my testosterone (male hormone) levels are higher than normal which can lead to hair loss (just look at the big guys in most fitness magazines</li>
            <li>My hair appears much thinner and I am noticing hair coming out much more frequently then in the past.</li>
            <li>I wanted a product that had Polysorbate 80 (a new hair loss prevention ingredient) and this shampoo has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado coming from Florida</li>
            <li>I did not even touch the fact that it prevents/stops hair lost from the infamous DHT build up that most people aren&#x27;t aware of!!</li>
            <li>&quot;, it&#x27;s a natural side effect for guys with high testosterone and a genetic predisposition.  </li>
            <li>So I did some research and come to find out that Nioxin has ingredients that actually will block your hair follicles as does so many other shampoos on the market..</li>
            <li>A complete scam!</li>
            <li>It also has a few other good ingredients (biotin, saw palmetto).</li>
            <li>Gentlemen, clean your hair and scalp properly and keep your hair, enough said.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get the perfume smell of other shampoos or the waxy feel it just feels clean.</li>
            <li>Everybody knows that our skin is a highly absorbent tissue that allows both good and bad chemicals to be absorbed into our system.  </li>
            <li>many of them noting that positive reviews are all one-timers and hence likely fakes --- suggests that the purveyor himself may be behind the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first due to the fact that noone i knew had really heard of it.  </li>
            <li>Other shampoos dry out my scalp and can cause stinging, as well as cause more stray hairs.</li>
            <li>The shampoo in this bottle is crystal clear.</li>
            <li>Being a man I am naturally paranoid about losing my hair.</li>
            <li>Not too overbearing but far from Garnier Fructis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this product again with hopes that I did just receive a batch that wasn&#x27;t properly formulated as this shampoo really did make a difference for me.</li>
            <li>Does more than just keep your hair thick if you get my drift.</li>
            <li>It smells good and using a small dime sized amount one bottle seems to last close to 5 months of daily and twice daily use</li>
            <li>Now imagine that the shampoo you are using today is chock full of inorganic chemicals designed to fluff, foam, and force your soap into acting like a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a product I highly recommend</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice that after just a few washes, your hair is left very soft with a satisfyingly clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for about six months and my hair feels thicker and stronger than it ever has as well as I&#x27;ve seen some new hair coming back.</li>
            <li>Also, the product last longer than regular shampoos since it does not require much product to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>You need not supplement with exogenous testosterone to suffer the effects of DHT accumulation in your hair follicles; that&#x27;s why you see so many 30-40 year old men that are way too thin for \\&quot;their age\\</li>
            <li>This is not a hair regrowth shampoo, it&#x27;s a loss prevention and general hair health shampoo; it is what shampoo should&#x27;ve been all along!  </li>
            <li>My hair was thinning on the top due to working out everyday.</li>
            <li>I work out hard and heavy at my gym 3 times per week, and at 57 years of age, my hair is thicker than it has been since I was in my 30&#x27;s, and my Girlfriend says it is really soft and nice to touch.</li>
            <li>We have not used it long enough to comment on any extra hair growth but we really like the natural ingredient.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t just in shampoo, it is widely used in cosmetics too, which is a whole diff topic ofwhy</li>
            <li>The lack of artificial ingredients has really restructured my hair from being coarse, horse-like bristles to the kind of hair that you want to run your hands through all day.</li>
            <li>My fourth bottle came and I was surprised to see the color had changed.</li>
            <li>I still have some left in my old bottle and will supply photos of the difference in the color.</li>
            <li>I wanted to update after reading some of the new reviews which are pathetic at best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the typical dry scalp shampoo with minimal benefit until now.    </li>
            <li>For the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been constantly shedding hair daily, scalp line has receded and I have decent balding on my crown.</li>
            <li>I think due to which my testosterone levels are very high.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced like any other designer shampoo</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a 5 star product in my book and worth paying a little extra for.</li>
            <li>This product was originally developed for Bodybuilders and other individuals who live a high-testosterone lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve occasionally used various face washes and they seem to dry my skin out too much.</li>
            <li>Since starting this shampoo about last June my shedding has stopped completely.</li>
            <li>can make you feel great, but testosterone can be broken down into other hormones.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it for the active male.</li>
            <li>My profile: Bodybuilder with high test levels, The DHT was bringing my hair down...</li>
            <li>The concept is simple: in with the good and out with the bad.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo is great!</li>
            <li> Add in the fact that the shampoo contains polysorbate 80 to fight DHT build-up - which can lead to hair loss - and that makes this a great product for me!</li>
            <li> Was really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shampoo!</li>
            <li> This company has created an excellent product and does seem to work well for men as well as men who body build.</li>
            <li> and, ironically, my girlfriend uses it too and says it&#x27;s the best shampoo she&#x27;s ever used</li>
            <li> This is a very impressive product.</li>
            <li> This product is brilliant.</li>
            <li> After three weeks I can see the difference, great product.</li>
            <li> It contains Jojoba which is a great ingredient for hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of blocking DHT with the ingredient polysorbate 80.  </li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Lathering may be great and all, but at what expense.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and if you checkout the brand&#x27;s website it provides a ton of information for you to read.</li>
            <li> Great job guys.</li>
            <li> lol.  </li>
            <li> I noticed great results.</li>
            <li> I may just be rambling now, but I just really love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this is on amazon now, because I look forward to ordering it here as soon as I run out!!</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this more than 5 stars though!!</li>
            <li> this is more like DOG SHAMPOO!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dog shampoo that smells really good</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that it has polysorbate 80 in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt make your hair feel very healthy after use.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking this for about 6 months now, and I can tell that my hair is a lot thicker and has a lot more body!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> This product is SLS free and lathers (foams) up great.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing for all hair types.</li>
            <li> but it has been a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> One, being the addition of Polysorbate 80 which effectively removes DHT from the scalp.  </li>
            <li> You just don&#x27;t require a lot of shampoo, this stuff is effective.  </li>
            <li> i purchased this product and was led to believe it smelled good and refreshing .</li>
            <li> I turn forty this year, and while I&#x27;m still doing better hair wise than a lot of my friends</li>
            <li> But I read the ingredients and was very impressed with the lack of chemicals and the benefit of all natural plant extracts.</li>
            <li> They worked great, within 2 weeks of my first bottle</li>
            <li> My hair even seems to have more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing I&#x27;d love to see it a conditioner that would help maximize volume in a healthy way.</li>
            <li> so not a terribly helpful review.</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker and richer and there are no fabric softeners, so it&#x27;s perfect for the daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> many reviewers say it is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, do an internet search and read more.</li>
            <li> So, overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product for what it has enabled me to maintain.  </li>
            <li> I have been into Body Building for many years,and have always taken supplements to enhance my workouts not thinking that it had anything to do with Hair loss...</li>
            <li> I was actually better before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loaded with healthy ingredients and has no toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> I think I got scammed:)</li>
            <li> Interesting, huh?</li>
            <li> It smells great and also leaves my hair clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this great product to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well water is pretty good at that so lets keep moving.</li>
            <li> Shampoo has a great masculine smell too it.</li>
            <li> What I got sure looks and feels like shampoo, was your bottle filled with confetti?</li>
            <li> Most importantly, though, is what this product does not contain.</li>
            <li> Guess they never thought that preventing hair thinning was a good market or something as long as their product lathered really good.  </li>
            <li> - many have significant hair loss.)</li>
            <li> Originally called &amp;#34;Bodybuilder Shampoo&amp;#34;, this shampoo is now appropriately called &amp;#</li>
            <li> I use it daily (whenever I wash my hair) and not only has it delivered as advertised it truly is a great safe healthy shampoo that has all my hair looking great.  </li>
            <li> A really easy routine that delivers results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using Man Shampoo can help men to keep their hair clean, healthy and looking</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it for a week i felt my hair is getting strong, so i replaced the shampoo from my bathroom Closet to my Gym Bag, so that i can use it after working out at my gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had always had a full head of hair for many years,and when I started showing signs of thinning hair,my wife who also is a hair stylist came home with a product kit called Nioxin..</li>
            <li> My hair dresser in LA suggested that I try this shampoo for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I started having huge issues with dandruff in which I never had before.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for an Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair smells and feel great after daily use.</li>
            <li> , i know about Biotin, so felt comfortable and Bought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying to find more natural products these days because I&#x27;ve noticed that I look and feel much better when I stay away from the chemical stuff that most companies sell.</li>
            <li> but they do share an important side effect if you are going to use it in a shampoo, and that is skin irritation.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this shampoo makes too much sense.</li>
            <li> So scientific research has revealed some natural products that can address the DHT accumulation issue that the makers of Man Shampoo thought was a good idea to put in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> We are trying to clean our hair and better our scalp right?</li>
            <li> A head full of hair goes great with big muscles! -John</li>
            <li> Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to high levels of 1,4-dioxane has caused vertigo, drowsiness, headache, anorexia and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs in humans.  </li>
            <li> I originally found this product from Jay Cutler&#x27;s facebook page, as I have started noticing thinning hair on my scalp and this product is supposed to help out with hair loss.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo goes on very clean and seems to have greatly slowed down my hair loss (caused by T-Therapy).  </li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best shampoo when it comes to combating male pattern baldness.</li>
            <li> All checked clean in my book.</li>
            <li> Ever felt your scalp itch and wonder why it itches when you consider yourself to be a clean person that showers every day?  </li>
            <li> One click this product right into your Amazon cart!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very good because it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh</li>
            <li> I am 61 and have always had a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 shampoos my hair was MUCH thicker and more luxurious than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> My hair feels super clean after shampooing, and I am holding on to what&#x27;s up there.</li>
            <li> I like that there is finally a product that uses all of the good elements of hair care (polysorbate 80, biotin, selenium, etc.)</li>
            <li> I saw new hairs growing where there wasn&#x27;t much hair,and I don&#x27;t lose as many hairs any more...</li>
            <li> Man Shampoo helps fight this safely and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals that can worsen hair loss but help rejuvenate growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man</li>
            <li> I have some light hair loss and was interested in trying a shampoo product.</li>
            <li> Anyone considering this product will be very pleased once they make it part of their daily shower routine!</li>
            <li> The first time i used it my scalp felt different (in a good way).  </li>
            <li> Thanks to whoever reads through my rambling of appreciation of this product!!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, strong, and feels great.</li>
            <li> I need very little to get great lather and a fresh, clean feel after the shower.</li>
            <li> ManPoo has a great ingredient list without harsh chemicals and even block dht.</li>
            <li> So this Shampoo has many benefits for a wide range of people just wanting healthy hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo not only is free of that stuff,but contains healthy polysorbate 80, biotin, and no fragrances.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t, and that is why Man Shampoo offers benefits that so many name brand soap/shampoos can not offer.  </li>
            <li> You will feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li> Exactly as the description of the product states, this shampoo is so pure and natural, that when you use it, you can tell just how true to their word, the company is!!</li>
            <li> and my hair was strong, I rarely saw any of my hair falling out, and it was clearly thicker, fuller and healthier.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best for your especially if your big into working out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was a good choice, i didn&#x27;t liked the initial few uses, it&#x27;s not perfumed</li>
            <li> You can really tell just how much effort the company puts into their product!!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo fellas, do not let your hard work in the gym effect that hairline, get on this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it was first introduced to the market.</li>
            <li> I was using Fat burning supplements ( Thermogenics) for about 2 months, in the first 2 weeks of using fat burners, i notices that i was losing lot of hair, just by shampooing and running my hands through my hair.</li>
            <li> Skeptic at first</li>
            <li> But if you take care nothing can happen and it&#x27;s absolutely a must!</li>
            <li> My first thought was, \\&quot;why isn&#x27;t this in all shampoos\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> Well first and foremost we want dirt, debris or whatever we may have been rolling around in on any given day, out of our hair.</li>
            <li> We want to basically wash the actual hair with products that will promote hair strength, growth, and regeneration on top of cleansing it.  </li>
            <li> Removing DHT from scalp tissue is critical to keeping the follicle unclogged and the hair healthy.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I only use it once per day versus the recommendation of twice.  </li>
            <li> And rightly so, because if you&#x27;re trying to keep what you&#x27;ve got or improve it, you certainly don&#x27;t want to be putting something on your scalp</li>
            <li> Regardless if you lift weights or not, this infamous hormone can interfere with the growth or thickness of your hair, which is why every guy could benefit from this awesome product!!</li>
            <li> first off it smelled just like the dog shampoo</li>
            <li> Man Shampoo is made from naturally occurring ingredients, and this is important for your scalp and your body.  </li>
            <li> the first week of March.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with bodybuilding supplements, you may have seen some of these ingredients before in fat burners and natural testosterone boosters.</li>
            <li> This is a cool product especially for those that workout frequently and want healthy hair.</li>
            <li> So all that being said, every now and then when I run out of shampoo and have to wait a couple of days because I procrastinated and waited until I actually ran out of shampoo before I ordered more, I&#x27;ll use some of my girlfriend&#x27;s high dollar stuff and notice that my hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it normally does with Man Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am an active athlete and am always involve in some kind of sports..</li>
            <li> but then I noticed my scalp was starting to be very dry,and my hair was shedding more...</li>
            <li> Everything about it seemed positive, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> When I used it the first time my scalp felt cleaner and my hair felt so much stronger.</li>
            <li> My scalp doesn&#x27;t dry out,and my hair just looks healthy again..</li>
            <li> Its very easy, take whatever shampoo you are taking currently, and swap it out for this, and you will tell a major difference!</li>
            <li> /&gt;About 4 months later, I have noticed an immense difference in my hair thickness on the top of my head, have never had any dandruff issues, and my hair feels soft and clean every time I use it!  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend ALWAYS pets my hair because she&#x27;s jealous of how soft my hair is(in the manliest of manly ways of course &amp;#62;;D), and she always wants to use my shampoo!!</li>
            <li> My first 3 bottles all of which I would have without a doubt give at minimum a high 4 star rating were a yellowish milky color.</li>
            <li> and I can really feel that my hair is cleaner.</li>
            <li> I am very cautious in what I put into my body or on my body.</li>
            <li> Thinning seems to have stopped as much as I can tell.</li>
            <li> REALLY?</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a shampoo at a very inflated price.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever because it is very concentrated.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Well, the answer is because Sodium Lauryl Sulfate causes a \\&quot;lathering\\&quot; effect which people seem to really like out of their shampoo.</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps, as I wouldn&#x27;t have taken the time to write this much about it if I didn&#x27;t like it so much.</li>
            <li> This is for any guy that wants to maintain his youthful, boyish locks while sticking to the necessities in life.</li>
            <li> Do you really want this chemical soup circulating through your body?  </li>
            <li> I did some research and realized that this shampoo was the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really think much of it and kept using the product.</li>
            <li> Why not be more target specific and add it to your shampoo and apply it directly to your target area, the scalp?</li>
            <li> at least it doesnt smell good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super picky about what in and on my body, so at first I was suspicious because the product didn&#x27;t necessarily signal &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to me.</li>
            <li> Man Shampoo is very pure and natural and really leaves my hair looking good….</li>
            <li> Basically, testosterone is the primary male hormone and that high levels of testosterone</li>
            <li> I use it after working out at the gym and not only does my hair feel clean, my scalp also feels healthier.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty scary thought for any guy to lose his precious mane!!</li>
            <li> Decided to give Man Shampoo a try and over the course of a couple months, the balding slowed dramatically and new hair growth could be seen in certain areas.</li>
            <li> I continued using this product, 2 more bottles down</li>
            <li> Clever, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I highly suggest you buy it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a high quality shampoo with DHT diminishing effects this is it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended a must buy.</li>
            <li> I have DHT build up on my scalp from high testosterone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like you never really knew what clean hair felt like until you started regularly stripping the DHT off of it and achieving a truly clean scalp and hair follicles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a healthy 40 year old that still works out and likes to stay active.</li>
            <li> but you actually get your monies worth.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I have added about ten pounds of muscle and take a testosterone boosting product which is pretty much guaranteed to up the DHT in my system.</li>
            <li> have been I life long body builder and therefore my testosterone (male hormone) levels are higher than normal which can lead to hair loss (just look at the big guys in most fitness magazines</li>
            <li> My hair appears much thinner and I am noticing hair coming out much more frequently then in the past.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that had Polysorbate 80 (a new hair loss prevention ingredient) and this shampoo has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I live in Colorado coming from Florida</li>
            <li> I did not even touch the fact that it prevents/stops hair lost from the infamous DHT build up that most people aren&#x27;t aware of!!</li>
            <li> &quot;, it&#x27;s a natural side effect for guys with high testosterone and a genetic predisposition.  </li>
            <li> So I did some research and come to find out that Nioxin has ingredients that actually will block your hair follicles as does so many other shampoos on the market..</li>
            <li> A complete scam!</li>
            <li> It also has a few other good ingredients (biotin, saw palmetto).</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, clean your hair and scalp properly and keep your hair, enough said.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the perfume smell of other shampoos or the waxy feel it just feels clean.</li>
            <li> Everybody knows that our skin is a highly absorbent tissue that allows both good and bad chemicals to be absorbed into our system.  </li>
            <li> many of them noting that positive reviews are all one-timers and hence likely fakes --- suggests that the purveyor himself may be behind the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first due to the fact that noone i knew had really heard of it.  </li>
            <li> Other shampoos dry out my scalp and can cause stinging, as well as cause more stray hairs.</li>
            <li> The shampoo in this bottle is crystal clear.</li>
            <li> Being a man I am naturally paranoid about losing my hair.</li>
            <li> Not too overbearing but far from Garnier Fructis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this product again with hopes that I did just receive a batch that wasn&#x27;t properly formulated as this shampoo really did make a difference for me.</li>
            <li> Does more than just keep your hair thick if you get my drift.</li>
            <li> It smells good and using a small dime sized amount one bottle seems to last close to 5 months of daily and twice daily use</li>
            <li> Now imagine that the shampoo you are using today is chock full of inorganic chemicals designed to fluff, foam, and force your soap into acting like a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a product I highly recommend</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice that after just a few washes, your hair is left very soft with a satisfyingly clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about six months and my hair feels thicker and stronger than it ever has as well as I&#x27;ve seen some new hair coming back.</li>
            <li> Also, the product last longer than regular shampoos since it does not require much product to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> You need not supplement with exogenous testosterone to suffer the effects of DHT accumulation in your hair follicles; that&#x27;s why you see so many 30-40 year old men that are way too thin for \\&quot;their age\\</li>
            <li> This is not a hair regrowth shampoo, it&#x27;s a loss prevention and general hair health shampoo; it is what shampoo should&#x27;ve been all along!  </li>
            <li> My hair was thinning on the top due to working out everyday.</li>
            <li> I work out hard and heavy at my gym 3 times per week, and at 57 years of age, my hair is thicker than it has been since I was in my 30&#x27;s, and my Girlfriend says it is really soft and nice to touch.</li>
            <li> We have not used it long enough to comment on any extra hair growth but we really like the natural ingredient.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t just in shampoo, it is widely used in cosmetics too, which is a whole diff topic ofwhy</li>
            <li> The lack of artificial ingredients has really restructured my hair from being coarse, horse-like bristles to the kind of hair that you want to run your hands through all day.</li>
            <li> My fourth bottle came and I was surprised to see the color had changed.</li>
            <li> I still have some left in my old bottle and will supply photos of the difference in the color.</li>
            <li> I wanted to update after reading some of the new reviews which are pathetic at best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the typical dry scalp shampoo with minimal benefit until now.    </li>
            <li> For the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been constantly shedding hair daily, scalp line has receded and I have decent balding on my crown.</li>
            <li> I think due to which my testosterone levels are very high.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced like any other designer shampoo</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is a 5 star product in my book and worth paying a little extra for.</li>
            <li> This product was originally developed for Bodybuilders and other individuals who live a high-testosterone lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve occasionally used various face washes and they seem to dry my skin out too much.</li>
            <li> Since starting this shampoo about last June my shedding has stopped completely.</li>
            <li> can make you feel great, but testosterone can be broken down into other hormones.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it for the active male.</li>
            <li> My profile: Bodybuilder with high test levels, The DHT was bringing my hair down...</li>
            <li> The concept is simple: in with the good and out with the bad.  </li>
            <li> Smell is very subjective, to me this has a very VERY faint scent and is fine for a men&#x27;s shampoo</li>
            <li> in the more expensive shampoos there should be only natural vegetable and herbs to get down dht and cleanse the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now over 3 weeks into this bottle I can clearly notice that this is not of the same quality as my previous bottles.</li>
            <li> He is obviously closely monitoring reviews, but his responses, like the positive reviews themselves, are cookie cutter duplications that never address the content of the negative posts.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this product really contains any of the ingrediants as advertised.</li>
            <li> As I write this I don&#x27;t know what the bottle says but I use about a nickle to a quarter sized spot of it for my entire head and a bottle lasts me a long time.  </li>
            <li> When someone recommended the product I was a little negative at first but surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> Most products that are similar but targeted to women are 10x as expensive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all slimy or perfumey as other shampoos may be, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that oily--fake feeling of hydration that those cheap chemically shampoos leave behind.</li>
            <li> I also noticed it dried up and cleared up the little bit of acne when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Quite frankly the reviews must be fake because this product is nothing like they made it sound.</li>
            <li> another plus is that it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bodybuilding for about 20 years now and was looking for a shampoo that would allow me to keep my natural hair without having to use all of the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of their products and this one knocks it out of the park.</li>
            <li> Being a bit of a gym rat body builder myself, I was reading an article written by 4X Mr Olympia Jay Cutler, who has a very thick head of hair by the way, and Jay pretty much flat out said, \\&quot;hey</li>
            <li> Now, a year later, I would not use any other product.</li>
            <li> My bottles actually last longer than the way bigger bottles of designer shampoo because I use so little.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as I can buy it!</li>
            <li> nothing was helping how dry and flaky my head became until I tried Man Shampoo after about a week</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to have issues with dry flaky scalp like I used to.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s out your hair.</li>
            <li> not live up</li>
            <li> you guys know that pro body builders supplement with exogenous testosterone at high levels and that this can have a negative affect on keeping your hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo not only has slowed down my hair loss but it feels and looks fuller.</li>
            <li> I did not see any changes from my previous shampoo after several weeks of using the item.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very dry out here</li>
            <li> I hate the idea of the alternative look that so many of my friends are sporting, I like having hair and lots of it, so this shampoo is the one for me!</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit each time and the lather it creates tackles any lingering product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a extremely holistic person, so when I cam across this, I spent hours researching every single ingredient.</li>
            <li> Go to the grocery store and see how many shampoos have cocamide and parabens and you will be shocked.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, so one bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Another naturally occurring plant additive that is included to help fight the negative effects of DHT is Saw Palmetto.</li>
            <li> should really  not use wheat protein  in this formulation</li>
            <li> Really are people too poor to afford $17 on a bottle of shampoo that lasts MONTHS???     </li>
            <li> I started using Body Builder Shampoo,and believe me,I actually started noticing the difference in just a few weeks..</li>
            <li> I started using this a few months back and let me tell you that the changes are noticeable.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say that is special about it is that it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way and lasts me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I searched endlessly for ways to &amp;#34;naturally stop or combat MPB&amp;#34; and I came across this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I thought it was extremely overrated</li>
            <li> I carried it around in my sportsbag and it is designed as a &#x27;press one side in and the other side will come up&#x27;.</li>
            <li> to both fight DHT and promote scalp and hair health, and doubt i will ever use any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The other thing to note is that nowhere in the seller&#x27;s description are any claims about preventing thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need to use a small amount for the average head of hair.</li>
            <li> I started googling about loosing hair with active bodybuilding regime, i found that some fat burners rise your Testosterone levels which may be the cause for loosing</li>
            <li> i use on my chihuahua.its not worth what i payed for it</li>
            <li> I no longer find hair in the drain after a shower, brush has less in it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Needless to say he was concerned initially about DHT levels and their contribution to male pattern baldness.</li>
            <li> This is typically an oral supplement taken to help stop the conversion of DHT in the body.</li>
            <li> Your typical grocery store shampoo contains chemicals which create an excess of DHT buildup at the hairline, which is indefinitely correlated to hair loss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad that Amazon reviewers aren&#x27;t the brightest people, you end up with garbage reviews for a decent product.</li>
            <li> But, I didn&#x27;t want all that junk that is often in other shampoos that just plain kills your hair over time.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find any sodium lauryl sulfates or other hormone disruptors that are common ingredients in other products.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thinning hair and a little of a receding hairline</li>
            <li> I had a little drying of the scalp before but it has eliminated that as well.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that since using this product, my hair does appear a little thicker but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thing for a little bit of time, and then done.</li>
            <li> After months of looking for a shampoo that is designed for balding or thinning hair and finding little to no results, i stumbled across this one.  </li>
            <li> Nothing that makes me a little worried about using it for a prolonged time frame.  </li>
            <li> I recomend it to anyone that suffers from hair loss due to high test/dht levels.</li>
            <li> was looking for a shampoo that did not have any harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Product does not work as advertised, dont waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> let it sit a few minutes while I wash the rest of me and then rinse.  </li>
            <li> DHT (dihydro-testosterone) is a converted derivative of testosterone that can become prevalent enough in scalp tissue to start causing your hair to thin.</li>
            <li> Which brings up the question of, \\&quot;What really is in everyday shampoo\\&quot;?</li>
            <li> You will see ingredients like aloe, Nettle leaf extract, Green Tea extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Inositol, ect.</li>
            <li> To my iron brothers in the gym, skip a few protein drinks and use that money to buy some of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used it for quite a few years</li>
            <li> After a month i began seeing thin hair beginning to take on color and starting to feel thicker and stronger.  </li>
            <li> It does not contain any of the harmful chemicals that can cause long term problems to your scalp or worse contribute to your hair falling out.  </li>
            <li> I notice my head not itching no more and about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I had no more flakes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that is an intended application</li>
            <li> Again, not sure what is recommended</li>
            <li> Again, internet search, don&#x27;t be lazy.</li>
            <li> No propylene glycol, no SLS, nothing harsh at all!  </li>
            <li> I am now on my fourth bottle of Man Shampoo, I am not sure what happened, whether I got a weird batch or something but the color of the shampoo itself changed.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a must have for any man over 30 to prevent or at least slow down baldness!</li>
            <li> pattern of the purveyor of this &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; shampoo product responding to each and every negative review ---</li>
            <li> Just glance at all of the info that pops up about the negative side effects of each.  </li>
            <li> Do you ever wonder how I keep my hair so thick and healthy?\\</li>
            <li> Plus my scalp just feels cleaner, probably because it&#x27;s not filled with all the crap other shampoos have in it.</li>
            <li> &quot; Just check out the EPA website if you want to read everything stated about Dioxane, but I encourage you to do a simple Google search as well; here is the EPA link: [...]  </li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo during my time in the US because I&#x27;m surring of hereditary hair loss and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Could have been worse.</li>
            <li> These days it&#x27;s hard enough to find shampoo without all the nasty chemicals that can ruin your health.</li>
            <li> but now I hate using any other shampoo</li>
            <li> , i was skeptical to buy it because of the cost and unfamiliarity of the product, but i took a chance, Because of the formula of the shampoo and the Ingredients, Biotin, Saw palmetto, Polysorbate 80.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fake product?</li>
            <li> Expensive?</li>
            <li> I have researched every ingredient and there is nothing bad in this product.</li>
            <li> you have a bad combination.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s MY shampoo and NOT hers, I selfishly have to lie to her, telling her that it&#x27;s meant for guys, and that it &amp;#34;boosts my testosterone so don&#x27;t use it or you&#x27;ll start to grow a beard.&amp;#34; HAHAHAHH!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After three weeks I can see the difference, great product. When someone recommended the product I was a little negative at first but surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it was first introduced to the market. I had been looking for an Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) free shampoo. This product is SLS free and lathers (foams) up great. I wanted a product that had Polysorbate 80 (a new hair loss prevention ingredient) and this shampoo has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been I life long body builder and therefore my testosterone (male hormone) levels are higher than normal which can lead to hair loss (just look at the big guys in most fitness magazines - many have significant hair loss.) I also use Creatine Monohydrate which has been linked to hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a shampoo that did not have any harsh chemicals. I have researched every ingredient and there is nothing bad in this product. It contains Jojoba which is a great ingredient for hair. It also has Saw Palmetto and Biotin which have both been shown to reduce hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair line has not receded any further since I started using this product and I do not see hair in the sink or in my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and I can really feel that my hair is cleaner. My hair even seems to have more body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a small amount for the average head of hair.</li>
            <li> I discovered this shampoo during my search for a quality polysorbate 80 shampoo. Being a man I am naturally paranoid about losing my hair. So I jumped at the chance to use a product that can help fight DHT build-up. Well, I have been a repeat customer ever since. This shampoo is great! I only use a little bit each time and the lather it creates tackles any lingering product in my hair. My hair is cleaner and healthier than ever. Don&#x27;t let the size of the bottle fool you either. A little goes a LONG way and lasts me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 out of 5 stars. I feel as though the emphasis of stopping the build up of DHT should be a concern for all men. Man Shampoo helps fight this safely and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have chemicals that can worsen hair loss but help rejuvenate growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man Shampoo has a great masculine smell too it. Not too overbearing but far from Garnier Fructis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d love to see it a conditioner that would help maximize volume in a healthy way. May exist but I&#x27;m looking forward to it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked great for me.  I use it after working out at the gym and not only does my hair feel clean, my scalp also feels healthier.  Add in the fact that the shampoo contains polysorbate 80 to fight DHT build-up - which can lead to hair loss - and that makes this a great product for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 6 months and I highly suggest you buy it. It does not contain any of the harmful chemicals that can cause long term problems to your scalp or worse contribute to your hair falling out.  My hair smells and feel great after daily use.</li>
            <li> I am 61 and have always had a full head of hair.  I started Testosterone therapy  last year because my T was on the low end.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed I was now starting to lose hair.  After researching it realized that DHT was the culprit probably brought on by my T&lt;br /&gt;treatments.  This shampoo has saved the day.  I no longer find hair in the drain after a shower, brush has less in it.&lt;br /&gt;And another plus is that it goes a long way.  A little dab will do ya!!&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered several times and will continue to keep it in my shower</li>
            <li> should really  not use wheat protein  in this formulation should this company,should be plenty of plant extracts  and herbs to degrease the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  in the more expensive shampoos there should be only natural vegetable and herbs to get down dht and cleanse the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  customer</li>
            <li> Been using this shampoo for over a year now. I live in Colorado coming from Florida and it&#x27;s very dry out here and I started having huge issues with dandruff in which I never had before.  I tried every dandruff shampoo on the market and nothing was helping how dry and flaky my head became until I tried Man Shampoo after about a week I notice my head not itching no more and about 2 weeks I had no more flakes.  So this Shampoo has many benefits for a wide range of people just wanting healthy hair.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best shampoo when it comes to combating male pattern baldness. MPB runs in my family, so I have to take all the proper precautions to combat this. I searched endlessly for ways to &amp;#34;naturally stop or combat MPB&amp;#34; and I came across this shampoo. I am very cautious in what I put into my body or on my body. I am a extremely holistic person, so when I cam across this, I spent hours researching every single ingredient. All checked clean in my book. I do physique modeling, so what&#x27;s the benefit of having a killer body, with thinning hair? Not in my book! I have been taking this for about 6 months now, and I can tell that my hair is a lot thicker and has a lot more body! This is a great shampoo fellas, do not let your hard work in the gym effect that hairline, get on this. Its very easy, take whatever shampoo you are taking currently, and swap it out for this, and you will tell a major difference! It&#x27;s that simple!</li>
            <li> I was using Fat burning supplements ( Thermogenics) for about 2 months, in the first 2 weeks of using fat burners, i notices that i was losing lot of hair, just by shampooing and running my hands through my hair.I started googling about loosing hair with active bodybuilding regime, i found that some fat burners rise your Testosterone levels which may be the cause for loosing hair.&lt;br /&gt;after lot of research i found MAN Shampoo, i was skeptical to buy it because of the cost and unfamiliarity of the product, but i took a chance, Because of the formula of the shampoo and the Ingredients, Biotin, Saw palmetto, Polysorbate 80.&lt;br /&gt;I was Taking Biotin supplements already, i know about Biotin, so felt comfortable and Bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good choice, i didn&#x27;t liked the initial few uses, it&#x27;s not perfumed but it&#x27;s very good because it doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week i felt my hair is getting strong, so i replaced the shampoo from my bathroom Closet to my Gym Bag, so that i can use it after working out at my gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to my Friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just finished my 2nd bottle of Man Shampoo and moving on to my third. For the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been constantly shedding hair daily, scalp line has receded and I have decent balding on my crown. Since starting this shampoo about last June my shedding has stopped completely. I also noticed it dried up and cleared up the little bit of acne when I first started using it so I wash my face and beard with it daily in the shower. Not sure if that is an intended application but it has been a nice bonus. I&#x27;ve occasionally used various face washes and they seem to dry my skin out too much. This shampoo hasn&#x27;t had that effect. It smells good and using a small dime sized amount one bottle seems to last close to 5 months of daily and twice daily use [I shower upon waking and again after the gym or any outdoor weekend projects, so probably 5-6x a week I use it 2x a day.]    Update Nov 2014... still using this and not shedding. Thinning seems to have stopped as much as I can tell. Don&#x27;t seem to have issues with dry flaky scalp like I used to. I&#x27;ve tried most of the typical dry scalp shampoo with minimal benefit until now.    I wanted to update after reading some of the new reviews which are pathetic at best. One person used it 5x and didn&#x27;t see any change... REALLY? Smell is very subjective, to me this has a very VERY faint scent and is fine for a men&#x27;s shampoo, some men&#x27;s shampoo is way too fragrant. Dog shampoo?? I&#x27;ve had dog shampoo that smells really good so not a terribly helpful review. Fake product? Really? What I got sure looks and feels like shampoo, was your bottle filled with confetti? Expensive? Really are people too poor to afford $17 on a bottle of shampoo that lasts MONTHS???     It&#x27;s sad that Amazon reviewers aren&#x27;t the brightest people, you end up with garbage reviews for a decent product.</li>
            <li> Product does not work as advertised, dont waste your money on this. overpriced do yourself and your wallet a favor and stay away from this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Was really impressed with this product. Skeptic at first but now I hate using any other shampoo this is by far the best for your especially if your big into working out. I really recommend it for the active male.</li>
            <li> This product was originally developed for Bodybuilders and other individuals who live a high-testosterone lifestyle. I purchased this product for my husband quite a while ago when he started testosterone replacement therapy. Needless to say he was concerned initially about DHT levels and their contribution to male pattern baldness. He did quite a bit of research and saw polysorbate-80 helps fight DHT buildup and when I saw this product contained it the choice was a no brainer to try. In the time my husband has been using the product not only has his hair not thinned but his hair has actually gotten thicker. Even his barber asked him what he was using. Definitely a product I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed thicker hair after using this. Plus my scalp just feels cleaner, probably because it&#x27;s not filled with all the crap other shampoos have in it.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser in LA suggested that I try this shampoo for my fine hair. I&#x27;m super picky about what in and on my body, so at first I was suspicious because the product didn&#x27;t necessarily signal &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; to me. But I read the ingredients and was very impressed with the lack of chemicals and the benefit of all natural plant extracts. Within 2 shampoos my hair was MUCH thicker and more luxurious than it has ever been. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price. Most products that are similar but targeted to women are 10x as expensive! This is a total find!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a year ago when it was called Body Builder Shampoo. My hair was thinning, and going Bald was my biggest fear. I tried Rogain for a while, but the side effects were not acceptable, so I did some searching online, and stumbled across Body Builder Shampoo. Everything about it seemed positive, so I gave it a try. Now, a year later, I would not use any other product. I use it everyday. I work out hard and heavy at my gym 3 times per week, and at 57 years of age, my hair is thicker than it has been since I was in my 30&#x27;s, and my Girlfriend says it is really soft and nice to touch. I would highly recommend this great product to anybody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Doug</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing for all hair types. Other shampoos dry out my scalp and can cause stinging, as well as cause more stray hairs. This is the perfect shampoo!</li>
            <li> I thought it was extremely overrated I went with the hype of the ratings and it&lt;br /&gt;Did not live up</li>
            <li> I use this product for two months, and during that time did not see any effect. It&#x27;s just a shampoo at a very inflated price.</li>
            <li> I have some light hair loss and was interested in trying a shampoo product. I did some research and found MAN SHAMPOO. I really like it. Great price. It lasts forever because it is very concentrated. I need very little to get great lather and a fresh, clean feel after the shower. I highly recommend this product. I was very pleased that it has polysorbate 80 in it. That was the deciding factor for me actually, as after my research found that that was a critical ingredient. If your looking for a high quality shampoo with DHT diminishing effects this is it. One click this product right into your Amazon cart!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Man Shampoo for over a year now.  I did extensive research and knew I wanted a shampoo with polysorbate 80 to fight DHT build-up.  But, I didn&#x27;t want all that junk that is often in other shampoos that just plain kills your hair over time.  I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve got thinning hair and a little of a receding hairline but this shampoo has halted the progression.  I use it daily (whenever I wash my hair) and not only has it delivered as advertised it truly is a great safe healthy shampoo that has all my hair looking great.  I had a little drying of the scalp before but it has eliminated that as well.  As I write this I don&#x27;t know what the bottle says but I use about a nickle to a quarter sized spot of it for my entire head and a bottle lasts me a long time.  Again, not sure what is recommended but I lather up then let it sit a few minutes while I wash the rest of me and then rinse.  A really easy routine that delivers results.</li>
            <li> My profile: Bodybuilder with high test levels, The DHT was bringing my hair down... Since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo I managed to save my hair.  It smells great and also leaves my hair clean and fresh.  I recomend it to anyone that suffers from hair loss due to high test/dht levels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bodybuilding for about 20 years now and was looking for a shampoo that would allow me to keep my natural hair without having to use all of the harsh chemicals. This company has created an excellent product and does seem to work well for men as well as men who body build.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo during my time in the US because I&#x27;m surring of hereditary hair loss and thin hair. I often had to scratch my scalp a lot and with man shampoo these problems are gone. My hair feels thicker and richer and there are no fabric softeners, so it&#x27;s perfect for the daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing which I would recommend to change is the closing flap of the bottle. I carried it around in my sportsbag and it is designed as a &#x27;press one side in and the other side will come up&#x27;. So the bottle was opened accidentely at some times and it leaked. But if you take care nothing can happen and it&#x27;s absolutely a must!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  This shampoo goes on very clean and seems to have greatly slowed down my hair loss (caused by T-Therapy).  Does a great job of blocking DHT with the ingredient polysorbate 80.  Also, the product last longer than regular shampoos since it does not require much product to wash my hair.  This shampoo is a must have for any man over 30 to prevent or at least slow down baldness!</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. Joke of a product. No scientific basis whatsoever. Every 5 star review is written by reviewrs with only review. Hmmmm?  In summary, a garbage product backed up by garbage reviews. What a scam.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s out your hair. I had to stop using it, was turning my hair into straw. Maybe it will work for you but it didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Saw this product and thought I give it a try, i am one that always like to read how others felt about the product and thought it might work for me. I was not please the results, matter fact I did not see any changes from my previous shampoo after several weeks of using the item. I would not recommend anyone buying it in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> We like this shampoo and have no complaints. We have not used it long enough to comment on any extra hair growth but we really like the natural ingredient.</li>
            <li> This looks / reads like the SCAM many reviewers say it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pattern of the purveyor of this &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; shampoo product responding to each and every negative review --- many of them noting that positive reviews are all one-timers and hence likely fakes --- suggests that the purveyor himself may be behind the positive reviews.  He is obviously closely monitoring reviews, but his responses, like the positive reviews themselves, are cookie cutter duplications that never address the content of the negative posts.</li>
            <li> I started using Man Shampoo about 4 months ago and I really like it. I&#x27;m always trying to find more natural products these days because I&#x27;ve noticed that I look and feel much better when I stay away from the chemical stuff that most companies sell. Man Shampoo is very pure and natural and really leaves my hair looking good…. and, ironically, my girlfriend uses it too and says it&#x27;s the best shampoo she&#x27;s ever used lol</li>
            <li> These days it&#x27;s hard enough to find shampoo without all the nasty chemicals that can ruin your health. This shampoo not only is free of that stuff,but contains healthy polysorbate 80, biotin, and no fragrances. My hair feels super clean after shampooing, and I am holding on to what&#x27;s up there. Go to the grocery store and see how many shampoos have cocamide and parabens and you will be shocked. I have been using Man Shampoo for six months and it&#x27;s great. You only need a small amount, so one bottle lasts a long time. Buy one for home, and one for your gym bag. You will feel the difference right away.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when it was called BodyBuilder Shampoo. Being a bit of a gym rat body builder myself, I was reading an article written by 4X Mr Olympia Jay Cutler, who has a very thick head of hair by the way, and Jay pretty much flat out said, \\&quot;hey you guys know that pro body builders supplement with exogenous testosterone at high levels and that this can have a negative affect on keeping your hair. Do you ever wonder how I keep my hair so thick and healthy?\\&quot; Then he said to check out BodyBuilder Shampoo and went on to say that he agreed with the scientific statements made by the company.  Basically, testosterone is the primary male hormone and that high levels of testosterone can make you feel great, but testosterone can be broken down into other hormones. DHT (dihydro-testosterone) is a converted derivative of testosterone that can become prevalent enough in scalp tissue to start causing your hair to thin. That and a genetic predisposition for baldness and you have a bad combination. You need not supplement with exogenous testosterone to suffer the effects of DHT accumulation in your hair follicles; that&#x27;s why you see so many 30-40 year old men that are way too thin for \\&quot;their age\\&quot;, it&#x27;s a natural side effect for guys with high testosterone and a genetic predisposition.  So scientific research has revealed some natural products that can address the DHT accumulation issue that the makers of Man Shampoo thought was a good idea to put in a shampoo. One, being the addition of Polysorbate 80 which effectively removes DHT from the scalp.  My first thought was, \\&quot;why isn&#x27;t this in all shampoos\\&quot;? We put fluoride in tap water but can&#x27;t put something in shampoo to help stop male pattern baldness? We are washing our hair aren&#x27;t we? .... or are we? Which brings up the question of, \\&quot;What really is in everyday shampoo\\&quot;? Go to your bathroom and see if your shampoo has some or all of these toxic chemicals: Dioxane, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (or SLS), and Propylene Glycol(also called 1,2-dihydroxypropane, 1,2-propanediol, methyl glycol, and trimethyl glycol). But don&#x27;t stop there, go back to your computer and type in each chemical. Just glance at all of the info that pops up about the negative side effects of each.  Dioxane- known carcinogen! This is what the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has to say about Dioxane:  \\&quot;1,4-Dioxane is used as a solvent.  Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to high levels of 1,4-dioxane has caused vertigo, drowsiness, headache, anorexia and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, and lungs in humans.  It may also irritate the skin.  Damage to the liver and kidneys has been observed in rats chronically (long-term) exposed in their drinking water\\&quot;......\\&quot;Tumors have been observed in orally exposed animals.  EPA has classified 1,4-dioxane as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.\\&quot; Just check out the EPA website if you want to read everything stated about Dioxane, but I encourage you to do a simple Google search as well; here is the EPA link: [...]  Now, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Propylene Glycol aren&#x27;t listed as proven carcinogens but they do share an important side effect if you are going to use it in a shampoo, and that is skin irritation. Again, do an internet search and read more. Why would these be included in shampoo if they can irritate skin? We are trying to clean our hair and better our scalp right? Well, the answer is because Sodium Lauryl Sulfate causes a \\&quot;lathering\\&quot; effect which people seem to really like out of their shampoo. It makes soapy, into lathery. Lathering may be great and all, but at what expense. Ever felt your scalp itch and wonder why it itches when you consider yourself to be a clean person that showers every day?  Propylene Glycol, again, non carcinogenic, but also has irritant side effects. Again, internet search, don&#x27;t be lazy. Propylene Glycol can cause skin allergies. This stuff isn&#x27;t just in shampoo, it is widely used in cosmetics too, which is a whole diff topic ofwhy it shouldn&#x27;t be in cosmetics.  So, now that we have an idea of what we don&#x27;t want in our shampoo, now we have to decide what is actually beneficial in a man&#x27;s shampoo. Well, lets just get basic; what are our goals when we wash our hair? What does a man need out of a shampoo? Well first and foremost we want dirt, debris or whatever we may have been rolling around in on any given day, out of our hair. Well water is pretty good at that so lets keep moving. We want to basically wash the actual hair with products that will promote hair strength, growth, and regeneration on top of cleansing it.  Removing DHT from scalp tissue is critical to keeping the follicle unclogged and the hair healthy. Man Shampoo also has biotin and panthenol (pro-vitamin B5) in it which can help to increase thickness, texture and body of the hair strands.  Another naturally occurring plant additive that is included to help fight the negative effects of DHT is Saw Palmetto. This is typically an oral supplement taken to help stop the conversion of DHT in the body. Why not be more target specific and add it to your shampoo and apply it directly to your target area, the scalp? Honestly, this shampoo makes too much sense. What have the big shampoo manufacturers been doing all this time? Guess they never thought that preventing hair thinning was a good market or something as long as their product lathered really good.  I&#x27;m not going to go through every ingredient, yes ingredient not chemical, that is in Man Shampoo, but if you take a look at the rest of the ingredients, you will notice that they are all derived from plants and are not some manufactured chemical that may be harmful to you. You will see ingredients like aloe, Nettle leaf extract, Green Tea extract, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Inositol, ect. If you are familiar with bodybuilding supplements, you may have seen some of these ingredients before in fat burners and natural testosterone boosters. Hey lets nourish and  build our hair just like we do our muscles, and do it without DHT and losing our hair! This is not a hair regrowth shampoo, it&#x27;s a loss prevention and general hair health shampoo; it is what shampoo should&#x27;ve been all along!  So all that being said, every now and then when I run out of shampoo and have to wait a couple of days because I procrastinated and waited until I actually ran out of shampoo before I ordered more, I&#x27;ll use some of my girlfriend&#x27;s high dollar stuff and notice that my hair just doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it normally does with Man Shampoo. It&#x27;s almost like you never really knew what clean hair felt like until you started regularly stripping the DHT off of it and achieving a truly clean scalp and hair follicles. I have noticed that since using this product, my hair does appear a little thicker but that&#x27;s probably because it is healthier than it used to be.  Anyway, this is a 5 star product in my book and worth paying a little extra for. It is reasonably priced like any other designer shampoo but you actually get your monies worth.  Oh ya and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of shampoo each time you shower. Depending on your hair length, use an amount the size of a dime or quarter. My bottles actually last longer than the way bigger bottles of designer shampoo because I use so little. You just don&#x27;t require a lot of shampoo, this stuff is effective.  I hope this review helps, as I wouldn&#x27;t have taken the time to write this much about it if I didn&#x27;t like it so much. Gentlemen, clean your hair and scalp properly and keep your hair, enough said. To my iron brothers in the gym, skip a few protein drinks and use that money to buy some of this shampoo. A head full of hair goes great with big muscles! -John</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about a year, and while I can&#x27;t say that it brought back my hair, I can say that I haven&#x27;t noticed it getting any thinner. On top of that, I only use it once per day versus the recommendation of twice.  Additionally, I have added about ten pounds of muscle and take a testosterone boosting product which is pretty much guaranteed to up the DHT in my system. So, overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product for what it has enabled me to maintain.  Most importantly, though, is what this product does not contain. You won&#x27;t find any sodium lauryl sulfates or other hormone disruptors that are common ingredients in other products. And rightly so, because if you&#x27;re trying to keep what you&#x27;ve got or improve it, you certainly don&#x27;t want to be putting something on your scalp that is contrary to this effort!</li>
            <li> I have been into Body Building for many years,and have always taken supplements to enhance my workouts not thinking that it had anything to do with Hair loss...I had always had a full head of hair for many years,and when I started showing signs of thinning hair,my wife who also is a hair stylist came home with a product kit called Nioxin..I used it for quite a few years and it did seem to work for a while,but then I noticed my scalp was starting to be very dry,and my hair was shedding more...So I did some research and come to find out that Nioxin has ingredients that actually will block your hair follicles as does so many other shampoos on the market..So I once again researched the internet and came across a Shampoo called Body Builder Shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have the harmful ingredients that block hair follicles in which lead to hair loss...I started using Body Builder Shampoo,and believe me,I actually started noticing the difference in just a few weeks..I saw new hairs growing where there wasn&#x27;t much hair,and I don&#x27;t lose as many hairs any more...My scalp doesn&#x27;t dry out,and my hair just looks healthy again..I truly believe that if you are thinning on your hairline,or just don&#x27;t want to,you should try this shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have the Sulfates for ingredients,because in time as you age,that will start blocking your hair follicles,and you will start seeing hair loss...Body Builder Shampoo works...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Testosterone Replacement for a year and noticed my hair seemed weaker, especially since i had been seeing hair loss. Decided to give Man Shampoo a try and over the course of a couple months, the balding slowed dramatically and new hair growth could be seen in certain areas. Upon further research, the Polysorbate 80 found in the shampoo has been found to decrease DHT, which is a result of Testosterone therapy. Anyone considering this product will be very pleased once they make it part of their daily shower routine! And the scent is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping A+&lt;br /&gt;Cost A+&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness A+</li>
            <li> Originally called &amp;#34;Bodybuilder Shampoo&amp;#34;, this shampoo is now appropriately called &amp;#34;Man Shampoo&amp;#34;. For me, this is the ONLY shampoo that I ever use and ever NEED/WANT to use. Exactly as the description of the product states, this shampoo is so pure and natural, that when you use it, you can tell just how true to their word, the company is!! It&#x27;s not all slimy or perfumey as other shampoos may be, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that oily--fake feeling of hydration that those cheap chemically shampoos leave behind. You&#x27;ll notice that after just a few washes, your hair is left very soft with a satisfyingly clean feeling. My girlfriend ALWAYS pets my hair because she&#x27;s jealous of how soft my hair is(in the manliest of manly ways of course &amp;#62;;D), and she always wants to use my shampoo!! Because it&#x27;s MY shampoo and NOT hers, I selfishly have to lie to her, telling her that it&#x27;s meant for guys, and that it &amp;#34;boosts my testosterone so don&#x27;t use it or you&#x27;ll start to grow a beard.&amp;#34; HAHAHAHH!!! I may just be rambling now, but I just really love this shampoo!! I did not even touch the fact that it prevents/stops hair lost from the infamous DHT build up that most people aren&#x27;t aware of!! It&#x27;s a pretty scary thought for any guy to lose his precious mane!! Regardless if you lift weights or not, this infamous hormone can interfere with the growth or thickness of your hair, which is why every guy could benefit from this awesome product!! I&#x27;m so glad this is on amazon now, because I look forward to ordering it here as soon as I run out!! You can really tell just how much effort the company puts into their product!! Thanks to whoever reads through my rambling of appreciation of this product!! Wish I could give this more than 5 stars though!!</li>
            <li> My hair was thinning on the top due to working out everyday. I am an active athlete and am always involve in some kind of sports..I think due to which my testosterone levels are very high. Testosterone creates DHT on the scalp  which thins hair..I have seen my hair grow back after i started using this shampoo...will continue using it..</li>
            <li> This product is brilliant. I&#x27;ve been a long time fan of their products and this one knocks it out of the park. This is for any guy that wants to maintain his youthful, boyish locks while sticking to the necessities in life. The lack of artificial ingredients has really restructured my hair from being coarse, horse-like bristles to the kind of hair that you want to run your hands through all day. It&#x27;s not an overnight, miracle difference, but stick with it and you&#x27;ll notice the changes.</li>
            <li> MAN shampoo??? this is more like DOG SHAMPOO!! i purchased this product and was led to believe it smelled good and refreshing . first off it smelled just like the dog shampoo i use on my chihuahua.its not worth what i payed for it either.i would not recommend this to anyone unless you have animals.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product looking for results since I had read the reviews on it. Quite frankly the reviews must be fake because this product is nothing like they made it sound. It&#x27;s horrible. The odor is horrendous. It doesn&#x27;t work I have before and after pictures to prove it. I was actually better before. DO NOT BUY! Save your money. A complete scam!</li>
            <li> From my reading I learned that help target dht buildup you should include polysorbate 80 - which Man shampoo has. It also has a few other good ingredients (biotin, saw palmetto). It&#x27;s now part of my daily routine!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and if you checkout the brand&#x27;s website it provides a ton of information for you to read. It&#x27;s loaded with healthy ingredients and has no toxic chemicals. When I used it the first time my scalp felt cleaner and my hair felt so much stronger. My hair became thicker and healthier. This is a cool product especially for those that workout frequently and want healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Does more than just keep your hair thick if you get my drift. Heh heh heh. Highly recommended a must buy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo not only has slowed down my hair loss but it feels and looks fuller. I have DHT build up on my scalp from high testosterone and this is working wonders to help eliminate a lot of my problem.  I would definately tell my friends about this. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is a very impressive product. Coming from a family with a history of male pattern baldness I have done extensive research looking for preventative measures. Your typical grocery store shampoo contains chemicals which create an excess of DHT buildup at the hairline, which is indefinitely correlated to hair loss. ManPoo has a great ingredient list without harsh chemicals and even block dht. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and have noticed my hair has thickened and looks healthier!</li>
            <li> I turn forty this year, and while I&#x27;m still doing better hair wise than a lot of my friends I&#x27;ve noticed that it is not what it used to be. I started using this a few months back and let me tell you that the changes are noticeable. My hair is thick, strong, and feels great. The shampoo advises leaving it on the scalp to do it&#x27;s thing for a little bit of time, and then done. It works so well that I&#x27;m on to this forever. I hate the idea of the alternative look that so many of my friends are sporting, I like having hair and lots of it, so this shampoo is the one for me!</li>
            <li> Man Shampoo is made from naturally occurring ingredients, and this is important for your scalp and your body.  Everybody knows that our skin is a highly absorbent tissue that allows both good and bad chemicals to be absorbed into our system.  Now imagine that the shampoo you are using today is chock full of inorganic chemicals designed to fluff, foam, and force your soap into acting like a shampoo.  Do you really want this chemical soup circulating through your body?  I don&#x27;t, and that is why Man Shampoo offers benefits that so many name brand soap/shampoos can not offer.  Do you scalp AND your body a favor- use Man Shampoo!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a healthy 40 year old that still works out and likes to stay active. Loosing my hair was not what I wanted so I did some checking and found Man Shampoo. I read that it has polysorbate 80 to fight DHT build-up but all I cared about was keeping hair on my head. I&#x27;ve used it for about six months and my hair feels thicker and stronger than it ever has as well as I&#x27;ve seen some new hair coming back. You don&#x27;t get the perfume smell of other shampoos or the waxy feel it just feels clean. My barber has even noticed a change and wanted to know what happened. Give it a try and decide for your self</li>
            <li> After months of looking for a shampoo that is designed for balding or thinning hair and finding little to no results, i stumbled across this one.  I was sceptical at first due to the fact that noone i knew had really heard of it.  I did some research and realized that this shampoo was the real deal.  The concept is simple: in with the good and out with the bad.  The first time i used it my scalp felt different (in a good way).  After a month i began seeing thin hair beginning to take on color and starting to feel thicker and stronger.  I like that there is finally a product that uses all of the good elements of hair care (polysorbate 80, biotin, selenium, etc.) to both fight DHT and promote scalp and hair health, and doubt i will ever use any other shampoo.  Body by Uprising has hit a home run with this one.  Great job guys.</li>
            <li> I originally found this product from Jay Cutler&#x27;s facebook page, as I have started noticing thinning hair on my scalp and this product is supposed to help out with hair loss.  Ordered 4 bottles immediately.  This was around the time that I started caring what chemicals were in my products as well, so when they showed up and I checked the ingredients, I was overjoyed!  No propylene glycol, no SLS, nothing harsh at all!  Nothing that makes me a little worried about using it for a prolonged time frame.  And it smells awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 4 months later, I have noticed an immense difference in my hair thickness on the top of my head, have never had any dandruff issues, and my hair feels soft and clean every time I use it!  I will continue to use this product as long as I can buy it!</li>
            <li> I think I got scammed:) lol.  Doesnt make your hair feel very healthy after use.  And it has no smell, or at least it doesnt smell good. I am not sure if this product really contains any of the ingrediants as advertised. Oh well, I only lost 18 bucks.  Could have been worse.</li>
            <li> Used this about 5 times and every time find lots of hair in the drain, seems to have the same effects as a $3.00 bottle of shampoo, can&#x27;t go by reviews all the time.</li>
            <li> Interesting, huh? The other thing to note is that nowhere in the seller&#x27;s description are any claims about preventing thinning hair.  Those claims are in the reviews.  Clever, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, the only claim the seller makes is:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The Benefits of Man Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Using Man Shampoo can help men to keep their hair clean, healthy and looking good.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually purchased this and tried it.  The only thing I can say that is special about it is that it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> I am now on my fourth bottle of Man Shampoo, I am not sure what happened, whether I got a weird batch or something but the color of the shampoo itself changed. My first 3 bottles all of which I would have without a doubt give at minimum a high 4 star rating were a yellowish milky color. They worked great, within 2 weeks of my first bottle I noticed great results. I continued using this product, 2 more bottles down and my hair was strong, I rarely saw any of my hair falling out, and it was clearly thicker, fuller and healthier. My fourth bottle came and I was surprised to see the color had changed. The shampoo in this bottle is crystal clear. I didn&#x27;t really think much of it and kept using the product. Now over 3 weeks into this bottle I can clearly notice that this is not of the same quality as my previous bottles. My hair appears much thinner and I am noticing hair coming out much more frequently then in the past. I am overseas at the moment and return home back to the US the first week of March. I still have some left in my old bottle and will supply photos of the difference in the color. I will be purchasing this product again with hopes that I did just receive a batch that wasn&#x27;t properly formulated as this shampoo really did make a difference for me. If not, I will be spending my money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Contains Fragrance, and the company refuses to answer my questions about it contents !</li>
