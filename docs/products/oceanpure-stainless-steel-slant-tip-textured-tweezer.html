            <li>I am so delighted with them.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are as good as tweezerman at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>These are good for thicker hairs, not as good on the finer hairs.</li>

            <li>The carrying case is a nice bonus as well.</li>
            <li>They come with a nice fabric case too, so maybe I will be able to keep these nice.  </li>
            <li>A super, great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Liked it so well, I ordered more as gifts</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the price!  </li>
            <li>I also love that they come with a nice carrying case to protect them and also make them easy to find when carrying them in my  purse.  </li>
            <li>Build quality is top notch and even comes with a textured pain finish which is quite nice and makes it easy to grip.  </li>

            <li>I lost a pair of tweezers that successfully pulled unwanted hairs (from wherever) at first try.  </li>
            <li>Better off with a $2 tweezer from any pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there is better out there</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like at first but good product does the job.  </li>
            <li>Bought this because Amazon didn&#x27;t have the cheapo ones - but the quality is superior and it seems to be lasting a good while too.</li>
            <li>So far this gets 5 stars, and has a great feel and size.</li>
            <li>If you are using a mirror, it&#x27;s quite easy to draw blood.  </li>
            <li>but no longer grasps my fine chin hairs.</li>
            <li>They grip fine hairs well.</li>
            <li>The price was great, especially with Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as tweezermans, but a close second and for the price, I am very surprised how good they are.</li>
            <li>These worked perfectly, their first test was a couple of splinters, they gripped well and saved me (with help from my Hubby) from foreign objects under my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the grip on the handle, and the fact that they come in a nice bag, but I have not had good success actually grabbing hairs with these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>never liked slants, but these r awesome!!!</li>
            <li>love it and love the blue color.</li>
            <li>great little tweezer.  </li>
            <li>than that, they grip wonderfully, and I&#x27;ve had no problem with broken hair.</li>
            <li>Since most facial hair is removed with tweezers by using a mirror, unintended scratches tend to happen until you get familiar with the tweezers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ends meet just right).</li>
            <li>I took a flier on this litte item but it did me right.  </li>
            <li>These are great tweezers compared to ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li>Worked wonders at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying to find the type of tweezers extract hairs at first try.</li>
            <li>It has a slight slanted tip that accurately grasps most things.</li>
            <li>The tweezers is sharp &amp; effective.</li>
            <li>With these I can pretty much pull out any errant hair.  </li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, it performs like its pricier bretheren.  </li>
            <li>these turned out 2 b better than i expected.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realize the size of these were so big, definitely have good use for them but not for what I initially bought for...</li>
            <li>The grips are textured so they are easy to hold on and don&#x27;t slip when trying to use them with wet hands.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about my tweezers, I love these, they are heavy duty with a slant tip.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This situation told me that I really do deserve new tweezers, and to hide them next time.</li>
            <li>These tweezers, used primarily for removing splinters and related tasks, do just that - perform as expected.</li>
            <li>They work as expected, are well made, and economical.</li>
            <li>The contact area at the tip is large and honed well, so it&#x27;s easy to grab small objects solidly from any angle/position.  </li>
            <li>They work terrifically because they have such fine, sharp tips.  </li>
            <li>Nice tweezers, gets the job done and hurts less than my old pair, comes in nice little carry pouch for travel, easy to grip as well, nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend for facial hair</li>
            <li>This is a very solid, high quality tweezer.  </li>
            <li>Had higher expectations based on other reviews.</li>
            <li>this is my second order of the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comparable products cost twice as much at your local wal-mart.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and exact.  </li>
            <li>I recently awoke to find my favorite tweezers on the dining room table (a little less tweezy than I remembered) and my lil bro crashed out nearby.</li>
            <li>very sharp, very versatile and can pick individual hairs.</li>

            <li> Hard to get excited about a simple pair of tweezers that perform their expected task.</li>
            <li> On the other hand,  pulling/grabbing straggler hairs from eyebrows or under/around chin could take several efforts to extract, despite the tipped angle I use.  </li>
            <li> The widened middle along with the slightly pebbled surface helps fingers to grasp the tweezer without slipping.</li>
            <li> Just not very pretty or nice-feeling in your hand.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sharp tweezers.</li>
            <li> I bought several pairs, to use sorting small parts and picking out rejects.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the edges of the steel tips are quite sharp.  </li>
            <li> the edges are very sharp, which does help quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, Bite the bullet and spend the money for a Tweezerman Tweezers.</li>
            <li> This tweezer does not grip your hair, and even on the few occurrences when it does, it just slices your hair and leaves it shorter than it was.</li>
            <li> Very precise, gets from the base of the hair, no breakage!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the feel of the textured material, even though it may provide some grip.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on Tweezerman, and go with these!</li>
            <li> Really does a terrible job of pulling hair out.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> well made, great value.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my tweezerman tweezers, which had bent.  Since the tweezermans condition was my fault, I did not think they would replace them nor did I try.  I have used these once and they are really good.  Tweezermans are over $20 and these are under $4, so they are quite a bargain too.  They come with a nice fabric case too, so maybe I will be able to keep these nice.  They do the job well.  Not quite as good as tweezermans, but a close second and for the price, I am very surprised how good they are.</li>
            <li> excellent product for the price. the edges are very sharp, which does help quite a bit. this is my second order of the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comparable products cost twice as much at your local wal-mart. couldn&#x27;t possibly tell someone not to buy this set.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sharp tweezers. This is not. Don&#x27;t waste your money, Bite the bullet and spend the money for a Tweezerman Tweezers.</li>
            <li> I recently awoke to find my favorite tweezers on the dining room table (a little less tweezy than I remembered) and my lil bro crashed out nearby. This situation told me that I really do deserve new tweezers, and to hide them next time. These worked perfectly, their first test was a couple of splinters, they gripped well and saved me (with help from my Hubby) from foreign objects under my skin. Next test was the uni-brow...they passed with flying colors. The price was great, especially with Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> These are awesome tweezers. Very precise, gets from the base of the hair, no breakage! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the feel of the textured material, even though it may provide some grip. Just not very pretty or nice-feeling in your hand. But definitely good tweezers.</li>
            <li> These are awesome and work great!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> So far this gets 5 stars, and has a great feel and size. Comfortable to hold and use. Well honed and works perfect(the ends meet just right). Feels well-made. Looks good, but, it is a tweezer after all. Good price and one does not pay for the name. I&#x27;ll update if this changes. I recommend this tweezer, would buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> What to say? They are tweezers just as pictured. They work as expected, are well made, and economical. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great price great quality. I would recommend to anyone. The tweezers is sharp &amp; effective. I like the textured handle too.</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about a simple pair of tweezers that perform their expected task. These tweezers, used primarily for removing splinters and related tasks, do just that - perform as expected. I would rate them an additional star except that I reserve the highest rating for a products that excels in some manner.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders at first but no longer grasps my fine chin hairs. Maybe it got rusted from when I rinsed it with water.</li>
            <li> With these I can pretty much pull out any errant hair.  I was leary on the price, but don&#x27;t be.  Great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for the price!  Must cheaper than Tweezerman!</li>
            <li> My younger brother kept stealing my tweezers to pluck his unibrow so I have him these for Xmas and he loves them</li>
            <li> they open only about a quarter of an inch, but that&#x27;s enough. very sharp, very versatile and can pick individual hairs. love it and love the blue color.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife and daughters. They say they are great!</li>
            <li> These have to be one of the sharpest pair of tweezers that I have ever bought.  They work terrifically because they have such fine, sharp tips.  The grips are textured so they are easy to hold on and don&#x27;t slip when trying to use them with wet hands.  I also love that they come with a nice carrying case to protect them and also make them easy to find when carrying them in my  purse.  A super, great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Super good! Gets the roots of dem hairs real nice</li>
            <li> I bought two of these and now I wish I had bought more! They are fantastic and I am delightfully suprized at their craftmanship and how easy they are to use. They do not cramp up my fingers and they do grasp even the tiniest of pieces. I am so delighted with them.</li>
            <li> I took a flier on this litte item but it did me right.  Very inexpensive, it performs like its pricier bretheren.  Build quality is top notch and even comes with a textured pain finish which is quite nice and makes it easy to grip.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on Tweezerman, and go with these!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are as good as tweezerman at a fraction of the price. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers compared to ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  I have no complaints--they were inexpensive and are great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Nice tweezers, gets the job done and hurts less than my old pair, comes in nice little carry pouch for travel, easy to grip as well, nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> these turned out 2 b better than i expected. never liked slants, but these r awesome!!! would highly recommend for facial hair</li>
            <li> These are well-crafted metal tweezers. It has a slight slanted tip that accurately grasps most things. The widened middle along with the slightly pebbled surface helps fingers to grasp the tweezer without slipping. The tweezers comes in a pouch within a box for safe keeping. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great little tweezer.  does the job it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li> Nice set of tweezers.  I bought several pairs, to use sorting small parts and picking out rejects.  These are good quality with a nice grip texture.  Nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and exact.  Can pinch so be careful.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work great!</li>
            <li> DO NOT RECOMMEND. This tweezer does not grip your hair, and even on the few occurrences when it does, it just slices your hair and leaves it shorter than it was. Absolutely horrible.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was in need of tweezers.  I use them to remove facial hair. They do an excellent job of gripping even the finest eyebrow hair-so I am very pleased.  I gave it four stars because the edges of the steel tips are quite sharp.  If you are using a mirror, it&#x27;s quite easy to draw blood.  Since most facial hair is removed with tweezers by using a mirror, unintended scratches tend to happen until you get familiar with the tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;other than that, they grip wonderfully, and I&#x27;ve had no problem with broken hair.</li>
            <li> Had these for about 3 months. These are good for thicker hairs, not as good on the finer hairs. Had higher expectations based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  The tweezers didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about my tweezers, I love these, they are heavy duty with a slant tip.  I use them on my eyebrows and they work perfectly, I keep them in my purse and one in my bathroom.  Great product</li>
            <li> These tweezers come in an adorable case and the color/texture of how their made is absolutely beautiful.  On the other hand,  pulling/grabbing straggler hairs from eyebrows or under/around chin could take several efforts to extract, despite the tipped angle I use.  At times, I cannot extract the hair(s) at all.  I lost a pair of tweezers that successfully pulled unwanted hairs (from wherever) at first try.  I&#x27;ll keep trying to find the type of tweezers extract hairs at first try.</li>
            <li> Really does a terrible job of pulling hair out.  Better off with a $2 tweezer from any pharmacy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the size of these were so big, definitely have good use for them but not for what I initially bought for...Still satisified w the product</li>
            <li> Just great, does what it has to do with precision at the 1st attempt.</li>
            <li> Bought this because Amazon didn&#x27;t have the cheapo ones - but the quality is superior and it seems to be lasting a good while too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like at first but good product does the job.  Use it for eyebrows only.  I&#x27;m sure there is better out there but for the price it works well enough for me.</li>
            <li> They grip fine hairs well.</li>
            <li> Liked it so well, I ordered more as gifts</li>
            <li> Just okay. Hairs slip out sometimes.</li>
            <li> This is a very solid, high quality tweezer.  The contact area at the tip is large and honed well, so it&#x27;s easy to grab small objects solidly from any angle/position.  The body of the tweezer is nicely textured so it doesn&#x27;t slip.  The carrying case is a nice bonus as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I would purchase these again.  I really like the grip on the handle, and the fact that they come in a nice bag, but I have not had good success actually grabbing hairs with these tweezers.  I spend a lot of time pinching at the hairs, only to have the tweezers not grip them firmly enough to pull them out. Disappointed.</li>
