            <li> /&gt;Delivery time was almost 1 month, due to custom process.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> , I guess I didn&#x27;t read correctly and never realized they were so small.</li>
            <li> once you use the blow dryer it makes it impossible to comb through, impossible, I even proceeded to use step 3 and that did not work at all</li>
            <li> and im wondering whats wrong with this product, because it has a terrible smell that doesn&#x27;t go away</li>

            <li> Ok, but very time consuming and does not last long.</li>
            <li> I loved!!!! After watch some videos on YouTube makes easy to do it my self. The 3 hrs totally worth it now I have straight and shine hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Amazing products I love those!</li>
            <li> My sister had her had done at a salon in Brazil with this product. It looked amazing. Her hair is very curly, and after that her hair is straight, shiny, no need of iron. I bought it online and im wondering whats wrong with this product, because it has a terrible smell that doesn&#x27;t go away and it made my hair so dry. I washed mynhair more than 10 times and I still smell paprika. Terrible!!</li>
            <li> There was no problem with the product, but with custom.&lt;br /&gt;I had to pay additional custom fees, vat. So the total order was almost the double amount.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time was almost 1 month, due to custom process.&lt;br /&gt;At the end it was worth to had bought it in Europe.</li>
            <li> The worst Keratin treatment ever. I have had treatments done by professionals and those I did myself but this one disappointed me especially when Alfaparf is such a reputable and well known salon product.&lt;br /&gt;The step 1 shampoo leaves an amazing feeling of softness in your hair, step 2, Keratin, super soft but once you use the blow dryer it makes it impossible to comb through, impossible, I even proceeded to use step 3 and that did not work at all I had so much brake up trying to do this and not to mention the flat iron part, terrible. I will return to my old product and keep faithful to it. As for all the other Alfaparf products, those I love.</li>
            <li> I need to buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great! I wouldn&#x27;t have made it through the summer without this. I was in pools and water parks all summer and my hair stayed semi straight but completely manageable. No frizz. It does smell and smoke a lot but it works well and lasts. Make sure you have a straightening iron that has different temps. I set mine at 450 degrees. Not sure why others didn&#x27;t see results cuz it worked just as well as the salon for me :)</li>
            <li> Very good and it came on time</li>
