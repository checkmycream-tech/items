    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I love this eye cream!!!</li>
            <li>Either way it works great under makeup.  </li>
            <li>However, the cream felt good around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Um, no, thought that would be super awesome.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’m happy with this and will probably buy more when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li>Incredible product and really works!!!</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena Line is amazing, I has never used this brand before to speak of, but I got hooked when I tried the rapid wrinkle repair.  </li>
            <li>It does not have an odor which is nice and did not irritate my eyes (like some reviewers mentioned).</li>
            <li>the applicator brush is not my kind of thing from a germ harboring perspective, not everyone washes their hands (as one should) before using face products.</li>
            <li>It also feels nice on my skin and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>Kind of like what I remember from my preschool fingerpainting experiences.</li>
            <li>We have a nice applicator that you need to twist in order to get some of the cream.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t see anything on the ingredient list that would support tightening, I wonder if they know what they&#x27;re doing or if they just mixed some good stuff together and hoped for the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just accepted it and been grateful my skin is pretty great for my age.</li>
            <li>packaging is nice and easy to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect magic here.</li>
            <li>The bleaching cream worked better.</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes better and doesn’t contain mica.</li>
            <li>Eye Circle reduction: 1 star&lt;br /&gt;Other properties: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Average: 3 stars&lt;</li>
            <li>Eye Circle reduction: 1 star&lt;br /&gt;Other properties: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Average: 3 stars&lt;</li>
            <li>I love that can wear it alone or with makeup</li>
            <li>do once you put makeup on top of it.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself was ok, but the packaging needs work.  </li>
            <li>But so many people swore by this Neutrogena product I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product cost $8 more at Target.</li>
            <li>It is more of a makeup than an eye cream</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say for sure that it has erased wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>okay--</li>
            <li>It seems to be more like makeup than medicine.</li>
            <li>Still, even with that said, I think that most people want this product for cosmetic reasons, and in that regard it does help.</li>
            <li>I wished it did more</li>
            <li>but it is more of an indulgent makeup bag item.</li>
            <li>More?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it looks as if its working, but I am unsure if its an illusion from the sheen or if the cream is a magical cure.</li>
            <li>and I guess I need more treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say I can definitely see improvement.</li>
            <li>I end up with more than I need on the brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the results with continued use since it seems the more you use it the better results you&#x27;ll get over time.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised and impressed the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I tried my makeup on top of this, but the light reflecting particles did show through my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it works great for</li>
            <li>I also feel like the oil would allow my makeup to come off easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The applicator works well and the cream flows easily, but it&#x27;s simply an easy to apply</li>
            <li>I noticed that the creamy formula brushes on easily</li>
            <li>I also found the applicator to be easy to use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell, is easy to put on</li>
            <li>but I’ve gotten better results in terms of an instant “pick me up” with their Bright on Schedule eye roller.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the product is formulated with “light reflecting minerals to brighten eyes.”  </li>
            <li>The product promises results in a week, and I did not notice any lightening of the circles, but that could just be because mine are light to begin with.  </li>
            <li>This product also provided a smooth surface upon which to apply cosmetic eye products.</li>
            <li>This product also provided a smooth surface upon which to apply cosmetic eye products.</li>
            <li>It is suppose to have light reflecting minerals that brighten the eyes; working well alone or under make-up.  </li>
            <li>However, I really didn&#x27;t notice any permanent results in terms of lightening my under-eye circles, which is kind of the point.</li>
            <li>Also, this product leaves the under eye area smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this for free as a reviewer, but otherwise I would be looking for a refund!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll never know if makes good on that promise, because both times I&#x27;ve tried it under my eyes, they became irritated, with a lingering burning sensation lasting most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The cream is easy and pleasant to apply, and I definitely can see  difference.</li>
            <li>It is slightly cool when it goes on, creamy, and feels like a light oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to try something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They best part of this, its small and fits in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d be happier if they provided a more consistent delivery system, like maybe a tube or jar.</li>
            <li>You then use tissue paper to clean off the brush before recapping the lid (do not rinse with water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions tell you to wipe the brush clean after every use.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s more apparent in daylight, but that&#x27;s all the more reason to wear sunglasses if you go outdoors.    </li>
            <li>I love neutropenia products but didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with this one</li>
            <li>I really didn’t think it was a good idea to use them near the eye area!  </li>
            <li>I have been fighting my dark circles for years - this is the best product so far!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the best person to review this because I haven&#x27;t tried all others--I have used different creams that serve as wrinkle reducers around the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t used them religiously</li>
            <li>I experienced no irritation at all, and unlike other creams this one had no unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>It comes out quickly, in a sort of a blob.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this since it does improve the appearance of the dark circles, is easy to apply, and is fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a huge deal breaker, but I also don&#x27;t want to look like some disco reject either ;)</li>
            <li>So for me this will be a good night cream for the dry skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice cooling effect and does not dry feeling tacky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-I needed a bajillion clicks to get the initial product flowing to the applicator but found three clicks to be perfect each time I needed to paint my single eye area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I needed a bajillion clicks to get the initial product flowing to the applicator but found three clicks to be perfect each time I needed to paint my single eye area.</li>
            <li>This product is basically just a VERY lightweight concealer in a light beige.</li>
            <li>according to their website, so I thought it was worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The brush is perfect for gently massaging the product into delicate eye skin, and it also eliminates any greasy fingers.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed into the skin and appears to be working.  </li>
            <li>more often I  dabbed the item into a finger and applied it directly like that.</li>
            <li>and it comes up at the top area near the brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to turn the tube cap, hear the clicks, watch the cream bead up on the brush, and stroke the cream on to the offending area.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish is that there were more detailed instructions as to how often you&#x27;re meant to apply this.  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a drugstore product, the price to product ratio makes this a rather expensive option for use, more so than many department store eye creams and exceptionally so for a drug store one.</li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t really have significant wrinkles to begin with, so</li>
            <li>Right before bed?  </li>
            <li>Right out of the shower?  </li>
            <li>A very light shimmery sheen created by some micronized gold-ish silica provides a barely noticeable cosmetic effect.</li>
            <li>She reports that while it is smooth to apply, the applicator does not dispense a steady flow of cream.</li>
            <li>While I would not recommend this product to get rid of dark circles, there are certainly exceptionally good reasons to still use this product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li>While I would not recommend this product to get rid of dark circles, there are certainly exceptionally good reasons to still use this product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li>What I did find is that it was a nice moisturizer for my dry winter skin around the eyes, and it did not interfere with makeup.  </li>
            <li>I still had my funky allergy-related blots, but the rest of my under-eye area looked a lot better overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that first couple hours that I want some help with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used one, just click slowly on first use, and stop as soon as you see some product oozing up through the brush.</li>
            <li>If I don’t get enough sleep or am stressed, they’re really prominent.  </li>
            <li>and if it did show results, then it would be more obvious to tell.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>It did seem to lighten the dark circles under my eyes, but as many reviews mention and even the product description, it has &#x27;light reflecting minerals&#x27; ....</li>
            <li>I noticed results within the first three days.  </li>
            <li>I put it on my finger first and noticed that yes indeed, as another reviewer stated, the cream has gold sheen to it.</li>
            <li>have enjoyed using this product for the last week.</li>
            <li>a few good points</li>
            <li>I also really like that it has an applicator built in, dispensing just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>It’s easy to use because it comes with a tiny brush that lets you apply the product right where you want it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-The brush applicator could be a good option for those with a lower than average fine motor skill development if you find the current best method of applying eye creams &amp;#34;gently patting with the ring finger&amp;#34; to be an awkward task.</li>

            <li>I think it outperforms many more expensive products available.</li>
            <li>I’ve used face lotions and creams with mica flecks in the past, never with good results.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Skin tightening is not advertised as a feature of this product, but clearly Neutrogena is hoping that they might be able to add it, as that would be a major selling point.</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t say that I have seen any positive effects from using this product.  </li>
            <li>I used this for over a week to test their claims that this &amp;#34;works to make under-eye skin tone more even, targeting dark circles for visible results in only one week.&amp;#34;  I have to say, my results were okay, but somewhat underwhelming.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am nowhere near the demographic for Olay’s Fresh Effects line (they’re really made for youngerladies)</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t have too much product coming out.</li>
            <li>The cream is off white, light in texture, and has some glittery shine to it.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness the mica didn’t irritate my skin, but the product didn’t moisturize the eye area very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Whatever else an eye cream does, it should really be gentle and nourishing to the under eye area, and this just wasn’t.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn’t take much each time</li>
            <li>All their line seems to really work.  </li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference while using this product.  </li>
            <li>For my situation, this product didn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Yesterday, I rubbed my eye and got the product into my eye which really stung and my eye watered for about an hour.</li>
            <li>I generally do not wear foundation, so having a lightweight, quick and easy eye option to perk up my eyes is appreciated, but I wish they had marketed it as a concealer rather than an actual fix.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I found when wearing concealer or other eye makeup products on top, this product did not interfere with either their application or the length of their wear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I found when wearing concealer or other eye makeup products on top, this product did not interfere with either their application or the length of their wear.</li>
            <li>I have used this for 2 weeks and my dark circles are lighter, not as much as I would like but better than before.  </li>
            <li>but it is more like a cosmetic concealer with light reflecting particles vs. actually making the darkened area have noticeable improvement in skin tone with less pigment.</li>
            <li>A week of using it has made the skin around my eyes feel better even if I cannot tell a difference in the dark circles.</li>
            <li>Although this cream does reduce the appearance of my dark circles, I&#x27;m not in love with the delivery mechanism.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don’t twist out too much product and waste it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before and perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.  </li>
            <li>It comes out as this little tannish crème that more than anything looks like makeup.  </li>
            <li>I read a long time ago that nothing cures dark under eye circles except plenty of sleep, good diet and genes, and consistent physical activity -- you know, the cure for EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  normally use a lot of makeup but tried covering the eye cream with a matted powder.</li>
            <li>Therefore the brush applicator could be a good option to help reduce the growth of eye irritating and infection harboring germs in this eye product.</li>
            <li>Other people have written detailed analyses of the ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no guess work here as to how much is too much or not enough.  </li>
            <li>Pretty standard for a clicker tube.</li>
            <li>It is a light cover up of dark circles.</li>
            <li>I didn’t notice any difference on the first application, instant or otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Per the product description: &amp;#34;Works to make under-eye skin tone more even, targeting dark circles for visible results in only one week.&amp;#34; Also it claims to have &amp;#34;Light Reflecting Minerals&amp;#34; that &amp;#34;instantly brightens under-eye shadows caused by fatigued</li>
            <li>Perhaps this is an unfair test, but when you want to get rid of dark circles, you want the most effective product.</li>
            <li>It is possible that with more use this might make a slight difference, but I don’t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, like I mentioned before, my eye circles are probably worse than most, so it may work better for people with less severe problems.</li>
            <li>I pretty much gave up on products that claim they&#x27;re going to reduce my dark under-eye circles and don&#x27;t even try using concealer anymore...</li>
            <li>I didn’t know what to expect when I got to sample this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Since I travel frequently, this will become a staple in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>The price is the lowest I have so far found.</li>
            <li>Even though the instructions say it may take up to 10 twists to get the product to appear in the brush, it took nearly 30 for me.</li>
            <li>putting something light on top of something dark is going to make whatever&#x27;s dark a little lighter.</li>
            <li>Still, it works better than any concealer I&#x27;ve ever used and while the results over time are not miraculous, my dark circles are indeed distinctly less</li>
            <li>I have dark circles under my eyes - accentuated even more due to a recent bout with the flu.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: using the Neutrogena Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream caused no noticeable reduction in under eye darkness after a 30 day period of consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ve got sensitive eyes, but I have no intention of trying for a third day of discomfort.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t make things worse, but I can&#x27;t see that it makes things better.  </li>
            <li>Reading the reviews on Neutrogena&#x27;s site, I notice a few references to \\&quot;tightened skin\\&quot; followed by a Neutrogena customer service rep&#x27;s response to \\&quot;call us right away!\\</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference and my dark circles  </li>
            <li>While I usually expect to use a product for longer to see results, Neutrogena promises to see some in &amp;#34;one week.&amp;#34; So, I figured i&#x27;d give them at least that long and even a bit longer for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll just simply say that this product really does work on the puffy-factor and the dark that comes from tiredness and the like.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not the same kind of dark circles you&#x27;re going to have in the morning from being tired and dehydrated, etc.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> okay--</li>
            <li> It seems to be more like makeup than medicine.</li>
            <li> Still, even with that said, I think that most people want this product for cosmetic reasons, and in that regard it does help.</li>
            <li> I wished it did more</li>
            <li> but it is more of an indulgent makeup bag item.</li>
            <li> More?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it looks as if its working, but I am unsure if its an illusion from the sheen or if the cream is a magical cure.</li>
            <li> and I guess I need more treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to say I can definitely see improvement.</li>
            <li> I end up with more than I need on the brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the results with continued use since it seems the more you use it the better results you&#x27;ll get over time.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised and impressed the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I tried my makeup on top of this, but the light reflecting particles did show through my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it works great for</li>
            <li> I also feel like the oil would allow my makeup to come off easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The applicator works well and the cream flows easily, but it&#x27;s simply an easy to apply</li>
            <li> I noticed that the creamy formula brushes on easily</li>
            <li> I also found the applicator to be easy to use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell, is easy to put on</li>
            <li> but I’ve gotten better results in terms of an instant “pick me up” with their Bright on Schedule eye roller.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the product is formulated with “light reflecting minerals to brighten eyes.”  </li>
            <li> The product promises results in a week, and I did not notice any lightening of the circles, but that could just be because mine are light to begin with.  </li>
            <li> This product also provided a smooth surface upon which to apply cosmetic eye products.</li>
            <li> This product also provided a smooth surface upon which to apply cosmetic eye products.</li>
            <li> It is suppose to have light reflecting minerals that brighten the eyes; working well alone or under make-up.  </li>
            <li> However, I really didn&#x27;t notice any permanent results in terms of lightening my under-eye circles, which is kind of the point.</li>
            <li> Also, this product leaves the under eye area smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this for free as a reviewer, but otherwise I would be looking for a refund!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll never know if makes good on that promise, because both times I&#x27;ve tried it under my eyes, they became irritated, with a lingering burning sensation lasting most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The cream is easy and pleasant to apply, and I definitely can see  difference.</li>
            <li> It is slightly cool when it goes on, creamy, and feels like a light oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to try something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They best part of this, its small and fits in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d be happier if they provided a more consistent delivery system, like maybe a tube or jar.</li>
            <li> You then use tissue paper to clean off the brush before recapping the lid (do not rinse with water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The directions tell you to wipe the brush clean after every use.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s more apparent in daylight, but that&#x27;s all the more reason to wear sunglasses if you go outdoors.    </li>
            <li> I love neutropenia products but didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with this one</li>
            <li> I really didn’t think it was a good idea to use them near the eye area!  </li>
            <li> I have been fighting my dark circles for years - this is the best product so far!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the best person to review this because I haven&#x27;t tried all others--I have used different creams that serve as wrinkle reducers around the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t used them religiously</li>
            <li> I experienced no irritation at all, and unlike other creams this one had no unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> It comes out quickly, in a sort of a blob.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this since it does improve the appearance of the dark circles, is easy to apply, and is fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a huge deal breaker, but I also don&#x27;t want to look like some disco reject either ;)</li>
            <li> So for me this will be a good night cream for the dry skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice cooling effect and does not dry feeling tacky.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-I needed a bajillion clicks to get the initial product flowing to the applicator but found three clicks to be perfect each time I needed to paint my single eye area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I needed a bajillion clicks to get the initial product flowing to the applicator but found three clicks to be perfect each time I needed to paint my single eye area.</li>
            <li> This product is basically just a VERY lightweight concealer in a light beige.</li>
            <li> according to their website, so I thought it was worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The brush is perfect for gently massaging the product into delicate eye skin, and it also eliminates any greasy fingers.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed into the skin and appears to be working.  </li>
            <li> more often I  dabbed the item into a finger and applied it directly like that.</li>
            <li> and it comes up at the top area near the brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to turn the tube cap, hear the clicks, watch the cream bead up on the brush, and stroke the cream on to the offending area.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that there were more detailed instructions as to how often you&#x27;re meant to apply this.  </li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a drugstore product, the price to product ratio makes this a rather expensive option for use, more so than many department store eye creams and exceptionally so for a drug store one.</li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t really have significant wrinkles to begin with, so</li>
            <li> Right before bed?  </li>
            <li> Right out of the shower?  </li>
            <li> A very light shimmery sheen created by some micronized gold-ish silica provides a barely noticeable cosmetic effect.</li>
            <li> She reports that while it is smooth to apply, the applicator does not dispense a steady flow of cream.</li>
            <li> While I would not recommend this product to get rid of dark circles, there are certainly exceptionally good reasons to still use this product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li> While I would not recommend this product to get rid of dark circles, there are certainly exceptionally good reasons to still use this product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li> What I did find is that it was a nice moisturizer for my dry winter skin around the eyes, and it did not interfere with makeup.  </li>
            <li> I still had my funky allergy-related blots, but the rest of my under-eye area looked a lot better overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that first couple hours that I want some help with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used one, just click slowly on first use, and stop as soon as you see some product oozing up through the brush.</li>
            <li> If I don’t get enough sleep or am stressed, they’re really prominent.  </li>
            <li> and if it did show results, then it would be more obvious to tell.</li>
            <li> Really works!  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> It did seem to lighten the dark circles under my eyes, but as many reviews mention and even the product description, it has &#x27;light reflecting minerals&#x27; ....</li>
            <li> I noticed results within the first three days.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my finger first and noticed that yes indeed, as another reviewer stated, the cream has gold sheen to it.</li>
            <li> have enjoyed using this product for the last week.</li>
            <li> a few good points</li>
            <li> I also really like that it has an applicator built in, dispensing just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> It’s easy to use because it comes with a tiny brush that lets you apply the product right where you want it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-The brush applicator could be a good option for those with a lower than average fine motor skill development if you find the current best method of applying eye creams &amp;#34;gently patting with the ring finger&amp;#34; to be an awkward task.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The brush applicator could be a good option for those with a lower than average fine motor skill development if you find the current best method of applying eye creams &amp;#34;gently patting with the ring finger&amp;#34; to be an awkward task.</li>
            <li> I think it outperforms many more expensive products available.</li>
            <li> I’ve used face lotions and creams with mica flecks in the past, never with good results.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Skin tightening is not advertised as a feature of this product, but clearly Neutrogena is hoping that they might be able to add it, as that would be a major selling point.</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t say that I have seen any positive effects from using this product.  </li>
            <li> I used this for over a week to test their claims that this &amp;#34;works to make under-eye skin tone more even, targeting dark circles for visible results in only one week.&amp;#34;  I have to say, my results were okay, but somewhat underwhelming.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am nowhere near the demographic for Olay’s Fresh Effects line (they’re really made for youngerladies)</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t have too much product coming out.</li>
            <li> The cream is off white, light in texture, and has some glittery shine to it.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness the mica didn’t irritate my skin, but the product didn’t moisturize the eye area very well at all.  </li>
            <li> Whatever else an eye cream does, it should really be gentle and nourishing to the under eye area, and this just wasn’t.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn’t take much each time</li>
            <li> All their line seems to really work.  </li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference while using this product.  </li>
            <li> For my situation, this product didn&#x27;t really do anything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Yesterday, I rubbed my eye and got the product into my eye which really stung and my eye watered for about an hour.</li>
            <li> I generally do not wear foundation, so having a lightweight, quick and easy eye option to perk up my eyes is appreciated, but I wish they had marketed it as a concealer rather than an actual fix.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I found when wearing concealer or other eye makeup products on top, this product did not interfere with either their application or the length of their wear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I found when wearing concealer or other eye makeup products on top, this product did not interfere with either their application or the length of their wear.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 weeks and my dark circles are lighter, not as much as I would like but better than before.  </li>
            <li> but it is more like a cosmetic concealer with light reflecting particles vs. actually making the darkened area have noticeable improvement in skin tone with less pigment.</li>
            <li> A week of using it has made the skin around my eyes feel better even if I cannot tell a difference in the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Although this cream does reduce the appearance of my dark circles, I&#x27;m not in love with the delivery mechanism.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don’t twist out too much product and waste it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before and perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.  </li>
            <li> It comes out as this little tannish crème that more than anything looks like makeup.  </li>
            <li> I read a long time ago that nothing cures dark under eye circles except plenty of sleep, good diet and genes, and consistent physical activity -- you know, the cure for EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  normally use a lot of makeup but tried covering the eye cream with a matted powder.</li>
            <li> Therefore the brush applicator could be a good option to help reduce the growth of eye irritating and infection harboring germs in this eye product.</li>
            <li> Other people have written detailed analyses of the ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no guess work here as to how much is too much or not enough.  </li>
            <li> Pretty standard for a clicker tube.</li>
            <li> It is a light cover up of dark circles.</li>
            <li> I didn’t notice any difference on the first application, instant or otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Per the product description: &amp;#34;Works to make under-eye skin tone more even, targeting dark circles for visible results in only one week.&amp;#34; Also it claims to have &amp;#34;Light Reflecting Minerals&amp;#34; that &amp;#34;instantly brightens under-eye shadows caused by fatigued</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is an unfair test, but when you want to get rid of dark circles, you want the most effective product.</li>
            <li> It is possible that with more use this might make a slight difference, but I don’t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, like I mentioned before, my eye circles are probably worse than most, so it may work better for people with less severe problems.</li>
            <li> I pretty much gave up on products that claim they&#x27;re going to reduce my dark under-eye circles and don&#x27;t even try using concealer anymore...</li>
            <li> I didn’t know what to expect when I got to sample this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Since I travel frequently, this will become a staple in my cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> The price is the lowest I have so far found.</li>
            <li> Even though the instructions say it may take up to 10 twists to get the product to appear in the brush, it took nearly 30 for me.</li>
            <li> putting something light on top of something dark is going to make whatever&#x27;s dark a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Still, it works better than any concealer I&#x27;ve ever used and while the results over time are not miraculous, my dark circles are indeed distinctly less</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes - accentuated even more due to a recent bout with the flu.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: using the Neutrogena Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream caused no noticeable reduction in under eye darkness after a 30 day period of consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ve got sensitive eyes, but I have no intention of trying for a third day of discomfort.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make things worse, but I can&#x27;t see that it makes things better.  </li>
            <li> Reading the reviews on Neutrogena&#x27;s site, I notice a few references to \\&quot;tightened skin\\&quot; followed by a Neutrogena customer service rep&#x27;s response to \\&quot;call us right away!\\</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference and my dark circles  </li>
            <li> While I usually expect to use a product for longer to see results, Neutrogena promises to see some in &amp;#34;one week.&amp;#34; So, I figured i&#x27;d give them at least that long and even a bit longer for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll just simply say that this product really does work on the puffy-factor and the dark that comes from tiredness and the like.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not the same kind of dark circles you&#x27;re going to have in the morning from being tired and dehydrated, etc.</li>
            <li> I suspect the higher than average price point/oz is due to the brush application container.</li>
            <li> Suffice to say that there is no miracle contained in this slim tube, but that the cream is also inoffensive, with no obvious odor and no major allergens.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several weeks and even 71yr old dark eye circles are lightening.  </li>
            <li> Did not really notice much difference in the dark circles, and I have used it for well over one week.  </li>
            <li> how long a tube will last before it needs to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> The product itself does make the eye area lighter and smoother looking both short and long term and for the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, sometimes 2x daily, and while it hasn&#x27;t diminished the dark circles much at all it does seem to decrease the puffiness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is lightweight, and applying it multiple times a day -- which I have done in the absence of other instruction -- doesn&#x27;t feel like overkill.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most disappointing cosmetics I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and have had allergy eyes for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> I’ve had them as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> The directions say you have to twist up to ten times to prime the applicator, and it took at least that for the first grayish colored product to appear on the little brush.</li>
            <li> While its not the most expensive cream I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s too pricey to waste any of it.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product -- it does seem to brighten the eyes when it is applied, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s making any long term difference in dark circle or purplish lines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very dark circles under my eyes - they are there, just not very dark.  </li>
            <li> I think the key has to do with where your dark circles are originating.</li>
            <li> I think my dark circles are related to age and genetics.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this dark circle eye cream for the last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream]] is not a be-all-and-end-all or even an instant fix.  </li>
            <li> This is then brushed into the area where your dark circles are.  </li>
            <li> Although dark circles may temporarily diminish, I haven&#x27;t seen any long-lasting effects after two weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> -- If you have dark under eyes circles, I recommend you look into allergens as a possible cause and perhaps try an elimination diet.</li>
            <li> The only difference in the dark circles under my eyes is that the eye cream creates a shimmering residue on the area that stays all day and draws attention to the darken area.</li>
            <li> It did cover the shimmering but the dark circles were the same color I started out with before using eye</li>
            <li> I think I am just going back to the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I will also say my under eyes do not look as puffy, which I think was a bigger issue with me than the dark</li>
            <li> Even with enough sleep the skin under my eyes is slightly darker because of allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyes looked no different in terms of being “brighter” or “less fatigued.”  </li>
            <li> I did have some trouble using it the first time - you have to turn the wheel at least 10 times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past to lighten them with no luck, and even using the most expensive makeups it never seems to cover them 100%.  </li>
            <li> Really am a fan of the applicator and the fact that very little product gets wasted on my fingers!</li>
            <li> Makeup doesn’t cover them very well at all, unfortunately (I’ve tried several techniques and tricks).  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena’s Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream claims to “instantly wakes up fatigued eyes and starts to reduce the look of dark circles in just one week,”</li>
            <li> It does not appear to do anything for long term dark circles.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no difference in darkness level between my two under eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I only noticed a slight difference in the dark discoloration.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has &#x27;repaired&#x27; my dark circles but has definitely made it less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I suspect the higher than average price point/oz is due to the brush application container.eye irritating and infection harboring germs in this eye product.</li>
            <li> Effect was subtle enough to not highlight that I used the product only on one eye.</li>
            <li> I do like it as well as any other eye cream I have used.  </li>
            <li> Due to these properties, I see why some have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I used this product under one eye, and a bleaching cream under the other.</li>
            <li> To increase objectivity in evaluating results, I tried this eye cream under one eye and kept using my existing eye cream under the other.</li>
            <li> --if anything, they&#x27;ve been easier on the skin than some other brands I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dropping to one star due to \\&quot;turning\\&quot; mechanism.</li>
            <li> You apply it in the AM along with any other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Just twist the bottom and a little bead of cream appears in the center of the brush</li>
            <li> It does reduce the dark circle a bit, but do not expect to reduce wrinkles around eyes.</li>
            <li> Me, I&#x27;ve had perpetual dark circles under my eyes since I was a teenager...due to allergies.</li>
            <li> The box says “starts to reduce the look of dark circles in just one week.”  </li>

            <li> As someone who inherited her father&#x27;s \\&quot;two burn holes in a blanket\\&quot; dark eye circles, let me assure you that this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t really perform as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the appearance of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The cream blended into my light/medium skin tone and was invisible on my skin - I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that this cream worked to diminish dark circles under eyes, but it didn&#x27;t make them go away.</li>

            <li> I have dark under-eye circles from genetics and from allergies.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this at the outset as the last dark circle cream I used irritated my skin terribly causing a swollen rash, but with the Neutrogena name I felt more comfortable that I wouldn&#x27;t have a repeat reaction.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like plastic surgery level results, but I do notice my dark circles looking brighter.  </li>

            <li> If you read the reviews here and on Neutrogena&#x27;s site, you&#x27;ll see that the effect is typically subtle, but the results may depend on the nature of your dark circles, and whether you&#x27;re dealing with pigmentation issues or allergies or sleep deprivation, or all of the above.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect magic here. The \\&quot;repair\\&quot; effect takes a while. A week in my experiment. It does reduce the dark circle a bit, but do not expect to reduce wrinkles around eyes. You may need a cosmetic surgeon for that.</li>
            <li> As you can see, the bunch of us reviewers have had mixes results. I think the key has to do with where your dark circles are originating. Me, I&#x27;ve had perpetual dark circles under my eyes since I was a teenager...due to allergies. That&#x27;s not the same kind of dark circles you&#x27;re going to have in the morning from being tired and dehydrated, etc. I pretty much gave up on products that claim they&#x27;re going to reduce my dark under-eye circles and don&#x27;t even try using concealer anymore...I&#x27;ve just accepted it and been grateful my skin is pretty great for my age. However! I&#x27;m like anyone else, too, and my under-eye area is always looking haggard in the morning...there is the standard puffiness, and whaddyaknow, this product made me realize that I have two shades of dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just simply say that this product really does work on the puffy-factor and the dark that comes from tiredness and the like. I was surprised and impressed the first time I used it. I did almost immediately see a difference (within about a minute or so). I still had my funky allergy-related blots, but the rest of my under-eye area looked a lot better overall. I can&#x27;t say I see any progressive difference, though, after weeks of use. But the immediate improvement I do see is what matters to me, since my skin always starts to look less haggard within an hour or two of waking anyway. It&#x27;s that first couple hours that I want some help with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the tube/delivery, I see nothing wrong with it. Just don&#x27;t go nuts on the clicking and you won&#x27;t have too much product coming out. Pretty standard for a clicker tube. If you&#x27;ve never used one, just click slowly on first use, and stop as soon as you see some product oozing up through the brush. That will be plenty for both eyes. After that, I found that just two or three clicks is all you need. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I love neutropenia products but didn&#x27;t really notice a difference with this one</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and have had allergy eyes for as long as I can remember.  Even with enough sleep the skin under my eyes is slightly darker because of allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a week and I cannot tell a difference.  The box says “starts to reduce the look of dark circles in just one week.”  I think my dark circles are related to age and genetics.  It is possible that with more use this might make a slight difference, but I don’t expect much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn’t mean I don’t like it.  I do like it as well as any other eye cream I have used.  It is slightly cool when it goes on, creamy, and feels like a light oil on my skin.  I tried my makeup on top of this, but the light reflecting particles did show through my makeup.  I also feel like the oil would allow my makeup to come off easily.  So for me this will be a good night cream for the dry skin around my eyes.  A week of using it has made the skin around my eyes feel better even if I cannot tell a difference in the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Our family likes Neutrogena products, so my wife tried this out. She reports that while it is smooth to apply, the applicator does not dispense a steady flow of cream. While it goes on neatly, as of yet, she has not noticed the dark circle &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; that this product seeks to offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this dark circle eye cream for the last 2 weeks. I have had dark under eye circles since being an adolescent so I was excited to try something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice and easy to carry in my purse. The directions state to turn the knob at the bottom up to 10 times to release cream. However, it took me about 25 turns to see some off white cream on the brush. The cream is off white, light in texture, and has some glittery shine to it. Due to these properties, I see why some have noticed a difference. It is a light cover up of dark circles. It does not have an odor which is nice and did not irritate my eyes (like some reviewers mentioned). However, I only noticed a slight difference in the dark discoloration.</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but it is not wonderful. I used this product under one eye, and a bleaching cream under the other. The bleaching cream worked better. Perhaps this is an unfair test, but when you want to get rid of dark circles, you want the most effective product.</li>
            <li> A review from my wife...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have horrid purple shadows under my eyes.  I’ve had them as long as I can remember.  If I don’t get enough sleep or am stressed, they’re really prominent.  I also think they’ve gotten worse with age.  Makeup doesn’t cover them very well at all, unfortunately (I’ve tried several techniques and tricks).  Neutrogena’s Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream claims to “instantly wakes up fatigued eyes and starts to reduce the look of dark circles in just one week,” according to their website, so I thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the product is formulated with “light reflecting minerals to brighten eyes.”  Translation?  Mica flecks.  I’ve used face lotions and creams with mica flecks in the past, never with good results.  It just irritates my skin. I really didn’t think it was a good idea to use them near the eye area!  It wasn’t even out of the package yet, and already there’s a strike against it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strike two comes when I take it out of the box and I see that it’s the product is applied with an attached brush.  It’s one of those tubes where you turn the bottom and the product comes up through the bristles.  I hate those on principal.  They’re havens for germs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I decided to give the product a chance and used it for about two weeks.  I didn’t notice any difference on the first application, instant or otherwise.  My eyes looked no different in terms of being “brighter” or “less fatigued.”  After two weeks, I could see no difference at all in the appearance of my dark circles. Thank goodness the mica didn’t irritate my skin, but the product didn’t moisturize the eye area very well at all.  Whatever else an eye cream does, it should really be gentle and nourishing to the under eye area, and this just wasn’t.  I can’t recommend it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am nowhere near the demographic for Olay’s Fresh Effects line (they’re really made for youngerladies) but I’ve gotten better results in terms of an instant “pick me up” with their Bright on Schedule eye roller.  It also moisturizes better and doesn’t contain mica. That I can recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very dark circles under my eyes - they are there, just not very dark.  The product promises results in a week, and I did not notice any lightening of the circles, but that could just be because mine are light to begin with.  What I did find is that it was a nice moisturizer for my dry winter skin around the eyes, and it did not interfere with makeup.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and is quickly absorbed.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and update this review if my circles do get lighter.</li>
            <li> This product is basically just a VERY lightweight concealer in a light beige. Coverage-wise, it&#x27;s about the same as a tinted moisturizer. It does not appear to do anything for long term dark circles. That being said, I don&#x27;t dislike the product. I generally do not wear foundation, so having a lightweight, quick and easy eye option to perk up my eyes is appreciated, but I wish they had marketed it as a concealer rather than an actual fix. I&#x27;m disappointed in it as a dark circle corrector.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it does instantly help because it&#x27;s a concealer. But you could get a cheaper concealer.</li>
            <li> I didn’t know what to expect when I got to sample this, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It does work to cover dark circles under your eyes.  It’s easy to use because it comes with a tiny brush that lets you apply the product right where you want it.  After brushing it on, I use my little finger to “pat” the cream into the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also think this product leaves your skin soft and isn’t drying or irritating at all.  I have sensitive skin and it works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take about eighteen twists initially, on the tube, to get the product out to the brush, but now I only have to twist it once or twice each time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube is somewhat small, about the size of a tube of mascara.  I have no idea yet how long a tube will last before it needs to be replaced.  However, it doesn’t take much each time and I’ve used this three weeks now and I think there’s a lot left.  Make sure you don’t twist out too much product and waste it.  Also the brush needs to be wiped off with a tissue after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m happy with this and will probably buy more when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> To increase objectivity in evaluating results, I tried this eye cream under one eye and kept using my existing eye cream under the other. That way I couldn&#x27;t &amp;#34;talk&amp;#34; myself into seeing results that weren&#x27;t there and if it did show results, then it would be more obvious to tell. While I usually expect to use a product for longer to see results, Neutrogena promises to see some in &amp;#34;one week.&amp;#34; So, I figured i&#x27;d give them at least that long and even a bit longer for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results? Here we go:&lt;br /&gt;Initial application: A very light shimmery sheen created by some micronized gold-ish silica provides a barely noticeable cosmetic effect. This sheen provided no noticeable reduction in under eye darkness but did not contribute to it either. Effect was subtle enough to not highlight that I used the product only on one eye. I&#x27;m talking *subtle;* subtle enough for a man to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7 Days of Use:  (the promised &amp;#34;results in a week&amp;#34; mark) I saw absolutely no difference in darkness level between my two under eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 Days of Use: no difference in darkness level between my two under eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14 Days of Use: no difference in darkness level between my two under eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;21 Days of Use: no difference in darkness level between my two under eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 Days of Use: no difference in darkness level between my two under eye areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: using the Neutrogena Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream caused no noticeable reduction in under eye darkness after a 30 day period of consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s bad news. However, I&#x27;ll go ahead an mention a few good points I feel this product still has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product advantages:&lt;br /&gt;-While the applicator brush is not my kind of thing from a germ harboring perspective, not everyone washes their hands (as one should) before using face products. Therefore the brush applicator could be a good option to help reduce the growth of eye irritating and infection harboring germs in this eye product. This is assuming the average number of germs on the face skin is lower than would be on unwashed hands.&lt;br /&gt;-The brush applicator could be a good option for those with a lower than average fine motor skill development if you find the current best method of applying eye creams &amp;#34;gently patting with the ring finger&amp;#34; to be an awkward task. Perhaps &amp;#34;painting&amp;#34; on a cream would be easier.&lt;br /&gt;-This product did not *increase* my dark eye circles so yay for small victories.&lt;br /&gt;-I found when wearing concealer or other eye makeup products on top, this product did not interfere with either their application or the length of their wear. This product also provided a smooth surface upon which to apply cosmetic eye products. This is a big deal and the reason I gave this cream 3 stars instead of only one. you may decide to use this product just because it doesn&#x27;t cause your mascara to &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; on you throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR While I would not recommend this product to get rid of dark circles, there are certainly exceptionally good reasons to still use this product otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Dark Eye Circle reduction: 1 star&lt;br /&gt;Other properties: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Average: 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;-I needed a bajillion clicks to get the initial product flowing to the applicator but found three clicks to be perfect each time I needed to paint my single eye area.

            <li> I love this eye cream!!! I have been looking for something like this for a while now. I have noticed that my dark circles are not as dark as they once were. They best part of this, its small and fits in my makeup bag. I love that can wear it alone or with makeup and it doesnt crease around the eyes like some eye creams do once you put makeup on top of it. I&#x27;ve been trying to remember to wear it day and night but for the 2 weeks (ish) I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove the dark circles under my eyes.  I had the dark circles for years I guess I was hopeful. However, the cream felt good around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 2 weeks and my dark circles are lighter, not as much as I would like but better than before.  This Neutrogena Line is amazing, I has never used this brand before to speak of, but I got hooked when I tried the rapid wrinkle repair.  All their line seems to really work.  I hope my dark circles will get even lighter if so I will re-post.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for about 2 weeks now &amp; I am seeing a difference.  I have been fighting my dark circles for years - this is the best product so far!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the most disappointing cosmetics I&#x27;ve ever used. Even sadder that it comes from Neutrogena. It does nothing except add sparkle and makes your under eye area very slick. It even smudged my waterproof mascara. Into the trash.</li>
            <li> Reviewed by Lynn Holland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every woman  from the twenties on is looking to reduce any dark area under the eye, or as my daughter used to say , “the queen of death look”. This product by Neutrogena comes in a compact applicator about the size of a mascara wand.  The directions say you have to twist up to ten times to prime the applicator, and it took at least that for the first grayish colored product to appear on the little brush. The brush is perfect for gently massaging the product into delicate eye skin, and it also eliminates any greasy fingers. The product itself does make the eye area lighter and smoother looking both short and long term and for the price I think it outperforms many more expensive products available. Since I travel frequently, this will become a staple in my cosmetic bag. Really am a fan of the applicator and the fact that very little product gets wasted on my fingers!</li>
            <li> Really works!  Have been using this for several weeks and even 71yr old dark eye circles are lightening.  Easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It has a nice cooling effect and does not dry feeling tacky.  It has reduced some of the darkness and inflammation under my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> As someone who inherited her father&#x27;s \\&quot;two burn holes in a blanket\\&quot; dark eye circles, let me assure you that this [[ASIN:B00OLP9R8Q Neutrogena Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream]] is not a be-all-and-end-all or even an instant fix.  Still, it works better than any concealer I&#x27;ve ever used and while the results over time are not miraculous, my dark circles are indeed distinctly less dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> Very difficult to get the product to dispense.  Used it for about 2 weeks, then the bottom part of the pen broke off, so could no longer use.  The lotion itself was ok, but the packaging needs work.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I read a long time ago that nothing cures dark under eye circles except plenty of sleep, good diet and genes, and consistent physical activity -- you know, the cure for EVERYTHING. ;-) But so many people swore by this Neutrogena product I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now, sometimes 2x daily, and while it hasn&#x27;t diminished the dark circles much at all it does seem to decrease the puffiness around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. this product cost $8 more at Target. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t really perform as advertised.  It is more of a makeup than an eye cream</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any difference and my dark circles  were not that severe. I did like the way it brushes on.</li>
            <li> Incredible product and really works!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the best person to review this because I haven&#x27;t tried all others--I have used different creams that serve as wrinkle reducers around the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t used them religiously and I don&#x27;t really have significant wrinkles to begin with, so I&#x27;ve had trouble deciding how well the items work.  This doesn&#x27;t make things worse, but I can&#x27;t see that it makes things better.  It comes out as this little tannish crème that more than anything looks like makeup.  It is absorbed into the skin and appears to be working.  I just can&#x27;t say for sure that it has erased wrinkles.  In terms of ease of use, I find the stick okay--more often I  dabbed the item into a finger and applied it directly like that.</li>
            <li> It works like it said it would. The price is the lowest I have so far found. And am purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen any difference while using this product.  I have dark circles under my eyes - accentuated even more due to a recent bout with the flu.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the appearance of my dark circles.  It is suppose to have light reflecting minerals that brighten the eyes; working well alone or under make-up.  The cream blended into my light/medium skin tone and was invisible on my skin - I didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is a brush.  You twist the bottom of the tube and a tan cream begins to bubble out of the bristles.  This is then brushed into the area where your dark circles are.  You then use tissue paper to clean off the brush before recapping the lid (do not rinse with water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before and perhaps my expectations were a bit too high.  I was hopeful that the &amp;#34;rapid dark circle repair eye cream&amp;#34; would be a welcomed addition to my cosmetics and that I would be using less eye concealer.  unfortunately, I just don&#x27;t see any difference when using this product.</li>
            <li> I used this for over a week to test their claims that this &amp;#34;works to make under-eye skin tone more even, targeting dark circles for visible results in only one week.&amp;#34;  I have to say, my results were okay, but somewhat underwhelming. However, I have *extremely* dark under-eye circles, so one can&#x27;t expect miracles! I do think it brightens the under-eye area - the cream in beige in color and it also has sparkles that are beige in color and therefore brightens the area well. It also feels nice on my skin and didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I also like the way in applies (you turn it and it comes up at the top area near the brush and you brush it on). However, I really didn&#x27;t notice any permanent results in terms of lightening my under-eye circles, which is kind of the point. However, like I mentioned before, my eye circles are probably worse than most, so it may work better for people with less severe problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I used this everyday until I ran out and there was no change in the dark circles or puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Although dark circles may temporarily diminish, I haven&#x27;t seen any long-lasting effects after two weeks of daily use. The applicator works well and the cream flows easily, but it&#x27;s simply an easy to apply cover-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no issues with skin sensitivity.</li>
            <li> If you passed Fingerpainting 101, you understand the underlying (sorry, really hard to avoid puns with this product) concept: putting something light on top of something dark is going to make whatever&#x27;s dark a little lighter. If you read the reviews here and on Neutrogena&#x27;s site, you&#x27;ll see that the effect is typically subtle, but the results may depend on the nature of your dark circles, and whether you&#x27;re dealing with pigmentation issues or allergies or sleep deprivation, or all of the above.    Other people have written detailed analyses of the ingredients in this product. Suffice to say that there is no miracle contained in this slim tube, but that the cream is also inoffensive, with no obvious odor and no major allergens. It&#x27;s fun to turn the tube cap, hear the clicks, watch the cream bead up on the brush, and stroke the cream on to the offending area.The cream is lightweight, and applying it multiple times a day -- which I have done in the absence of other instruction -- doesn&#x27;t feel like overkill. Some people have mentioned the shimmer. I haven&#x27;t seen it. Maybe it&#x27;s more apparent in daylight, but that&#x27;s all the more reason to wear sunglasses if you go outdoors.    Reading the reviews on Neutrogena&#x27;s site, I notice a few references to \\&quot;tightened skin\\&quot; followed by a Neutrogena customer service rep&#x27;s response to \\&quot;call us right away!\\&quot; Skin tightening is not advertised as a feature of this product, but clearly Neutrogena is hoping that they might be able to add it, as that would be a major selling point. Since I don&#x27;t see anything on the ingredient list that would support tightening, I wonder if they know what they&#x27;re doing or if they just mixed some good stuff together and hoped for the best. Kind of like what I remember from my preschool fingerpainting experiences.</li>
            <li> I would say that this cream worked to diminish dark circles under eyes, but it didn&#x27;t make them go away. It seems to be more like makeup than medicine. When you wash your face at the end of the day, the dark circles are still there. Still, even with that said, I think that most people want this product for cosmetic reasons, and in that regard it does help. -- If you have dark under eyes circles, I recommend you look into allergens as a possible cause and perhaps try an elimination diet.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and I have dark circles that are a result of allergies.  I tried this product for a week and I really can&#x27;t say that I have seen any positive effects from using this product.  I didn&#x27;t notice any diminishing of the circles at all, even after a week of use.  For my situation, this product didn&#x27;t really do anything.  On the plus side, this didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream promises to visibly reduce the look of dark circles in just a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never know if makes good on that promise, because both times I&#x27;ve tried it under my eyes, they became irritated, with a lingering burning sensation lasting most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any issues with Neutrogena products in the past--if anything, they&#x27;ve been easier on the skin than some other brands I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;ve got sensitive eyes, but I have no intention of trying for a third day of discomfort.  I think I&#x27;d rather have dark circles under my eyes than serious redness in them!</li>
            <li> Per the product description: &amp;#34;Works to make under-eye skin tone more even, targeting dark circles for visible results in only one week.&amp;#34; Also it claims to have &amp;#34;Light Reflecting Minerals&amp;#34; that &amp;#34;instantly brightens under-eye shadows caused by fatigued eyes.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product faithfully for three weeks brushing it on TWICE a day: once in the morning and once in the evening.  I have dark under-eye circles from genetics and from allergies. I noticed that the creamy formula brushes on easily and it does brighten the area but it is more like a cosmetic concealer with light reflecting particles vs. actually making the darkened area have noticeable improvement in skin tone with less pigment. I wished it did more but it isn&#x27;t a lasting effect but it is more of an indulgent makeup bag item.</li>
            <li> I have been trying the Neutrogena Rapid Dark Circle Repair Eye Cream for about a week and a half. The only difference in the dark circles under my eyes is that the eye cream creates a shimmering residue on the area that stays all day and draws attention to the darken area. I have had several people ask or remark about what is under my eyes. I don&#x27;t  normally use a lot of makeup but tried covering the eye cream with a matted powder. It did cover the shimmering but the dark circles were the same color I started out with before using eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I rubbed my eye and got the product into my eye which really stung and my eye watered for about an hour. I think I am just going back to the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. It did seem to lighten the dark circles under my eyes, but as many reviews mention and even the product description, it has &#x27;light reflecting minerals&#x27; .... for a kinda glittery effect. Luckily it is subtle. I don&#x27;t think it has &#x27;repaired&#x27; my dark circles but has definitely made it less noticeable. I also found the applicator to be easy to use. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this since it does improve the appearance of the dark circles, is easy to apply, and is fairly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had &amp;#34;dark circles&amp;#34; under my eyes since I was a teenager no matter what I do.  It&#x27;s just genetics and unfortunately all of my family has it.  I&#x27;ve tried other products in the past to lighten them with no luck, and even using the most expensive makeups it never seems to cover them 100%.  I was very skeptical of this at the outset as the last dark circle cream I used irritated my skin terribly causing a swollen rash, but with the Neutrogena name I felt more comfortable that I wouldn&#x27;t have a repeat reaction.  Indeed, I didn&#x27;t.  I experienced no irritation at all, and unlike other creams this one had no unpleasant odor.  I also really like that it has an applicator built in, dispensing just the right amount.  There&#x27;s no guess work here as to how much is too much or not enough.  Just twist the bottom and a little bead of cream appears in the center of the brush (it&#x27;s about the size of a nail polish brush), then you just paint it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There does appear to be a slight tint to it, or maybe it&#x27;s that the microbeads reflect your skin tone.  Either way it works great under makeup.  I noticed results within the first three days.  Now, it&#x27;s not anything earth-shattering.  It&#x27;s not like plastic surgery level results, but I do notice my dark circles looking brighter.  I was driving to work, caught a glimpse of my eyes in the rear-view mirror, and could immediately tell the dark circles were less noticeable.  I&#x27;m excited to see the results with continued use since it seems the more you use it the better results you&#x27;ll get over time.  The only thing I wish is that there were more detailed instructions as to how often you&#x27;re meant to apply this.  I&#x27;ve been doing it once a day, but are you supposed to use it twice a day?  More?  Less?  Right before bed?  Right out of the shower?  Does it matter?  I don&#x27;t know because you&#x27;re really only told to &amp;#34;twist and apply&amp;#34; and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> We have a nice applicator that you need to twist in order to get some of the cream. I put it on my finger first and noticed that yes indeed, as another reviewer stated, the cream has gold sheen to it. I also noticed that in the sunlight you could see sheen under my eye. This isn&#x27;t a huge deal breaker, but I also don&#x27;t want to look like some disco reject either ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it looks as if its working, but I am unsure if its an illusion from the sheen or if the cream is a magical cure. It doesn&#x27;t smell, is easy to put on and I do like it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, does it get rid of dark circles and make me look like I am 20 again? Um, no, thought that would be super awesome. However, I have noticed the darkness under my eyes looks lighter. I will also say my under eyes do not look as puffy, which I think was a bigger issue with me than the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The product minimizes the appearance of dark circles upon applying.  The darkness will never fade away as my dermatologist indicated, but it does minimizes the appearance.  Also, this product leaves the under eye area smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping me a little and I guess I need more treatment.</li>
            <li> Did not really notice much difference in the dark circles, and I have used it for well over one week.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: Dropping to one star due to \\&quot;turning\\&quot; mechanism. It just doesn&#x27;t work - I can&#x27;t get the product into the applicator brush. I got this for free as a reviewer, but otherwise I would be looking for a refund!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL:&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed using this product for the last week. I did have some trouble using it the first time - you have to turn the wheel at least 10 times (I needed close to 20) before the cream emerges inside the brush (hard to explain, but you&#x27;&#x27;ll know it when you see it). I tried clockwise and counter-clockwise, and I almost gave up and called Neutrogena for a replacement. However, the cream did make it&#x27;s appearance. Now it only needs a couple of turns before each use. Anyway. The cream is easy and pleasant to apply, and I definitely can see  difference. It does seem to work as a cover-up cosmetic as opposed to a healing cream. You apply it in the AM along with any other cosmetics. It isn&#x27;t meant to be worn overnight.</li>
            <li> Although this cream does reduce the appearance of my dark circles, I&#x27;m not in love with the delivery mechanism. Even though the instructions say it may take up to 10 twists to get the product to appear in the brush, it took nearly 30 for me. Whenever I use it sometimes it only takes one twist for product to appear, sometimes 5 or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happier if they provided a more consistent delivery system, like maybe a tube or jar.</li>
            <li> For months I have had dark circles under my eyes. They made me look tired. I tried various types &amp; brands of make up to cover them. If you&#x27;ve tried that you know it doesn&#x27;t work well. When I read about Neutrogena Rapid Dark Circle Repair eye Cream I thought I might as well give it a try. After 10 days of use I&#x27;m very happy to say I can definitely see improvement. My dark circles have visibly lightened. It would help to have directions on the recommended times to use it each day. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning &amp; again before bed. I have not experienced any skin or eye irritation as some reviewers claim .If you&#x27;re looking for a miracle, this ain&#x27;t it. If you&#x27;re looking to lighten your dark circles, I recommend you give it a try. Neutrogena could definitely improve the applicator, You turn the bottom of the applicator to dispense the cream onto a brush. The cream doesn&#x27;t dispense evenly. It comes out quickly, in a sort of a blob.I end up with more than I need on the brush. The directions tell you to wipe the brush clean after every use. That causes you to waste the cream. While its not the most expensive cream I&#x27;ve used, it&#x27;s too pricey to waste any of it. The applicator is a solid white tube. There is no way to determine how much is left in the tube.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, maybe someone else would but I did not at all.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product -- it does seem to brighten the eyes when it is applied, but I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s making any long term difference in dark circle or purplish lines.</li>
