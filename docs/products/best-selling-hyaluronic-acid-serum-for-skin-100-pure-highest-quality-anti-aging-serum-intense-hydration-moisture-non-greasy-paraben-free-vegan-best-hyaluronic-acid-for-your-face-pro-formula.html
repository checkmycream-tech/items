            <li>I have been using it for 4 days and everyone is talking about how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>But it is nice, hopefully is working.</li>
            <li>but I can say it does feel nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>my mom liked it.</li>
            <li>I love it, and it makes my face feel good.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product, it makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>Research into this is excellent, and the do-it-yourself approach is cheaper, and you know what you&#x27;re  really getting.  </li>
            <li>comes in a handy glass bottle with a rubber dropper</li>
            <li>A really nice serum.</li>
            <li>I am going to keep buying this product, it is priced reasonably and works great!</li>
            <li>I honestly dont feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I rather spend more and get a good known brand or ask your dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I am 55 and always looking for something to help my skin stay as nice as it can.</li>
            <li>Would of liked to have a lotion added as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this is a good product and does what it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it now that its warm.  </li>
            <li>It gives my face a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>its a nice acid</li>
            <li>nice serum for the money</li>
            <li>and I cannot honestly tell you that I notice any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since delivery (April)  and to be quite honest</li>
            <li>n nice</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out or anything.</li>
            <li>and I use it with Rose water, and then my moisturized over it.  </li>
            <li>Nice product I will order again.</li>
            <li>Hydrates my skin, nice skin glow afterwards.</li>
            <li>I liked it so well</li>
            <li>I liked the product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product smoothes nicely over skin with no smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Feels nice on skin and you can feel the tightness as it works.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, however, I found another product that incorporated Vitamin C in their product, which adds to the benefit of using Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as the &amp;#34;big brand&amp;#34; product but a much better deal.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to use along with the derma-roller and am loving the results.</li>
            <li>The product has nice viscosity.</li>
            <li>My husband even commented on the difference of my skin, and he can be brutally honest (which i respect because i&#x27;d</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel really nice.</li>
            <li>Awesome looking and ready for your make-up.</li>
            <li>This one did not do anything effective for my skin...</li>
            <li>I spray either a rose water or lavender spray on then the HAS.</li>
            <li>So I found this browsing on my own here and bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cr√®mes with this type product in it and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely THE best serum to put on your face!!!</li>
            <li>Its suppose to be good for your skin, so that being said, I love it.</li>
            <li>I do not think that it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>Cosmetics penetrate better your skin), apply the serum and after that, apply a good moisturization cream.</li>
            <li>Used in combination with the derma roller this is quite effective.  </li>
            <li>This is really a nice serum.</li>
            <li>Honestly have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This company also incorporates charitable donations made to Susan G Komen to support Breast Cancer Awareness.</li>
            <li>my skin is nice and  I can see my face getting tighter</li>
            <li>nice choice</li>
            <li>People tell me how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>nice feeling on skin,have sencitive skin and redness comes after every product i use</li>
            <li>I honestly believe, by smelling it and its looks, that it is what Arbonne sells for $50 for their face and body serum.  </li>
            <li>This is the best by far from any beauty store !!!</li>
            <li>I have found that for me the BEST way to use it is to mix it into my favorite night time moisturizer after cleansing right before bed.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and it feels real nice going on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Cosmedica Skincare they have great services, their products are great.</li>
            <li>Success !!!</li>
            <li>However, I bought this particular brand based on everyone else&#x27;s excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I use this twice a day under a light moisturizer and it feels wonderful, even with my mild rosacea.</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t achieve optimum results while using this product, I was able to get better hydration when I added this to my lotions.</li>
            <li>Item shipped fast, I love this product, it is the best thing for my face</li>
            <li>..makes my skin feel lovely and really seems to be doing wonderful things..</li>
            <li>For now, the stuff feels great, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>It came in great shape and quickly</li>
            <li>Very easy to add to your face cream.</li>
            <li>After so many years of &amp;#34;disaster skin&amp;#34; I LOVE the way my skin feels!</li>
            <li>My skin is more elastic and looks more youthful!</li>
            <li>I love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>The best hyaluronic acid have tried so far!</li>
            <li>Love the service, love the product!</li>
            <li>Love, love this!</li>
            <li>Very good product, 100% pure hyaluronic Acid serum,by Cosmedica, no fillers like some have.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this or any good H.A. serum to anyone with skin issues or who would like to ease up on some fine lines.</li>
            <li>This product is so good for aging skin, fine line, and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Very good and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>make me feel very good and for the price is very recommendable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the most amazing product out there but for the price and function it is supplemental to any skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>love this product, skin looks amazing</li>
            <li>: Like so many health and vitamin products on Amazon, this is another with reviews of people claiming amazing results that for me, no way are the results I think I noticed anyway</li>
            <li>She immediately received unhelpful votes, but it didn&#x27;t stop there - as her review grows more popular (71 out of 81 people thought the review is helpful)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s affordable and I&#x27;d say the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but honestly can&#x27;t say I love it.</li>
            <li>The price is perfect, but  didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for, as I have mature skin.</li>
            <li>So far I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to get a 100% product, rather than have it just as an ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s all in my head, but my face looks amazingly refreshed from using this.</li>
            <li>This product isnt a facelift in a bottle, but I will say it is the best serum I have used so far</li>
            <li>Been tested, it should be genuine, but not used in the face, I think it should be good.</li>
            <li>but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I try in many kind of serum.</li>
            <li>you will notice lines softening and a nice healthy luster.</li>
            <li>So far so great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure even without the roller it would be effective.  </li>
            <li>What I really liked about this product is the fact that does not contain but one good chemical, which is very rare in most skin products.</li>
            <li>Now I have an almost full bottle that will have to be thrown away!!</li>
            <li>Very good hydration in warm climates and good all year long.</li>
            <li>It does work best if you apply it to clean skin first,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try this product since I have heard that hyaluronic  acid is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent product...if used properly will yield amazing results</li>
            <li>This is a great hyaluronic acid serum and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Feel It&#x27;s a great product that works for a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever seen that beautiful glow on celebrities&#x27; cheeks and wonder how they do it without being oily, that very well might be the way.</li>
            <li>Being able to find the unadulterated ingredient at a reasonable price was excellent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, does exactly what it says on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product and I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 2 weeks (consistently) and have seen great results.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, my coworker told me my complexion looked great.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the fridge with the Vit-C and it is cool and soothing after a good face wash with my Clarisonic face brush.</li>
            <li>I have sun damage and even though I realize it is what it is I can see improvement or softening of fine lines!</li>
            <li>Hopefully, with time, I&#x27;ll see some of those fine lines disappearing!  </li>
            <li>Very light, seems to improve skin texture and quality.</li>
            <li>No greasy, Very light.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any change after i used it, I used it after wash off the face, and I was expecting my skin should be turned very smooth, but I don&#x27;t see any change</li>
            <li>it is not greasy at all, and that was very important to me.</li>
            <li>Very light and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very smooth and has also improved my complexion.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and moisture..</li>
            <li>(surprising to me)&lt;br /&gt;Feel:&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly drying and stretchy (almost like you had a mild botox)</li>
            <li>This product does absorb quickly, which is good..</li>
            <li>Affordable, easy to apply and Effective.....</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re using a retinol product.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice too and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about 6 months now and find it amazing for tightening your skin and reducing the appearance of fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and it has been doing away nicely with fine lines.</li>
            <li>I use it in place of a moisturizer under makeup, Large bottle at great price.</li>
            <li>it left my skin so hydrated and wonderful in the morning, I used this after dermarolling!!</li>
            <li>I do love it, use it nightly before applying my wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)</li>
            <li>I add 2-3 drops (at the most) to my moisturizer every time.</li>
            <li>For the most part, this hyaluronic acid does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is to hydrate your skin and plump it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer and will reorder again.</li>
            <li>I like this serum, it does help plump up your skin and give you a more youthful look, but I think Dr. Oz&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin C is better.</li>
            <li>, this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>It has more water than hyaluronic acid, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>and it feels ok</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels much better.</li>
            <li>and I think that one was better.</li>
            <li>had better results with Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li>BUT I still love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>

            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I swear my skin looks better since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>I would like to use more to see if my skin feel much better.</li>
            <li>I did observe a bit of peeling, but the underlying skin was so much better than what it had replaced.</li>
            <li>I have used one product better than this called MED PEEL (Hyaluronic Anti-Aging)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it;  I was developing &amp;#34;lizard skin&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>Love the moisture it gives.</li>
            <li>I am impressed and definitely would advise to use the provider.</li>
            <li>so it would be more convenient for others to read (just like I</li>
            <li>It seems to work better for my wrinkles on my forehead than nerium :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The combination seems to be causing a change for the better on my forearms (after rolling the skin with the Titanium micro needle roller.)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and look more brighter and softer..</li>
            <li>It has made my skin more hydrated and moisturised.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the packaging makes it look much more luxe than it costs.</li>
            <li>plan to use this serum in conjunction with a more firming moisturinzer that I am waiting to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think this product has returned my skin to a greater softness that I did not have</li>
            <li>Use your favorite moisturizer/sunblock.</li>
            <li>I am noticing softer, more even toned skin after just one week of use.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>My pores are disappearing and my skin is looking more youthful.</li>
            <li>I do think that my makeup applies and looks better.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I layer many products to my face -  serum/argan oil, moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the Cosmedia skin-care product.  </li>
            <li>I heard about hyaluronic acid from my microdermabrasionist who told be to use the serum in between sessions for better results.  </li>
            <li>I received this serum for free to test and review then give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li>The product would probably work better if the moisturizer being used had ingredients that allowed the hyaluronic acid property to be fully utilized.</li>
            <li>Fantastic serum!</li>
            <li>I bought this serum for my wife as reviews prompted her decision to purchase, and after several days of use she is extremely satisfied with the product and would repurchase this great serum anytime!</li>
            <li>I love my Bert&#x27;s Bees Moisturizer and this</li>
            <li>was the perfect thing to use as Step 1, under my current moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have bought so many skincare products(with glass bottle packaging) before</li>
            <li>Two more words ....</li>
            <li>I thought I saw a difference but not so sure now.  </li>
            <li>I am, however, giving it more time.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and this has helped to tighten and bring moisture to my skin better then any $300.00 product I use to use.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this.....</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>but I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>is looking better.</li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have already purchased a second bottle.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product,I have been using this about a week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>excellent skin product especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li>the skin giving a more youthful affect...</li>
            <li>favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to everybody.</li>
            <li>When I look in the mirror after applying this serum, my face doesn&#x27;t seem to have as many wrinkles.</li>
            <li>more on days I workout.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was any more hydrated than before.</li>
            <li>I have ordered another brand and it works much better.</li>
            <li>I have received this product for free for my HONEST review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>please don&#x27;t stop making this product :)</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this serum.</li>
            <li>Bought it before reading and doing more research.</li>
            <li>, I feel my hands look better than they did before.</li>
            <li>Love this serum and use it nightly under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to a face cream, you may want to add one on top of the serum or mix it in as others have suggested.</li>
            <li>Most products come as a blend.</li>
            <li>But I thought is try ONE more thing before.</li>
            <li>whole line is great.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is the greatest since pools in the back yard.</li>
            <li>I had some psoriasis on my face and after about a week of the treatments, the psoriasis left my face, I was so happy!</li>
            <li>Love this product  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product it has great reviews.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It is dewy, clearer, more balanced and my makeup goes on better now too.</li>
            <li>I think my face is better moisturized</li>
            <li>I use it at home, and I don&#x27;t use it at work, and almost immediately I noticed that on weekends when I&#x27;m at home all day my hands start doing better than when I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li>love what hyaluronic acid does for my skin.  </li>
            <li>But I will buy it again, though perhaps one that includes Vitamin C to help my skin absorb and process the acid more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>The product is okay..</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be purchasing it repeatedly.</li>
            <li>but sure hope to in the many days to come</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t not work, but seems like more water than hyaluronic acid serum......</li>
            <li>Softer than the summer in a humid climate. :-)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not horrible either, dont make me break</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I always make sure I order more when I see that I&#x27;m close to running out.</li>
            <li>Im doing much better now, but just beware of any skin reactions.</li>
            <li>This is ever so much better.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product and I will purchase more.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would work better than it does.  </li>
            <li>This serum also made my wrinkles more prominent..</li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>It had  more effect on the lower cheek area.</li>
            <li>and I like it better.</li>
            <li>And I found it. :-)))</li>
            <li>This product was delivered fast and feels great.</li>
            <li>My skin becomes more hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li>My face is smoother and more radiant.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>It was sealed in plastic, inside the box, and the box was also covered in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;That made me feel safe.</li>
            <li>I t was like magic.</li>
            <li>Now his feet are much better.</li>
            <li>This hyaluronic acid serum seems to work just as well as some of the more pricey ones on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love the fact its not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I do think you could use it without moisturizer, or I seem to be able to, even though I have aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I used it many times but couldn&#x27;t understand why it was so</li>
            <li>love Google.  </li>
            <li>It is supposed to be better to injest it for optimal results.</li>
            <li>I use it after derma rolling to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>My skin is already looking better.</li>
            <li>¬°¬°¬° :)</li>
            <li>The combination of the two really helps me keep my skin looking great.  </li>
            <li>I gave this serum as a Christmas gift to my sisters and friends last year and everyone was impressed.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be better.  </li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim...looking for a skin treatment that might relieve the psoriasis on the top of my foot.  </li>
            <li>Exercise, a healthy diet, and PLENTY of WATER are a must when trying to maintain your skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying more..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two weeks or so now and my face looks more youthful</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a wonderful moisturizer and hydration system for your skin, especially the lines.  </li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and plumps out the skin to make lines mostly invisible.  </li>
            <li>have already ordered 2 more, one for my daughter and one for a friend.</li>
            <li>The products are very inexpensive and do a great job for me.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I love that it comes in a 2 ounce bottle instead of just one.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Already notice my skin looking so much better.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Did nothing for me, I&#x27;d rather purchase Witch hazel waters, it keep moisture and refine the pore much better then this product.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of time reading/ on the computer and would always end up touching my face or chin and would get pimples.</li>
            <li>I love reading reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin looking brighter and feeling way more moisturized.</li>
            <li>skin looks much better since using the serum.</li>
            <li>more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum is more like a delivery system than a stand-in for your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The more &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; of rosewater</li>
            <li>Noticed by many</li>
            <li>I really love this product and plan on continuing to use  </li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>Will give it more time though.</li>
            <li>but like I said, will give more time before concluding anything  </li>
            <li>the more you use it the more results you will see.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this on a cleaned and toned face and see if there is a notable effect, and will update my review accordingly.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, I love what it does for my skin, at a smaller price than Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li>and I am choosing to believe that people will definitely love me more if I have fewer wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I SEE A LOT LOVE</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Ok but I&#x27;m 45 and don&#x27;t see that it has helped fade any of my age spots</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>I will update as more time goes on.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for being able to offer it at such a great price!!</li>

            <li>It isn&#x27;t the most hydrating thing on my counter</li>
            <li>I think it may take more times with my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s such a great bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>Combined with your dermaroller, you get even better results</li>
            <li>Make sure you pat it on or skin does not feel tighter.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sooo many hyaluronic acid serums but never found one</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for about a month, love it.</li>
            <li>And I have tried many products.</li>

            <li>I was very excited to try this HA.</li>

            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or it takes a while to soak in, but you will be able to tell after the first couple of times what amount works best for you.</li>
            <li>so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Product feels clean and nice...</li>
            <li>Seems pure and effective!</li>
            <li>This is a great product of high quality.</li>
            <li>I have been using another brand of hyaluronic acid for two years and have experienced a tremendous amount of success.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the good work;)</li>
            <li>This appears, so far, to be an effective and safe product as well as being a good value.</li>
            <li>I am not young and I don&#x27;t have absolutely perfect skin</li>
            <li>Seems to absorb pretty good and hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for hydration, and really plumps up those fine lines.  </li>
            <li>but the clarity of my skin already looks better and the fine lines between my brows look better.</li>
            <li>Especially fresh and still a little damp out of the shower (best time for application).</li>
            <li>I have known for a very long time that hygienic acid is good for your body, from head to toe!!  </li>
            <li>product itself is really easy to use, it comes with an eye dropper top and you just put the desired amount on your palm</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin you would use it under whatever cream works best for you.</li>
            <li>Nice formulation, not greasy, absorbs &amp; dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the way it&#x27;s bottled with the dropper, makes it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Read up about it for sure before using it because it can be strong.</li>
            <li>Nice and slippery, also dries quickly and non sticky.</li>
            <li>makes my wrinkles look better but more importantly</li>
            <li>The fact that the product is paraben- free and organic makes me love this product even more.</li>
            <li>face does look firmer after using it, then I will use a good moisturizer on top it, I am ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I love it , hydrate , smooth , from the first use you &#x27;ll feel good .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it-really do notice dimished fine lines.</li>
            <li>Think it helps with preventing wrinkles and helps fine lines for sure.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines have mostly disappeared around my eyes.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, the enlarged pores and shadows under my eyes aren&#x27;t as visible, and the fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes have diminished a bit.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are disappearing and blemishes seem to fade like magic.</li>

            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel as oily during the day and my make up goes on more smoothly and seems to stay on my face longer than before.</li>
            <li>I was able to receive this product for free in order to give the company my hoenst review of the serum</li>
            <li>I am 65 years old, have been using the product for about 10 days with great results.  </li>

            <li>my skin drinks this stuff like water - really feels good</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m really qualified to say if it&#x27;s good or bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not greasy, gives a nice fresh plumpness to the face.</li>

            <li>It was shipped very quickly.</li>

            <li>The quality is high and it feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>with high hopes it would be as good as promised from reviews and product description</li>
            <li>Great product, I received it right away and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>Best thing to do is use it right after washing your face while your pores are open.</li>
            <li>Just because its Hyaluronic Acid does not mean it is automatically good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Very light and soaks in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid serum is average, at best..</li>
            <li>it seems to be a nice addition to cream , I apply it first .</li>
            <li>My opinion is that if you can use or add hyaluronic acid serum to to your normal moisturizing routine, it&#x27;s a good thing since it helps your skin retain moisture.  </li>
            <li>BUT, it makes perfect sense to me that if it says it helps seal the moisture in, that it may just help prevent deeper wrinkles down the line.  </li>
            <li>Is very good helps me a lot with my dry skin just 3 drops is all what I need for</li>
            <li>So far so good, too early to tell in terms of results but shipping was fast and it was a great deal :)!</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, and the fine lines are fewer and farther between.</li>
            <li>I still noted my fine line ..</li>
            <li>After one week I can see the fine line disappear, I will deffinetly be re ordering</li>
            <li>I apply it after cleansing and applying moisturizers and it&#x27;s light and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li>And the fine lines by my eyes are all but gone.  </li>
            <li>I used with my sonic infuser and watched my fine lines disappear.</li>
            <li>Smothed out fine wrinkle lines and cleared up blemishes.</li>
            <li>When I mix it with Vitamin C, it helps reduce my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love Hyaluronic serum, particularly after a peel.  </li>
            <li>I am using this in combination with collagen and have noticed a decrease in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I used a really good eye cream and moisturizer with it that usually work great for me but not even they can help me now.</li>
            <li>Does a number on fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I can already see reduction in fine lines and deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Silky smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It helps with fine lines and made my skin feel softer.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines wrinkles are improved.</li>
            <li>Now it seems my skin is really flawless and a lot more firm!</li>
            <li>and I notice it gives my skin a glow and has diminished some of the fine lines I had around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This seems to soften fine wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with a glycolic acid cream at night, and the combination of the two has sloughed away lots of my acne scarring and redness, so that I feel fine going without makeup.</li>
            <li>Fine lines around my eyes seem smoothed</li>
            <li>The fine wrinkles on my hand are disappearing.</li>
            <li>I could tell the first time I used it that my skin was softer, smoother, more even toned, andjust feels better.</li>
            <li>and it depuffs and smooths the fine lines and even gives a tighter appearance.  </li>
            <li>It helps to soften the skin and any fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It reduces fine lines and keeps your skin looking radiant.  </li>

            <li>what a super item,  love this seller</li>
            <li>It feels okay going on and quickly absorbs into the skin, but I&#x27;ve seen no change in my skin, whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It is important that you use a strong SPF sunscreen on your face.</li>
            <li>This product also boosts cell renewal so any scars or pimples, it&#x27;ll heal quick!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and odorless, (to me!)</li>
            <li>I love the feel and texture of this serum, it&#x27;s thicker than some others I&#x27;ve tried but absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>A truly light and smooth formula, spreads easily and dries with no greasy or sticky</li>
            <li>Non greasy, quickly absorbed, noticed a reduction in fine lines and improvement in skin tone within a week of using this!</li>
            <li>Usually you mix it with your own good face cream or make your own formula with Vitamin c crystals ( recipe available on skin forums)</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with Niacinamide Cream and it has made a huge difference in the smoothness of my skin and fine lines</li>
            <li>Nice large bottle.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>

            <li>This product has done a great job on my facial skin</li>
            <li>Light and smooth.</li>
            <li>it is so light that you don&#x27;t feel overloading your skin with products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great Stuff,  I use it twice daily</li>
            <li>My skin is supple and smooth.</li>
            <li>My face feels great and seems to look younger too!  </li>
            <li>Its So Important to Reversing the Aging Process.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it alone but add it to most of my creams including retinal, and day/evening moisturizers and sunblock.</li>
            <li>and I think it is better than this one because it feels like it really penetrates the skin, whereas this product feels like it just rests on the top of the skin.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good  </li>
            <li>As most people know such cosmetics from leading brands must have some date on them, to ensure that the product is still good for use.</li>
            <li>As I said, &amp;#34;So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of fair completion, blue eyes, reddish undertones &amp; many freckles.</li>
            <li>So far so good, so I will continue to buy moving forward.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but it feels good, doesn&#x27;t hurt (have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>So far it was always a battle of pros and cons (if it helps with acne - than it causes over-dryness, if it is a good moisturizer than it&#x27;s causing acne etc).</li>
            <li>I am 48, very nice skin bought it to see if it would help with pores and a fine lines, have been using it daily for almost a month</li>
            <li>The price is very economical for such a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been purchasing cleaning products and have done the most of my Christmas shopping right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>if people keep commenting I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m doing something right .</li>
            <li>So, if my math is right, that means this magical serum is 98.5% distilled water.  </li>
            <li>Price is very fair in comparison to what I have gotten from other companies.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product in comparison to other hydrating serums/creams but if used alone,doesn&#x27;t make miracles.</li>
            <li>All things considered, a very good product at a price almost anyone can take a chance on, which is always a factor when I&#x27;m considering the purchase of a previously unknown product!</li>
            <li>Love this particular one, it&#x27;s the right price for me, and feels so great on my face, I slather it all over my face, and neck after I wash, and I think it really is helping to keep my wrinkles a bit at bay</li>
            <li>My husband wants to know why I&#x27;m looking younger and more beautiful.</li>
            <li>then smooth it on your clean face.</li>
            <li>A great product and I will update this when it&#x27;s had more time to work on the lines on my forehead and these stubborn dark spots.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected to buy, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than three years, and I have been very satisfied with its overall quality.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is also the main ingredient in the popular Juviderm injectables...</li>
            <li>The product is so easy to use and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, just a couple of drops on finger tips and gently rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try! ...</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I fell in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>I do not know exactly what the percentage is in this stuff, but I can tell you that since using it my skin is much more moisturized WITHOUT feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>That bothers me, and makes me suspicious that this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; is mostly water (the first ingredient).</li>
            <li>In conjunction with my moisturizing regimen, it seems to be making a significant difference.</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly when you said it would, and I love it.</li>
            <li>As I said, if I see anything remarkable, I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product so far</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li>This serum goes on smooth and cool to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered a refill of the original brand.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin hydrated, has helped eliminate break outs and has faded sun damage significantly.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it starts working immediately to hydrate and moisturize.</li>
            <li>First time trying hyaluronic acid, enjoyed it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those who don&#x27;t want to put heavy cream on your face at night!</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels fresh!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 60 year old \\&quot;wash and wear\\&quot; male, and am always looking&lt;br /&gt; for a more efficient, faster method with fewer \\&quot;steps\\&quot; to get from the shower to the door, and so this product is ideal for me.</li>
            <li>and I rarely say that about a product!</li>
            <li>It keeps my face very fresh, specially wearing make up.</li>
            <li>my skin looks more youthful and the fine lines and wrinkles have softened so much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and easy to order!</li>
            <li>I have revised my rating to a five star and am getting ready to order another bottle while it is available and very reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li>Works great and holds moisture a long time!  </li>
            <li>Bought it after researching the new &amp;#34;face uplift&amp;#34; cream and combining this with Vitamin C (liquid in capsules), rosemary extract, mint extract and vitamin D to make my own cream.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and drys quickly.</li>
            <li>Face has a more even tone and nice texture to it after only one week.</li>
            <li>I have used several serums in my life, and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I had good skin before, but I think my skin looks amazing now after just a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>While the results aren&#x27;t blow-your-mind amazing, I do see more moisturized and dewy skin on the day following the use of the serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every OTC and Rx on the market for acne, and about a third of treatments for acne scar revision (mainly because most dermatologist aren&#x27;t experienced with cosmetic procedures and treatment for ethnic skin.</li>
            <li>u can get an infection if your face or the roller isn&#x27;t totally clean and sanitized EVERY time.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>helps trap moisture in your skin after your clean and use a toner&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you spill any, it&#x27;s a pain to clean out of clothing</li>
            <li>I know the product is clean and not damaged.</li>
            <li>I have a young look and have been able to pass for mid-late 20&#x27;s for many years now).</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It is light, absorbs quickly and leaves skin moist and looking refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It did come on time and in a clean package.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products for my skin and rarely feel there are any improvements in my skin, but I am ordering more of this product, which says I think it is worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be sure that it is having positive effects, but when I look in the mirror</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it so far!</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell my skin looks better than it did before I did the microneedling 2 weeks ago!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel pretty good, but I got more out of it when I was younger.</li>
            <li>It is always good to try a test area first on any new product.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE this PURE FORM of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li>My wrinkles seem to be responding better to this pure, liquid form.  </li>
            <li>The name implies that the serum is &amp;#34;100% pure Hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; when the serum is actually mostly water.  </li>
            <li>I do this right before bedtime, and wake up with glowing skin!</li>
            <li>Every morning I would wake up with a fresh, clean, and smooth feeling face.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking shiny.</li>
            <li>n fresh looking , I use it after using dermastamp .5 mm and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I truely think I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually my skin looking so good.  </li>
            <li>I believe in this product and am completely satisfied with the whole transaction with the sellers.</li>
            <li>This is the best Hyaluronic serum and the least</li>
            <li>my skin definitely looks good</li>
            <li>Then I smear a dropper full on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>this really works i love this stuff and just bought some for my mother ..</li>
            <li>Love how fast it absorbs.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far.</li>
            <li>I love this Hyaluronic acid because it is real.  </li>
            <li>It seems to make my skin look better, I am thinking it plumps up the skin so the wrinkles don&#x27;t show as much.</li>
            <li>there are only good things to say about this serum.  </li>
            <li>I can not give a true rating to an item I just brought with out</li>
            <li>Wow really great serum double the size of most.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it has diminished all my lines on my forehead, and my skin is baby soft .</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>and I find this to be very satisfactory and on top of which you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>True, it contains nothing else.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this and will be buying it as stocking stuffer for my mom and mother in law. :)</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful, thick, gooey, serum that soaks into your skin and: tightens it, lessens wrinkles, plumps, holds moisture in, softens, adds luminosity, and improves texture.</li>
            <li>( I use Weleda&#x27;s Skinfood  or organic sweet almond oil)</li>
            <li>cannot say enough good things.</li>
            <li>I started seeing some instant results, the bel essence and hyaluronic acid hydrated my skin immediately and made it look good, but after a couple of months, I was seeing permanent change.  </li>
            <li>and it is 2/3 full</li>
            <li>It is nice, but I have used far nicer serums.</li>
            <li>True miracle.  </li>
            <li>I love the compliments from him and how he wants to show me off.</li>
            <li>Its good, next time will try another brand</li>

            <li>Not bad turn</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Great for the dry weather!!</li>
            <li>It plumps up my skin, especially around my mouth and eyes where fine lines are more pronounced!  </li>
            <li>I also highly recommend this for other parts of the body that do not seem to improve even with the best moisturizing habits (like knees and elbows.)    </li>
            <li>It helps my face look full and so smooth, I can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late twenties and started noticing the first fine lines under my eyes and read wonderful reviews on this product.</li>
            <li>Not the case I find I need a full dropper in the palm of my hand and with a quick</li>
            <li>Skin is very, very smooth and just feels more hydrated overall.  </li>
            <li>The other great thing is that you do not need a ton of this to see results.</li>
            <li>Yes it is VEGAN, free of parabens, does not have oils making your skin oily, dye free, free of any fragrances (which normally cause headaches to me) nor does it have any persavatives or fillers;</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how much happiness I am getting out of this little bottle :-)</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>the stuff works well, absorbs quickly......</li>
            <li>My acne has cleared up, my skin is super hydrated but not as oily as It was.</li>
            <li>I will admit that after 3 months of use my face has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li>so I see the difference quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will be a loyal user from now on.</li>
            <li>and I can tell results quite quickly.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>I did receive my bottle free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is solely based off of my own personal experience having used it.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how quickly my skin tightened and improved.</li>
            <li>Was using a different brand of hyaluronic acid and like this one better, and love that I can get it online through Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>quickly calms aches and pains...and joints use anywhere on your body</li>
            <li>It does say no studies have been done on pregnant woman .</li>
            <li>So I wont be using this while pregnant.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and I have been using.  </li>
            <li>I say this because some days, my face looks much better, but on a few days, not as good.</li>
            <li>It goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Also like the fact that it dries quickly</li>
            <li>I decided on this one because is cheaper and has more product, however after more than two months of using it twice daily</li>
            <li>It is quickly to absorb and is not sticky, but I didn&#x27;t see the results I was expecting.</li>
            <li>So I did a quick research on the internet to find out what on earth is \\&quot;hyaluronic acid\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li>Hydrates and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li>It hydrated my face rather quickly and helped to end the peeling one gets after the procedure.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is lovely, I love a simple design and the dropper works well</li>
            <li>Love this particular Hyaluronic Serum.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it for two more weeks, give it a decent shot before discontinuing use.</li>
            <li>You can see the difference in your skin quickly when using this</li>
            <li>It has no odor, and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t report any extraordinary results from it.</li>
            <li>And it has helped tremendously with my ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quick and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>2 drops are plenty, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li>This product has more benefits that can be listed and I particularly like this company.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product for free or for a discounted price in exchange of my personal Honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>I like a matte look, and this does not leave my face looking shiny, because it penetrates so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered many times, and would highly recommend the seller&#x27;s prompt and reliable service.</li>
            <li>easy to use dropper measures out the small amounts needed, great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acid serums and this product is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I then put on my normal moisteriser over the top of this.</li>
            <li>I tried another product with Vitamin C because I wanted to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t missing anything, but I think that the Cosmedia hyaluronic acid is a much better product with better results.  </li>
            <li>I love this product - it makes my daily moisturizer go much further and produces great results.</li>
            <li>From the very first time I used it I started to see softer plumper skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my second brand I have tried and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The results will be very evident soon.</li>
            <li>The very reasonable price is just a bonus!</li>
            <li>It should be the very first product to hit the face after cleansing and toning.  </li>
            <li>Add weekly exfoliating (I use a clay mask), and my skin is now, after a year, so smooth, soft, and skin tone is so great, that the only make up I wear is blush and mascara.  </li>
            <li>,this is one thing that truly does work and is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>BUT, right here on Amazon a cool company called Bulk Supplements sells powdered Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>They have helped my skin&#x27;s general appearance so that when I am make-up free, I look better.</li>
            <li>As I previously stated, I had always used a gel formula and was happy with that product.  </li>
            <li>I just bought my second bottle, and as the first, it arrived promptly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly, improves texture and brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li>He even calls me beautiful out of no where.., kind of creepy</li>
            <li>The serum is good but the alcohol harm the skin by making it so dry .</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and had no weighty</li>
            <li>really like that this product came with a doppler, making it easy to apply.</li>
            <li>i love this skin product it makes my skin so soft and young looking,and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I had tried some other vegan moisturizing products which ended up burning my face, this is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Saw results after the first 3 days!</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li>Amazing hydration solution - two application of this serum in the morning replaces the moisturizer on hot summer days, leaves my skin silky and smooth for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the bottle til gone &amp; will definitely be ordering some more!</li>
            <li>It totally hydrates skin and makes it so smooth!!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite Hyaluronic acid thus far!</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more bottles when the first one is finished :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hyaluronic acid serum over my anti-oxidant (and under mu moisturizer) on my face, neck and chest  for the last year and love it!  </li>
            <li>and she really likes it!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li>Can see a visible difference in your skin after first use!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>&amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, goes on smoothly &amp; dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and because it is a clear liquid, it can be used under a moisturizer or even light makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it could fast improve on any lines, fine or otherwise either, but...</li>
            <li>I have noticed much improvement in fine lines &amp; wrinkles &amp; also pore reduction.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it could fast improve on any lines, fine or otherwise either, but what it does is providing and keeping locked in a layer of moisture that the skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Great for smoothing out skin, probably better on less mature skin</li>
            <li>It is the first product on put on my face after I clean it.  </li>
            <li>Pure and with no additives, this serum makes a huge difference in your skin&#x27;s hydration levels when used over time.  </li>
            <li>100% Pure is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin very dry, this helps hydrate my face....</li>
            <li>I notice my face spores smaller, better skin tone; and and it seems fine wrinkles are gone</li>
            <li>My fine lines seem to rebound back, plus my acne has become better.</li>
            <li>recommend this product not because I hope to receive 50% off my next purchase from them, but because I feel smart in having bought a product so much more inexpensively than another and got what I feel is a better result.</li>
            <li>but I do love this toner as well (maybe not for everyday use) but for that quick pick me upper and that bright Vitamin C skin, this will do!</li>
            <li>This is fantastic and has improved the quality of my skin so much.</li>
            <li>I received it, it was great, and after a few days liquefied, now is like water.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, definite</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t need a ton to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>As a licensed skin professional, I use serums in many of my pre and post procedures.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it given the price point.</li>
            <li>I use this morning and night before applying a moisturizer and do believe it has made a nice difference in the overall texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m more of a natural girl</li>
            <li>I do not think it was worth the money</li>
            <li>Love this so far.</li>
            <li>For the money you pay for this product, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and glows, need I say more</li>
            <li>My skin feels more elastic and soft.  </li>
            <li>But I am more surprised at what it has done for my hair.  </li>
            <li>After this serum is absorbed my face looks brighter.</li>
            <li>The following is my honest opinion and experience with the product.</li>
            <li>makes my skin soft and smooth, and evens out those lines and wrinkles!  </li>
            <li>but so far I haven&#x27;t been satisfied until this product.  </li>
            <li>massage in until absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the wrinkles are almost completely gone, although I didn&#x27;t have many to begin with.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I know what I&#x27;ve seen with my own eyes after about 4-6 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>the entire face is really good and the price is really affordable ......</li>
            <li>As far as softer skin is concerned, I still apply a moisturizer on top as well..</li>
            <li>product seems okay so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, only $14, but the review/ rave makes me expect much more from this product.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is a key ingredient in most skincare products and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it might just be there to provide &amp;#34;slip.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t see that it has shown any kind of improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for about a week, but it goes on nicely and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>The serum is not greasy, is rapidly absorbed, and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is  absorbed in seconds but didn&#x27;t like the consistency, too watery, so</li>
            <li>I have only used the product for about a month which I believe is really too soon to do a fair rating.  </li>
            <li>Once absorbed, does not interact with makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple weeks, but it has softened my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I received this at a complimentary but all views presented above are my own.</li>
            <li>and gives a fresh feel however if you are expecting it to work miracles , its not what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>it keeps my skin really soft love it</li>
            <li>So far my skin is firmer and more plump.</li>
            <li>and it dries or is absorbed</li>
            <li>My face is now youthful, more plumper, clear, and glowing.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more drastic results this far into using.</li>
            <li>Several people have mentioned how nice my skin looks and asked what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li>I liked the product and bought the 8 oz because i&#x27;m planning to make this product part of my regular regime.</li>
            <li>Does not feel greasy &amp; is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is so worth</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>effective- watch out for fluid accumulation around nasal-labiel fold that causes drying/flaking.  </li>
            <li>Thi is my second order, love this stuff my skin is so smooth after I apply this, I use morning and night.</li>
            <li>is soft., but after the passing of the day ... I began to see the difference, clearer skin, better.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels with this gel, soft, hidrated...</li>
            <li>Though it is not advertised as such, this serum is also VERY useful for making aging hands look better.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews were positive and as someone who is in her 50&#x27;s, I was interested in trying different products to keep my skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Even my &#x27;thinking wrinkle&#x27; (that pesky wrinkle right between your eyes), which I&#x27;ve had since my early 20s, looks better.</li>
            <li>I love the dropper, no mess like the squirt tops.</li>
            <li>I am in my very late 30&#x27;s and armed this along with healthy eating, am looking forward to my 40&#x27;s and beyond!!!</li>
            <li>First, I do not feel any greasy; my skin absorb quickly and I did not feel any greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even waste money on a moisturizer any more!!  </li>
            <li>I have even had a few (yes, more than one!!)</li>
            <li>my skin feels very nice and looks firm</li>
            <li>I am in my late 20&#x27;s but have been keeping good care of my skin, well trying too!</li>
            <li>Also this product is a good value as compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 19, but its great for dark spots and giving your face a smooth glow!  </li>
            <li>and this is the right product for</li>
            <li>This serum is right up with the pricier serums.</li>
            <li>Soaks right in</li>
            <li>I feel this works and the price is right.</li>
            <li>And, the price is right.</li>
            <li>It soaks right into your skin.  </li>
            <li>but I can feel like my skin gets lifted right after I apply it.</li>
            <li>This serum soaks right into your skin without leaving a tacky residue.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after I was my face or after a shower.  </li>
            <li>I use product 3 times a week every night and I use just the right amount so my face is not too oily but meets the right amount needed for my skin pores.</li>
            <li>I use jojoba oil to moisturize and it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>I put it on each night right before putting on my night cream.</li>
            <li>But with the right moisturizer, this isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li>The right combination of products makes all the difference.</li>
            <li>I use it right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li>right after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>No smell, no reactions, right consistency.</li>
            <li>Noticed results right away.</li>
            <li>honestly right now I&#x27;m still questioning it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>I got it right away</li>
            <li>, also, I put this on immediately after I clean my face with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, while it&#x27;s still moist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of products on Amazon, and this is the first time that I&#x27;m completely baffled by why something received so many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>This is especially important to me since I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li>The product feels good and my skin is smooth and a little bit cleaner, but further use will tell me more.</li>
            <li>something that happens to me on a daily basis because I have oily and very very easily clogged pores which I fight with the clarisonic and bha product).</li>
            <li>I have excellent skin for a 77 year old with very few wrinkles, no crow&#x27;s feet at the eyes or mouth lines.</li>
            <li>I primarily purchased it because of its high ratings and reviews.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily, great for acne prone skin, dry mature skin as well</li>
            <li>I love the super short ingredient list since there are just three ingredients: distilled water, hyaluronic acid, benzyl-alcohol(0.5%).</li>
            <li>When I first started with the product, it immediately absorbed in my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, and really plump the skin to make it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Cool gel package came fast and bottle was in tact and sealed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel a watered down product works as good.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are disappearing and my skin is sooooo soft!</li>
            <li>My face looks a little smoother, feels nice and makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>, it enhances every other serum to performe in a better way, I mix it with my other serum and they penetrate better in skin and show amazing results than before used alone without this hyaluronic serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They are not very bad, but they are there</li>
            <li>I am 43 years old, and I have tried other hyaluronic acids and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t noticed that huge of an improvement in the appearance of my skin, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t get new acne with this product (</li>
            <li>way I use it is right after a hot shower while my face is still moist from the steam i apply the product.</li>
            <li>It gets in the skin super fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and tightens up the face a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased others and the consistency was just a bit off, and I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin except that it felt dry.  </li>
            <li>I think it may take a few more weeks to see a more noticable change.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin so that&#x27;s good, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to taking Hyalorunic acid capsules rather than using a serum.</li>
            <li>This serum seem to gets in the skin super fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and tightens up the face a bit.</li>
            <li>It really is for sensitive skin, reduces pore size, decreases wrinkles, and gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It feels rather like a light Aloe Vera gel that dries nice and firm.</li>
            <li>It does make it work better if you spray a light mist of water on AFTER applying the serum, or just wet your hands, shake the excess water, and rub on the skin that you applied the serum to.</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly, and the stuff really worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used $30 serums with both hyaluronic acid and vitamin c, and honestly this is much cheaper and gives the same result.</li>
            <li>these products I&#x27;m talking about like retinol and glycolic peel will make your skin sensitive to the sun and will easily make you burn.</li>
            <li>Words are just not enough, you would have to actually use this serum to see how great it is.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quick and it really boasts the abosbtion of retinol and mosturizer.</li>
            <li>This brand is reasonably priced and ships quickly.  </li>
            <li>works great with Organic Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;fine lines on upper lip have started to disappear and the pore around the nose area already appear smaller in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>This  Hyaluronic Acid Serum was quick absorbing and was not oily or greesy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for hyluronnic acid serums, this is a good one, however a bit too liquid for a serum, not my favorite but a decent product.</li>
            <li>but when I do use it as consistently as I should my skin feels so incredibly soft, without exaggeration, I can honestly say it truly does feel as soft as baby skin.  </li>
            <li>I truly enjoy using Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Cosmedica because it is all NATURAL!</li>
            <li>I really like the way the serum absorbs into your skin right away, leaving it feeling hydrated and fresh</li>
            <li>It dries very fast.  </li>
            <li>it is now, I will continue to keep getting it, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I do like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I am 58 and very fortunate for my age as I look years younger</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>--I have another similar product I&#x27;m trying that is more of a gel, but it takes longer to dry and ends up kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised that it came so quickly!</li>
            <li>so I read a little and learned that hyaluronic acid is good for hair as well.  </li>
            <li>Awesome serum - a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li>If your skin is dry or becoming dry this is a nice natural way to make it feel better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and gentle, specially for winter or</li>
            <li>I would recommend using it before a good moisturizer and don&#x27;t use with other strong products like vitamin C serum, alternate days for each.</li>
            <li>when now you can buy Hyaluronic acid with vitamin c and e added to it for only a couple dollars more.</li>
            <li>Not much is needed for it to be effective, I also received this product promptly from the seller.</li>
            <li>It came fast and this product is the bomb!</li>
            <li>It was the first time I heard about Hyaluronic Acid and decided to check if Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li>After about the first week I saw my face gradually begin to lift.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute must in skin care!</li>
            <li>I also decided to use it on my hands (trying one hand first as a trial) and can see a difference between the two hands, so I started using on both hands</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m running low, def gonna buy more</li>
            <li>All I can say is it really works!  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something to complete my nightly skin care routine and this definitely fit the bill.</li>
            <li>After several uses the serum, my skin was feeling more refreshed.</li>
            <li>I will not only keep using it but will most likely purchase more.</li>
            <li>I happen to see a Dr. Oz show with a dermatologist on talking about Hyaluronic Acid and to buy a serum where that ingredient was one of the first three ingredients in the product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my pores that I&#x27;ve seen the most changes in, my pores are way smaller.</li>
            <li>I use both day and night and my face has an overall better appearance.</li>
            <li>At first I started using this serum</li>
            <li>Started to smell funny after a week.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product.</li>
            <li>was alternating days between using and not using the serum before going to bed when I first got the serum.</li>
            <li>I am now using the serum every night and results are more obvious with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will be the second bottle that I have started using and I truly love this product.</li>
            <li>Okay I just received this in the mail last week.</li>
            <li>This is the first time using hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>From the first time I put a drop on my finger and rubbed it on my face</li>
            <li>Someone else mentioned how it left a matt look to your skin that was quite appealing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>This seems to hydrate my skin pretty well and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li>With the moisturizer only penetrating through the top layer.  </li>
            <li>Be patient because this product really does work and for the price it is worth trying it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first of it</li>
            <li>My overall skin tone has improved and seems brighter and more even.</li>
            <li>At first, I was unsure of this product.</li>
            <li>Seams to brighten my completion and moisturize pretty well..</li>
            <li>This is my first usage of a hylauronic acid product.</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products but I&#x27;ve never found anything that equals the speed and quality of Hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>Which is the reason I tried it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I can say it has no Oder and feels smooth,  as far as anything else .</li>
            <li>, let it soak in, then apply my regular moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have issues with dryness since it is absorbed really well into the skin.</li>
            <li>Will be coming back for more....</li>
            <li>Made skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li>I combine it with a favorite moisturizer or sunscreen and use it daily.</li>
            <li>I notice the difference just from the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li>I add this to my daily sunscreen to make it more pliable.</li>
            <li>I use this after a derma-roll and it soooothes my red skin then top off with vitamin C -</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well under face cream, and I feel like it PLUMPS up my cheeks too!</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing when it is applied and the skin has an overall appearance of smoothness..</li>
            <li>I have nothing else left to say, ok</li>
            <li>I am using it in combination with my higher end lotions and cremes.  </li>
            <li>We did just one foot first.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that I should have gotten more.</li>
            <li>so mush better now and younger</li>
            <li>the only problem is that Im from Chile, south America and i have some delivery dificoulties to get this product.please send it to my country .I would pay even more if you want, but let me get it becouse in my country is impossible.thank you and Buy it</li>
            <li>I FIRST APPLY THE VITAMIN C</li>
            <li>After the treatment my skin looks exactly as if I would just visit the cosmetologist.</li>
            <li>it has a funny consistency, but once you apply it and it dries, you wont even know you have it on.</li>
            <li>water is listed as the first ingredient with hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;second.</li>
            <li>those who over 35 and are starting to experience more dryness in their skin.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li>Really firms skin!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling beautifully smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad clumpy at first.</li>
            <li>I have found that the thicker serum that I made is even more beneficial for my skin than Cosmedica&#x27;s- especially with smoothness and moisture retention.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, seems to be hydrating already!  </li>
            <li>WILL NEED MORE TIME FOR FINAL RESULTS AND REVIEW.</li>
            <li>i can feel my skin is getting smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have used better BUT is a third of the price</li>
            <li>this is the first time I am using this product so I won&#x27;t know the results until close to the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Maybe I will add more later if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li>It intensely moisturizes, without feeling greasy!</li>
            <li>I tried it first and now have both sisters and both daughters using it.    </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and it makes my make go on smooth and stay longer, not to mention it helps with my wrinkles which have started to fade at my ripe old age of 60.</li>
            <li>are more than enough.  </li>
            <li>I appears to be exactly what it is said to be --</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I notice the difference.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased an acid serum before</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It is very soothing!  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve only had this product for about 24 hours</li>
            <li>It seems to tighten my face when I first put it on, but the sensation isn&#x27;t permanent.</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My pores looks smaller and my skin looks more radiant.</li>
            <li>It may not be injections, but for the price, it&#x27;s pretty darned close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for the past year and have seen excellent results.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first but after using it for about three weeks I see a Big difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin feel moist, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>will go back for more.</li>
            <li>The first bottle of the serum contained a liquid serum.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to go several months without it after using this.</li>
            <li>Works very Well!  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it, smells funny....</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use this daily so cannot be sure i see results.</li>
            <li>so I use it first and then put on a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I use the Vitamin C toner first, then this and then my moisturizers before I put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li>It looks even better the next day.</li>
            <li>Once a week, I do a 1 minute glycolic peel (30%) then rinse off and apply hylauronic acid and just a simple moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve tried, though, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others.)  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get it how this product gets five star reviews, and even i bought it considering the stellar ratings.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft..</li>
            <li>either my concealer is working better or this is really starting to make a difference to the texture of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>After consistently using this product I truly see a difference.</li>
            <li>Just be aware that it could have the reverse effect.</li>
            <li>I was at first hesitant</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more from this seller.</li>
            <li>I wish they could offer this in a way you could use on your whole body!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had long enough to be 100% sure that its as good as my regular Hyaluronic , but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Has been using it for more than a month and my skin fells and looks younger .</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>No weird chemicals in it</li>
            <li>Also, I swear after the first two times I used it I broke out.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought the 2oz bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft and smooth-</li>
            <li>Now, after only a week, I have to lightly pat my skin with my fingertips for about a minute so that it will absorb the hyaluronic acid!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s because of this product but not only I love my skin, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only 2 uses, my skin tone is more even, my skin is brighter and all-in-all</li>
            <li>in the morning I wash my face and apply serum first and facial cream with vitamin C on top of it.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum,  It could all be my imagination, but I think the product works, makes my skin look better.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many different products for aging skin over the years.</li>
            <li>BACK GUARANTEE if you are not completly satisfied...</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first oil type serum.</li>
            <li>This was first experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I really can&#x27;t see a difference!</li>
            <li>After using this product for a few weeks, the serum turns into water and is no longer good.  </li>
            <li>This serum actually works, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (i have very sensitive skin), and it works not only on the face, but it also works on hands (which we tend to forget and hands, no matter how perfect our facial skin may be, our hands are often neglected and show our true age).</li>
            <li>This a really good HA compared to the other highly reviewed ones on amazon.</li>
            <li>-those tiny dry lines not associated with your eyes or mouth- on my face which has greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews for any product I buy online but for the first time I actually have to say this is amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really see if its working, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference like many of the other reviews make it seem like it does.</li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing this again due to the hyaluronic acid vitamins are more effective for me.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, had really high expectation but doesn&#x27;t really hydrate or plump or do anything.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped my 50-year old skin with dryness, fine lines.</li>
            <li>I use it all over, but it is very effective for dry spots, including facial excema!</li>
            <li>I also combine it with other ingredients to make a nice l-ascorbic vitamin c face treatment.</li>
            <li>Seems to add with other series nicely...</li>
            <li>and it was reasonably priced, considering many higher priced products only  &amp;#34;CONTAIN&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know whether to credit this serum or the other products i am using with it.</li>
            <li>I also question whether it&#x27;s as effective as the other serum I&#x27;ve been using by Image Skin Care where the #1 ingredient is</li>
            <li>It also has a relatively light consistency and doesn&#x27;t carry a strong smell like some other skin products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other more espensive products reveal results quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>We shall see how long my true &amp; accurate review lasts..</li>
            <li>I use this every night in conjunction with my vitamin C serum for a fresh and vibrant glow.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the fine lines are not as apparent.  </li>
            <li>I waited until I used the whole bottle before writing a review to be sure i gave it enough time.</li>
            <li>3 drops are more than enough to cover my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li>My regular moisturizer is working way better - my skin feels hydrated for much longer with this underneath.  </li>
            <li>This is my best kept secret to soft supple skin.</li>
            <li>You do seem to get some skin irritation when using too much directly on your skin every night or if you use it more than once a day (if directly applied).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising how much you get from a few drops.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, it just isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough for my skin , I had to combine it with a facial cream..</li>
            <li>The package is nice and secure with thick bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I think you should only have to do this one time-it is always the same I said it was good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the public eye daily and get compliments on how good my hair and skin look.</li>
            <li>This is 100% pure hyaluronic acid at a very!</li>
            <li>Has helped my dry skin, and helps other products absorb more thoroughly and more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Still looking for positive results.</li>
            <li>in all, my experience with the product is a positive one.ter, hyaluronic acid, benzyl-alcohol(0.5%).</li>
            <li>in all, my experience with the product is a positive one.</li>
            <li>Really like this, you do need to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel (and look) really hydrated, which is a nice change from other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My first time using this--I really like it.</li>
            <li>The ll lines are better but not completely gone, still working on it.  </li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every day and put Retinol cream or make up or sunscreen, etc.</li>
            <li>And in fact, people should start taking care of their skin in their 20s because it&#x27;s easier to keep a smooth, wrinkle free skin rather than trying to erase or hide wrinkles and other imperfections.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels so hydrated and plump, cool, and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it&#x27;s been a lot of help for fading my scars and dark spots as well as</li>
            <li>It makes it feel soft and cool.</li>
            <li>It helps me with dark spots, fine lines and gives an overall healthy glow to my skin!</li>
            <li>Better yet, those high end products mysteriously are never shipped yet they still bill for the products that were never received.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many many HA serum before, some are 10 time more expensive!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 1 % people and that&#x27;s the highest you&#x27;ll find on Amazon, works well with other facial moisturizers, nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Since using this best-selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum on my skin, I have noticed an improvment to my skin texture as it leaves my skin looking bright and feeling moisturized while the lines that I have noticed due to natural aging are diminished and appear much much softer.</li>
            <li>It is so excessively dry and flaky I just cannot believe one use of this stuff could cause so many issues.</li>
            <li>By morning your skin needs more hydration, skin seems dry.  </li>
            <li>My hands look a ton more youthful &amp; my feet are no longer dry or scratchy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles only lighter ones, I am trying to use more natural products to delay some of the wrinkling process as much as I can :)</li>
            <li>If you purchase this, make sure you wet your face first and then apply the product.  </li>
            <li>It does slightly dry out your skin, so make sure you are using it with Moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not too sure about what, exactly, this product is supposed to do, but it seems to do nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the anti wrinkle or uffy eye thing, but this stuff is magic in a bottle for ultra dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you do not put something on top, it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Simple ingredients, gel consistency that spreads and penetrates easily.  </li>
            <li>It does dry out your face more in the winter</li>
            <li>the wetter the better and just let it air dry</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin really soft</li>
            <li>tell me recently, how smooth and pretty my skin looks.</li>
            <li>That made me realize this probably doesn&#x27;t have anything strong enough to help my skin.</li>
            <li>With the big size and affordable price, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Hardly long enough to give a fair assessment.</li>
            <li>The left side of my face/head has proven to be resistant to products that work great on the other side, you know, the side that HASN&#x27;T BEEN HANGING OUT THE DRIVER&#x27;S SIDE WINDOW FOR 40 YEARS!</li>
            <li>COSMEDICA&#x27;s leading seller is this pure hyaluronic acid serum in the 60 cc (2 oz) bottle.</li>
            <li>I mix it with pure vitamin c powder, pure vitamin A and E oil</li>
            <li>(CosMedix Pure C ).</li>
            <li>pure HA.</li>
            <li>I thought &amp;#34;why pay for creams with it in them when I can get the pure product?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>100 % pure hyaluronic serum.</li>
            <li>This serum is pure hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>My pores are still large</li>
            <li>This is a pure liquified form.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to others without hesitation.</li>
            <li>My goal, to find products that are pure and does not contain sodium benzoate.</li>
            <li>I have acne scarring and large pores.  </li>
            <li>Will certainly re-purchase.  </li>
            <li>100% Pure (2oz/60ml)</li>
            <li>It made me wonder whether all these positive reviews are real??</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing, I have no idea where these positive reviews are coming from</li>
            <li>It comes out like a loose gel and warms in your had and goes on more like a liquid.</li>
            <li>It is a very affordable and easy to mix with daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It totally met my expectations and confirmed positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using about a month and have noticed an improvement in fine lines and overall skin texture.  </li>
            <li>I can not say yet if it lessens fine lines, but I can say that it definitely has an effect on the texture of your skin and holds moisture.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my face, particularly on my fine lines and wrinkles; it&#x27;s definitely not causing me any break-outs</li>
            <li>I can see a big difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are gone and deeper lines getting smaller every day &amp; pours are shrinking.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller and I have smoother skin with fewer fine lines.</li>
            <li>She is 12 years older than me and looks my age!</li>
            <li>thank you Cosmedica for acting so quickly!</li>
            <li>Product is pure hyaluronic acid serum which works very well to soften and hydrate skin.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this product and was surprised with such positive results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing deal, it lasted a little over two months using it twice a day on my face and once a day on my chest and tummy.</li>
            <li>I decided to see what all the hype is about, and let me tell you the stuff in this little bottle is amazing.</li>
            <li>This really helps with fine lines around eyes, above lips &amp; on neck.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...something that really hydrates my abnormally dry skin!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as faithfully as I should, so I haven&#x27;t seen any major, long term results (my own fault)</li>
            <li>No false promises with this product</li>
            <li>After using this product faithfully for the last two months, I can see and feel a huge difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m not constantly worried about my face being oily, it use to be a huge insecurity</li>
            <li>I actually also use Great Lakes Collagen (in the green container) in my coffee.</li>
            <li>Not only did this not make my face feel great, but it actually dried it out.  </li>
            <li>I use retinol and bp on my skin which can be very drying.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>It is really a night and day difference.</li>
            <li>Result is basically the same as with prior brands (better hydration and moisture than with regular OTC moisturizers, diminished pores and skin texture); however, this one beats the price :-)</li>
            <li>Really really worked.</li>
            <li>Really plumps your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I was really looking for something to work and give me the promising results.</li>
            <li>Really soaks in and smoothes skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if I can tell a difference, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I felt like my face was &#x27;molting&#x27; to give way to a much smoother, youthful epidermis.</li>
            <li>It really makes your skin feel hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for the rest of my skin at all - either used alone or under moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very efficient in moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 54) or anything, but I really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I appreciated the reviews.</li>
            <li>I received it 3 days ago, but have noticed that it really rehydrates and gives your skin a polish.</li>
            <li>It really works wonders.</li>
            <li>It really changed my skin.</li>
            <li>and I really likes it...</li>
            <li>I really have to say that I noticed a difference in my skin within a week.  </li>
            <li>And she really likes the texture</li>
            <li>you rub the serum between your fingers, it has a very slippery feel to it.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>I really think its helping with some darker spots I have on my face</li>
            <li>The HA really does boost the moisture level in my skin and helps transport the cream into the dermis.</li>
            <li>It does hydrate and smooth out wrinkles when you use it with your regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very drying on my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product arrived in a timely manner and was wrapped in a very protected manner.</li>
            <li>Too much alcohol in this.</li>
            <li>Gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;you really need to use a moisturizer after this</li>
            <li>I really notice my skin feels softer and smoother, and moisturized after I use the Cosmedica brand serum.  </li>
            <li>Next time I will search for an alcohol free brand.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>the beginning I used it all over my face and noticed that it was over drying the parts of my face that aren&#x27;t very oily.</li>
            <li>Now I smooth on 2-3 drops of serum and then do the same with 2-3 drops of my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>With this routine, my skin feels tighter and so much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast this works.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waster your money it does absolutely nothing for your skin.</li>
            <li>I have spent many more $$ on branded name items for my sensitive skin care products and did not get the the same results.  </li>
            <li>My Husband also said that my skin looked much healthier to him and felt so much softer than it ever has</li>
            <li>Very diluted serum.</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>I do annual mesotherapy and all kinds of staff, but it helps me to maintain my skin during the whole year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can really tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>If u want to really go crazy-get a derma-roller and use this after.</li>
            <li>fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff..</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t see much difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed one</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much time using the serum.</li>
            <li>My skn has been much softer.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating and is what they have advertised for this product.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to lock in moisture and works</li>
            <li>But, you can&#x27;t apply too much if you&#x27;re wearing it under make up--or you will get flakiness..</li>
            <li>About a week into using this product, I really appreciate its affordable price and truly beneficial results...</li>
            <li>This serum has really made a difference in how my face feels and looks.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I had lost a lot of moisture in my skin over the winter and this product has really helped.</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It does take a couple of weeks to really see the difference it makes so be patient.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I bought this serum because this product advertised that: \\&quot;Heal dryness on face with intense hydration\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>Generous size and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I like the way this serum goes on, it dries fast and leaves no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The result is that both of those products are much lighter, which I really like.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product, but have heard that it can really help</li>
            <li>The product was as described by seller, arrived very on time,</li>
            <li>I rely so much on a product&#x27;s rating before I decide to buy .</li>
            <li>; delivery was very prompt.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and having not used anything like this in a while, expected more pronounced results.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and use this instead of moisturizer and it works very well</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that could help to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; up my skin, especially near the eyes.</li>
            <li>, however it didn&#x27;t do much for the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really wonder whether this even is what it says it is.</li>
            <li>Could see a difference straight away.  </li>
            <li>Is there anything out there that really works?????</li>
            <li>but I am absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li>The good&lt;br /&gt;-The serum helps my moisturizers absorb into my skin much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had a breakout since using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do give this product five stars for performance, but that&#x27;s not the only important aspect of a purchase choice.&lt;br /&gt;In case</li>
            <li>It is FANTASTIC stuff, and it does all of the above for me.</li>
            <li>How maddening is it to know that a company wants to dupe you?</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Goes on evenly, absorbs fast, leaves no residue, but neither does it do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell much with using it.</li>
            <li>my skin really glows on this...amazing product.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to order my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li>, so much smother &amp; tighter.</li>
            <li>I use about 3 drops and it leaves my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well</li>
            <li>It really works.....</li>
            <li>I love it when I get my order when it&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t really comment on the product, I like the service they&#x27;ve provided.</li>
            <li>this just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.</li>
            <li>If you use a moisturizer afterward, it really seems to HELP that moisturizer work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the level of moisture or texture in my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for over two weeks now and haven&#x27;t really seen any difference.</li>
            <li>Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>It really helps to moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps to hydrate around your eyes too.</li>
            <li>Really aggravating.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t believe they would use such cheap bottling....</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and well-done packaging.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Although the consistency is more watery than I expected, it still hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Not the real deal</li>
            <li>He told me that out of all the many $1000&#x27;s that i&#x27;ve spent over the years on skincare, this $14.95 Amazon Prime product has literally proven to work and show results immediately.</li>
            <li>and I do not have to buy it very often.</li>
            <li>, this product works really well with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and doesn&#x27;t get oily during the day (no shine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and at night a whole dropperful each time..when my eyes are puffy and even when they are not..</li>
            <li>but I AM MUCH HAPPIER with this product.  </li>
            <li>Really plumps your skin.</li>
            <li>Meh, didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Lines fade much faster and plump up.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t really noticed but</li>
            <li>Much smoother.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>This just seemed to not do much of anything.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll wait and see if my skin really changes to know if I&#x27;d purchase this product again</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have had lines around my eyes  for quite a while and this product really reduces them.</li>
            <li>You dont need to apply to much.</li>
            <li>and I felt that it didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li>No matter how much of this product I put on my face, everything just soaks in.</li>
            <li>So much for that.  </li>
            <li>It really did reduce the appearance of a couple of stubborn lines I had on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very runny and watery.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product,.</li>
            <li>I did mix the serum in straight organic shea butter.</li>
            <li>I hope she likes it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>and I really like.</li>
            <li>&amp; I know from my classes how much benefict Hyaluric acid can be so beneficial.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been keeping telling me that she really loves it.</li>
            <li>you feel the skin tighten and absorbing.</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels after I apply the toner .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li>Did not notice much of difference since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>I do believe it has even smoothed out very superficial lines.</li>
            <li>Went on very smoothly as I gently patted on my face.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>I still use this with my night cream and in the morning my skin feels really moisturized.</li>
            <li>I just turned 40 and noticed my skin is much dryer than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin looks with these two.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating for the skin and helps fade sun spots.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference on the days that I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I really like the way my skin feels after it.</li>
            <li>Mine skin looks much healthier and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Moisturizes and dries fast.</li>
            <li>suited to my skin very well.i m using it just for over a week.skin became lighter and it doesnt blocked my pores.will</li>
            <li>This product really controls the oil and ensures that my skin stays matte all day.</li>
            <li>the whole concept is it helps to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li>And really, nothing, but nothing, comes close to using tretinoin  </li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and fast shipper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However Amazon handles my complaint very prompt and good.</li>
            <li>After reading all the negative reviews I was hesitant to order this product, but did anyways because of the good price just to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But so far I have really enjoyed this addition to my daily skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>2 oz seems a lot for this kind of product because you only need a dime size drop for your entire face.</li>
            <li>I am unable to determine yet which product is more effective, if there is going to be a difference in results.</li>
            <li>It was easily absorbed by the skin and left a silky, fresh feel.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve liked the few \\&quot;serum\\&quot; type products  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying this serum at least twice a day since I received it because it feels so good.</li>
            <li>I have heard nothing but great things about HA but typically, beauty products do not have a high enough dose to see the results it touts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acids that plump up my wrinkles better and make my skin softer (Perlabella Hyaluronic Acid Pure Dose).</li>
            <li>Great, affordable, 2 small drops are all I need to cover my face and neck, sinks into the skin really quick.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t normally try to hurt a company&#x27;s sales by posting recipes on how to make their product in 7.5 seconds for less than a dollar, but I rely on honest Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>I saw this product while looking for other natural facial products and it already had great reviews.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever used hyaluronic acid, seems to help your skin shed cells and creat new</li>
            <li>Even though it is not very expensive it works well .</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to any person wanting a simple yet effective facial routine.</li>
            <li>It tightens, more than it plumps, like with other serums.</li>
            <li>I also believe this product helps my skin absorb other products better</li>
            <li>Olay or other store brands are of better quality.</li>
            <li>My pores instantly shrink after using this, your skin looks so fresh!</li>
            <li>It tightens, more than it plumps, like with other serums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now &amp; my skin looks &amp; feels much better after using it along with my other skin care products .</li>
            <li>Overall this is a product worth having to boost hydration!</li>
            <li>It has the most HA content that I have seen in other products.</li>
            <li>With a little patience, this product does exactly what it is supposed to do:  it binds to water and allows greater hydration of the skin.  </li>
            <li>and i recommend using other moisture products with it to enhance the hydration function. :)</li>
            <li>I tried it after using Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid (which has witch hazel, aloe and Vit C among other things) but found that the Oz Naturals had a better effect.</li>
            <li>I tried so many other things; how else am I going to find out if they work on ME?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no negative skin reactions whatsoever!</li>
            <li>As with most other serums, you do need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I feel like I use more of this than other serums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so well hydrated that my combination skin is now normal!</li>
            <li>Extremely hid rating and non greasy :)</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, the dry patches are gone and my overall skin tone is even and has its youthful glow back</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re gonna feel like all the fluids absorbed into the pores instantly and the face skin more dry than before it was applied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very simple and clean, looks like a medicine a doctor might prescribe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instantly I felt a smoothness and clean feeling after applying the product.  </li>
            <li>pretty sure it&#x27;s missing something</li>
            <li>I apply this product first on clean skin and let it dry for a minute.</li>
            <li>It does dry your skin if you use too much, so go easy with it.  </li>
            <li>The acid isn&#x27;t strong enough to make you feel the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;, and with gentle exfoliation you can keep that young looking skin forever.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my skin draw in more moisture and helps fade my dark acne scars</li>
            <li>I have oil skin and pretty sensitive, but it just works perfectly for my skin without any uncomfortable!</li>
            <li>Great product for the price, saw immediate results, now few days later, my mature aging skin looks &amp; feels almost like a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li>and it works so fast I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Many sites stated that the hylauronic acid molecule is actually too large to actually penetrate and work in skincare products.</li>
            <li>Extra fast super delivery in 5 days (take in consideration am on APO address and everything we order is taking 12 to 15 days ) 2.</li>
            <li>While it is pricier, I would rather pay for something that works vs. continuing on with a cheaper, far less effective product.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, is completely non-greasy, and it absorbs quickly without drying my moderately sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price on this was best but the actual absorption was hardly noticeable like the smaller one by another company.</li>
            <li>but I have to say you certainly get what you pay for and a little more with this product.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient in this bottle is distilled water, and I think that the hyaluronic acid is so diluted that it&#x27;s nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li>Whole face appears younger, more defined and youthful after only a two week period.</li>
            <li>but wow, it works fast!  </li>
            <li>This is an average product, it&#x27;s ok for the value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used much more expensive Hyaluronic Serums, and I think this one is possibly just as good.  </li>
            <li>you know those claims \\&quot;see results instantly, full results in 4-6weeks\\&quot;, only those results never happen.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;ve tried to consciously stay out of the sun if I could help it.</li>
            <li>Pretty good deal!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been browsing for Hyaluronic acid but usually cost a lot for a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>Healing and moisturizing to skin love this product have suffered from acne and through the healing process this has helped with dark spot removal and scars will continue to use this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on 49 years old and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I am requesting a full refund and sendinf this back.</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone as well and will normally flareup in breakouts if I try anythng new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>Its only been week with no bad skin reactions.</li>
            <li>This product actually works, has kept my face clear of breakouts and it does minimize the fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have considered putting some in a smaller bottle to keep in my bathroom and put the large bottle in the fridge to keep it fresh longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, after using half of the first bottle, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have been looking for something a little extra to help moisturize around the yes and thought that this was perhaps the solution.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my liquid gold, the one product I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different brands and this is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so good that my dry and rough patches are gone!</li>
            <li>super smoothing, absorbs quickly, never clogs my pores, I use it over other serums, such as vitamin C and firming serums, under my foundation for happy skin..LOVE it.</li>
            <li>The more I used the serum, the less I noticed the tight/dryness.</li>
            <li>It is softer, more supple, and the wrinkles are slightly less pronounced.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the outcome and gradual improvements, I can truly say that there is a 60-70% less breakouts now for my skin condition.</li>
            <li>On all products the less ingredients the better.  </li>
            <li>The serum has a slightly smell, ok smell.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know if its just the serum or the serum less stress, love..</li>
            <li>I use this along with Vitamin C, E and A serums and it seems to work a lot better and cost a lot less than what I was using before.</li>
            <li>SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex]] instead.</li>
            <li>Anther for buying the larger size bottle - use on both face and hands and see a return to that healthy younger look.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my skin so well and gives it a vibrant mellow look like I just stepped out the shower.</li>
            <li>So the skin overall will feel much more smoothed after several days of use.</li>
            <li>I had used another, more expensive hyaluronic product before, but this one works just as well or better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give a true rating as yet as I haven&#x27;t used it for a long period</li>
            <li>This particular acid can&#x27;t penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li>works better than some of the more expensive products that iI have used.</li>
            <li>I use it at night, then apply a light moisturizer, the next morning my face and neck are soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>Many sources on the internet, as well as the product label, recommend to apply another layer of facial cream or moisturizer following application of the hyaluronic serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am older but still have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of Hyaluronic Acid Serum and am quite pleased with Cosmedica&#x27;s offering.  </li>
            <li>I am a African American with oily skin and what I love about the product is that it is not oily and it help control the oil on my face</li>
            <li>I do love that you use such a tiny amount</li>
            <li>Classic case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am 7 years older than one of my sisters and 10 years older than the youngest.</li>
            <li>Their friends also mistake me as someone closer to their age and wouldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m much older than they are.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly so that&#x27;s not adding a lot of time to my daily skin care routine</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a short while, but it is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>the got back to me quickly and realized that every skin is not alike.....</li>
            <li>sure like to have used this stuff for last several yrs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my skin is very soft!</li>
            <li>This is better than Retin A. Really improves appearance of skin and last a long time.</li>
            <li>My skin also requires constant hydrating because I have to use strong facial cleansers and wipes sometimes, as I am in the theater/stage industry and am required to use certain make-up and cleansing products.</li>
            <li>Other products I&#x27;ve used, feels like I have a layer of make-up on, but this absorbs completely leaving my face feeling clean and fresh.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>You very little very strong and get the job done.</li>
            <li>, I use it at night under moisturizer, My skin is very hydrated and soft, Not to sure about seeing any results yet about lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li>This is truly the pure form and completely liquid, dispensed with a dropper.  </li>
            <li>I am keeping it in the fridge and it is a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>I have used another brand for a little longer and have seen results, but with this brand it seems to have gotten more hydrated and fewer wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Love the serum.. a little sticky</li>
            <li>The long term effects on fine lines will be wait &amp; see, as it&#x27;s to early to tell yet.  </li>
            <li>I am only giving one star for the following reason:  This product arrived very quickly - five stars for that; The packaging looked ok on the outside, but the actual product box was damaged and the product was not sealed.  </li>
            <li>I have parched, desert dry skin with wrinkles of a 50 year old on my 36 year old skin &amp; in the first hour of applying this, I saw glowing improvement!!!</li>
            <li>It is extremely hydrating and penetrates your skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, with a little bit of thickness to it at first but dries weightless.</li>
            <li>It immediately softens the skin, is not harsh at all (and I have very dry sensitive skin), and I love that I can just apply it before putting on my sun screen.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way thank you so much for putting out such a great product.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly, but initially gave me dry patches around my lower lip.  </li>
            <li>Promising but too early to tell</li>
            <li>On the whole though, there is definitely a marked difference in my face.</li>
            <li>This serum works very well so far.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- gentle on sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After applying this serum skin on the face is incredibly soft, it even wants to touch.</li>
            <li>I try to use it &amp;#34;every-other-day&amp;#34; since this is intense and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As a result of Retin-A my skin sheds at a higher frequency than I have ever experienced and I have been desperate to find a product that alleviates this without making my skin break out.</li>
            <li>my combination skin (dry-tzone) has completely corrected thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>am a 70 year old redhead with weathered skin and it really has reduced the wrinkles and skin aging flaws.</li>
            <li>I am also taking phyto-ceramides, thinking the combination would really deliver soft, youthful well moisturized results.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, these products tend to wreck havoc on your skin, but this serum from Cosmedica has greatly improved my skin since I started using it in February.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has been using this product for about 1 month, the result is promising, it clear off my pimples and tighten my pores too.</li>
            <li>my girl starts really complimenting me and the comments about the lines on the face have completely stopped.</li>
            <li>After 1 week of using this product my whole forehead was clear again...</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m really liking the product and find myself using this serum throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free (Professional Formula)</li>
            <li>Works well for everyday use &amp; even better after a peel.</li>
            <li>instructions recommend that you put a regular moisturizer over it since it is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the noticeable difference in my skin without any of the side effects you usually see like drying or redness from these kind of products.  </li>
            <li>I will give it a few more months.</li>
            <li>I normally use DDF Wrinkle resist plus and pore minimizer</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t afford my normal serum.</li>
            <li>I love it and have been using it for a few years.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s quite the normal reaction the skin to the acid serum should be.  </li>
            <li>She gave a negative, but honest, review of this hyaluronic acid serum because the serum makes her face even drier.  </li>
            <li>Dried light!</li>
            <li>I will be able to tell if it is indeed a 5 star after I used it for a few months.</li>
            <li>I will have to write a revised review in a few weeks when I can have more history for this product.</li>
            <li>I normally use another, pricier brand of face serum</li>
            <li>At first I was pleased, and at least thought I was seeing results.</li>
            <li>You should let the bottle sit in the fridge for a few hours til the magical gelling happens.</li>
            <li>Also a few side notes: I&#x27;m a caucasian female, early 30&#x27;s, fair skin.</li>
            <li>no negative residual feeling on skin.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks much better after using this hyaluronic product for a few months...</li>
            <li>really love it and recommend it to every one, you will be amazed to see the results in just few days.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth the extra minute.</li>
            <li>I normally use SkinCeuticals &amp; was hoping to find a product comparable to that.</li>
            <li>Only been using this 1 week so as far as results not sure but love the smooth texture of product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products throughout my 45 years and they all feel oily or heavy or both.</li>
            <li>I cleansed my face like I normally do every morning.</li>
            <li>The Retin-A works very well for me, but there are certain parts of my face (right below my nostrils, and the center of my chin below my lip) that just peel and peel and peel and still haven&#x27;t adjusted to the Retin-A even after being on it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>Might not affect immediately but after few weeks of using, my skin looks better, fresher and smoother.</li>
            <li>I mix this with my normal moisturizers day and night for an added boost.</li>
            <li>I add a few drops of this to my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i use it on my face everyday and it is doing what it is supposed to do  love it</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m 57 and spent many of those years being mean to my face.  </li>
            <li>So it is difficult for me to find that good balance where the oily spots are cleaned up and the dry spots are not dried out more.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t wait too long to put my moisturizer on because the HA soaks right into my skin.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t make it disappear completely, but it does make it less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;-Sensitive skins will love the lack of fragrance and fillers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best hidden secret to skin care.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better for me when applied to a wet face, then waiting until the skin has absorbed both the water and the acid before applying other serums or moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>really hydrates the skin, but it has to be followed up by spray pure water and pat them into the skin several times for moisture absorption, then followed with a high quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When applied, it completely penetrates into your skin and there is no greasy feeling residue left on the surface, just smooth, soft, naturally plumped up skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am 26 with a few fine lines around my eyes and really thought that this would work.</li>
            <li>I had recently bought and used the whole bottle of Pure Body Naturals Hyaluronic acid and it doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write a review about any product but when the product is such a stellar dissappointment such as this serum, I must comment.</li>
            <li>After spending too much money trying out different creams, I eventually went back to my tried and true Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this product coupled with a good anti-aging moisturizer are a good skin regimen for women wanting to soften skin, lessen the appearance of wrinkles, and minimize that annoying &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that has to be blotted away all day long.</li>
            <li>just appreciate it that may newly started companies using organic materials and making affordable quality products.</li>
            <li>I am using it with my new dermapen.  </li>
            <li>This information was new to</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>I am 37 and have a new glow about me.  </li>
            <li>I skip retinol products that night because it will burn/sting the newly treated skin.</li>
            <li>Need to buy a new bottle...</li>
            <li>Will last a VERY long time and does such a nice job.</li>
            <li>Been using for 3 weeks nothing noticeable in fine line reduction, puffiness or dark spots area.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see a reduction in fine lines, but so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I also like to put a few drops over my foundation to help set it and give it a more natural look.</li>
            <li>This is an all natural product that really helps keep the skin soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>absorb quick into skin and help the dry skin a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but hoping for great results in the near future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for only 2 weeks and in combination with the Sibu Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil I am noticing that my brow wrinkle (the crease between the brows) is starting to smooth out.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be enough so far to keep my skin smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried it on my legs which are always super dry</li>
            <li>Since I use it with other products I can&#x27;t say how efficacious it is for reducing wrinkles or dark spots on its own, but I absolutely think that it plumps my skin and leaves it glowing.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this didn&#x27;t bother it at all.  </li>
            <li>Leave my skin very soft and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Seller delivered as promised and was very professional.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out on a whim-</li>
            <li>My face is very soft.  </li>
            <li>I mainly started using it to fix some areas with uneven skin tone, reduce fine lines under the eye and also reduce the number/size of pores.  </li>
            <li>After getting microdermabrasion my skin specialist suggested using hyaluronic to help keep my skin moist, and wow does it work!</li>
            <li>but wow!</li>
            <li>Already used 4 times (morning and night) and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li>Double thanks!</li>
            <li>Cant believe how soft my skin feels !</li>
            <li>64 years young!</li>
            <li>my skins feels so soft after using it!  </li>
            <li>In fact, my girlfriend bought this product because of their stellar reviews, which now appears to be a total scam done by the company.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels like it did when I was a young woman - soft, very silky, and no heavy residue.  </li>
            <li>I have tried Argon oil, rosemary oil, and many other traditional cosmetic lines.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the smaller bottle because this was a first time purchase however</li>
            <li>Have only been using about 2 weeks, at first</li>
            <li>I usually never give any ratings, but for this product i must say : 1.</li>
            <li>Extra fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>And it is sooooooooo soft!</li>
            <li>my skin is the exact same..</li>
            <li>At first I used it only on my face and neck, including my eyes.  </li>
            <li>As part of my daily routine I started using it on my scalp too and my hair is now thicker and healthier - so much so that I have quit using products with minoxidil!</li>
            <li>My skin looks hydrated, pretty, younger and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li>Product seems ok, not sure if I will repurchase again.</li>
            <li>I like the way it makes my 47 year old face look and feel!</li>
            <li>and WOW were they generous!</li>
            <li>My face and neck are growing smoother and softer, and fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>but so far, on my face, I see no negative side effects.</li>
            <li>I use it first in the morning and evening followed by my moisturizers and such.</li>
            <li>My skin is so sensitive and this worked wonders!  </li>
            <li>But if you take care of your skin consistently and follow directions well, you will see a big difference.</li>
            <li>, I recently got married and was showing people my wedding photos.</li>
            <li>I do not usually write Reviews</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle (2oz) on Feb. 27th and still have 1/3 of a bottle left</li>
            <li>My really small super fine lines have gone but really no big change.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 2 stars as I&#x27;m just on my first bottle...</li>
            <li>I used Amazon&#x60;s Retinol as the moisturizer and my skin felt so soft and a I will continue to use!</li>
            <li>Only product I have ever used that gave consistent and permanent results.  </li>
            <li>and yeah, I am a hundred thirty one years old!</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I think fine lines are less noticeable</li>
            <li>Skin looks radiant and feels so soft!</li>
            <li>This was the first skin product that was way above expectation..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, so haven&#x27;t seem significant results just yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not sure, but I feel like my skin is getting more even toned.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone interested in trying something different than the creams that are out there.  </li>
            <li>Also, when you first apply it, you can actually feel your skin tighten.  </li>
            <li>It is similar to my first purchase in that it is silky and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size, as you only need a very small amount per use.</li>
            <li>I really like the weightlessness and quick absorption of the product, but I do not notice a slight difference for this working toward wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Deep, clean moisturizing that actually makes your primer + foundation go on SMOOTHER!!!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>A few drops, smooth over your entire face right after washing, then follow with your moisturizer</li>
            <li>This serum is really nice, it&#x27;s a gel-like consistency, so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely however my Dermitologist says it will do very little topically.</li>
            <li>(and I mean quick) pat of the hands together to get the product on both hands so you can apply it to the face in a quick fashion.</li>
            <li>The price is right and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Given that I am nearing 40, my skin is beginning to dry and fine lines are starting to show(though</li>
            <li>After rolling, I use a vitamin C cream followed by the hyaluronic acid serum and when I rub it on, the dead skin comes off easily.  </li>
            <li>I apply it first in a thin coat, then after it dries, put my moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li>It sinks in incredibly fast to the point of looking like nothing was applied in the first place.</li>
            <li>It sinks in weightlessly and quickly, however it did not appear to increase the efficacy of my moisturizer at all.  </li>
            <li>Instead of the skin absorbing it and going back to how it normally feels, it makes the lotion act like sunscreen- an oily, shiny layer that collects dust.</li>
            <li>I have paid double at my derm for pure hyaluronic serum and this one does the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>Bought because of numerous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to help peel away dead skin and stimulate new smooth skin.</li>
            <li>After less than a month my skin looks so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The furrow lines may take longer but even a slight softening is better than the opposite.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>I could shout from the mountain tops (if I lived in the mtns) that this really has helped with my excessively dry skin, wrinkles around eyes, smile lines, and overall glow of my skin.  </li>
            <li>but my sister insisted I looked for the pure ingredient that made that moisturizer extra especial.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s keeping up the good work at the very least!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known for some time that hyaluronic acid was one of the best moisturizers, but the &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; products have only a small amount in their formulas and the companies charge a ridiculously steep price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been hard for me to find a product that softens age lines &amp; wrinkles but doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily.</li>
            <li>I have had a really hard time finding a skin care regimen for my sensitive, reddish, acne-scarred skin, but I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>which is a huge plus in harsh Canadian winters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could clearly see my skin was dehydrated and nothing could \\&quot;quench its thirst\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>After a week, I was surprised by how much my pores have minimized, especially on my lower cheeks and the area between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s what it should do, but also clearly says after using this serum always follow up with you</li>
            <li>Can really see the plumping action on back of my hands.</li>
            <li>clear</li>
            <li>I hesitate to recommend it after only two days, but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>has not smell to it and clear.</li>
            <li>I used another brand prior to this (dr grandel) and that brand really made my face soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>It also helps keep my skin clear and hydraded.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like the way it feels under my regular face cream.  </li>
            <li>I have used only couple of days but really like so far.</li>
            <li>Chemotherapy  (14 yes ago) pushed me into early menopause.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward : I am currently on my 2nd bottle of this HA.</li>
            <li>Skin is so soft after use and wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was young.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product multiple times and getting ready to order another.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and Hyalunoric acid does wonders for me.</li>
            <li>I naturally have a slim face.  </li>
            <li>I was completely amazed.  </li>
            <li>but so far there has been no improvement there.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles under my cheek bones disappeared completely.</li>
            <li>When applied directly to my face, I did get a face-full of pimples.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a too early to tell a difference.</li>
            <li>This really works i feel like i look much younger being 28.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>and this helps it to feel hydrated but not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>simply reduces her wrinkles very well.  </li>
            <li>We have been using it for about a year so far</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>but I have a rather sensitive nose</li>
            <li>what they naturally smell like.</li>
            <li>, I was really pleasantly surprised at the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m near 40, I feel that I need hydration.</li>
            <li>Even as an adult I still struggle with acne</li>
            <li>I think this product works really well with oily skin and the areas that were starting to crack</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft within just a week</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks now.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>May be too early.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped my skin become soft and firmed it up.</li>
            <li>I have deep wrinkles on my forehead and my complexion really took a beating after having my daughter after 35.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Even my 67 yr old mom has been using it.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-60&#x27;s and people frequently ask what I use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic serum made my skin soft but thats it</li>
            <li>i didnt see any plumping in the skin as it claimed on pre mature wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hunting a whole set of products to create the ultimate skincare package.  </li>
            <li>no dye, just a natural clear liquid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel baby soft.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m still young</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M A 55 YEAR OLD WOMEN</li>
            <li>So far I have used it for over two months</li>
            <li>I recommend it to my sister and to a professional skin care person.</li>
            <li>I used the entire bottle of this hyaluronic acid serum and did not notice that much improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>This is reasonably priced and my 2nd order.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell that it has made any difference in the way my skin looks, but perhaps it is too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>My skin seems to be well-hydrated, so far, but I&#x27;ve not been mistaken for a teenager or carded in a bar.</li>
            <li>I use this after a session with Dermalogi and my skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>For the price of this product my skin is soft and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>how much hyaluronic acid is actually in the bottle because</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had enough time to see any real results</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old, and used to be a sun worshiper...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin with acne</li>
            <li>That has nearly all gone away too.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face incredibly soft and my skin looks even in tone and texture.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid is naturally occurring in your body, so you can be assured that you&#x27;re giving your skin something it loves.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing results with the natural serums... takes time to see.</li>
            <li>this is a product that replaces something that is naturally produced by the skin but that production decreases as we age</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft now.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix it with my night cream, with my daily moisturizer or sunscreen, with my foundation, or just apply it straight to my face.  </li>
            <li>Helps really well for the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>Not so much difference in my face, but again, it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It is relatively inexpensive and really does help improve skin texture.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and it has been gently exfoliating my skin and moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li>Bought this product on a whim &amp;amp; I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I know, too early for a review</li>
            <li>My face looks brighter and much healthier instantly!</li>
            <li>I am 26 years old with combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>I am using the product, but maybe it&#x27;s too early to see any results.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and with an even texture.</li>
            <li>It makes My skin shine and soft .</li>
            <li>Beware if you have allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 51 yrs young</li>
            <li>but so far I like the way it makes my soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is fast acting!  </li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s not helping my acne so much (but not aggravating it either), but it&#x27;s definitely helping with moisture</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything different from using this product.</li>
            <li>So far it keeps my skin soft and supple and moist.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and tightened.</li>
            <li>Wow... this product gave me what it talks about.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft but I must use a moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li>So far , I like the serum.</li>
            <li>This is the second brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum I&#x27;ve tried, and I like this one much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Been using it nearly 2 weeks</li>
            <li>but so far I like the results.  </li>
            <li>No adverse reactions noted thus far</li>
            <li>Every part of you deserves to look young.</li>
            <li>The lines on my neck are gone, and my hands don&#x27;t look like old lady crepe skin.  </li>
            <li>Just for the record I have 3 year old and 3 months old babies, no sleep ever</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a month but really like the results.</li>
            <li>I would recommended this product for sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I am on Retin-A 0.05% for adult acne.</li>
            <li>and I am already 30 years old, no history of acne or whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>If you use it directly, just a couple of drops for under each eye is it.&lt;br /&gt;This has turned out, for me anyway, the find of the year.</li>
            <li>I believe I was sent an old bottle of serum.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hydration - As far as hydration goes, the product did well.  </li>
            <li>The price is very inexpensive relative to what this product does.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face so soft.</li>
            <li>I am 64 yrs old and have been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>I put this on every day and my skin is dewy and soft.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, acne prone skin with lots of acne scars</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin, no break outs that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li>It makes the skin so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft using this.</li>
            <li>It completely changed the texture and appearance of my skin, making it look and feel youthful again.</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of scaly precancerous areas for years that I was going to have the dermatologist remove, and by putting it directly on those areas, they are gone.  </li>
            <li>love it, my skin looks younger everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Hyaluronic Acid for a few weeks and my skin is starting to look and feel better.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this product after reading reviews but it is good.</li>
            <li>Not mentioned in the ordering info, and a major oversight!!</li>
            <li>I have bought another serum(180 Ultima Pure Swiss, (Super Strong) Hyaluronic Acid Serum Forte with Vitamin C) at the same time and only this bottle is broken,</li>
            <li>I might get back to normal!  </li>
            <li>I brashly squirted a whole dropper-full into my hand the first time I used it, and ended up having to spread it over a large part of my upper body.</li>
            <li>Without using water first, my skin got dry from using this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too early for me to tell you whether this product has made a profound difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this the first time and it worked wonders on my dry patches.</li>
            <li>must was face first, let it dry.</li>
            <li>Not sure what I&#x27;m putting on my face because it seems a bit strong.</li>
            <li>yo, black female with caramel complexion, so darken marks from acne is easily visible on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels so silky and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I have gotten this a few times now, and am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quickly absorbed into the skin, and other product can be applied over it.  </li>
            <li>It is true that this product makes your skin feel tight</li>
            <li>It seriously eliminated that side effect of the Retin-A. LOvE IT.</li>
            <li>It was packaged in a dark glass bottle to ensure freshness, is reasonably priced and provides intense hydration as advertised.  </li>
            <li>i have found that my (older) facial skin needs application in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look any younger, but every day I am getting older anyway.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin about a week to ten days later after first use.</li>
            <li>The first time i wrote a review for this product i received an email saying it needs to be revised, only because i used &#x27;actual&#x27; words describing this serum.</li>
            <li>most of you are skeptical when buying something for the first time</li>
            <li>I use it on my hands as well and that seems to help a little bit more with this dry weather too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rate this high enough.  </li>
            <li>The information that came with this product said it could be mixed with other things, so after using it for a few days to be sure I wasn&#x27;t going to magically develop an allergic reaction (which has happened many times with other things in years past), I mixed several droppers-full of this product into both my day and night creams, so I&#x27;m not layering on products that are just going to mix together on my face, anyway.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several  and would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The price is right, I use it at bedtime and my face is much smoother and tiny lines around eyes and mouth seem to be less pronounced</li>
            <li>did not put the 5 stars , only because ,  you feel that is right for your face , neck and decollete , but I hope the benefits are long term and underneath.</li>
            <li>If it does that, you have major improvement!  </li>
            <li>It is a hydrator like no other!</li>
            <li>If you look at alot of the reviews past the first page they are 3 words or a little more, so I suspect something is going on.  </li>
            <li>However, I often dab a few drops on, allow it to dry, and then apply my lotions -better result this way in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Only if used daily in that way before you go to sleep, you will see a significant difference(sorryfor being strict, my skin has always been dry)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most of the harsh chemicals that are in other products.</li>
            <li>I see positive results after only 2 applications, one last night before bedtime and one this morning.</li>
            <li>I love this serum and would highly recommend this to people with dry and dull skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use much so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and have had delicate, sensitive skin since forever, and I finally got fed up with this latest flare-up.</li>
            <li>Smells strange but very firming to my face</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for a long period of time but it seems to be very hydrating.</li>
            <li>We appreciate the product.&lt;br /&gt;We are going to use them for a long time until we see some real benefit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the product is exactly what l expected</li>
            <li>Great results and much less expensive than switching to a high cost moisturizer with it as an ingredient.</li>
            <li>I only have a few fine lines, no wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I had some contact dermatitis, it cleared it right up, and it makes your skin really nice, especially in the cold air.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, my skin was so dry that it immediately absorbed the product.  </li>
            <li>skin is remarkably smooth, with very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with a gycolic acid peel (I double up on application of Hualuronic acid for about 4 to 5 days after a peel and then coat with pure vitamin A oil instead of a petroleum-based product that causes clogged pores and breakouts which estheticians and dermatologists recommend after certain procedures - tsk tsk naughty professionals).</li>
            <li>This works great as a base moisturizer, but especially for minimizing fine lines just as well as (if not better) than the high price brands one purchases in a high end retail store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell if most products work, but this one definitely does.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use much, it goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for every day use but strong enough that day by day you notice the difference as all the uneveness, dull skin</li>
            <li>Only new to these..</li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 4 stars is because I&#x27;m new to skin care products.</li>
            <li>This serum really helps to aid in my dry skin treatment.  </li>
            <li>Does dry skin fast, so put on moisture cream after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 and my skin is so dry during the winter so this has been a real test</li>
            <li>I could put layers and layers of my favorite, expensive moisturizers on and still not get much</li>
            <li>although it starts out feeling slightly sticky, the tackiness goes away when the serum is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>has an initially oily texture that quickly absorbs into skin in dry weather (instant moisture relief!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Works great on reducing eye fatigue from those late nights ...staying out late and drinking all night.</li>
            <li>I am currently using 100% Natural and USDA Certified Organic Grapeseed Oil and WOW</li>
            <li>I am 53 with age spots from too much sun when I was younger, also wrinkles around the eyes and deep furrow lines and I am noticing everything softening up.</li>
            <li>My peers didn&#x27;t really care for that when we were younger and the sun damage on their skin is obvious.</li>
            <li>I use the same regimen on my neck and hands, and I get compliments all the time about how young I look, how soft my skin is and that I have a glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this serum for two days, but I can already see a difference in my skin, which is very old</li>
            <li>I have spent a LOT more for half the volume!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in the percentage of hyaluronic acid, along with the other ingredients in it, but nothing is listed on the label.</li>
            <li>Then I had a major breakout and stopped using it on my face, in case it triggered the breakout somehow.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen anything major....</li>
            <li>It has definitely helped my 56 year old skin - people think I&#x27;m 40!  </li>
            <li>Both of the major brands here on Amazon did.</li>
            <li>will try it again but for the week that I used it, it was giving me breakouts, nothing major</li>
            <li>Applied in the morning, evening, even during the day, it absorbs well and moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li>First, I beg to differ with the other commenters here that you can&#x27;t reduce lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It has a sticky feeling as you pat it on, and like I said, I did not notice any major change to my skin.</li>
            <li>Tried the product for the first time based on  reviews by other users who have tried it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything and this is the first product I have tried that have finally softened and almost eliminated  my dry spots.  </li>
            <li>(Lots of my other favorite active ingredients, like dimethicone, create a barrier that prevents moisture from escaping, since your skin&#x27;s mechanisms that are supposed to keep the water inside are failing, but humectants work differently.)</li>
            <li>Then I apply Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair for Night because it&#x27;s a moisturizer and also has retinol, which really helps with skin repair (wrinkles and uneven tone), smooths skin by promoting new growth, and also helps keeps my skin clear from acne.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li>Originally I put the serum directly on my skin followed by moisturizer, but it made my skin feel tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>Maybe my skin was sensitive to it, but it really did dry my skin!!!  </li>
            <li>i use it to prep my skin for using a retinoid hydrogel that is otherwise too hard to apply smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>So upon ordering this, me of little faith, was surprised by the speed it arrived, and i saw results the first time i applied it, and with no adverse skin reactions.</li>
            <li>When I get out of the shower in the morning, I&#x27;ll pat my face dry and right away applying the serum to my skin and let it dry.</li>
            <li>I had the highest hopes for this product after reading all the great reviews, I also read the bad ones, and hoped they were the exception and not the norm.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t affect my oily t-zone problems and still manages to help the rest of my skin that&#x27;s generally dehydrated.</li>
            <li>We all have hyaluronic acid in our bodies already, but is generally taken as a supplement to help with joints.  </li>
            <li>This serum is dirt cheap when you compare it to results it can produce and when used in combination with derma roller (they call it a miracle tool for skin perfection-cheap alternative to derma fillers), at least for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy and has kept my skin clear, and makes it look actually dewy instead of oily.  </li>
            <li>Family members commented on my face looking clear and overall &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Definitely tones, but may cause some sensitive skin to peel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 60year old female, use it around my mouth every night along with the L&#x27;Oreal cream</li>
            <li>but if I feel the results are barely noticeable then</li>
            <li>Especially considering that I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use the Hyaluronic serum directly after micro needling my entire face.</li>
            <li>This product provides the moisture I need: my face actually radiates and I have mature skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is apparent when you apply the serum</li>
            <li>Using  this product for nearly a year and definitely seeing the result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as oily as when I was younger, but still developed an oily glow within an hour or two of showering.  </li>
            <li>so far, it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect on my neck area.  </li>
            <li>is left feeling really soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far it seems to working</li>
            <li>I use this after I &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34; my face and so far I have seen a definite improvement in my skin and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The 100% pure-highest quality apparently means what they could get and make for the money.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, so it is probably too early to tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I apply this my face feels so soft and I am already seeing results only after 1 week of use.</li>
            <li>I bought a similar product from a professional and I knew when I applied it.</li>
            <li>which is the complete opposite of what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I will be 75 years old next month.</li>
            <li>At 63 years old I am mistaken for someone in my 40&#x27;s daily!</li>
            <li>particular hyaluronic acid serum was tested on my forehead between my brows, where I often fight with dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave this only one star because after two weeks of use I developed a rash all over my face which took another two weeks of slathering cortizone all over my face for it to go away.</li>
            <li>and now I feel that my face is more hydrated and my pores have drastically decreased in size</li>
            <li>Love this product.non irritating and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li>I love this product, i always had irritated and sensible skin, looking tired.</li>
            <li>The bottles that I have received have a thick liquid that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Having to use this much doesn&#x27;t make it last very long.</li>
            <li>So far, I like the results, although they are not as notable as with a couple of serums I used in the past (one does not last at all, and the other has since tripled its price).</li>
            <li>The only negative is that It dries out very quickly once applied on the skin, but i think it is suppose to do that, so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>My skin is a bit dry so this product was easily absorbed since it&#x27;s not very oily.  </li>
            <li>But, as I&#x27;ve done with other serums, I leave it for a few minutes and then put my regular moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a short time, but it does leave my face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It soaks right in but skin does not  stay moisturized but a few hours.</li>
            <li>I originally bought and used a \\&quot;Swiss\\&quot; hyaluronic acid serum, 100% pure at twice the cost, so when I used it up quickly, I went hunting for another less expensive product that would have the same results.</li>
            <li>We have dry to normal skin.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a slight but consistent firming of the skin around my mouth and forehead.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and, while I&#x27;ve yet to notice any miraculous results, peps up my complexion on dull days after late nights just fine.</li>
            <li>, I have gone rashes on the face, my pores are very clean and have decreased in size.</li>
            <li>I have tried other serums and find this one very drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Considering I buy it from other companies for as much as $75 a  bottle.</li>
            <li>The hyaluronic acid plumps up your skin so they aren&#x27;t as noticeable, and the bel essence gives your skin the vitamins, fatty acids, omega 3&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s that are needed to build healthy new skin, minus the lines, wrinkles and dark spots.  </li>
            <li>There is a wide price range for this stuff depending what brand and who&#x27;s selling it, from this seller I got twice the product for $4.00 less than the brand I originally intended to buy before they got</li>
            <li>google reviews and feel let down with all the positive 4 - 5 stars, because this is anything but &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced having some tiny painless &amp;#34;welts&amp;#34; that look like acne develop on my skin, small pustules of clear liquid being trapped in the epidermis, which are pretty hard to get rid of since they are not exactly acne or whiteheads.</li>
            <li>i live in really dry cities</li>
            <li>it sinks right in, and a tiny bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>A difference doesn&#x27;t need to be dramatic for me to appreciate it--it can be the difference between staying up all night scratching my arms and being able to sleep.</li>
            <li>The above recipe actually makes a gel that is slightly thicker than Cosmedica&#x27;s, so you could use less powder and it will make even more serum.</li>
            <li>I had been having trouble with oily skin but many products dried up my skin.</li>
            <li>It just gives me a healthy appearance, not once has my skin dried up during this harsh Boston winter.</li>
            <li>Was a little drying at first, but my skin has since adjusted.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this serum, after carefully reading all of the reviews, as well as reading in a magazine that hyaluronic serum holds up to 1000% its weight in water.</li>
            <li>I first ordered a C serum from a different brand, -less</li>
            <li>This serum leaves your skin smooth &amp; tight!!!</li>
            <li>After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have definitely noticed my skin has evened out and generally looks healthier.</li>
            <li>it dries my skin too much, but if i mix it with any other moisturizer it does wonder to my skin, i can see and feel the difference the next day, and people are complementing my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about purchasing this product, but, unfortunately, the alcohol in it irritated my skin, so I didn&#x27;t see much hydration</li>
            <li>For 18 dollars, you can make at least 20 of these 2 oz serum bottles full.</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated and fresh, been using it with my usual skincare and it has made a difference.</li>
            <li>True, other lines have vitamins as well in their serums, but I get enough of that from other face products</li>
            <li>Very watery, runs down my face.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not disappointed with this purchase and will buy again when I run out, which will be a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have other unnecessary stuff, like fragrances or other actives, so it is non greasy and great for sensitive skin or if you plan to mix it with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My laugh lines have become less noticeable!!</li>
            <li>not a single drop of the serum was left.</li>
            <li>Depend on it daily to keep my skin hydrated, especially since I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>Also, it Is extremely dry and looks old now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 68 yr old woman who still has oily skin so if you have really dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li>Their skin looks dry, cracked, tan but old.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a much cheaper version that I have previously purchased at Amazon, so</li>
            <li>I use this every night mixed with my moisturiser and it has cleared up my acne and dark marks really fast.</li>
            <li>Apparently, this product is not a miracle for everyone: instead of feeling moisturized and hydrated, some people feel the total opposite.  </li>
            <li>Makes a visable difference in my aging eye area in only a few days, thanks!</li>
            <li>It goes on a little greasy, but the moment it&#x27;s absorbed, my skin is noticeably still dry.</li>
            <li>and I have gradually been seeing positive results everyday.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is due to the fact that I have a pretty oily T-zone (which is where these pustules have appeared), or if it&#x27;s because I applied too much of the product onto my skin, but I am now left with having to combat these tiny bumps on my skin by pricking them with a needle.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough so far to see what lasting effects might be.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use products on my face other than washing with baby soap.</li>
            <li>Right after I use toner on my face, I apply a small drop on each area (forehead, crow&#x27;s feet around eyes, upper lip, and neck)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the serum twice a day for about two weeks (3 small drops for face [right side, left side, forehead] and one drop for neck), have had no adverse reactions (no breakouts, rashes, etc.)</li>
            <li>&amp; my skin tone has really  improved with less sun spots &amp; red areas.</li>
            <li>I ordered a similar product before and paid twice as much for half the amount.</li>
            <li>, Cosmedica&#x27;s HA is much much thicker consistancy and with less ingredients and also with HA being the second ingredient.</li>
            <li>The bel essence also relieves the harshness of using retinol and hyaluronic acid, especially if you have dry to sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li>43 year old recovering tan-o-holic, lots of sun damage seeing marked results half way into 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only encountered less than 1 in 10 that made me actually feel they did anything and even less ever wowed me of having significant results.</li>
            <li>The truth is, after I gently rubbed the liquid-like serum on my face, the serum quickly dried out from my skin (not sure if it was absorbed into my skin or simply vaporized), and left my skin even drier, like it has pulled all moisture out of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 56 years old, menopausal, with very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels a little drying to me, but I think I was using too much.</li>
            <li>so much better less break outs smaller pores and no more dry spots.</li>

            <li> My aesthetics suggested this to me (the brand that she sells), so I came home, looked on my beloved Amazon, and found this.  </li>
            <li> good stuff for you hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I fell for all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> they either need to be scent-free or have to smell good.</li>
            <li> , however, I will not use it during summer since I feel like it will not be a good match with a tan.</li>
            <li> so gives a good gliding effect.</li>
            <li> I have good skin, sometimes it blemishes because of that monthly visitor but good otherwise.  </li>
            <li> When I do wear light make-up, it looks like I have perfect complexion, no wrinkles.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not like &amp;#34;in love&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;OMG&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a good product for the money.</li>
            <li> but this turned out surprisingly well.</li>

            <li> Really nice.</li>

            <li> I have been using it for 4 days and everyone is talking about how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> But it is nice, hopefully is working.</li>
            <li> but I can say it does feel nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> my mom liked it.</li>
            <li> I love it, and it makes my face feel good.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, it makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> Research into this is excellent, and the do-it-yourself approach is cheaper, and you know what you&#x27;re  really getting.  </li>
            <li> comes in a handy glass bottle with a rubber dropper</li>
            <li> A really nice serum.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep buying this product, it is priced reasonably and works great!</li>
            <li> I honestly dont feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I rather spend more and get a good known brand or ask your dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I am 55 and always looking for something to help my skin stay as nice as it can.</li>
            <li> Would of liked to have a lotion added as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this is a good product and does what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it now that its warm.  </li>
            <li> It gives my face a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> its a nice acid</li>
            <li> nice serum for the money</li>
            <li> and I cannot honestly tell you that I notice any difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since delivery (April)  and to be quite honest</li>
            <li> n nice</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out or anything.</li>
            <li> and I use it with Rose water, and then my moisturized over it.  </li>
            <li> Nice product I will order again.</li>
            <li> Hydrates my skin, nice skin glow afterwards.</li>
            <li> I liked it so well</li>
            <li> I liked the product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product smoothes nicely over skin with no smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin and you can feel the tightness as it works.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, however, I found another product that incorporated Vitamin C in their product, which adds to the benefit of using Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the &amp;#34;big brand&amp;#34; product but a much better deal.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to use along with the derma-roller and am loving the results.</li>
            <li> The product has nice viscosity.</li>
            <li> My husband even commented on the difference of my skin, and he can be brutally honest (which i respect because i&#x27;d</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel really nice.</li>
            <li> Awesome looking and ready for your make-up.</li>
            <li> This one did not do anything effective for my skin...</li>
            <li> I spray either a rose water or lavender spray on then the HAS.</li>
            <li> So I found this browsing on my own here and bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cr√®mes with this type product in it and liked it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely THE best serum to put on your face!!!</li>
            <li> Its suppose to be good for your skin, so that being said, I love it.</li>
            <li> I do not think that it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> Cosmetics penetrate better your skin), apply the serum and after that, apply a good moisturization cream.</li>
            <li> Used in combination with the derma roller this is quite effective.  </li>
            <li> This is really a nice serum.</li>
            <li> Honestly have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This company also incorporates charitable donations made to Susan G Komen to support Breast Cancer Awareness.</li>
            <li> my skin is nice and  I can see my face getting tighter</li>
            <li> nice choice</li>
            <li> People tell me how nice my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> nice feeling on skin,have sencitive skin and redness comes after every product i use</li>
            <li> I honestly believe, by smelling it and its looks, that it is what Arbonne sells for $50 for their face and body serum.  </li>
            <li> This is the best by far from any beauty store !!!</li>
            <li> I have found that for me the BEST way to use it is to mix it into my favorite night time moisturizer after cleansing right before bed.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and it feels real nice going on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Cosmedica Skincare they have great services, their products are great.</li>
            <li> Success !!!</li>
            <li> However, I bought this particular brand based on everyone else&#x27;s excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I use this twice a day under a light moisturizer and it feels wonderful, even with my mild rosacea.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t achieve optimum results while using this product, I was able to get better hydration when I added this to my lotions.</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast, I love this product, it is the best thing for my face</li>
            <li> ..makes my skin feel lovely and really seems to be doing wonderful things..</li>
            <li> For now, the stuff feels great, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> It came in great shape and quickly</li>
            <li> Very easy to add to your face cream.</li>
            <li> After so many years of &amp;#34;disaster skin&amp;#34; I LOVE the way my skin feels!</li>
            <li> My skin is more elastic and looks more youthful!</li>
            <li> I love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The best hyaluronic acid have tried so far!</li>
            <li> Love the service, love the product!</li>
            <li> Love, love this!</li>
            <li> Very good product, 100% pure hyaluronic Acid serum,by Cosmedica, no fillers like some have.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this or any good H.A. serum to anyone with skin issues or who would like to ease up on some fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product is so good for aging skin, fine line, and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Very good and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> make me feel very good and for the price is very recommendable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the most amazing product out there but for the price and function it is supplemental to any skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> love this product, skin looks amazing</li>
            <li> : Like so many health and vitamin products on Amazon, this is another with reviews of people claiming amazing results that for me, no way are the results I think I noticed anyway</li>
            <li> She immediately received unhelpful votes, but it didn&#x27;t stop there - as her review grows more popular (71 out of 81 people thought the review is helpful)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s affordable and I&#x27;d say the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but honestly can&#x27;t say I love it.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect, but  didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for, as I have mature skin.</li>
            <li> So far I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to get a 100% product, rather than have it just as an ingredient.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s all in my head, but my face looks amazingly refreshed from using this.</li>
            <li> This product isnt a facelift in a bottle, but I will say it is the best serum I have used so far</li>
            <li> Been tested, it should be genuine, but not used in the face, I think it should be good.</li>
            <li> but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I try in many kind of serum.</li>
            <li> you will notice lines softening and a nice healthy luster.</li>
            <li> So far so great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure even without the roller it would be effective.  </li>
            <li> What I really liked about this product is the fact that does not contain but one good chemical, which is very rare in most skin products.</li>
            <li> Now I have an almost full bottle that will have to be thrown away!!</li>
            <li> Very good hydration in warm climates and good all year long.</li>
            <li> It does work best if you apply it to clean skin first,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try this product since I have heard that hyaluronic  acid is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...if used properly will yield amazing results</li>
            <li> This is a great hyaluronic acid serum and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Feel It&#x27;s a great product that works for a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever seen that beautiful glow on celebrities&#x27; cheeks and wonder how they do it without being oily, that very well might be the way.</li>
            <li> Being able to find the unadulterated ingredient at a reasonable price was excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, does exactly what it says on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and I am happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks (consistently) and have seen great results.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, my coworker told me my complexion looked great.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the fridge with the Vit-C and it is cool and soothing after a good face wash with my Clarisonic face brush.</li>
            <li> I have sun damage and even though I realize it is what it is I can see improvement or softening of fine lines!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, with time, I&#x27;ll see some of those fine lines disappearing!  </li>
            <li> Very light, seems to improve skin texture and quality.</li>
            <li> No greasy, Very light.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change after i used it, I used it after wash off the face, and I was expecting my skin should be turned very smooth, but I don&#x27;t see any change</li>
            <li> it is not greasy at all, and that was very important to me.</li>
            <li> Very light and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth and has also improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and moisture..</li>
            <li> (surprising to me)&lt;br /&gt;Feel:&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly drying and stretchy (almost like you had a mild botox)</li>
            <li> This product does absorb quickly, which is good..</li>
            <li> Affordable, easy to apply and Effective.....</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re using a retinol product.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice too and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now and find it amazing for tightening your skin and reducing the appearance of fine wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and it has been doing away nicely with fine lines.</li>
            <li> I use it in place of a moisturizer under makeup, Large bottle at great price.</li>
            <li> it left my skin so hydrated and wonderful in the morning, I used this after dermarolling!!</li>
            <li> I do love it, use it nightly before applying my wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)</li>
            <li> I add 2-3 drops (at the most) to my moisturizer every time.</li>
            <li> For the most part, this hyaluronic acid does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is to hydrate your skin and plump it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a satisfied customer and will reorder again.</li>
            <li> I like this serum, it does help plump up your skin and give you a more youthful look, but I think Dr. Oz&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin C is better.</li>
            <li> , this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> It has more water than hyaluronic acid, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> and it feels ok</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels much better.</li>
            <li> and I think that one was better.</li>
            <li> had better results with Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> BUT I still love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and love the results.  </li>
            <li> So glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> :) By the way I am 62.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I swear my skin looks better since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li> I would like to use more to see if my skin feel much better.</li>
            <li> I did observe a bit of peeling, but the underlying skin was so much better than what it had replaced.</li>
            <li> I have used one product better than this called MED PEEL (Hyaluronic Anti-Aging)</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it;  I was developing &amp;#34;lizard skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Each day it is getting more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery.</li>

            <li> I love this HA.  </li>
            <li> I feel this brand stays on the face better.   </li>
            <li> I love this product an will continue to use an purchase more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I laid my eyes on these...</li>
            <li> my skin looks better</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> Love the moisture it gives.</li>
            <li> I am impressed and definitely would advise to use the provider.</li>
            <li> so it would be more convenient for others to read (just like I</li>
            <li> It seems to work better for my wrinkles on my forehead than nerium :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The combination seems to be causing a change for the better on my forearms (after rolling the skin with the Titanium micro needle roller.)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and look more brighter and softer..</li>
            <li> It has made my skin more hydrated and moisturised.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the packaging makes it look much more luxe than it costs.</li>
            <li> plan to use this serum in conjunction with a more firming moisturinzer that I am waiting to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think this product has returned my skin to a greater softness that I did not have</li>
            <li> Use your favorite moisturizer/sunblock.</li>
            <li> I am noticing softer, more even toned skin after just one week of use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....</li>
            <li> My pores are disappearing and my skin is looking more youthful.</li>
            <li> I do think that my makeup applies and looks better.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> I layer many products to my face -  serum/argan oil, moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the Cosmedia skin-care product.  </li>
            <li> I heard about hyaluronic acid from my microdermabrasionist who told be to use the serum in between sessions for better results.  </li>
            <li> I received this serum for free to test and review then give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> The product would probably work better if the moisturizer being used had ingredients that allowed the hyaluronic acid property to be fully utilized.</li>
            <li> Fantastic serum!</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for my wife as reviews prompted her decision to purchase, and after several days of use she is extremely satisfied with the product and would repurchase this great serum anytime!</li>
            <li> I love my Bert&#x27;s Bees Moisturizer and this</li>
            <li> was the perfect thing to use as Step 1, under my current moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have bought so many skincare products(with glass bottle packaging) before</li>
            <li> Two more words ....</li>
            <li> I thought I saw a difference but not so sure now.  </li>
            <li> I am, however, giving it more time.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and this has helped to tighten and bring moisture to my skin better then any $300.00 product I use to use.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this.....</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> but I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> is looking better.</li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have already purchased a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product,I have been using this about a week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts and my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> excellent skin product especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li> the skin giving a more youthful affect...</li>
            <li> favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to everybody.</li>
            <li> When I look in the mirror after applying this serum, my face doesn&#x27;t seem to have as many wrinkles.</li>
            <li> more on days I workout.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was any more hydrated than before.</li>
            <li> I have ordered another brand and it works much better.</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free for my HONEST review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> please don&#x27;t stop making this product :)</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this serum.</li>
            <li> Bought it before reading and doing more research.</li>
            <li> , I feel my hands look better than they did before.</li>
            <li> Love this serum and use it nightly under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to a face cream, you may want to add one on top of the serum or mix it in as others have suggested.</li>
            <li> Most products come as a blend.</li>
            <li> But I thought is try ONE more thing before.</li>
            <li> whole line is great.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is the greatest since pools in the back yard.</li>
            <li> I had some psoriasis on my face and after about a week of the treatments, the psoriasis left my face, I was so happy!</li>
            <li> Love this product  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product it has great reviews.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It is dewy, clearer, more balanced and my makeup goes on better now too.</li>
            <li> I think my face is better moisturized</li>
            <li> I use it at home, and I don&#x27;t use it at work, and almost immediately I noticed that on weekends when I&#x27;m at home all day my hands start doing better than when I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li> love what hyaluronic acid does for my skin.  </li>
            <li> But I will buy it again, though perhaps one that includes Vitamin C to help my skin absorb and process the acid more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> The product is okay..</li>

            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t not work, but seems like more water than hyaluronic acid serum......</li>
            <li> Softer than the summer in a humid climate. :-)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not horrible either, dont make me break</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>

            <li> Im doing much better now, but just beware of any skin reactions.</li>
            <li> This is ever so much better.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would work better than it does.  </li>
            <li> This serum also made my wrinkles more prominent..</li>
            <li> I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> It had  more effect on the lower cheek area.</li>
            <li> and I like it better.</li>
            <li> And I found it. :-)))</li>
            <li> This product was delivered fast and feels great.</li>
            <li> My skin becomes more hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> My face is smoother and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> It was sealed in plastic, inside the box, and the box was also covered in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;That made me feel safe.</li>
            <li> I t was like magic.</li>
            <li> Now his feet are much better.</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum seems to work just as well as some of the more pricey ones on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the fact its not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I do think you could use it without moisturizer, or I seem to be able to, even though I have aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I used it many times but couldn&#x27;t understand why it was so</li>
            <li> love Google.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to be better to injest it for optimal results.</li>
            <li> I use it after derma rolling to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li> My skin is already looking better.</li>
            <li> ¬°¬°¬° :)</li>
            <li> The combination of the two really helps me keep my skin looking great.  </li>
            <li> I gave this serum as a Christmas gift to my sisters and friends last year and everyone was impressed.  </li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be better.  </li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim...looking for a skin treatment that might relieve the psoriasis on the top of my foot.  </li>
            <li> Exercise, a healthy diet, and PLENTY of WATER are a must when trying to maintain your skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying more..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks or so now and my face looks more youthful</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a wonderful moisturizer and hydration system for your skin, especially the lines.  </li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and plumps out the skin to make lines mostly invisible.  </li>
            <li> have already ordered 2 more, one for my daughter and one for a friend.</li>
            <li> The products are very inexpensive and do a great job for me.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I love that it comes in a 2 ounce bottle instead of just one.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Already notice my skin looking so much better.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Did nothing for me, I&#x27;d rather purchase Witch hazel waters, it keep moisture and refine the pore much better then this product.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time reading/ on the computer and would always end up touching my face or chin and would get pimples.</li>
            <li> I love reading reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin looking brighter and feeling way more moisturized.</li>
            <li> skin looks much better since using the serum.</li>
            <li> more often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum is more like a delivery system than a stand-in for your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The more &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; of rosewater</li>
            <li> Noticed by many</li>
            <li> I really love this product and plan on continuing to use  </li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> Will give it more time though.</li>
            <li> but like I said, will give more time before concluding anything  </li>
            <li> the more you use it the more results you will see.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this on a cleaned and toned face and see if there is a notable effect, and will update my review accordingly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I love what it does for my skin, at a smaller price than Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li> and I am choosing to believe that people will definitely love me more if I have fewer wrinkles.</li>

            <li> i am beyond satisfied.</li>

            <li> I think it may take more times with my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s such a great bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Combined with your dermaroller, you get even better results</li>

            <li> I was very excited to try this HA.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum a couple of weeks ago, and was very excited to use it.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or it takes a while to soak in, but you will be able to tell after the first couple of times what amount works best for you.</li>
            <li> so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Product feels clean and nice...</li>
            <li> Seems pure and effective!</li>
            <li> This is a great product of high quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using another brand of hyaluronic acid for two years and have experienced a tremendous amount of success.  </li>
            <li> Keep up the good work;)</li>
            <li> This appears, so far, to be an effective and safe product as well as being a good value.</li>
            <li> I am not young and I don&#x27;t have absolutely perfect skin</li>
            <li> Seems to absorb pretty good and hydrates my skin.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hydration, and really plumps up those fine lines.  </li>
            <li> but the clarity of my skin already looks better and the fine lines between my brows look better.</li>
            <li> Especially fresh and still a little damp out of the shower (best time for application).</li>
            <li> I have known for a very long time that hygienic acid is good for your body, from head to toe!!  </li>
            <li> product itself is really easy to use, it comes with an eye dropper top and you just put the desired amount on your palm</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin you would use it under whatever cream works best for you.</li>
            <li> Nice formulation, not greasy, absorbs &amp; dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the way it&#x27;s bottled with the dropper, makes it so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Read up about it for sure before using it because it can be strong.</li>
            <li> Nice and slippery, also dries quickly and non sticky.</li>
            <li> makes my wrinkles look better but more importantly</li>
            <li> The fact that the product is paraben- free and organic makes me love this product even more.</li>
            <li> face does look firmer after using it, then I will use a good moisturizer on top it, I am ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I love it , hydrate , smooth , from the first use you &#x27;ll feel good .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it-really do notice dimished fine lines.</li>
            <li> Think it helps with preventing wrinkles and helps fine lines for sure.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines have mostly disappeared around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, the enlarged pores and shadows under my eyes aren&#x27;t as visible, and the fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes have diminished a bit.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are disappearing and blemishes seem to fade like magic.</li>
            <li> I have found it to be very good for my skin, and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and definitely worth every cent.</li>
            <li> It is light, refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical feel to it.</li>
            <li> Everything came on time, great quality, can be used at home and in a professional settings.</li>
            <li> so far its great with a face cream too.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel as oily during the day and my make up goes on more smoothly and seems to stay on my face longer than before.</li>
            <li> I was able to receive this product for free in order to give the company my hoenst review of the serum</li>
            <li> I am 65 years old, have been using the product for about 10 days with great results.  </li>
            <li> but I believe in caring for your skin early on and this serum works a great job at helping me do that.</li>

            <li> with high hopes it would be as good as promised from reviews and product description</li>
            <li> Great product, I received it right away and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> Best thing to do is use it right after washing your face while your pores are open.</li>
            <li> Just because its Hyaluronic Acid does not mean it is automatically good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Very light and soaks in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid serum is average, at best..</li>
            <li> it seems to be a nice addition to cream , I apply it first .</li>
            <li> My opinion is that if you can use or add hyaluronic acid serum to to your normal moisturizing routine, it&#x27;s a good thing since it helps your skin retain moisture.  </li>
            <li> BUT, it makes perfect sense to me that if it says it helps seal the moisture in, that it may just help prevent deeper wrinkles down the line.  </li>
            <li> Is very good helps me a lot with my dry skin just 3 drops is all what I need for</li>
            <li> So far so good, too early to tell in terms of results but shipping was fast and it was a great deal :)!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, and the fine lines are fewer and farther between.</li>
            <li> I still noted my fine line ..</li>
            <li> After one week I can see the fine line disappear, I will deffinetly be re ordering</li>
            <li> I apply it after cleansing and applying moisturizers and it&#x27;s light and absorbs easily.  </li>
            <li> And the fine lines by my eyes are all but gone.  </li>
            <li> I used with my sonic infuser and watched my fine lines disappear.</li>
            <li> Smothed out fine wrinkle lines and cleared up blemishes.</li>
            <li> When I mix it with Vitamin C, it helps reduce my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Hyaluronic serum, particularly after a peel.  </li>
            <li> I am using this in combination with collagen and have noticed a decrease in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I used a really good eye cream and moisturizer with it that usually work great for me but not even they can help me now.</li>
            <li> Does a number on fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I can already see reduction in fine lines and deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Silky smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It helps with fine lines and made my skin feel softer.  </li>

            <li> Now it seems my skin is really flawless and a lot more firm!</li>
            <li> and I notice it gives my skin a glow and has diminished some of the fine lines I had around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This seems to soften fine wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a glycolic acid cream at night, and the combination of the two has sloughed away lots of my acne scarring and redness, so that I feel fine going without makeup.</li>
            <li> Fine lines around my eyes seem smoothed</li>
            <li> The fine wrinkles on my hand are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I could tell the first time I used it that my skin was softer, smoother, more even toned, andjust feels better.</li>
            <li> and it depuffs and smooths the fine lines and even gives a tighter appearance.  </li>

            <li> what a super item,  love this seller</li>
            <li> It feels okay going on and quickly absorbs into the skin, but I&#x27;ve seen no change in my skin, whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It is important that you use a strong SPF sunscreen on your face.</li>
            <li> This product also boosts cell renewal so any scars or pimples, it&#x27;ll heal quick!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and odorless, (to me!)</li>
            <li> I love the feel and texture of this serum, it&#x27;s thicker than some others I&#x27;ve tried but absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> A truly light and smooth formula, spreads easily and dries with no greasy or sticky</li>
            <li> Non greasy, quickly absorbed, noticed a reduction in fine lines and improvement in skin tone within a week of using this!</li>
            <li> Usually you mix it with your own good face cream or make your own formula with Vitamin c crystals ( recipe available on skin forums)</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Niacinamide Cream and it has made a huge difference in the smoothness of my skin and fine lines</li>
            <li> Nice large bottle.  </li>

            <li> I rarely use it alone but add it to most of my creams including retinal, and day/evening moisturizers and sunblock.</li>
            <li> and I think it is better than this one because it feels like it really penetrates the skin, whereas this product feels like it just rests on the top of the skin.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good  </li>
            <li> As most people know such cosmetics from leading brands must have some date on them, to ensure that the product is still good for use.</li>
            <li> As I said, &amp;#34;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of fair completion, blue eyes, reddish undertones &amp; many freckles.</li>
            <li> So far so good, so I will continue to buy moving forward.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but it feels good, doesn&#x27;t hurt (have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> So far it was always a battle of pros and cons (if it helps with acne - than it causes over-dryness, if it is a good moisturizer than it&#x27;s causing acne etc).</li>
            <li> I am 48, very nice skin bought it to see if it would help with pores and a fine lines, have been using it daily for almost a month</li>
            <li> The price is very economical for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been purchasing cleaning products and have done the most of my Christmas shopping right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> if people keep commenting I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m doing something right .</li>
            <li> So, if my math is right, that means this magical serum is 98.5% distilled water.  </li>
            <li> Price is very fair in comparison to what I have gotten from other companies.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product in comparison to other hydrating serums/creams but if used alone,doesn&#x27;t make miracles.</li>
            <li> All things considered, a very good product at a price almost anyone can take a chance on, which is always a factor when I&#x27;m considering the purchase of a previously unknown product!</li>
            <li> Love this particular one, it&#x27;s the right price for me, and feels so great on my face, I slather it all over my face, and neck after I wash, and I think it really is helping to keep my wrinkles a bit at bay</li>
            <li> My husband wants to know why I&#x27;m looking younger and more beautiful.</li>
            <li> then smooth it on your clean face.</li>
            <li> A great product and I will update this when it&#x27;s had more time to work on the lines on my forehead and these stubborn dark spots.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected to buy, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than three years, and I have been very satisfied with its overall quality.  </li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is also the main ingredient in the popular Juviderm injectables...</li>
            <li> The product is so easy to use and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply, just a couple of drops on finger tips and gently rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try! ...</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I fell in LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> I do not know exactly what the percentage is in this stuff, but I can tell you that since using it my skin is much more moisturized WITHOUT feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> That bothers me, and makes me suspicious that this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; is mostly water (the first ingredient).</li>
            <li> In conjunction with my moisturizing regimen, it seems to be making a significant difference.</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly when you said it would, and I love it.</li>
            <li> As I said, if I see anything remarkable, I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smooth and cool to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered a refill of the original brand.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin hydrated, has helped eliminate break outs and has faded sun damage significantly.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it starts working immediately to hydrate and moisturize.</li>
            <li> First time trying hyaluronic acid, enjoyed it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who don&#x27;t want to put heavy cream on your face at night!</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels fresh!  </li>

            <li> and I rarely say that about a product!</li>

            <li> Works great and holds moisture a long time!  </li>
            <li> Bought it after researching the new &amp;#34;face uplift&amp;#34; cream and combining this with Vitamin C (liquid in capsules), rosemary extract, mint extract and vitamin D to make my own cream.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and drys quickly.</li>
            <li> Face has a more even tone and nice texture to it after only one week.</li>
            <li> I have used several serums in my life, and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I had good skin before, but I think my skin looks amazing now after just a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> While the results aren&#x27;t blow-your-mind amazing, I do see more moisturized and dewy skin on the day following the use of the serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every OTC and Rx on the market for acne, and about a third of treatments for acne scar revision (mainly because most dermatologist aren&#x27;t experienced with cosmetic procedures and treatment for ethnic skin.</li>

            <li> I know the product is clean and not damaged.</li>
            <li> I have a young look and have been able to pass for mid-late 20&#x27;s for many years now).</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It is light, absorbs quickly and leaves skin moist and looking refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It did come on time and in a clean package.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products for my skin and rarely feel there are any improvements in my skin, but I am ordering more of this product, which says I think it is worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be sure that it is having positive effects, but when I look in the mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it so far!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell my skin looks better than it did before I did the microneedling 2 weeks ago!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel pretty good, but I got more out of it when I was younger.</li>
            <li> It is always good to try a test area first on any new product.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE this PURE FORM of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles seem to be responding better to this pure, liquid form.  </li>
            <li> The name implies that the serum is &amp;#34;100% pure Hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; when the serum is actually mostly water.  </li>
            <li> I do this right before bedtime, and wake up with glowing skin!</li>
            <li> Every morning I would wake up with a fresh, clean, and smooth feeling face.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking shiny.</li>
            <li> n fresh looking , I use it after using dermastamp .5 mm and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I truely think I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually my skin looking so good.  </li>
            <li> I believe in this product and am completely satisfied with the whole transaction with the sellers.</li>
            <li> This is the best Hyaluronic serum and the least</li>
            <li> my skin definitely looks good</li>
            <li> Then I smear a dropper full on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> this really works i love this stuff and just bought some for my mother ..</li>
            <li> Love how fast it absorbs.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this Hyaluronic acid because it is real.  </li>
            <li> It seems to make my skin look better, I am thinking it plumps up the skin so the wrinkles don&#x27;t show as much.</li>
            <li> there are only good things to say about this serum.  </li>
            <li> I can not give a true rating to an item I just brought with out</li>
            <li> Wow really great serum double the size of most.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it has diminished all my lines on my forehead, and my skin is baby soft .</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> and I find this to be very satisfactory and on top of which you can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li> True, it contains nothing else.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this and will be buying it as stocking stuffer for my mom and mother in law. :)</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful, thick, gooey, serum that soaks into your skin and: tightens it, lessens wrinkles, plumps, holds moisture in, softens, adds luminosity, and improves texture.</li>
            <li> ( I use Weleda&#x27;s Skinfood  or organic sweet almond oil)</li>
            <li> cannot say enough good things.</li>
            <li> I started seeing some instant results, the bel essence and hyaluronic acid hydrated my skin immediately and made it look good, but after a couple of months, I was seeing permanent change.  </li>
            <li> and it is 2/3 full</li>
            <li> It is nice, but I have used far nicer serums.</li>
            <li> True miracle.  </li>
            <li> I love the compliments from him and how he wants to show me off.</li>
            <li> Its good, next time will try another brand</li>
            <li> Love this product I bot from different company before this product feel more fabulous than anything I try before  </li>
            <li> Not bad turn</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Great for the dry weather!!</li>
            <li> It plumps up my skin, especially around my mouth and eyes where fine lines are more pronounced!  </li>
            <li> I also highly recommend this for other parts of the body that do not seem to improve even with the best moisturizing habits (like knees and elbows.)    </li>
            <li> It helps my face look full and so smooth, I can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties and started noticing the first fine lines under my eyes and read wonderful reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> Not the case I find I need a full dropper in the palm of my hand and with a quick</li>
            <li> Skin is very, very smooth and just feels more hydrated overall.  </li>
            <li> The other great thing is that you do not need a ton of this to see results.</li>
            <li> Yes it is VEGAN, free of parabens, does not have oils making your skin oily, dye free, free of any fragrances (which normally cause headaches to me) nor does it have any persavatives or fillers;</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much happiness I am getting out of this little bottle :-)</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> the stuff works well, absorbs quickly......</li>
            <li> My acne has cleared up, my skin is super hydrated but not as oily as It was.</li>
            <li> I will admit that after 3 months of use my face has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li> so I see the difference quickly.  </li>
            <li> I will be a loyal user from now on.</li>
            <li> and I can tell results quite quickly.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> I did receive my bottle free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is solely based off of my own personal experience having used it.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how quickly my skin tightened and improved.</li>
            <li> Was using a different brand of hyaluronic acid and like this one better, and love that I can get it online through Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> quickly calms aches and pains...and joints use anywhere on your body</li>
            <li> It does say no studies have been done on pregnant woman .</li>
            <li> So I wont be using this while pregnant.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I have been using.  </li>
            <li> I say this because some days, my face looks much better, but on a few days, not as good.</li>
            <li> It goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Also like the fact that it dries quickly</li>
            <li> I decided on this one because is cheaper and has more product, however after more than two months of using it twice daily</li>
            <li> It is quickly to absorb and is not sticky, but I didn&#x27;t see the results I was expecting.</li>
            <li> So I did a quick research on the internet to find out what on earth is \\&quot;hyaluronic acid\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and seems to be doing the job.</li>
            <li> Hydrates and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li> It hydrated my face rather quickly and helped to end the peeling one gets after the procedure.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is lovely, I love a simple design and the dropper works well</li>
            <li> Love this particular Hyaluronic Serum.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it for two more weeks, give it a decent shot before discontinuing use.</li>
            <li> You can see the difference in your skin quickly when using this</li>
            <li> It has no odor, and absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t report any extraordinary results from it.</li>
            <li> And it has helped tremendously with my ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> 2 drops are plenty, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li> This product has more benefits that can be listed and I particularly like this company.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free or for a discounted price in exchange of my personal Honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> I like a matte look, and this does not leave my face looking shiny, because it penetrates so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered many times, and would highly recommend the seller&#x27;s prompt and reliable service.</li>
            <li> easy to use dropper measures out the small amounts needed, great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acid serums and this product is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I then put on my normal moisteriser over the top of this.</li>
            <li> I tried another product with Vitamin C because I wanted to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t missing anything, but I think that the Cosmedia hyaluronic acid is a much better product with better results.  </li>
            <li> I love this product - it makes my daily moisturizer go much further and produces great results.</li>
            <li> From the very first time I used it I started to see softer plumper skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my second brand I have tried and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The results will be very evident soon.</li>
            <li> The very reasonable price is just a bonus!</li>
            <li> It should be the very first product to hit the face after cleansing and toning.  </li>
            <li> Add weekly exfoliating (I use a clay mask), and my skin is now, after a year, so smooth, soft, and skin tone is so great, that the only make up I wear is blush and mascara.  </li>
            <li> ,this is one thing that truly does work and is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> BUT, right here on Amazon a cool company called Bulk Supplements sells powdered Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> They have helped my skin&#x27;s general appearance so that when I am make-up free, I look better.</li>
            <li> As I previously stated, I had always used a gel formula and was happy with that product.  </li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle, and as the first, it arrived promptly and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly, improves texture and brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> He even calls me beautiful out of no where.., kind of creepy</li>
            <li> The serum is good but the alcohol harm the skin by making it so dry .</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and had no weighty</li>
            <li> really like that this product came with a doppler, making it easy to apply.</li>
            <li> i love this skin product it makes my skin so soft and young looking,and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I had tried some other vegan moisturizing products which ended up burning my face, this is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Saw results after the first 3 days!</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Amazing hydration solution - two application of this serum in the morning replaces the moisturizer on hot summer days, leaves my skin silky and smooth for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the bottle til gone &amp; will definitely be ordering some more!</li>
            <li> It totally hydrates skin and makes it so smooth!!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite Hyaluronic acid thus far!</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more bottles when the first one is finished :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hyaluronic acid serum over my anti-oxidant (and under mu moisturizer) on my face, neck and chest  for the last year and love it!  </li>
            <li> and she really likes it!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> Can see a visible difference in your skin after first use!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> &amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, goes on smoothly &amp; dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and because it is a clear liquid, it can be used under a moisturizer or even light makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it could fast improve on any lines, fine or otherwise either, but...</li>
            <li> I have noticed much improvement in fine lines &amp; wrinkles &amp; also pore reduction.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it could fast improve on any lines, fine or otherwise either, but what it does is providing and keeping locked in a layer of moisture that the skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing out skin, probably better on less mature skin</li>
            <li> It is the first product on put on my face after I clean it.  </li>
            <li> Pure and with no additives, this serum makes a huge difference in your skin&#x27;s hydration levels when used over time.  </li>
            <li> 100% Pure is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin very dry, this helps hydrate my face....</li>
            <li> I notice my face spores smaller, better skin tone; and and it seems fine wrinkles are gone</li>
            <li> My fine lines seem to rebound back, plus my acne has become better.</li>
            <li> recommend this product not because I hope to receive 50% off my next purchase from them, but because I feel smart in having bought a product so much more inexpensively than another and got what I feel is a better result.</li>
            <li> but I do love this toner as well (maybe not for everyday use) but for that quick pick me upper and that bright Vitamin C skin, this will do!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic and has improved the quality of my skin so much.</li>
            <li> I received it, it was great, and after a few days liquefied, now is like water.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, definite</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t need a ton to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> As a licensed skin professional, I use serums in many of my pre and post procedures.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it given the price point.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night before applying a moisturizer and do believe it has made a nice difference in the overall texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m more of a natural girl</li>
            <li> I do not think it was worth the money</li>
            <li> Love this so far.</li>
            <li> For the money you pay for this product, it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and glows, need I say more</li>
            <li> My skin feels more elastic and soft.  </li>
            <li> But I am more surprised at what it has done for my hair.  </li>
            <li> After this serum is absorbed my face looks brighter.</li>
            <li> The following is my honest opinion and experience with the product.</li>
            <li> makes my skin soft and smooth, and evens out those lines and wrinkles!  </li>
            <li> but so far I haven&#x27;t been satisfied until this product.  </li>
            <li> massage in until absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the wrinkles are almost completely gone, although I didn&#x27;t have many to begin with.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I know what I&#x27;ve seen with my own eyes after about 4-6 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> the entire face is really good and the price is really affordable ......</li>
            <li> As far as softer skin is concerned, I still apply a moisturizer on top as well..</li>
            <li> product seems okay so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, only $14, but the review/ rave makes me expect much more from this product.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is a key ingredient in most skincare products and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it might just be there to provide &amp;#34;slip.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t see that it has shown any kind of improvement to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week, but it goes on nicely and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> The serum is not greasy, is rapidly absorbed, and has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is  absorbed in seconds but didn&#x27;t like the consistency, too watery, so</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for about a month which I believe is really too soon to do a fair rating.  </li>
            <li> Once absorbed, does not interact with makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple weeks, but it has softened my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I received this at a complimentary but all views presented above are my own.</li>
            <li> and gives a fresh feel however if you are expecting it to work miracles , its not what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> it keeps my skin really soft love it</li>
            <li> So far my skin is firmer and more plump.</li>
            <li> and it dries or is absorbed</li>
            <li> My face is now youthful, more plumper, clear, and glowing.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more drastic results this far into using.</li>
            <li> Several people have mentioned how nice my skin looks and asked what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and bought the 8 oz because i&#x27;m planning to make this product part of my regular regime.</li>
            <li> Does not feel greasy &amp; is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> This product is so worth</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> effective- watch out for fluid accumulation around nasal-labiel fold that causes drying/flaking.  </li>
            <li> Thi is my second order, love this stuff my skin is so smooth after I apply this, I use morning and night.</li>
            <li> is soft., but after the passing of the day ... I began to see the difference, clearer skin, better.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels with this gel, soft, hidrated...</li>
            <li> Though it is not advertised as such, this serum is also VERY useful for making aging hands look better.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews were positive and as someone who is in her 50&#x27;s, I was interested in trying different products to keep my skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Even my &#x27;thinking wrinkle&#x27; (that pesky wrinkle right between your eyes), which I&#x27;ve had since my early 20s, looks better.</li>
            <li> I love the dropper, no mess like the squirt tops.</li>
            <li> I am in my very late 30&#x27;s and armed this along with healthy eating, am looking forward to my 40&#x27;s and beyond!!!</li>
            <li> First, I do not feel any greasy; my skin absorb quickly and I did not feel any greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even waste money on a moisturizer any more!!  </li>
            <li> I have even had a few (yes, more than one!!)</li>
            <li> my skin feels very nice and looks firm</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20&#x27;s but have been keeping good care of my skin, well trying too!</li>
            <li> Also this product is a good value as compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 19, but its great for dark spots and giving your face a smooth glow!  </li>
            <li> and this is the right product for</li>
            <li> This serum is right up with the pricier serums.</li>
            <li> Soaks right in</li>
            <li> I feel this works and the price is right.</li>
            <li> And, the price is right.</li>
            <li> It soaks right into your skin.  </li>
            <li> but I can feel like my skin gets lifted right after I apply it.</li>
            <li> This serum soaks right into your skin without leaving a tacky residue.  </li>
            <li> I use it right after I was my face or after a shower.  </li>
            <li> I use product 3 times a week every night and I use just the right amount so my face is not too oily but meets the right amount needed for my skin pores.</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil to moisturize and it soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> I put it on each night right before putting on my night cream.</li>
            <li> But with the right moisturizer, this isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> The right combination of products makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I use it right after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li> right after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> No smell, no reactions, right consistency.</li>
            <li> Noticed results right away.</li>
            <li> honestly right now I&#x27;m still questioning it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I got it right away</li>
            <li> , also, I put this on immediately after I clean my face with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, while it&#x27;s still moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of products on Amazon, and this is the first time that I&#x27;m completely baffled by why something received so many glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> This is especially important to me since I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> The product feels good and my skin is smooth and a little bit cleaner, but further use will tell me more.</li>
            <li> something that happens to me on a daily basis because I have oily and very very easily clogged pores which I fight with the clarisonic and bha product).</li>
            <li> I have excellent skin for a 77 year old with very few wrinkles, no crow&#x27;s feet at the eyes or mouth lines.</li>
            <li> I primarily purchased it because of its high ratings and reviews.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily, great for acne prone skin, dry mature skin as well</li>
            <li> I love the super short ingredient list since there are just three ingredients: distilled water, hyaluronic acid, benzyl-alcohol(0.5%).</li>
            <li> When I first started with the product, it immediately absorbed in my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, and really plump the skin to make it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Cool gel package came fast and bottle was in tact and sealed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel a watered down product works as good.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are disappearing and my skin is sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> My face looks a little smoother, feels nice and makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> , it enhances every other serum to performe in a better way, I mix it with my other serum and they penetrate better in skin and show amazing results than before used alone without this hyaluronic serum.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are not very bad, but they are there</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old, and I have tried other hyaluronic acids and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed that huge of an improvement in the appearance of my skin, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t get new acne with this product (</li>
            <li> way I use it is right after a hot shower while my face is still moist from the steam i apply the product.</li>
            <li> It gets in the skin super fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and tightens up the face a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased others and the consistency was just a bit off, and I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin except that it felt dry.  </li>
            <li> I think it may take a few more weeks to see a more noticable change.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin so that&#x27;s good, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to taking Hyalorunic acid capsules rather than using a serum.</li>
            <li> This serum seem to gets in the skin super fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and tightens up the face a bit.</li>
            <li> It really is for sensitive skin, reduces pore size, decreases wrinkles, and gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It feels rather like a light Aloe Vera gel that dries nice and firm.</li>
            <li> It does make it work better if you spray a light mist of water on AFTER applying the serum, or just wet your hands, shake the excess water, and rub on the skin that you applied the serum to.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly, and the stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used $30 serums with both hyaluronic acid and vitamin c, and honestly this is much cheaper and gives the same result.</li>
            <li> these products I&#x27;m talking about like retinol and glycolic peel will make your skin sensitive to the sun and will easily make you burn.</li>
            <li> Words are just not enough, you would have to actually use this serum to see how great it is.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quick and it really boasts the abosbtion of retinol and mosturizer.</li>
            <li> This brand is reasonably priced and ships quickly.  </li>
            <li> works great with Organic Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;fine lines on upper lip have started to disappear and the pore around the nose area already appear smaller in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This  Hyaluronic Acid Serum was quick absorbing and was not oily or greesy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for hyluronnic acid serums, this is a good one, however a bit too liquid for a serum, not my favorite but a decent product.</li>
            <li> but when I do use it as consistently as I should my skin feels so incredibly soft, without exaggeration, I can honestly say it truly does feel as soft as baby skin.  </li>
            <li> I truly enjoy using Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Cosmedica because it is all NATURAL!</li>
            <li> I really like the way the serum absorbs into your skin right away, leaving it feeling hydrated and fresh</li>
            <li> It dries very fast.  </li>
            <li> it is now, I will continue to keep getting it, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I do like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I am 58 and very fortunate for my age as I look years younger</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> --I have another similar product I&#x27;m trying that is more of a gel, but it takes longer to dry and ends up kind of sticky.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised that it came so quickly!</li>
            <li> so I read a little and learned that hyaluronic acid is good for hair as well.  </li>
            <li> Awesome serum - a little goes a long way and</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry or becoming dry this is a nice natural way to make it feel better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and gentle, specially for winter or</li>
            <li> I would recommend using it before a good moisturizer and don&#x27;t use with other strong products like vitamin C serum, alternate days for each.</li>
            <li> when now you can buy Hyaluronic acid with vitamin c and e added to it for only a couple dollars more.</li>
            <li> Not much is needed for it to be effective, I also received this product promptly from the seller.</li>
            <li> It came fast and this product is the bomb!</li>
            <li> It was the first time I heard about Hyaluronic Acid and decided to check if Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li> After about the first week I saw my face gradually begin to lift.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an absolute must in skin care!</li>
            <li> I also decided to use it on my hands (trying one hand first as a trial) and can see a difference between the two hands, so I started using on both hands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m running low, def gonna buy more</li>
            <li> All I can say is it really works!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something to complete my nightly skin care routine and this definitely fit the bill.</li>
            <li> After several uses the serum, my skin was feeling more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I will not only keep using it but will most likely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I happen to see a Dr. Oz show with a dermatologist on talking about Hyaluronic Acid and to buy a serum where that ingredient was one of the first three ingredients in the product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my pores that I&#x27;ve seen the most changes in, my pores are way smaller.</li>
            <li> I use both day and night and my face has an overall better appearance.</li>
            <li> At first I started using this serum</li>
            <li> Started to smell funny after a week.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product.</li>
            <li> was alternating days between using and not using the serum before going to bed when I first got the serum.</li>
            <li> I am now using the serum every night and results are more obvious with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This will be the second bottle that I have started using and I truly love this product.</li>
            <li> Okay I just received this in the mail last week.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> From the first time I put a drop on my finger and rubbed it on my face</li>
            <li> Someone else mentioned how it left a matt look to your skin that was quite appealing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This seems to hydrate my skin pretty well and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> With the moisturizer only penetrating through the top layer.  </li>
            <li> Be patient because this product really does work and for the price it is worth trying it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first of it</li>
            <li> My overall skin tone has improved and seems brighter and more even.</li>
            <li> At first, I was unsure of this product.</li>
            <li> Seams to brighten my completion and moisturize pretty well..</li>
            <li> This is my first usage of a hylauronic acid product.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says it will.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products but I&#x27;ve never found anything that equals the speed and quality of Hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> Which is the reason I tried it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I can say it has no Oder and feels smooth,  as far as anything else .</li>
            <li> , let it soak in, then apply my regular moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have issues with dryness since it is absorbed really well into the skin.</li>
            <li> Will be coming back for more....</li>
            <li> Made skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> I combine it with a favorite moisturizer or sunscreen and use it daily.</li>
            <li> I notice the difference just from the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li> I add this to my daily sunscreen to make it more pliable.</li>
            <li> I use this after a derma-roll and it soooothes my red skin then top off with vitamin C -</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well under face cream, and I feel like it PLUMPS up my cheeks too!</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing when it is applied and the skin has an overall appearance of smoothness..</li>
            <li> I have nothing else left to say, ok</li>
            <li> I am using it in combination with my higher end lotions and cremes.  </li>
            <li> We did just one foot first.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I should have gotten more.</li>
            <li> so mush better now and younger</li>
            <li> the only problem is that Im from Chile, south America and i have some delivery dificoulties to get this product.please send it to my country .I would pay even more if you want, but let me get it becouse in my country is impossible.thank you and Buy it</li>
            <li> I FIRST APPLY THE VITAMIN C</li>
            <li> After the treatment my skin looks exactly as if I would just visit the cosmetologist.</li>
            <li> it has a funny consistency, but once you apply it and it dries, you wont even know you have it on.</li>
            <li> water is listed as the first ingredient with hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;second.</li>
            <li> those who over 35 and are starting to experience more dryness in their skin.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li> Really firms skin!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling beautifully smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad clumpy at first.</li>
            <li> I have found that the thicker serum that I made is even more beneficial for my skin than Cosmedica&#x27;s- especially with smoothness and moisture retention.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, seems to be hydrating already!  </li>
            <li> WILL NEED MORE TIME FOR FINAL RESULTS AND REVIEW.</li>
            <li> i can feel my skin is getting smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used better BUT is a third of the price</li>
            <li> this is the first time I am using this product so I won&#x27;t know the results until close to the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Maybe I will add more later if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> It intensely moisturizes, without feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> I tried it first and now have both sisters and both daughters using it.    </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and it makes my make go on smooth and stay longer, not to mention it helps with my wrinkles which have started to fade at my ripe old age of 60.</li>
            <li> are more than enough.  </li>
            <li> I appears to be exactly what it is said to be --</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I notice the difference.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased an acid serum before</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It is very soothing!  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve only had this product for about 24 hours</li>
            <li> It seems to tighten my face when I first put it on, but the sensation isn&#x27;t permanent.</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging.&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My pores looks smaller and my skin looks more radiant.</li>
            <li> It may not be injections, but for the price, it&#x27;s pretty darned close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for the past year and have seen excellent results.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first but after using it for about three weeks I see a Big difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel moist, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> will go back for more.</li>
            <li> The first bottle of the serum contained a liquid serum.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been able to go several months without it after using this.</li>
            <li> Works very Well!  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, smells funny....</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use this daily so cannot be sure i see results.</li>
            <li> so I use it first and then put on a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I use the Vitamin C toner first, then this and then my moisturizers before I put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> It looks even better the next day.</li>
            <li> Once a week, I do a 1 minute glycolic peel (30%) then rinse off and apply hylauronic acid and just a simple moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> Really like it!</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve tried, though, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others.)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it how this product gets five star reviews, and even i bought it considering the stellar ratings.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and soft..</li>
            <li> either my concealer is working better or this is really starting to make a difference to the texture of my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> After consistently using this product I truly see a difference.</li>
            <li> Just be aware that it could have the reverse effect.</li>
            <li> I was at first hesitant</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more from this seller.</li>
            <li> I wish they could offer this in a way you could use on your whole body!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had long enough to be 100% sure that its as good as my regular Hyaluronic , but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Has been using it for more than a month and my skin fells and looks younger .</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> No weird chemicals in it</li>
            <li> Also, I swear after the first two times I used it I broke out.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought the 2oz bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft and smooth-</li>
            <li> Now, after only a week, I have to lightly pat my skin with my fingertips for about a minute so that it will absorb the hyaluronic acid!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s because of this product but not only I love my skin, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only 2 uses, my skin tone is more even, my skin is brighter and all-in-all</li>
            <li> in the morning I wash my face and apply serum first and facial cream with vitamin C on top of it.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum,  It could all be my imagination, but I think the product works, makes my skin look better.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried many different products for aging skin over the years.</li>
            <li> BACK GUARANTEE if you are not completly satisfied...</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first oil type serum.</li>
            <li> This was first experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I really can&#x27;t see a difference!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, the serum turns into water and is no longer good.  </li>
            <li> This serum actually works, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (i have very sensitive skin), and it works not only on the face, but it also works on hands (which we tend to forget and hands, no matter how perfect our facial skin may be, our hands are often neglected and show our true age).</li>
            <li> This a really good HA compared to the other highly reviewed ones on amazon.</li>
            <li> -those tiny dry lines not associated with your eyes or mouth- on my face which has greatly diminished.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews for any product I buy online but for the first time I actually have to say this is amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really see if its working, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference like many of the other reviews make it seem like it does.</li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing this again due to the hyaluronic acid vitamins are more effective for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, had really high expectation but doesn&#x27;t really hydrate or plump or do anything.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped my 50-year old skin with dryness, fine lines.</li>
            <li> I use it all over, but it is very effective for dry spots, including facial excema!</li>
            <li> I also combine it with other ingredients to make a nice l-ascorbic vitamin c face treatment.</li>
            <li> Seems to add with other series nicely...</li>
            <li> and it was reasonably priced, considering many higher priced products only  &amp;#34;CONTAIN&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know whether to credit this serum or the other products i am using with it.</li>
            <li> I also question whether it&#x27;s as effective as the other serum I&#x27;ve been using by Image Skin Care where the #1 ingredient is</li>
            <li> It also has a relatively light consistency and doesn&#x27;t carry a strong smell like some other skin products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other more espensive products reveal results quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> We shall see how long my true &amp; accurate review lasts..</li>
            <li> I use this every night in conjunction with my vitamin C serum for a fresh and vibrant glow.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the fine lines are not as apparent.  </li>
            <li> I waited until I used the whole bottle before writing a review to be sure i gave it enough time.</li>
            <li> 3 drops are more than enough to cover my whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li> My regular moisturizer is working way better - my skin feels hydrated for much longer with this underneath.  </li>
            <li> This is my best kept secret to soft supple skin.</li>
            <li> You do seem to get some skin irritation when using too much directly on your skin every night or if you use it more than once a day (if directly applied).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprising how much you get from a few drops.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, it just isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough for my skin , I had to combine it with a facial cream..</li>
            <li> The package is nice and secure with thick bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I think you should only have to do this one time-it is always the same I said it was good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the public eye daily and get compliments on how good my hair and skin look.</li>

            <li> Has helped my dry skin, and helps other products absorb more thoroughly and more quickly.  </li>
            <li> Still looking for positive results.</li>
            <li> in all, my experience with the product is a positive one.ter, hyaluronic acid, benzyl-alcohol(0.5%).</li>
            <li> in all, my experience with the product is a positive one.</li>
            <li> Really like this, you do need to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel (and look) really hydrated, which is a nice change from other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My first time using this--I really like it.</li>
            <li> The ll lines are better but not completely gone, still working on it.  </li>
            <li> I use it pretty much every day and put Retinol cream or make up or sunscreen, etc.</li>
            <li> And in fact, people should start taking care of their skin in their 20s because it&#x27;s easier to keep a smooth, wrinkle free skin rather than trying to erase or hide wrinkles and other imperfections.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels so hydrated and plump, cool, and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it&#x27;s been a lot of help for fading my scars and dark spots as well as</li>
            <li> It makes it feel soft and cool.</li>
            <li> It helps me with dark spots, fine lines and gives an overall healthy glow to my skin!</li>
            <li> Better yet, those high end products mysteriously are never shipped yet they still bill for the products that were never received.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many many HA serum before, some are 10 time more expensive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1 % people and that&#x27;s the highest you&#x27;ll find on Amazon, works well with other facial moisturizers, nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Since using this best-selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum on my skin, I have noticed an improvment to my skin texture as it leaves my skin looking bright and feeling moisturized while the lines that I have noticed due to natural aging are diminished and appear much much softer.</li>
            <li> It is so excessively dry and flaky I just cannot believe one use of this stuff could cause so many issues.</li>
            <li> By morning your skin needs more hydration, skin seems dry.  </li>
            <li> My hands look a ton more youthful &amp; my feet are no longer dry or scratchy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles only lighter ones, I am trying to use more natural products to delay some of the wrinkling process as much as I can :)</li>
            <li> If you purchase this, make sure you wet your face first and then apply the product.  </li>
            <li> It does slightly dry out your skin, so make sure you are using it with Moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not too sure about what, exactly, this product is supposed to do, but it seems to do nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to the anti wrinkle or uffy eye thing, but this stuff is magic in a bottle for ultra dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you do not put something on top, it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Simple ingredients, gel consistency that spreads and penetrates easily.  </li>
            <li> It does dry out your face more in the winter</li>
            <li> the wetter the better and just let it air dry</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin really soft</li>
            <li> tell me recently, how smooth and pretty my skin looks.</li>
            <li> That made me realize this probably doesn&#x27;t have anything strong enough to help my skin.</li>
            <li> With the big size and affordable price, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hardly long enough to give a fair assessment.</li>
            <li> The left side of my face/head has proven to be resistant to products that work great on the other side, you know, the side that HASN&#x27;T BEEN HANGING OUT THE DRIVER&#x27;S SIDE WINDOW FOR 40 YEARS!</li>
            <li> COSMEDICA&#x27;s leading seller is this pure hyaluronic acid serum in the 60 cc (2 oz) bottle.</li>
            <li> I mix it with pure vitamin c powder, pure vitamin A and E oil</li>
            <li> (CosMedix Pure C ).</li>
            <li> pure HA.</li>
            <li> I thought &amp;#34;why pay for creams with it in them when I can get the pure product?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> 100 % pure hyaluronic serum.</li>
            <li> This serum is pure hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> My pores are still large</li>
            <li> This is a pure liquified form.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this to others without hesitation.</li>
            <li> My goal, to find products that are pure and does not contain sodium benzoate.</li>
            <li> I have acne scarring and large pores.  </li>
            <li> Will certainly re-purchase.  </li>
            <li> 100% Pure (2oz/60ml)</li>
            <li> It made me wonder whether all these positive reviews are real??</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing, I have no idea where these positive reviews are coming from</li>
            <li> It comes out like a loose gel and warms in your had and goes on more like a liquid.</li>
            <li> It is a very affordable and easy to mix with daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It totally met my expectations and confirmed positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using about a month and have noticed an improvement in fine lines and overall skin texture.  </li>
            <li> I can not say yet if it lessens fine lines, but I can say that it definitely has an effect on the texture of your skin and holds moisture.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my face, particularly on my fine lines and wrinkles; it&#x27;s definitely not causing me any break-outs</li>
            <li> I can see a big difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are gone and deeper lines getting smaller every day &amp; pours are shrinking.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller and I have smoother skin with fewer fine lines.</li>
            <li> She is 12 years older than me and looks my age!</li>
            <li> thank you Cosmedica for acting so quickly!</li>
            <li> Product is pure hyaluronic acid serum which works very well to soften and hydrate skin.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this product and was surprised with such positive results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing deal, it lasted a little over two months using it twice a day on my face and once a day on my chest and tummy.</li>
            <li> I decided to see what all the hype is about, and let me tell you the stuff in this little bottle is amazing.</li>
            <li> This really helps with fine lines around eyes, above lips &amp; on neck.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...something that really hydrates my abnormally dry skin!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as faithfully as I should, so I haven&#x27;t seen any major, long term results (my own fault)</li>
            <li> No false promises with this product</li>
            <li> After using this product faithfully for the last two months, I can see and feel a huge difference in my complexion.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not constantly worried about my face being oily, it use to be a huge insecurity</li>
            <li> I actually also use Great Lakes Collagen (in the green container) in my coffee.</li>
            <li> Not only did this not make my face feel great, but it actually dried it out.  </li>
            <li> I use retinol and bp on my skin which can be very drying.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> It is really a night and day difference.</li>
            <li> Result is basically the same as with prior brands (better hydration and moisture than with regular OTC moisturizers, diminished pores and skin texture); however, this one beats the price :-)</li>
            <li> Really really worked.</li>
            <li> Really plumps your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I was really looking for something to work and give me the promising results.</li>
            <li> Really soaks in and smoothes skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if I can tell a difference, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I felt like my face was &#x27;molting&#x27; to give way to a much smoother, youthful epidermis.</li>
            <li> It really makes your skin feel hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for the rest of my skin at all - either used alone or under moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very efficient in moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It dries very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 54) or anything, but I really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I appreciated the reviews.</li>
            <li> I received it 3 days ago, but have noticed that it really rehydrates and gives your skin a polish.</li>
            <li> It really works wonders.</li>
            <li> It really changed my skin.</li>
            <li> and I really likes it...</li>
            <li> I really have to say that I noticed a difference in my skin within a week.  </li>
            <li> And she really likes the texture</li>
            <li> you rub the serum between your fingers, it has a very slippery feel to it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> I really think its helping with some darker spots I have on my face</li>
            <li> The HA really does boost the moisture level in my skin and helps transport the cream into the dermis.</li>
            <li> It does hydrate and smooth out wrinkles when you use it with your regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very drying on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product arrived in a timely manner and was wrapped in a very protected manner.</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol in this.</li>
            <li> Gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;you really need to use a moisturizer after this</li>
            <li> I really notice my skin feels softer and smoother, and moisturized after I use the Cosmedica brand serum.  </li>
            <li> Next time I will search for an alcohol free brand.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> the beginning I used it all over my face and noticed that it was over drying the parts of my face that aren&#x27;t very oily.</li>
            <li> Now I smooth on 2-3 drops of serum and then do the same with 2-3 drops of my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> With this routine, my skin feels tighter and so much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast this works.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waster your money it does absolutely nothing for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have spent many more $$ on branded name items for my sensitive skin care products and did not get the the same results.  </li>
            <li> My Husband also said that my skin looked much healthier to him and felt so much softer than it ever has</li>
            <li> Very diluted serum.</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> I do annual mesotherapy and all kinds of staff, but it helps me to maintain my skin during the whole year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can really tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> If u want to really go crazy-get a derma-roller and use this after.</li>
            <li> fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff..</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t see much difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed one</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much time using the serum.</li>
            <li> My skn has been much softer.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating and is what they have advertised for this product.  </li>
            <li> It really helps to lock in moisture and works</li>
            <li> But, you can&#x27;t apply too much if you&#x27;re wearing it under make up--or you will get flakiness..</li>
            <li> About a week into using this product, I really appreciate its affordable price and truly beneficial results...</li>
            <li> This serum has really made a difference in how my face feels and looks.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had lost a lot of moisture in my skin over the winter and this product has really helped.</li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It does take a couple of weeks to really see the difference it makes so be patient.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this serum because this product advertised that: \\&quot;Heal dryness on face with intense hydration\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> Generous size and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I like the way this serum goes on, it dries fast and leaves no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> The result is that both of those products are much lighter, which I really like.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but have heard that it can really help</li>
            <li> The product was as described by seller, arrived very on time,</li>
            <li> I rely so much on a product&#x27;s rating before I decide to buy .</li>
            <li> ; delivery was very prompt.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and having not used anything like this in a while, expected more pronounced results.  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and use this instead of moisturizer and it works very well</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that could help to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; up my skin, especially near the eyes.</li>
            <li> , however it didn&#x27;t do much for the circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I really wonder whether this even is what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Could see a difference straight away.  </li>
            <li> Is there anything out there that really works?????</li>
            <li> but I am absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li> The good&lt;br /&gt;-The serum helps my moisturizers absorb into my skin much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had a breakout since using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do give this product five stars for performance, but that&#x27;s not the only important aspect of a purchase choice.&lt;br /&gt;In case</li>
            <li> It is FANTASTIC stuff, and it does all of the above for me.</li>
            <li> How maddening is it to know that a company wants to dupe you?</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly, absorbs fast, leaves no residue, but neither does it do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell much with using it.</li>
            <li> my skin really glows on this...amazing product.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to order my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li> , so much smother &amp; tighter.</li>
            <li> I use about 3 drops and it leaves my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really well</li>
            <li> It really works.....</li>
            <li> I love it when I get my order when it&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t really comment on the product, I like the service they&#x27;ve provided.</li>
            <li> this just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything.</li>
            <li> If you use a moisturizer afterward, it really seems to HELP that moisturizer work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the level of moisture or texture in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for over two weeks now and haven&#x27;t really seen any difference.</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> It really helps to moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps to hydrate around your eyes too.</li>
            <li> Really aggravating.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe they would use such cheap bottling....</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and well-done packaging.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Although the consistency is more watery than I expected, it still hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not the real deal</li>
            <li> He told me that out of all the many $1000&#x27;s that i&#x27;ve spent over the years on skincare, this $14.95 Amazon Prime product has literally proven to work and show results immediately.</li>
            <li> and I do not have to buy it very often.</li>
            <li> , this product works really well with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and doesn&#x27;t get oily during the day (no shine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and at night a whole dropperful each time..when my eyes are puffy and even when they are not..</li>
            <li> but I AM MUCH HAPPIER with this product.  </li>
            <li> Really plumps your skin.</li>
            <li> Meh, didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Lines fade much faster and plump up.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really noticed but</li>
            <li> Much smoother.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> This just seemed to not do much of anything.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll wait and see if my skin really changes to know if I&#x27;d purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have had lines around my eyes  for quite a while and this product really reduces them.</li>
            <li> You dont need to apply to much.</li>
            <li> and I felt that it didn&#x27;t do much for me</li>
            <li> No matter how much of this product I put on my face, everything just soaks in.</li>
            <li> So much for that.  </li>
            <li> It really did reduce the appearance of a couple of stubborn lines I had on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very runny and watery.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product,.</li>
            <li> I did mix the serum in straight organic shea butter.</li>
            <li> I hope she likes it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> and I really like.</li>
            <li> &amp; I know from my classes how much benefict Hyaluric acid can be so beneficial.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been keeping telling me that she really loves it.</li>
            <li> you feel the skin tighten and absorbing.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels after I apply the toner .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> Did not notice much of difference since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I do believe it has even smoothed out very superficial lines.</li>
            <li> Went on very smoothly as I gently patted on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> I still use this with my night cream and in the morning my skin feels really moisturized.</li>
            <li> I just turned 40 and noticed my skin is much dryer than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin looks with these two.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating for the skin and helps fade sun spots.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference on the days that I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my skin feels after it.</li>
            <li> Mine skin looks much healthier and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and dries fast.</li>
            <li> suited to my skin very well.i m using it just for over a week.skin became lighter and it doesnt blocked my pores.will</li>
            <li> This product really controls the oil and ensures that my skin stays matte all day.</li>
            <li> the whole concept is it helps to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> And really, nothing, but nothing, comes close to using tretinoin  </li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and fast shipper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However Amazon handles my complaint very prompt and good.</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews I was hesitant to order this product, but did anyways because of the good price just to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But so far I have really enjoyed this addition to my daily skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> 2 oz seems a lot for this kind of product because you only need a dime size drop for your entire face.</li>
            <li> I am unable to determine yet which product is more effective, if there is going to be a difference in results.</li>
            <li> It was easily absorbed by the skin and left a silky, fresh feel.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve liked the few \\&quot;serum\\&quot; type products  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying this serum at least twice a day since I received it because it feels so good.</li>
            <li> I have heard nothing but great things about HA but typically, beauty products do not have a high enough dose to see the results it touts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acids that plump up my wrinkles better and make my skin softer (Perlabella Hyaluronic Acid Pure Dose).</li>
            <li> Great, affordable, 2 small drops are all I need to cover my face and neck, sinks into the skin really quick.</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t normally try to hurt a company&#x27;s sales by posting recipes on how to make their product in 7.5 seconds for less than a dollar, but I rely on honest Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> I saw this product while looking for other natural facial products and it already had great reviews.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever used hyaluronic acid, seems to help your skin shed cells and creat new</li>
            <li> Even though it is not very expensive it works well .</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to any person wanting a simple yet effective facial routine.</li>
            <li> It tightens, more than it plumps, like with other serums.</li>
            <li> I also believe this product helps my skin absorb other products better</li>
            <li> Olay or other store brands are of better quality.</li>
            <li> My pores instantly shrink after using this, your skin looks so fresh!</li>
            <li> It tightens, more than it plumps, like with other serums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now &amp; my skin looks &amp; feels much better after using it along with my other skin care products .</li>
            <li> Overall this is a product worth having to boost hydration!</li>
            <li> It has the most HA content that I have seen in other products.</li>
            <li> With a little patience, this product does exactly what it is supposed to do:  it binds to water and allows greater hydration of the skin.  </li>
            <li> and i recommend using other moisture products with it to enhance the hydration function. :)</li>
            <li> I tried it after using Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid (which has witch hazel, aloe and Vit C among other things) but found that the Oz Naturals had a better effect.</li>
            <li> I tried so many other things; how else am I going to find out if they work on ME?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no negative skin reactions whatsoever!</li>
            <li> As with most other serums, you do need a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I feel like I use more of this than other serums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so well hydrated that my combination skin is now normal!</li>
            <li> Extremely hid rating and non greasy :)</li>
            <li> My skin looks great, the dry patches are gone and my overall skin tone is even and has its youthful glow back</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re gonna feel like all the fluids absorbed into the pores instantly and the face skin more dry than before it was applied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very simple and clean, looks like a medicine a doctor might prescribe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instantly I felt a smoothness and clean feeling after applying the product.  </li>
            <li> pretty sure it&#x27;s missing something</li>
            <li> I apply this product first on clean skin and let it dry for a minute.</li>
            <li> It does dry your skin if you use too much, so go easy with it.  </li>
            <li> The acid isn&#x27;t strong enough to make you feel the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;, and with gentle exfoliation you can keep that young looking skin forever.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my skin draw in more moisture and helps fade my dark acne scars</li>
            <li> I have oil skin and pretty sensitive, but it just works perfectly for my skin without any uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, saw immediate results, now few days later, my mature aging skin looks &amp; feels almost like a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> and it works so fast I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Many sites stated that the hylauronic acid molecule is actually too large to actually penetrate and work in skincare products.</li>
            <li> Extra fast super delivery in 5 days (take in consideration am on APO address and everything we order is taking 12 to 15 days ) 2.</li>
            <li> While it is pricier, I would rather pay for something that works vs. continuing on with a cheaper, far less effective product.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily, is completely non-greasy, and it absorbs quickly without drying my moderately sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price on this was best but the actual absorption was hardly noticeable like the smaller one by another company.</li>
            <li> but I have to say you certainly get what you pay for and a little more with this product.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient in this bottle is distilled water, and I think that the hyaluronic acid is so diluted that it&#x27;s nearly non-existent.  </li>
            <li> Whole face appears younger, more defined and youthful after only a two week period.</li>
            <li> but wow, it works fast!  </li>
            <li> This is an average product, it&#x27;s ok for the value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much more expensive Hyaluronic Serums, and I think this one is possibly just as good.  </li>
            <li> you know those claims \\&quot;see results instantly, full results in 4-6weeks\\&quot;, only those results never happen.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ve tried to consciously stay out of the sun if I could help it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good deal!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been browsing for Hyaluronic acid but usually cost a lot for a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> Healing and moisturizing to skin love this product have suffered from acne and through the healing process this has helped with dark spot removal and scars will continue to use this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on 49 years old and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I am requesting a full refund and sendinf this back.</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone as well and will normally flareup in breakouts if I try anythng new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Its only been week with no bad skin reactions.</li>
            <li> This product actually works, has kept my face clear of breakouts and it does minimize the fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have considered putting some in a smaller bottle to keep in my bathroom and put the large bottle in the fridge to keep it fresh longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, after using half of the first bottle, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and have been looking for something a little extra to help moisturize around the yes and thought that this was perhaps the solution.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my liquid gold, the one product I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands and this is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good that my dry and rough patches are gone!</li>
            <li> super smoothing, absorbs quickly, never clogs my pores, I use it over other serums, such as vitamin C and firming serums, under my foundation for happy skin..LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The more I used the serum, the less I noticed the tight/dryness.</li>
            <li> It is softer, more supple, and the wrinkles are slightly less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the outcome and gradual improvements, I can truly say that there is a 60-70% less breakouts now for my skin condition.</li>
            <li> On all products the less ingredients the better.  </li>
            <li> The serum has a slightly smell, ok smell.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know if its just the serum or the serum less stress, love..</li>
            <li> I use this along with Vitamin C, E and A serums and it seems to work a lot better and cost a lot less than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex]] instead.</li>
            <li> Anther for buying the larger size bottle - use on both face and hands and see a return to that healthy younger look.</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin so well and gives it a vibrant mellow look like I just stepped out the shower.</li>
            <li> So the skin overall will feel much more smoothed after several days of use.</li>
            <li> I had used another, more expensive hyaluronic product before, but this one works just as well or better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give a true rating as yet as I haven&#x27;t used it for a long period</li>
            <li> This particular acid can&#x27;t penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li> works better than some of the more expensive products that iI have used.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, then apply a light moisturizer, the next morning my face and neck are soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> Many sources on the internet, as well as the product label, recommend to apply another layer of facial cream or moisturizer following application of the hyaluronic serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am older but still have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of Hyaluronic Acid Serum and am quite pleased with Cosmedica&#x27;s offering.  </li>
            <li> I am a African American with oily skin and what I love about the product is that it is not oily and it help control the oil on my face</li>
            <li> I do love that you use such a tiny amount</li>
            <li> Classic case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am 7 years older than one of my sisters and 10 years older than the youngest.</li>
            <li> Their friends also mistake me as someone closer to their age and wouldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m much older than they are.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly so that&#x27;s not adding a lot of time to my daily skin care routine</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a short while, but it is so refreshing.  </li>
            <li> the got back to me quickly and realized that every skin is not alike.....</li>
            <li> sure like to have used this stuff for last several yrs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my skin is very soft!</li>
            <li> This is better than Retin A. Really improves appearance of skin and last a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin also requires constant hydrating because I have to use strong facial cleansers and wipes sometimes, as I am in the theater/stage industry and am required to use certain make-up and cleansing products.</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve used, feels like I have a layer of make-up on, but this absorbs completely leaving my face feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I therefore highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the OZ naturals also highly rated on amazon</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> You very little very strong and get the job done.</li>
            <li> , I use it at night under moisturizer, My skin is very hydrated and soft, Not to sure about seeing any results yet about lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is truly the pure form and completely liquid, dispensed with a dropper.  </li>
            <li> I am keeping it in the fridge and it is a little bit better.  </li>
            <li> I have used another brand for a little longer and have seen results, but with this brand it seems to have gotten more hydrated and fewer wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Love the serum.. a little sticky</li>
            <li> The long term effects on fine lines will be wait &amp; see, as it&#x27;s to early to tell yet.  </li>
            <li> I am only giving one star for the following reason:  This product arrived very quickly - five stars for that; The packaging looked ok on the outside, but the actual product box was damaged and the product was not sealed.  </li>
            <li> I have parched, desert dry skin with wrinkles of a 50 year old on my 36 year old skin &amp; in the first hour of applying this, I saw glowing improvement!!!</li>
            <li> It is extremely hydrating and penetrates your skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, with a little bit of thickness to it at first but dries weightless.</li>
            <li> It immediately softens the skin, is not harsh at all (and I have very dry sensitive skin), and I love that I can just apply it before putting on my sun screen.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way thank you so much for putting out such a great product.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly, but initially gave me dry patches around my lower lip.  </li>
            <li> Promising but too early to tell</li>
            <li> On the whole though, there is definitely a marked difference in my face.</li>
            <li> This serum works very well so far.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- gentle on sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After applying this serum skin on the face is incredibly soft, it even wants to touch.</li>
            <li> I try to use it &amp;#34;every-other-day&amp;#34; since this is intense and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle, and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As a result of Retin-A my skin sheds at a higher frequency than I have ever experienced and I have been desperate to find a product that alleviates this without making my skin break out.</li>
            <li> my combination skin (dry-tzone) has completely corrected thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> am a 70 year old redhead with weathered skin and it really has reduced the wrinkles and skin aging flaws.</li>
            <li> I am also taking phyto-ceramides, thinking the combination would really deliver soft, youthful well moisturized results.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these products tend to wreck havoc on your skin, but this serum from Cosmedica has greatly improved my skin since I started using it in February.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has been using this product for about 1 month, the result is promising, it clear off my pimples and tighten my pores too.</li>
            <li> my girl starts really complimenting me and the comments about the lines on the face have completely stopped.</li>
            <li> After 1 week of using this product my whole forehead was clear again...</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m really liking the product and find myself using this serum throughout the day as well.</li>
            <li> Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free (Professional Formula)</li>
            <li> Works well for everyday use &amp; even better after a peel.</li>
            <li> instructions recommend that you put a regular moisturizer over it since it is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the noticeable difference in my skin without any of the side effects you usually see like drying or redness from these kind of products.  </li>
            <li> I will give it a few more months.</li>
            <li> I normally use DDF Wrinkle resist plus and pore minimizer</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t afford my normal serum.</li>
            <li> I love it and have been using it for a few years.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s quite the normal reaction the skin to the acid serum should be.  </li>
            <li> She gave a negative, but honest, review of this hyaluronic acid serum because the serum makes her face even drier.  </li>
            <li> Dried light!</li>
            <li> I will be able to tell if it is indeed a 5 star after I used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I will have to write a revised review in a few weeks when I can have more history for this product.</li>
            <li> I normally use another, pricier brand of face serum</li>
            <li> At first I was pleased, and at least thought I was seeing results.</li>
            <li> You should let the bottle sit in the fridge for a few hours til the magical gelling happens.</li>
            <li> Also a few side notes: I&#x27;m a caucasian female, early 30&#x27;s, fair skin.</li>
            <li> no negative residual feeling on skin.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks much better after using this hyaluronic product for a few months...</li>
            <li> really love it and recommend it to every one, you will be amazed to see the results in just few days.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the extra minute.</li>
            <li> I normally use SkinCeuticals &amp; was hoping to find a product comparable to that.</li>
            <li> Only been using this 1 week so as far as results not sure but love the smooth texture of product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products throughout my 45 years and they all feel oily or heavy or both.</li>
            <li> I cleansed my face like I normally do every morning.</li>
            <li> The Retin-A works very well for me, but there are certain parts of my face (right below my nostrils, and the center of my chin below my lip) that just peel and peel and peel and still haven&#x27;t adjusted to the Retin-A even after being on it for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Might not affect immediately but after few weeks of using, my skin looks better, fresher and smoother.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my normal moisturizers day and night for an added boost.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this to my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i use it on my face everyday and it is doing what it is supposed to do  love it</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m 57 and spent many of those years being mean to my face.  </li>
            <li> So it is difficult for me to find that good balance where the oily spots are cleaned up and the dry spots are not dried out more.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t wait too long to put my moisturizer on because the HA soaks right into my skin.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make it disappear completely, but it does make it less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;-Sensitive skins will love the lack of fragrance and fillers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hidden secret to skin care.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better for me when applied to a wet face, then waiting until the skin has absorbed both the water and the acid before applying other serums or moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> really hydrates the skin, but it has to be followed up by spray pure water and pat them into the skin several times for moisture absorption, then followed with a high quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When applied, it completely penetrates into your skin and there is no greasy feeling residue left on the surface, just smooth, soft, naturally plumped up skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am 26 with a few fine lines around my eyes and really thought that this would work.</li>
            <li> I had recently bought and used the whole bottle of Pure Body Naturals Hyaluronic acid and it doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write a review about any product but when the product is such a stellar dissappointment such as this serum, I must comment.</li>
            <li> After spending too much money trying out different creams, I eventually went back to my tried and true Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this product coupled with a good anti-aging moisturizer are a good skin regimen for women wanting to soften skin, lessen the appearance of wrinkles, and minimize that annoying &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that has to be blotted away all day long.</li>
            <li> just appreciate it that may newly started companies using organic materials and making affordable quality products.</li>
            <li> I am using it with my new dermapen.  </li>
            <li> This information was new to</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> I am 37 and have a new glow about me.  </li>
            <li> I skip retinol products that night because it will burn/sting the newly treated skin.</li>
            <li> Need to buy a new bottle...</li>
            <li> Will last a VERY long time and does such a nice job.</li>
            <li> Been using for 3 weeks nothing noticeable in fine line reduction, puffiness or dark spots area.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see a reduction in fine lines, but so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I also like to put a few drops over my foundation to help set it and give it a more natural look.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural product that really helps keep the skin soft and moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> absorb quick into skin and help the dry skin a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but hoping for great results in the near future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for only 2 weeks and in combination with the Sibu Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil I am noticing that my brow wrinkle (the crease between the brows) is starting to smooth out.</li>
            <li> and it seems to be enough so far to keep my skin smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried it on my legs which are always super dry</li>
            <li> Since I use it with other products I can&#x27;t say how efficacious it is for reducing wrinkles or dark spots on its own, but I absolutely think that it plumps my skin and leaves it glowing.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this didn&#x27;t bother it at all.  </li>
            <li> Leave my skin very soft and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Seller delivered as promised and was very professional.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out on a whim-</li>
            <li> My face is very soft.  </li>
            <li> I mainly started using it to fix some areas with uneven skin tone, reduce fine lines under the eye and also reduce the number/size of pores.  </li>
            <li> After getting microdermabrasion my skin specialist suggested using hyaluronic to help keep my skin moist, and wow does it work!</li>
            <li> but wow!</li>
            <li> Already used 4 times (morning and night) and my skin is so soft!</li>
            <li> Double thanks!</li>
            <li> Cant believe how soft my skin feels !</li>
            <li> 64 years young!</li>
            <li> my skins feels so soft after using it!  </li>
            <li> In fact, my girlfriend bought this product because of their stellar reviews, which now appears to be a total scam done by the company.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels like it did when I was a young woman - soft, very silky, and no heavy residue.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Argon oil, rosemary oil, and many other traditional cosmetic lines.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the smaller bottle because this was a first time purchase however</li>
            <li> Have only been using about 2 weeks, at first</li>
            <li> I usually never give any ratings, but for this product i must say : 1.</li>
            <li> Extra fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> And it is sooooooooo soft!</li>
            <li> my skin is the exact same..</li>
            <li> At first I used it only on my face and neck, including my eyes.  </li>
            <li> As part of my daily routine I started using it on my scalp too and my hair is now thicker and healthier - so much so that I have quit using products with minoxidil!</li>
            <li> My skin looks hydrated, pretty, younger and rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> Product seems ok, not sure if I will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my 47 year old face look and feel!</li>
            <li> and WOW were they generous!</li>
            <li> My face and neck are growing smoother and softer, and fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> but so far, on my face, I see no negative side effects.</li>
            <li> I use it first in the morning and evening followed by my moisturizers and such.</li>
            <li> My skin is so sensitive and this worked wonders!  </li>
            <li> But if you take care of your skin consistently and follow directions well, you will see a big difference.</li>
            <li> , I recently got married and was showing people my wedding photos.</li>
            <li> I do not usually write Reviews</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle (2oz) on Feb. 27th and still have 1/3 of a bottle left</li>
            <li> My really small super fine lines have gone but really no big change.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 2 stars as I&#x27;m just on my first bottle...</li>
            <li> I used Amazon&#x60;s Retinol as the moisturizer and my skin felt so soft and a I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> Only product I have ever used that gave consistent and permanent results.  </li>
            <li> and yeah, I am a hundred thirty one years old!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I think fine lines are less noticeable</li>
            <li> Skin looks radiant and feels so soft!</li>
            <li> This was the first skin product that was way above expectation..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, so haven&#x27;t seem significant results just yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure, but I feel like my skin is getting more even toned.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone interested in trying something different than the creams that are out there.  </li>
            <li> Also, when you first apply it, you can actually feel your skin tighten.  </li>
            <li> It is similar to my first purchase in that it is silky and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a good size, as you only need a very small amount per use.</li>
            <li> I really like the weightlessness and quick absorption of the product, but I do not notice a slight difference for this working toward wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Deep, clean moisturizing that actually makes your primer + foundation go on SMOOTHER!!!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A few drops, smooth over your entire face right after washing, then follow with your moisturizer</li>
            <li> This serum is really nice, it&#x27;s a gel-like consistency, so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely however my Dermitologist says it will do very little topically.</li>
            <li> (and I mean quick) pat of the hands together to get the product on both hands so you can apply it to the face in a quick fashion.</li>
            <li> The price is right and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Given that I am nearing 40, my skin is beginning to dry and fine lines are starting to show(though</li>
            <li> After rolling, I use a vitamin C cream followed by the hyaluronic acid serum and when I rub it on, the dead skin comes off easily.  </li>
            <li> I apply it first in a thin coat, then after it dries, put my moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> It sinks in incredibly fast to the point of looking like nothing was applied in the first place.</li>
            <li> It sinks in weightlessly and quickly, however it did not appear to increase the efficacy of my moisturizer at all.  </li>
            <li> Instead of the skin absorbing it and going back to how it normally feels, it makes the lotion act like sunscreen- an oily, shiny layer that collects dust.</li>
            <li> I have paid double at my derm for pure hyaluronic serum and this one does the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> Bought because of numerous positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to help peel away dead skin and stimulate new smooth skin.</li>
            <li> After less than a month my skin looks so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The furrow lines may take longer but even a slight softening is better than the opposite.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> I could shout from the mountain tops (if I lived in the mtns) that this really has helped with my excessively dry skin, wrinkles around eyes, smile lines, and overall glow of my skin.  </li>
            <li> but my sister insisted I looked for the pure ingredient that made that moisturizer extra especial.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s keeping up the good work at the very least!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known for some time that hyaluronic acid was one of the best moisturizers, but the &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; products have only a small amount in their formulas and the companies charge a ridiculously steep price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard for me to find a product that softens age lines &amp; wrinkles but doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily.</li>
            <li> I have had a really hard time finding a skin care regimen for my sensitive, reddish, acne-scarred skin, but I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> which is a huge plus in harsh Canadian winters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could clearly see my skin was dehydrated and nothing could \\&quot;quench its thirst\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> After a week, I was surprised by how much my pores have minimized, especially on my lower cheeks and the area between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s what it should do, but also clearly says after using this serum always follow up with you</li>
            <li> Can really see the plumping action on back of my hands.</li>
            <li> clear</li>
            <li> I hesitate to recommend it after only two days, but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> has not smell to it and clear.</li>
            <li> I used another brand prior to this (dr grandel) and that brand really made my face soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> It also helps keep my skin clear and hydraded.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like the way it feels under my regular face cream.  </li>
            <li> I have used only couple of days but really like so far.</li>
            <li> Chemotherapy  (14 yes ago) pushed me into early menopause.  </li>
            <li> Fast forward : I am currently on my 2nd bottle of this HA.</li>
            <li> Skin is so soft after use and wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was young.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product multiple times and getting ready to order another.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and Hyalunoric acid does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I naturally have a slim face.  </li>
            <li> I was completely amazed.  </li>
            <li> but so far there has been no improvement there.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles under my cheek bones disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> When applied directly to my face, I did get a face-full of pimples.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a too early to tell a difference.</li>
            <li> This really works i feel like i look much younger being 28.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> and this helps it to feel hydrated but not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> simply reduces her wrinkles very well.  </li>
            <li> We have been using it for about a year so far</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> but I have a rather sensitive nose</li>
            <li> what they naturally smell like.</li>
            <li> , I was really pleasantly surprised at the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m near 40, I feel that I need hydration.</li>
            <li> Even as an adult I still struggle with acne</li>
            <li> I think this product works really well with oily skin and the areas that were starting to crack</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft within just a week</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> May be too early.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my skin become soft and firmed it up.</li>
            <li> I have deep wrinkles on my forehead and my complexion really took a beating after having my daughter after 35.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Even my 67 yr old mom has been using it.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-60&#x27;s and people frequently ask what I use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic serum made my skin soft but thats it</li>
            <li> i didnt see any plumping in the skin as it claimed on pre mature wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hunting a whole set of products to create the ultimate skincare package.  </li>
            <li> no dye, just a natural clear liquid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel baby soft.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m still young</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M A 55 YEAR OLD WOMEN</li>
            <li> So far I have used it for over two months</li>
            <li> I recommend it to my sister and to a professional skin care person.</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle of this hyaluronic acid serum and did not notice that much improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is reasonably priced and my 2nd order.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell that it has made any difference in the way my skin looks, but perhaps it is too early to tell.  </li>
            <li> My skin seems to be well-hydrated, so far, but I&#x27;ve not been mistaken for a teenager or carded in a bar.</li>
            <li> I use this after a session with Dermalogi and my skin feels so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> For the price of this product my skin is soft and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> how much hyaluronic acid is actually in the bottle because</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had enough time to see any real results</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old, and used to be a sun worshiper...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin with acne</li>
            <li> That has nearly all gone away too.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face incredibly soft and my skin looks even in tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is naturally occurring in your body, so you can be assured that you&#x27;re giving your skin something it loves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing results with the natural serums... takes time to see.</li>
            <li> this is a product that replaces something that is naturally produced by the skin but that production decreases as we age</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft now.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix it with my night cream, with my daily moisturizer or sunscreen, with my foundation, or just apply it straight to my face.  </li>
            <li> Helps really well for the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> Not so much difference in my face, but again, it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is relatively inexpensive and really does help improve skin texture.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and it has been gently exfoliating my skin and moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> Bought this product on a whim &amp;amp; I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I know, too early for a review</li>
            <li> My face looks brighter and much healthier instantly!</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old with combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I am using the product, but maybe it&#x27;s too early to see any results.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and with an even texture.</li>
            <li> It makes My skin shine and soft .</li>
            <li> Beware if you have allergies or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 51 yrs young</li>
            <li> but so far I like the way it makes my soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is fast acting!  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s not helping my acne so much (but not aggravating it either), but it&#x27;s definitely helping with moisture</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything different from using this product.</li>
            <li> So far it keeps my skin soft and supple and moist.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and tightened.</li>
            <li> Wow... this product gave me what it talks about.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft but I must use a moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> So far , I like the serum.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum I&#x27;ve tried, and I like this one much better.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Been using it nearly 2 weeks</li>
            <li> but so far I like the results.  </li>
            <li> No adverse reactions noted thus far</li>
            <li> Every part of you deserves to look young.</li>
            <li> The lines on my neck are gone, and my hands don&#x27;t look like old lady crepe skin.  </li>
            <li> Just for the record I have 3 year old and 3 months old babies, no sleep ever</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a month but really like the results.</li>
            <li> I would recommended this product for sensitive or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I am on Retin-A 0.05% for adult acne.</li>
            <li> and I am already 30 years old, no history of acne or whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> If you use it directly, just a couple of drops for under each eye is it.&lt;br /&gt;This has turned out, for me anyway, the find of the year.</li>
            <li> I believe I was sent an old bottle of serum.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hydration - As far as hydration goes, the product did well.  </li>
            <li> The price is very inexpensive relative to what this product does.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face so soft.</li>
            <li> I am 64 yrs old and have been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> I put this on every day and my skin is dewy and soft.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, acne prone skin with lots of acne scars</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin, no break outs that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li> It makes the skin so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft using this.</li>
            <li> It completely changed the texture and appearance of my skin, making it look and feel youthful again.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of scaly precancerous areas for years that I was going to have the dermatologist remove, and by putting it directly on those areas, they are gone.  </li>
            <li> love it, my skin looks younger everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Hyaluronic Acid for a few weeks and my skin is starting to look and feel better.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product after reading reviews but it is good.</li>
            <li> Not mentioned in the ordering info, and a major oversight!!</li>
            <li> I have bought another serum(180 Ultima Pure Swiss, (Super Strong) Hyaluronic Acid Serum Forte with Vitamin C) at the same time and only this bottle is broken,</li>
            <li> I might get back to normal!  </li>
            <li> I brashly squirted a whole dropper-full into my hand the first time I used it, and ended up having to spread it over a large part of my upper body.</li>
            <li> Without using water first, my skin got dry from using this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too early for me to tell you whether this product has made a profound difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this the first time and it worked wonders on my dry patches.</li>
            <li> must was face first, let it dry.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;m putting on my face because it seems a bit strong.</li>
            <li> yo, black female with caramel complexion, so darken marks from acne is easily visible on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels so silky and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have gotten this a few times now, and am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quickly absorbed into the skin, and other product can be applied over it.  </li>
            <li> It is true that this product makes your skin feel tight</li>
            <li> It seriously eliminated that side effect of the Retin-A. LOvE IT.</li>
            <li> It was packaged in a dark glass bottle to ensure freshness, is reasonably priced and provides intense hydration as advertised.  </li>
            <li> i have found that my (older) facial skin needs application in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look any younger, but every day I am getting older anyway.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin about a week to ten days later after first use.</li>
            <li> The first time i wrote a review for this product i received an email saying it needs to be revised, only because i used &#x27;actual&#x27; words describing this serum.</li>
            <li> most of you are skeptical when buying something for the first time</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands as well and that seems to help a little bit more with this dry weather too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this high enough.  </li>
            <li> The information that came with this product said it could be mixed with other things, so after using it for a few days to be sure I wasn&#x27;t going to magically develop an allergic reaction (which has happened many times with other things in years past), I mixed several droppers-full of this product into both my day and night creams, so I&#x27;m not layering on products that are just going to mix together on my face, anyway.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several  and would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The price is right, I use it at bedtime and my face is much smoother and tiny lines around eyes and mouth seem to be less pronounced</li>
            <li> did not put the 5 stars , only because ,  you feel that is right for your face , neck and decollete , but I hope the benefits are long term and underneath.</li>
            <li> If it does that, you have major improvement!  </li>
            <li> It is a hydrator like no other!</li>
            <li> If you look at alot of the reviews past the first page they are 3 words or a little more, so I suspect something is going on.  </li>
            <li> However, I often dab a few drops on, allow it to dry, and then apply my lotions -better result this way in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Only if used daily in that way before you go to sleep, you will see a significant difference(sorryfor being strict, my skin has always been dry)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most of the harsh chemicals that are in other products.</li>
            <li> I see positive results after only 2 applications, one last night before bedtime and one this morning.</li>
            <li> I love this serum and would highly recommend this to people with dry and dull skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use much so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have had delicate, sensitive skin since forever, and I finally got fed up with this latest flare-up.</li>
            <li> Smells strange but very firming to my face</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for a long period of time but it seems to be very hydrating.</li>
            <li> We appreciate the product.&lt;br /&gt;We are going to use them for a long time until we see some real benefit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the product is exactly what l expected</li>
            <li> Great results and much less expensive than switching to a high cost moisturizer with it as an ingredient.</li>
            <li> I only have a few fine lines, no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I had some contact dermatitis, it cleared it right up, and it makes your skin really nice, especially in the cold air.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, my skin was so dry that it immediately absorbed the product.  </li>
            <li> skin is remarkably smooth, with very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with a gycolic acid peel (I double up on application of Hualuronic acid for about 4 to 5 days after a peel and then coat with pure vitamin A oil instead of a petroleum-based product that causes clogged pores and breakouts which estheticians and dermatologists recommend after certain procedures - tsk tsk naughty professionals).</li>
            <li> This works great as a base moisturizer, but especially for minimizing fine lines just as well as (if not better) than the high price brands one purchases in a high end retail store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if most products work, but this one definitely does.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use much, it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for every day use but strong enough that day by day you notice the difference as all the uneveness, dull skin</li>
            <li> Only new to these..</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 4 stars is because I&#x27;m new to skin care products.</li>
            <li> This serum really helps to aid in my dry skin treatment.  </li>
            <li> Does dry skin fast, so put on moisture cream after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 57 and my skin is so dry during the winter so this has been a real test</li>
            <li> I could put layers and layers of my favorite, expensive moisturizers on and still not get much</li>
            <li> although it starts out feeling slightly sticky, the tackiness goes away when the serum is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> has an initially oily texture that quickly absorbs into skin in dry weather (instant moisture relief!)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Works great on reducing eye fatigue from those late nights ...staying out late and drinking all night.</li>
            <li> I am currently using 100% Natural and USDA Certified Organic Grapeseed Oil and WOW</li>
            <li> I am 53 with age spots from too much sun when I was younger, also wrinkles around the eyes and deep furrow lines and I am noticing everything softening up.</li>
            <li> My peers didn&#x27;t really care for that when we were younger and the sun damage on their skin is obvious.</li>
            <li> I use the same regimen on my neck and hands, and I get compliments all the time about how young I look, how soft my skin is and that I have a glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this serum for two days, but I can already see a difference in my skin, which is very old</li>
            <li> I have spent a LOT more for half the volume!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in the percentage of hyaluronic acid, along with the other ingredients in it, but nothing is listed on the label.</li>
            <li> Then I had a major breakout and stopped using it on my face, in case it triggered the breakout somehow.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything major....</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped my 56 year old skin - people think I&#x27;m 40!  </li>
            <li> Both of the major brands here on Amazon did.</li>
            <li> will try it again but for the week that I used it, it was giving me breakouts, nothing major</li>
            <li> Applied in the morning, evening, even during the day, it absorbs well and moisturizes like no other.</li>
            <li> First, I beg to differ with the other commenters here that you can&#x27;t reduce lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It has a sticky feeling as you pat it on, and like I said, I did not notice any major change to my skin.</li>
            <li> Tried the product for the first time based on  reviews by other users who have tried it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything and this is the first product I have tried that have finally softened and almost eliminated  my dry spots.  </li>
            <li> (Lots of my other favorite active ingredients, like dimethicone, create a barrier that prevents moisture from escaping, since your skin&#x27;s mechanisms that are supposed to keep the water inside are failing, but humectants work differently.)</li>
            <li> Then I apply Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair for Night because it&#x27;s a moisturizer and also has retinol, which really helps with skin repair (wrinkles and uneven tone), smooths skin by promoting new growth, and also helps keeps my skin clear from acne.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> Originally I put the serum directly on my skin followed by moisturizer, but it made my skin feel tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Maybe my skin was sensitive to it, but it really did dry my skin!!!  </li>
            <li> i use it to prep my skin for using a retinoid hydrogel that is otherwise too hard to apply smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> So upon ordering this, me of little faith, was surprised by the speed it arrived, and i saw results the first time i applied it, and with no adverse skin reactions.</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower in the morning, I&#x27;ll pat my face dry and right away applying the serum to my skin and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I had the highest hopes for this product after reading all the great reviews, I also read the bad ones, and hoped they were the exception and not the norm.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t affect my oily t-zone problems and still manages to help the rest of my skin that&#x27;s generally dehydrated.</li>
            <li> We all have hyaluronic acid in our bodies already, but is generally taken as a supplement to help with joints.  </li>
            <li> This serum is dirt cheap when you compare it to results it can produce and when used in combination with derma roller (they call it a miracle tool for skin perfection-cheap alternative to derma fillers), at least for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy and has kept my skin clear, and makes it look actually dewy instead of oily.  </li>
            <li> Family members commented on my face looking clear and overall &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Definitely tones, but may cause some sensitive skin to peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60year old female, use it around my mouth every night along with the L&#x27;Oreal cream</li>
            <li> but if I feel the results are barely noticeable then</li>
            <li> Especially considering that I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use the Hyaluronic serum directly after micro needling my entire face.</li>
            <li> This product provides the moisture I need: my face actually radiates and I have mature skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is apparent when you apply the serum</li>
            <li> Using  this product for nearly a year and definitely seeing the result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as oily as when I was younger, but still developed an oily glow within an hour or two of showering.  </li>
            <li> so far, it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect on my neck area.  </li>
            <li> is left feeling really soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far it seems to working</li>
            <li> I use this after I &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34; my face and so far I have seen a definite improvement in my skin and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> The 100% pure-highest quality apparently means what they could get and make for the money.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, so it is probably too early to tell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I apply this my face feels so soft and I am already seeing results only after 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> I bought a similar product from a professional and I knew when I applied it.</li>
            <li> which is the complete opposite of what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I will be 75 years old next month.</li>
            <li> At 63 years old I am mistaken for someone in my 40&#x27;s daily!</li>
            <li> particular hyaluronic acid serum was tested on my forehead between my brows, where I often fight with dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this only one star because after two weeks of use I developed a rash all over my face which took another two weeks of slathering cortizone all over my face for it to go away.</li>
            <li> and now I feel that my face is more hydrated and my pores have drastically decreased in size</li>
            <li> Love this product.non irritating and leaves my skin glowing.</li>
            <li> I love this product, i always had irritated and sensible skin, looking tired.</li>
            <li> The bottles that I have received have a thick liquid that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Having to use this much doesn&#x27;t make it last very long.</li>
            <li> So far, I like the results, although they are not as notable as with a couple of serums I used in the past (one does not last at all, and the other has since tripled its price).</li>
            <li> The only negative is that It dries out very quickly once applied on the skin, but i think it is suppose to do that, so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit dry so this product was easily absorbed since it&#x27;s not very oily.  </li>
            <li> But, as I&#x27;ve done with other serums, I leave it for a few minutes and then put my regular moisturizer on top.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a short time, but it does leave my face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> It soaks right in but skin does not  stay moisturized but a few hours.</li>
            <li> I originally bought and used a \\&quot;Swiss\\&quot; hyaluronic acid serum, 100% pure at twice the cost, so when I used it up quickly, I went hunting for another less expensive product that would have the same results.</li>
            <li> We have dry to normal skin.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a slight but consistent firming of the skin around my mouth and forehead.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and, while I&#x27;ve yet to notice any miraculous results, peps up my complexion on dull days after late nights just fine.</li>
            <li> , I have gone rashes on the face, my pores are very clean and have decreased in size.</li>
            <li> I have tried other serums and find this one very drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Considering I buy it from other companies for as much as $75 a  bottle.</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid plumps up your skin so they aren&#x27;t as noticeable, and the bel essence gives your skin the vitamins, fatty acids, omega 3&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s that are needed to build healthy new skin, minus the lines, wrinkles and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> There is a wide price range for this stuff depending what brand and who&#x27;s selling it, from this seller I got twice the product for $4.00 less than the brand I originally intended to buy before they got</li>
            <li> google reviews and feel let down with all the positive 4 - 5 stars, because this is anything but &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced having some tiny painless &amp;#34;welts&amp;#34; that look like acne develop on my skin, small pustules of clear liquid being trapped in the epidermis, which are pretty hard to get rid of since they are not exactly acne or whiteheads.</li>
            <li> i live in really dry cities</li>
            <li> it sinks right in, and a tiny bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A difference doesn&#x27;t need to be dramatic for me to appreciate it--it can be the difference between staying up all night scratching my arms and being able to sleep.</li>
            <li> The above recipe actually makes a gel that is slightly thicker than Cosmedica&#x27;s, so you could use less powder and it will make even more serum.</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble with oily skin but many products dried up my skin.</li>
            <li> It just gives me a healthy appearance, not once has my skin dried up during this harsh Boston winter.</li>
            <li> Was a little drying at first, but my skin has since adjusted.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this serum, after carefully reading all of the reviews, as well as reading in a magazine that hyaluronic serum holds up to 1000% its weight in water.</li>
            <li> I first ordered a C serum from a different brand, -less</li>
            <li> This serum leaves your skin smooth &amp; tight!!!</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have definitely noticed my skin has evened out and generally looks healthier.</li>
            <li> it dries my skin too much, but if i mix it with any other moisturizer it does wonder to my skin, i can see and feel the difference the next day, and people are complementing my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about purchasing this product, but, unfortunately, the alcohol in it irritated my skin, so I didn&#x27;t see much hydration</li>
            <li> For 18 dollars, you can make at least 20 of these 2 oz serum bottles full.</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated and fresh, been using it with my usual skincare and it has made a difference.</li>
            <li> True, other lines have vitamins as well in their serums, but I get enough of that from other face products</li>
            <li> Very watery, runs down my face.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not disappointed with this purchase and will buy again when I run out, which will be a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have other unnecessary stuff, like fragrances or other actives, so it is non greasy and great for sensitive skin or if you plan to mix it with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My laugh lines have become less noticeable!!</li>
            <li> not a single drop of the serum was left.</li>
            <li> Depend on it daily to keep my skin hydrated, especially since I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Also, it Is extremely dry and looks old now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 68 yr old woman who still has oily skin so if you have really dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> Their skin looks dry, cracked, tan but old.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a much cheaper version that I have previously purchased at Amazon, so</li>
            <li> I use this every night mixed with my moisturiser and it has cleared up my acne and dark marks really fast.</li>
            <li> Apparently, this product is not a miracle for everyone: instead of feeling moisturized and hydrated, some people feel the total opposite.  </li>
            <li> Makes a visable difference in my aging eye area in only a few days, thanks!</li>
            <li> It goes on a little greasy, but the moment it&#x27;s absorbed, my skin is noticeably still dry.</li>
            <li> and I have gradually been seeing positive results everyday.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is due to the fact that I have a pretty oily T-zone (which is where these pustules have appeared), or if it&#x27;s because I applied too much of the product onto my skin, but I am now left with having to combat these tiny bumps on my skin by pricking them with a needle.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough so far to see what lasting effects might be.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use products on my face other than washing with baby soap.</li>
            <li> Right after I use toner on my face, I apply a small drop on each area (forehead, crow&#x27;s feet around eyes, upper lip, and neck)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the serum twice a day for about two weeks (3 small drops for face [right side, left side, forehead] and one drop for neck), have had no adverse reactions (no breakouts, rashes, etc.)</li>
            <li> &amp; my skin tone has really  improved with less sun spots &amp; red areas.</li>
            <li> I ordered a similar product before and paid twice as much for half the amount.</li>
            <li> , Cosmedica&#x27;s HA is much much thicker consistancy and with less ingredients and also with HA being the second ingredient.</li>
            <li> The bel essence also relieves the harshness of using retinol and hyaluronic acid, especially if you have dry to sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li> 43 year old recovering tan-o-holic, lots of sun damage seeing marked results half way into 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only encountered less than 1 in 10 that made me actually feel they did anything and even less ever wowed me of having significant results.</li>
            <li> The truth is, after I gently rubbed the liquid-like serum on my face, the serum quickly dried out from my skin (not sure if it was absorbed into my skin or simply vaporized), and left my skin even drier, like it has pulled all moisture out of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, menopausal, with very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little drying to me, but I think I was using too much.</li>
            <li> so much better less break outs smaller pores and no more dry spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say right now the effects of the hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and in less than a minute no more greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I saw a dramatic reduction in fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have real oily skin but just very slight</li>
            <li> This serum keeps my skin soft and supple, and does not cause it to itch or become red like other harsher serums</li>
            <li> This product  absorbs better than any other competitor, almost instantly, where as the other brands I tried with fillers just sat on my skin for at least a minute before I could apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as quickly as I had hoped, although, I can definitely see a difference in the appearance of my skin compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought Cosmedica Skincare&#x27;s product because of the stellar rating, and it turns out that a large portion of it is fake.  </li>
            <li> I use it with other products Obagi clear, obagi tretinoin and Elastin Collage St. Ives.</li>
            <li> When used with my other moisturizer, I have seen a marked difference in hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> A beautician told me the other day that my skin felt soft and plum.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate like other things.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I saw dramatic results (been using for about 1 month now), but I do think by skin is in better condition overall due to use of this product.</li>
            <li> a nice barrier in dry conditions, such as flying, cold weather...</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they say is 100% pure- highest quality.</li>
            <li> I usually mix 2-3 drops of this with my favourite moisturizer or 100% pure shea butter</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, but it has become less so since I started to use this product.  </li>
            <li> No other products/serum used other than HA and my regular moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No one believes that I am (almost) 75 and have been through cancer surgery, open heart surgery and eight other major surgeries.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am a pretty die hard oil of olay fan.  </li>
            <li> I am tired of the questionable positive reviews and reviewers on Amazon, and I am going to try to post more reviews that you can at least trust is coming from a real person and professional.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product smooths my forehead lines and the small lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps yet, but very smoothing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> so not sure I really like.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several expensive products to try and keep my facial skin smooth</li>
            <li> Not sure really what to expect from either product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it did much for me</li>
            <li> I threw the box but would still return this serum, and request anyone whose about to buy it looking at the stellar ratings, please stop and read through the negative ratings as well.</li>
            <li> Long story short:</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long but mixed with my llotions my cellulite cream and my face cream</li>
            <li> The product should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I expect it to last me a long while.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see drastic changes, but seems to have helped a bit.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about two weeks, so I cannot give a long term review at this point.</li>
            <li> /&gt;5 drops will do your face and neck, so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> There are apparently no studies that prove hyaluronic acid works.  </li>
            <li> This will last a long time and will continue to be a staple in my vanity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve researched a lot and found out that delaying the signs of aging and preventing them is the way to go to stay &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; as long as possible.</li>
            <li> As I have only used this 3 times, I can&#x27;t speak to long term.</li>
            <li> Seems like it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet</li>
            <li> of product - I am generally not a fan of skincare products as I can always feel them lying on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The results were in writing only by the company and what I mean by that is it was hard to tell, I just went along with believing that my skin was getting what it needed after using my Derma Roller, when my body would absorb the product on my face at a much greater intensity.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> The line that was coming down from my eyes to my mouth has completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply directly to  my forehead because I didn&#x27;t want it running down my nose.  </li>
            <li> It is a little early to evaluate it properly.</li>
            <li> I ran out and have gone w/o it for a few days and my skin looks dull and my pores look huge.</li>
            <li> But, you can&#x27;t mess it up, and it&#x27;s safe to lick it off your fingers if you get sloppy</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin texture yet - which may be for the best, at least it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or other bad stuff.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin texture yet - which may be for the best, at least it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or other bad stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin does appear to be a little smoother, and maybe a little more even toned, but no one has noticed any difference, and usually when a product is working well, I get comments.</li>
            <li> Not even worth it to try this on my face , positive reviews has a lot of fake and repeated ones !</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling dry instead of moisturized.</li>
            <li> and I had several dry patches.  </li>
            <li> Also, my skin is so dry today even with my moisturizer on that my skin is actually flaking.  </li>
            <li> Since starting to use it two weeks ago my skin no longer looks horribly dry, it hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, and it looks as if my acne scars are lightening.</li>
            <li> I only apply a rain drop size to my t-zone, let it dry then, apply the toner</li>
            <li> so I think if I keep using it my dry spots will totally disappear.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that I have noticed was you have to put moisturizer on after or skin will feel dry.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have dry skin like me.</li>
            <li> Apply hyaluronic acid serum to face, neck, upper chest and let it dry, the apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My face was SO dry that my face was white all over!</li>
            <li> face is mixed oily and dry.</li>
            <li> A lot of different things I tried either over dry my skin or make it oilier.</li>
            <li> My skin showed a marked improvement in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum every night for two weeks, and noticed my skin became  dry, then I noticed red spots on my skin, and some blistering.  </li>
            <li> but not sure if it really helps skin retain moisture in the long run (i&#x27;ve been using this since sept of 2014).</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin due to steroids and chemotherapy.  </li>
            <li> It was nice and thick when i first got it but soon turned bad.  </li>
            <li> and this is the first and the only one that was broken when it finally reached me.</li>
            <li> Because of the dry outside air, I&#x27;ve been using a little bit of natural moisturizer (earth science brand).</li>
            <li> I have sun damage, large pores and dull skin.  </li>
            <li> Currently live in Cal which is dry (used to live on east coast where it was much more humid and my skin hated it).</li>
            <li> I have no more dry patches and I notice the texture being much smoother.</li>
            <li> Usually, when I try a new product my skin will go through a period of adjusting but not with this!</li>
            <li> now not only does it go on with ease, but my skin is no longer dry and flaky!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no perfumes or other additives and hyaluronic acid is naturally present in the human body and is also used to heal wounds and burns on the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently ordered similar products made by other manufacturers (brands).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the same results I was starting to see with the other brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products including prescription products, that were quite expensive without any results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive serums, and had no results at all, so I am amazed by this product.</li>
            <li> (the larger bottle of the other product was $60), though it almost seems like it smelled a bit different.</li>
            <li> If I look REALLY hard, there may be a small difference in plumping up my fine lines after using (but I could be imagining the difference)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a several months and after approximately 4 weeks I noticed my skin is smoother, less dry, brighter, &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; (in a good way) with less uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> little product is needed for complete coverage, and I use it on my face and neck in p.m. after I take off my makeup and in the a.m. before I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have a combination of oil and dry skin whereas my mom have dry facial skin.</li>
            <li> My skin normally has a few dry spots, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the hyaluronic acid diminished the dry patches immediately.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well and  and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The number one ingredient in this serum is WATER, so it&#x27;s very runny and therefore hard to mix in with moisturizer or liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> It was much larger than I was expecting, and seeing as I only need to use a little bit, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I tended to think that the \\&quot;swiss\\&quot; advertisement must mean that it is purer, more subtle in it&#x27;s performance,</li>
            <li> Smells bad didnt do anything for my face to be honest.</li>
            <li> When I saw this product in Amazon, I&#x27;m afraid the serum would make my face even more oily or greasy feeling because I have oily face.  </li>
            <li> The place between eyebrows is difficult to smooth out and the serum took care of it.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 60&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t expect any product to do as much as this one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 3 because I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working or now...if I apply it at night with moisturizer.. Next day my face feels soft</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t moisturize, firm, clear or reduce pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week so far, so not sure of all results.  </li>
            <li> (in my hand) and I apply it to my WET face, neck, and upper chest.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying this as long as they keep selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was well packaged and arrived a couple days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, a drop goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Anyway as long as it keeps at the price</li>
            <li> I been using it for long time</li>
            <li> Mary Ann Long; 2160 Snow Hill Road; Chuluota, FL 32766.</li>
            <li> and I think it goes a long way towards helping how my face looks.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful what products I use, as several cause irritation &amp; redness.</li>
            <li> I am not really old</li>
            <li> I plumps up your skin, as long as I use it.  </li>
            <li> Only a few drops are necessary to cover face, so it will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Will def be a long term customer</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way</li>
            <li> As long as it doesn&#x27;t make me break out (and if it does, I will update this), I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I will see in the long run how it benefits my skin.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the actual amount (percentage) of HA in the serum</li>
            <li> Good makeup base.</li>
            <li> I am in my late fifties with dry skin in certain areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: 2 days later, my rash (which is still all over my face) is starting to go down</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for less than I paid for only one product of a competitor for only 1</li>
            <li> the same day - 69 people all of a sudden thought her review was unhelpful in less than 6 hours.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy kiehls but thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid 4 times the amount and saw the same results in other products.  </li>
            <li> It can be used with other products like pepha-tight to make you look younger.</li>
            <li> i will definitely be ordering other products from cosmedica.  </li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind is no two people have the same skin texture, so what works for one may not work for the other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, those with oily skin are constantly battling their oil which a lot of products and regimens either leave it too greasy or extremely strip of all moisture.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;the value compared to other products on the market keep me coming back for additional purchases</li>
            <li> It seems to have done a little plumping in a couple of weeks using it twice daily and evened out the facial tone.</li>
            <li> product and a little more expensive-,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acid products and always come back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;v used other brands with the same ingredient and not had this problem</li>
            <li> I use this product along with my other facial products and while I don&#x27;t expect to see immediate results I hope that the hyaluronic acid serum will help improve the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> and/or when the skin receives multiple environmental or other insults.</li>
            <li> I use it at night with my other bedtime facial routines..</li>
            <li> Ordered this serum because it is only Hyaluronic acid without other vitamins etc.</li>
            <li> I only use a couple of drops (it absorbs in extremely well) on my face and then apply moisturizer...</li>
            <li> This time, I ordered a larger bottle because I want to use the serum on other dry areas, like my hands, heels and elbows (and anything else that is dry in between).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin hydrated for very long.</li>
            <li> I have not used it very long</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use for a very long time</li>
            <li> Just made my face feel really dry.</li>
            <li> Our dry climate challenges any skin product.</li>
            <li> My face was extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that feels dry after washing it</li>
            <li> wash my face morning and evening, pat dry with wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I thought nothing could help my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Hardcore moisturizer if you have dry skin, scar tissue, or keratosis.</li>
            <li> and my skin is really dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> Have you ever had a dry, oily face?</li>
            <li> Yup, then it starts to crack and wrinkle in the dry areas while the oily areas are still an oil-slick.</li>
            <li> but it does wonders for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bye bye dry skin</li>
            <li> (My skin tends to be on the dry side.)</li>
            <li> Wash ur face, pay dry and apply.</li>
            <li> skin is softer, pigment even and no longer dry from shaving</li>
            <li> Instead of injecting this into my knees, I&#x27;m patting it all over my face to help with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> After using it for 2 months my skin became extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I have read on google search to apply it on a damp/wet skin and let it dry.</li>
            <li> My skin has been dry because of the winter and this helped.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a week and my skin feels so dry that it hurts.</li>
            <li> and it started to dry out my face, so</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a product that would moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> yet I would have dry spots.. until I found this product.</li>
            <li> I watch Dr Oz, and he recommended this for dry skin.</li>
            <li> it does tend to dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Let it dry between spritz overs.</li>
            <li> I have skin irritations on my face where I have really dry patches.  </li>
            <li> This product is helping with my problem dry skin.</li>
            <li> but the skin feels dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even edible and my babies cradle cap and dry patches on her legs have disappeared overnight.</li>
            <li> , my ski became  dry and opaque, threw it away, not even with the help of derma roller.</li>
            <li> Must be followed by a moisturizer as the serum feels a bit dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that an all natural product could erase wrinkles, but the bel essence is fabulous and</li>
            <li> I know this will be heaven during the winter when my skin gets really dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still dry</li>

            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It seemed to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> , I use it with my derma roller, because they say don&#x27;t let the skin dry up after derma rolling.  </li>
            <li> Acne medication can leave your skin dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> and you only need a few drops to cover the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li> Left it alone, and tried it a few weeks later, after my breakut was healed.</li>
            <li> I emailed the supplier, they responded the next day, apologized and investigating this issue,  I got the replacement in the next few days!&lt;br</li>
            <li> [I use Cera Ve, the green bottle [for regular to oily skin] to wash, and Cera Ve, the blue label, moisturizer]</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30s and have always had skin problems especially acne scars and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not only do I have combination skin due to my Japanese-American genetics, but I&#x27;m also allergic to everything and live in both dry, cold Colorado and hot, humid Georgia.  </li>
            <li> morning and night I use my all time, never live without, the one thing I would pack for a desert island, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS</li>
            <li> But days of limited sun exposure, it&#x27;s just in the morning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a single mother &amp; when I splurge on beauty products or ANYTHING for myself..</li>
            <li> it has made that part of my face dry and soft, no more oily skin.</li>
            <li> Without the item moisturizer is not absorbed well and my skin feels dry later in the day or over a night but with the serum hydration is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have hard water.</li>
            <li> The moistureness goes away to fast, also the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> An added Bonus for me is that I have dark patches of skin under my jaw line that I have used lightners on without results and recently I noticed that they have started to look lighter since I started using this HA serum.  </li>
            <li> I usually get pegged for 29/30yrs old.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking to reverse skin aging, wrinkles, or loose skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth every penny and the amount you get will last for several months.</li>
            <li> I then pat it in which literally takes maybe 3 pats, then it goes slightly stick for the last 2 pats and then dry.  </li>
            <li> Then...it my wrinkles &amp; dryness even worse, after a week I looked 10 years OLDER, not younger.</li>
            <li> In fact it dried my skin in certain spots on the lower eye area, not sure why...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, there are very few products out there (if any) that can completely remove all your aging skin ailments.  </li>
            <li> My face was dry and felt tight after using it so I&#x27;d use my regular moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> It works as described and is a \\&quot;must\\&quot; for dry climates!</li>
            <li> &quot; So I guess I will use this on dry patches of skin or for my Fiancee&#x27;s psoriasis?!</li>
            <li> Actually, I do not see any difference in my skin by useing this product compared to the product I can buy in a dept store for less money.</li>
            <li> my skin, so that my &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; wrinkles above my nose are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Some previous obvious wrinkles were noticeably reduced.</li>
            <li> I have to apply other facial cream or other oil-based serum on my face to relieve the dryness and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I noticed my breakouts have diminished greatly, less oiliness and softer appearance of the skin, so I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Ive never really had dry skin or anything though</li>
            <li> just let the serum absorb into the skin and then apply my usual facial moisturizers, such as an Oil of Olay Regenerist product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve noted only slight changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> Going back to the previous product.</li>
            <li> I no longer need globs of moisturizer; my skin feels a lot plumper, the residual scarring seems less red and make up goes on smoother under this.</li>
            <li> I ADORE HYALURONIC ACID SERUM, these people deliver it quickly, a little goes a very long way, my skin adores this product and cannot give it enough stars...</li>
            <li> but if I don&#x27;t put anything on my face....it feels very dry..</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry</li>
            <li> My skin is very very dry and with the serum</li>
            <li> my face is very dry and flacky.</li>
            <li> Hubby has very dry skin on his ankles, around the sock line, I will start him using this tonight.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed and annoyed thinking I finally found a great serum.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days, but it seems to be addressing my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried using it a few different ways, but my skin still is dry.</li>
            <li> My skin tight and reduce wrinkle instantly.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is it can leave your face feeling a bit tight but if you mix it with your face lotion it eliminates this problem.</li>
            <li> When worn under make-up it provides a strong base for the makeup and the overall appearance of my face looks younger and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have some deep lines on my forehead between my eyes , they seem a little softer.</li>
            <li> and I actually feel like my lines are softening a little.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a little while</li>
            <li> , my scars haven&#x27;t gotten a little smaller.</li>
            <li> Arden moisturizer which eliminated that oiliness, but my skin still felt a little rough or coarse even though I use exfoliating gloves when I bathe.  </li>
            <li> some patches of my face get extremely oily while some stay extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I do not even have very sensitive skin and within 24 hours I have broken out in hives all over my face with an extremely itchy red rash.</li>
            <li> I used to have a bad habit of touching my face with my hands all the time and that didn‚Äôt help either.</li>
            <li> What a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I am always looking for a great product without having to pay outrageous prices.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately i havent noticed much of a difference in the last year and am now in the market for another HA serum.</li>
            <li> It just takes a small amount for face, eyes and neck and should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> So, I use it after my shower when I&#x27;m wet</li>
            <li> I will definitely use this everyday.</li>
            <li> After a week I tried mixing a few drops with moisturizer, but it had the same effect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this was a big waste of money</li>
            <li> It is a pity I don&#x27;t have before and after photos, but I can attest that this product works to lift and plump the face.</li>
            <li> This product dried the back of my hands making them look crepey.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> This is not very moisturizing, but it does feel like it tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is worth a shot, not too expensive</li>
            <li> This is not as nourishing as i expected.  </li>
            <li> It seems to last a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Been only been using this for a few weeks , you get a lot of serum for the money.</li>
            <li> I also apply this to my hands and feet as well as Curel Rough Skin Rescue.</li>
            <li> Then I saw quite few reviews stated not greasy; so I thought everyone has different skin type, and</li>
            <li> Just be careful bc</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a few days, but I like the &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; of my skin now.  </li>
            <li> I was curious about the HA product.</li>
            <li> I believe this serum could be used for everyday maintenance, aging prevention in skin, and overall brightness and clarity.  </li>
            <li> well, I guess this serum is really not for me</li>
            <li> Aside from that, I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that&#x27;s why several people said this product dried their skin out.</li>
            <li> Only been using a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have tried few different Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> She use it for removing of dead skin particles in pair with facial scrub.</li>
            <li> When I use I apply a few drops and mix my regular moisturizer and pat all over.</li>
            <li> Total WASTE of money.  </li>
            <li> so maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not really a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Not really a wallet breaking purchase. ^_^</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I only bought this a few weeks ago so that is why I am giving it a four star.</li>
            <li> Skin elasticity and overall &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced redness and uneven skin tone</li>
            <li> the shipment was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> When I apply the product to my face and neck, I place a few drops on the back of my hand, and work from there.</li>
            <li> You have to do it everyday, but you won&#x27;t see a big difference until after some time.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of use my skin is brighter  with fewer bumps.  </li>
            <li> product is as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now...but not religiously.</li>
            <li> I expected it to burn but, of course, it did not.  </li>
            <li> Have only used for a few days now</li>
            <li> The tube is after 2 weeks almost empty</li>
            <li> So, I deleted it, but still curious about the product, and found this seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that sticky, heavy feeling that some products (especially sunblock) leave on your skin.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no real scent, leaves no greasy feeling and</li>
            <li> Please remember this is not really a stand alone item.</li>
            <li> If you just squirt a few drops on your face and that&#x27;s it, the effect will be very short lived.</li>
            <li> This time its thick does make skin soft</li>
            <li> but I hate noticeable pores and my pores are not noticeable when I use my 0 hazardous bioelements cream \\&quot;all things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the past several years combating dry skin, hair, nails, etc.  </li>
            <li> I previously ordered the smaller bottle, which lasted me a long time a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not an expert, though.    </li>
            <li> I am so sorry that this product wasn&#x27;t right for my skin type.....</li>
            <li> not sure I see any plumping of skin occuring, which is why I bought this.very thin, clear liquid, is it really doing anything beyond a little moisturizing?</li>
            <li> It take a long time to Obsorb &amp; has a odd texture.</li>
            <li> and I believed there was a subtle difference, enough that I am on my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I know they might not be as tough to get rid of for older skin</li>
            <li> I mixed a drop or two with a no-paraben and organic moisturizer and started with a small application on my back to see if there is any allergic reaction for a few days before using the combination on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This product stopped dry, flaky skin, brightened complexion and gave me a slight glow.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way also, which is pleasing to my budget.</li>
            <li> Like the consistency and how little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t take much, a little of this serum goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I agree that  a little goes a long way, but I guess at the end</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not positive if I&#x27;ve encounter any other benefits from this serum yet.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, there are very few common name brand products on the shelves that do much of anything.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even hydrate my skin, it still felt tight and dry after applying the serum, I had to apply moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really tight and dry after i shower.</li>
            <li> Other products I researched were $60-$80.</li>
            <li> other words, it does its job, without any miracles - which I didn&#x27;t expect anyway.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews</li>
            <li> It is well known for the moisturizing ability.&lt;br /&gt;I would use as a serum or mix with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually put it on the back on my hand after shower, and spread it over my face little by little starting with my forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another other hyaluronic acid serum before</li>
            <li> I also use it to mix with other products, like vitamin C</li>
            <li> will be throwing out all of my other serums and just use this morning and night under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I applied this morning and might, under my other skincare.</li>
            <li> I like to use it at night underneath my other lotions and potions.</li>
            <li> I just began using it and in combination with my other skincare regimens, I notice a brighter complexion</li>
            <li> /&gt;- can mix it with other nighttime serums</li>
            <li> Just sayin, have had other brands that didn&#x27;t seem so watery.</li>
            <li> other words, it does its job, without any miracles - which I didn&#x27;t expect anyway.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product freezing solid would affect it, but I have not noticed any change.  </li>
            <li> Not every day but maybe every other day.  </li>
            <li> I have not experience the other affects it suppose to have&amp;#34; however I will continue to use and  find out.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the stated purity of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other lotions and creams containing hyaluronic acid and,&lt;br /&gt;although</li>
            <li> they contained other ingredients that I&#x27;d rather not</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t explain in detail because other reviewers have already done so.</li>
            <li> I  have purchased this product  3 times and I am experimenting using it with other skin care products to see if it will enhance the effects..</li>
            <li> So... I&#x27;ve started using twice daily for the past month and still NO change.</li>
            <li> If u mix this with an other eye creams its gon</li>
            <li> I follow the application with my usual facial serum \\&quot;Oil of Olay\\&quot;&amp; it seems to be working well.  </li>
            <li> I order a bottle every other month.</li>
            <li> ( lost product due to their fault) consistency too seems to be too runny (</li>
            <li> It however did not cause any side-effect or acne or any other skin-issues--</li>
            <li> Money well spent!  </li>
            <li> other places on my face</li>
            <li> I use it with other creams as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually is helping my skin</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this item from this point on and my former products are truly a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> In addition, there&#x27;s no crowds or other hassles, i.e. traffic, etc.  </li>
            <li> and I want to delay wrinkles and other signs of aging before they show up.</li>
            <li> Also skip anything that would sting if you are somehow still using any other products like salicylic acid, etc.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but she fed my curiosity.</li>
            <li> and I have tried other HA products here</li>
            <li> I have used a different product in the past that was in a gel composition.  </li>
            <li> this did not cause breakouts or any other skin problems.</li>
            <li> tried out other hyaluronic acid products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands ans</li>
            <li> I have used 4 other brands and this one tops the list.</li>
            <li> I add this product to my other moisturizers and it blends in well.  </li>
            <li> This product is satisfactory but does not absorb as well as other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li> though it quite affordable compared to the prices other vendors were offering.</li>
            <li> From the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I have faith that it will.  </li>
            <li> but I layer it with other products.</li>
            <li> I add it to other products and use it on</li>
            <li> I felt I needed to try this product due to my skin being so sun damaged from years in the sun.</li>
            <li> This must be due to the PROVEN anti aging properties the serum has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful about the amount you apply or it will cause your makeup to pill.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin around my chin and mouth, along with tight skin, and acne hyperpigmentation/blemishes.</li>
            <li> It absorbes in easily and is non greasy and does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> Also to apply the serum to your neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage and to apply moisturizer after the serum has dried, if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I apply at night because it takes a few minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s weird not putting that in the positive category, but I cannot pinpoint if it is because of the serum itself or because I can use my sunscreen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little over a week and feel that it has helped to re-hydrate my very dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like leaving negative reviews... yet over the past year I have ordered several different hyaluronic serums from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I even decided to try it on my poor, winter cracked hands in addition to my lotion and WOW!  </li>
            <li> My skin seems a little less dry</li>
            <li> The reviews said that a little went a long way, that&#x27;s a little misleading</li>
            <li> After using it for several days,  my face skin now is not so dull as before.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, my skin was looking dull</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that, in my dry climate, this can make my skin feel tight if I&#x27;m already dried out myself.</li>
            <li> Bottle looks small but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is 0.05 of alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I still have at least 3/4 of the bottle left</li>
            <li> Sorry, I really wanted it to do something.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I have never had bags under my eyes, but I have always struggled with the dark circles along with the dreaded &amp;#34;sunken&amp;#34; problem.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is drying.  </li>
            <li> My mom bought it to get rid of dark spots, dullness and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use it for my undereyes bags and dark circles</li>
            <li> I have bought $200 creams for my dark circles and they haven&#x27;t done anything promised.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use to see if it helps with my dark spots and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Apparently, this is just not a good product for me.  </li>
            <li> even when I stop using the Roc for a while, the bel essence keeps working on the lines and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a 2 oz dark bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with rough combo skin and was told Hyaluronic Acid would help and does it ever.  </li>
            <li> A smell that was rotten and sour.</li>
            <li> However, when I started noticing deeper crinkles and lines in my face I wanted to try something to slow the inevitable.</li>
            <li> I also have fairly sensitive skin, and my review also includes how well the product does without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought some liquid Vitamin C, watered it down with distilled water, applied before using this product.</li>
            <li> I am still working on getting that routine down pat.</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit pricey, which is why I knocked it down a star.  </li>
            <li> When I got the package at home, the box (not the shipping box, I&#x27;m talking about the box you see in the picture) fell down on the floor and the bottle broke into thousand pieces...</li>
            <li> I purchase almost everything based on reviews and it has yet to let me down.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> add a drop to my eye cream and to my night cream about 4 drops to cut down on time.</li>
            <li> When I looked under the questions for owners section, I noticed other people have asked this question...and no one knows the answer!</li>
            <li> if you are addicted to sun or cigarettes - they are the worst for your skin (alcohol isn&#x27;t great either), but I had deep crevices on my forehead, heavy lines around my eyes and lips</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy it again and it is highly recommended base on my personal result.</li>
            <li> bottle and am down to less than 1 oz.</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> , it makes my acne scarring less noticeable.</li>
            <li> as odd as it sounds, that&#x27;s how it was.</li>
            <li> But it is really subtle in fact, on this second bottle, I am doubting there is any difference at all, making me wonder if I was experience the &amp;#34;placebo&amp;#34; effect of seeing what I wanted to see . . .</li>
            <li> Sadly  this was a waste of my money, the 5 star reviews must be fakes because this stuff did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> You can probably use less</li>
            <li> and i think my forehead wrinkle is less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting to see results up to a month out, but began noticing benefits in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve notice a difference in my skin tone; wrinkles are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The lines on my face seem to be less pronounced.</li>
            <li> Of course, they are still there, but they are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I am noticing that I need less lotion to keep my skin (arms) moist.  </li>
            <li> it will last me at least a few months even using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Next up, the reason I mentioned wasting money in the title is because it is absolutely ridiculous to pay this amount.</li>
            <li> It does tightened everything up and make the wrinkles less visible.</li>
            <li> I am 37 and bought 2 bottles like a half year ago.</li>
            <li> and I see improvement in skin tightness and less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> You use less of it, for one thing.  </li>
            <li> I still have a half bottle</li>
            <li> as of now i stopped using it until my skin is less irritated...</li>
            <li> I also have slight acne.</li>
            <li> After about a week I started noticing that skin seemed to plump up and wrinkles were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Toned face, seriously 10 years younger sometimes.</li>
            <li> I also had skin irritation when I used too much, slight burning and redness.  </li>
            <li> My skins appears to be smoother and less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> hydrates, it brightens slightly and it&#x27;s so inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> find I need less moisturiser after applying the serum</li>
            <li> Still have a half a bottle, but ordered another yesterday, JUST IN CASE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to make the wrinkles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered it for her about a half dozen times now</li>
            <li> I used it (among other well researched things) to try to tame my acne scars.</li>
            <li> My dark marks are fading and I can&#x27;t wait to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet about this product, I seem to see a bit of improvement, but not much.</li>
            <li> All over smoothing, less noticeable little lines.</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit (half of a dropper) for face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Used it a few days now and it is helping keep my acne down</li>
            <li> It does make your skin seem tight when you apply it</li>
            <li> No greasy or tight feeling.</li>
            <li> The serum makes my skin so tight that it almost feels like a mask.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick as the MED PEEL Hyaluronic that I purchased but a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have noticed recently that my skin was dull and not healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Pp or my new maybe line powerless foundation....</li>
            <li> Product seems to make my skin feel firm and wrinkles are less visible.</li>
            <li> that a lot of other products for very little money.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was skeptical about trying this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need but a little.  </li>
            <li> It also started to sag a little</li>
            <li> It took a little while but way quicker than it took the wrinkles to appear.</li>
            <li> I noticed this past year frown lines and other lines around the lip area.  </li>
            <li> I often hear dermatologists speaking to the benefits of this serum, which is found in SMALL traces in other products.  </li>
            <li> It is like a little treat for my face.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin was brighter and where there were little lines and pores before, my skin just seemed to plump up after using the serum.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, in fact I put a little moisturizer on at night after I apply.</li>
            <li> After I wash I spray a little bit of a toner and while my skin is still damp</li>
            <li> I wash my face midday because after reapplying SPF 85+, my face feels a little heavy/dirty.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> a little bit</li>
            <li> No more spending $$$ for other serums.  </li>
            <li> A little too soon to tell yet.</li>
            <li> Takes a little discipline to use twice a day.</li>
            <li> Lots of product for little money, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a little underwhelmed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a little bit over a month now.</li>
            <li> I use it it with a little coconut oil and sunblock.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a beauty product junkie and always looking for a way to help combat those little lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use it with a little bit of bio oil.</li>
            <li> I am a little torn on this product.  </li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and effectiveness of this much less expensive version.  </li>
            <li> I like that its not too greasy and very light, so my skin hasnt had a bad reaction or broken out.</li>
            <li> Very little diminishing of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I felt the difference in my skin in few days.</li>
            <li> I got this product recently and im not happy with the result , i would like the refund</li>
            <li> I do not enjoy using this serum - but have been applying it every evening and some mornings.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve tired the smaller bottle in the prep and tone set</li>
            <li> This was after a few weeks of use, however.</li>
            <li> it dried my skin..will not use it again..</li>
            <li> Saw a difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> It was too irritating for me to use possibly because I also use alpha hydroxy.</li>
            <li> This  dried  </li>
            <li> Seesm to disappear once applied and dried.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops cover my face, eyes, neck.</li>
            <li> I use it after my needle treatments and it helps remove any imperfections and allows skin to breath without being too tacky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, I tried adding 8-10 drops of the Hyaluronic Serum into my conditioner bottle</li>
            <li> I used a few times already</li>
            <li> I think to notice any difference it will take a few months.</li>
            <li> I am now going to order this to use on my arms for the thin skin with a moisturizer because the price makes that possible.  </li>
            <li> I started using it all time, but dried skin out</li>
            <li> I am over 60 with quite a few wrinkles on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> In just a few weeks, I could tell a difference after using this product along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Cosmedica.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I wash my face, use witchhazel as toner, then this serum and finish my nightly routine with a heavy dose of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i am tired of spending mega bucks on facial creams that DO NOT work.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed, sometimes I wish that if you buy something, what they say in the add should be true.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> but since I started putting a few drops around my eyes before bedtime</li>
            <li> I firmly believe nothing gets rid of wrinkles unless you have cosmetic surgery</li>
            <li> Used it regularly everyday for almost 3 months but no difference in wrinkles and skin texture.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks on effect alone &amp; with Derma Roller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with retin a product for a few months....</li>
            <li> I saw results within a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> At my age the skin on the back of my hands has gone thin and wrinkly.</li>
            <li> I put on this serum, wait a few minutes, and then put on argon oil.  </li>
            <li> quite a bit of the serum was wasted</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I considered trying this product until I noticed some of the reviews are almost identical (a few words changed).</li>
            <li> I utilize this as my everyday regimen before I apply my moisturizer and my skin is brightened, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> still (I even used it all over my chest for a few days after a sunburn -and</li>
            <li> But I think I have to wait a few weeks to see if there is a difference.</li>
            <li> My fault, but wasted my $.  </li>
            <li> and I have missed a few nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a heavy routine in to clearing my skin.</li>
            <li> But I put a few droppers-full in my lighter lotions and now they go on like oil.</li>
            <li> You just nee a few drops.</li>
            <li> Not effective as I&#x27;ve expected.</li>
            <li> Bottle states just a few drops.  </li>
            <li> For a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; person, one bottle would last forever, but I&#x27;m a guy, clumsy, usually sleepy when applying, and always in a rush, so of course I&#x27;ve dumped the bottle twice!</li>
            <li> So right after I posted my review on Amazon, I got bad rantings already.</li>
            <li> These other reviews must be fake ---I will be sending this back today and stick to my vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li> Ive seen a difference with my skin, its less flaky and some of my dry patches has decreased.</li>
            <li> Just plain water.</li>
            <li> Extremely oily skin, battled acne since teensbut became worse in my 20s and required 6 months of Accutane, among other things.</li>
            <li> I expected moisturization but it seemed to be subtle if at all.  </li>
            <li> It has been especially helpful in our cold, dry Michigan winters...which can reek havoc on your skin.</li>
            <li> what it does is providing and keeping locked in a layer of moisture that the skin needs (pretty badly when you&#x27;re 40</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> , dark spots start to slowly lighten up.</li>
            <li> Although it helps, it is not a cure as we all will age, but this does help to slow things down a bit.</li>
            <li> saw on Dr. Oz show, I live in a cold climate so thought it would help with hydration...</li>
            <li> Bought it second time: BAD packing and bottle not sealed properly...</li>
            <li> has helped with my poor dry hands</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it probably does its job a little too well!</li>
            <li> little goes a loooong way!</li>
            <li> Little wrinkles disappear!</li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t in bad shape to begin with, but days after adding this product to my routine I noticed small spider angiomas and red spots totally vanishing.</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be a little bit thick.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic products in the past and decided to give this brand a try.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin an almost mask-like look and to me that emphasized any small wrinkles I&#x27;m seeing rather than minimizing them.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything for my skin though.</li>
            <li> I dab this on them At night and depending where they are the blemishes are usually gone by morning .</li>
            <li> I also had marks or small scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now after applying my vit c 20% serum and then apply moisterizer!  </li>
            <li> My roommate had some small wrinkles on his face and after using HA over the course of a week they have all but vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Since ive been us it for thr past 2 1/2 weeks</li>
            <li> Allergic reaction, including: swelling, redness, itch or excessive dryness</li>
            <li> was not pleased at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> I think that people are so use to fake items that they are simply cautious in buying any item because I have gone through this</li>
            <li> Still not sure if I notice a difference, but I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it again at night after washing my face before bed.</li>
            <li> The next reason why I&#x27;m not going to buy this product again is because the company is manipulating the rating system and posting fake reviews.</li>
            <li> My pores are only noticeable if there are irritating ingredients?!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the result yet</li>
            <li> I have used Hyaluronic Acid Serums in the past for Micro needling treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s doing anything.</li>
            <li> it was a small sample-sized tube included in a kit for problem skin ($20 for a week&#x27;s supply).</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed about that.</li>
            <li> I used a small amount, about the size of small button on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and have been for the past week or so.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I bought this because small bumps started growing on my forehead</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement in small eye wrinkles in 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t put anything on my face after applying this besides makeup.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will keep the signs of aging at bay but does brighten the skin.</li>
            <li> the first time, I felt disappointed ...</li>
            <li> and I feel after using this for the past 3 weeks</li>
            <li> The change in my skin is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I use a small drop of this hyaluronic acid by Cosmedia am and pm after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> The serum is a little thin compared to another serum I purchased previously, but it seemed to work just as well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m leery of all the bad reviews here and do believe if i used this daily it would dry my skin since it has alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> It is no better or worse than other products.  </li>
            <li> I guess the manufacturer has to rethink about the packaging of the product, the outer paper box is very thin and there is nothing to support the inner bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is I couldn&#x27;t put this in my face other than my eyes because it would make me break out a lot.</li>
            <li> It is thick but you can spread a small amount</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful :-(</li>
            <li> Since using the Hylaluronic first after washing I seem to get fewer annoying breakouts.</li>
            <li> I stayed home for a week due to the fact that this product made my face extremely red, itchy and very painful, basically my skin was raw and very rough to the touch, almost like sand paper.</li>
            <li> My skin became very dry this winter, and I was hoping that it would help a little, but there was absolutely no difference:(</li>
            <li> My skin looked (past tense)</li>
            <li> ; It&#x27;s hard to tell now that I&#x27;m in my seventy&#x27;s, but</li>
            <li> I bought this product to supplement my regular facial moisturizer and used it specifically during the winter which was particularly brutal.  </li>
            <li> hard to tell alot yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s one of those keeper products...</li>
            <li> I also use the Prep and Tone beforehand, or also add the toner to the serum when my skin is looking dull.</li>
            <li> The overall quality of my skin has become at least what it was 5 years ago!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my face became very dry</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am not familiar with the science behind why this should work but based on reviews and internet reading</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommended this product and promise you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> At least it worked for me.  </li>
            <li> heard some reviews complained about the package, my doesn&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Negative part</li>
            <li> Nothing negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I have aged like my mom, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I would give this negative stars if I could..</li>
            <li> least it appeared that they were doing SOMETHING to my skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s</li>
            <li> (especially in these cold days).</li>
            <li> After I fix them I&#x27;m afraid to ask what&#x27;s next.</li>
            <li> Never feels greasy or thick.  </li>
            <li> Thick</li>
            <li> Brow wrinkle is slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> Liquids and gets all over the place, not gel like or thick, too runny.</li>
            <li> but its definitely not as amazing as the reviews say about it.</li>
            <li> I mean I guess that&#x27;s what I get for ordering skin care on amazon.</li>
            <li> I have noticed is no more frown lines on my forehead!</li>
            <li> I mean you can&#x27;t expect miracles at age 65, but she has no complaints.</li>
            <li> Using it every day under my usual mosturizer!</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and well packed, but other than that, I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not a filler or surgery, but I&#x27;d rather just soften the lines and even out tone than have to maintain expensive injections every other month in order to look unrealistically wrinkle-free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean before you apply it on the face, take care of your pores(open</li>
            <li> The first week I used it, I hated it.</li>
            <li> Very slick and skin-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Look for products that have this ingredient and it is expensive or way down on the list.</li>
            <li> I got all kinds of compliments on my skin with the Dr. Oz formula, but this serum is much less expensive.</li>
            <li> My face was quite dry, and moisturizer alone wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> previous purchases ( 1 year) of the Nikko brand was expensive .  </li>
            <li> I see subtle differences in my skin tone, but not my pores, wrinkles, or tightness of skin.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks a subtle change.</li>
            <li> Don‚Äôt get me wrong, my scars are still visible but less noticeable since my skin tone is evening out-with no pronounced redness or discoloration.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful - smells exactly like urine..cannot get past it.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum hoping to find a less expensive hyaluronic acid than what I have been using.  </li>
            <li> If you can measure out a half teaspoon of powder and mix it with two oz of cold distilled or spring water, then shake a small bottle vigorously, you can make this serum yourself.</li>
            <li> It mad my skin dry...</li>
            <li> My second bottle I ordered had a bad odor.</li>
            <li> People were blown away and actually felt bad for my sisters.</li>
            <li> once it turns into water it is no good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and sad to report it has done nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time in expensive product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, It was a waste of money, in my case.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not as good as the reviews make it seem.</li>
            <li> I am 52, and have had a terrible time with facial dry skin.</li>
            <li> No more annoying dry skin peeling/flaking</li>
            <li> This company is NOT HONEST!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with my purchase big time.</li>
            <li> Closed my pores!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have really bad dry skin</li>
            <li> I also used it to soften the tough skin on my husbands feet.</li>
            <li> I mean, I did it!</li>
            <li> I have no more peeling!!</li>
            <li> less expensive and no compromise n quality, you cant beat that!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed to find I am out of the return window, which is 30 days, although that is how long it took for me to give it a chance to see if it made a visible difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> (I know its not a great explanation).&lt;br</li>
            <li> , no changes at all would not recommend, would like a refund not happy</li>
            <li> I dare not request for a replacement as I worry that it will be broken again when I receive it.</li>
            <li> After one day my face is completely broken out everywhere..</li>
            <li> Thsi product has definitely decreased the lines around my mouth and my chin.</li>
            <li> It makes me glow too even on tired days.</li>
            <li> Non irritating and absorbers immediately.</li>
            <li> I am really addicted.</li>
            <li> I also use this to \\&quot;thin out\\&quot; my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Eye dropper applicator came broken, burns my skin</li>
            <li> was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> received it broken and almost injured myself on the shards of glass.  </li>
            <li> They look tired and have lines all over their faces that weren&#x27;t there before.</li>
            <li> This is my secret, and I&#x27;ll never tell him.</li>
            <li> Or outdated.</li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> so I have therefor noticed any dramatic changes.</li>
            <li> So I am going to continue using this to see if there will be dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hundreds of beauty products and this is by far the worst packaging/cheapest glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lately, I would have people asking if I was sick or overly tired.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> At least this wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I wasted my money on this product</li>
            <li> I have difficult skin and sometimes put it through hell.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, weird smell, watery application.  </li>
            <li> So not happy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works at all, it&#x27;s probably just some random ingredients</li>
            <li> This review is for the wrong product</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I did not feel any difference in the moisture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Until the information is provided, I remain skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- a bit expensive, and lasts maybe a month or so if you&#x27;re using it generously</li>
            <li> The water was the secret!  </li>
            <li> I was just sad</li>
            <li> I am always a bit skeptical when I receive a product to try for review</li>
            <li> : unfortunately, this company cannot accept the fact this product is not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> What I can tell you is that my skin isn&#x27;t any worse!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T SPEND YOUR MONEY IN EXPENSIVE CREAMS.</li>
            <li> I tried to find out where the lab is located that makes this stuff and was unable to do so.  </li>
            <li> But this brand is a rip-off!</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Hopefully by then the world won&#x27;t be so superficial and wrinkles won&#x27;t be so scarey.  </li>
            <li> I was completely wrong.  </li>
            <li> It has not been uncomfortable for a a tender face.</li>
            <li> Sad to report no change as of yet.  </li>
            <li> My problem skin hasn&#x27;t shown ill effects.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> But not every woman can afford to buy expensive creams or go to spa every month.</li>
            <li> Sorry if it&#x27;s TMI&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I would have to exfoliate the skin off quite abrasively regularly to keep it from looking disgusting, which would then just aggravate that area and cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> This serum did not leave me feeling sticky or uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the raving reviews but unfortunately it made me break out.</li>
            <li> I take my beauty/anti-aging very seriously!  </li>
            <li> While the consistency is somewhat thicker than the other brand, it has caused horrific breakouts on my face.</li>
            <li> but I am angry that it hurt my face and eyes so badly.</li>
            <li> At 51, I needed a boost after a cold winter and my daughter&#x27;s wedding coming up.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m afraid of clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> While this serum seemed to plump up my skin in a few days, it also made e break out horribly.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of contamination</li>
            <li> and my eyes ard so irritated that I am blinking like crazy.</li>
            <li> I recommend it...don&#x27;t be afraid of the reviews that mention dryness.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it was because of cold weather and during shipping the liquid changed to gel.  </li>
            <li> This one has a slightly unpleasant, rancid odor.</li>
            <li> find that the serum does have a somewhat unpleasant scent to it</li>
            <li> It has a very faint smell that I don&#x27;t like when putting it on</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the terrible and confusing experience, I read the label on the bottle, and here is what it says: \\&quot; Warning:</li>
            <li> I wanted badly to use it</li>
            <li> but too bad</li>
            <li> I never get breakouts this bad...</li>
            <li> /&gt;- a bit tacky in humidity (not to bad if you use it after a shower at night,</li>
            <li> and i end up at my dermatologist with a bad case of inflamation on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use to have extremly oily skin and bad break outs.</li>
            <li> Applicator  is bad</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because my face broke out really bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly shocked by what 2 weeks has done for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product after 2 weeks of use  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Smell: (DEALBREAKER)&lt;br /&gt;-When</li>
            <li> For the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed to see that this wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> tho :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> my husband is disappointed.</li>
            <li> just another batch of worthless s</li>
            <li> I use it as a base and then use coconut oil to do my face exercises.</li>
            <li> It was horrifying.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with product.</li>
            <li> My skin looked awful on TV.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this serum is terrible!</li>
            <li> I also have had a problem with oily combination skin and have had a terrible problem with breakouts.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have a horrible reaction)&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Worst serum I&#x27;ve ever used..</li>
            <li> That is where the skin irritation is the worst.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s downright embarrassing and so awful looking to go out with skin just falling off all the time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my face with any nasty residue.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Love it! You will feel your skin refresh once applied.</li>
            <li> makes my wrinkles look better but more importantly, it makes my acne scarring less noticeable. By a lot!</li>
            <li> Long story short: Chemotherapy  (14 yes ago) pushed me into early menopause.  I&#x27;ve spent the past several years combating dry skin, hair, nails, etc.  Fast forward : I am currently on my 2nd bottle of this HA. The first week I used it, I hated it. After washing my face, I applied the HA and then my moisturizer. It dried out my skin so bad. So, I didn&#x27;t use it again for several months. Now, after I Googled the proper way to apply it, I add 3 drops of HA to my moisturizer  (in my hand) and I apply it to my WET face, neck, and upper chest.  Conclusion: After so many years of &amp;#34;disaster skin&amp;#34; I LOVE the way my skin feels!</li>
            <li> I got this product in the mail yesterday, it came very quickly. I use retinol and bp on my skin which can be very drying. I used this last night and my skin drank this like water...it left my skin so hydrated and wonderful in the morning, I used this after dermarolling!! So far so good!</li>
            <li> Have been using it about a month and I really like it.  Right after I use toner on my face, I apply a small drop on each area (forehead, crow&#x27;s feet around eyes, upper lip, and neck) and then pat it and then add a moisturizer.  Works well and skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Definitely tones, but may cause some sensitive skin to peel. I do love it, use it nightly before applying my wrinkle cream. Bottle looks small but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Really nice product &amp; the size makes it great value for money.  Works well for everyday use &amp; even better after a peel.</li>
            <li> very nice product! will continue purchase</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.  Too soon to see great benefits, but, it does feel smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li> I just love it! I felt the difference in my skin in few days. I recommend it for sure! 100%</li>
            <li> Works great.  Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)</li>
            <li> I got this product recently and im not happy with the result , i would like the refund</li>
            <li> My skin looks great since I began using this product twice a day!</li>
            <li> Love it-really do notice dimished fine lines. Use it every day &amp;amp; night with my regular moisturizer. Very hydrating. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed a difference and have used it several months.</li>
            <li> Promising but too early to tell</li>
            <li> A truly light and smooth formula, spreads easily and dries with no greasy or sticky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of products say to use a drop or two, but you can&#x27;t get that amount to spread over your face. With this serum, that is not an issue! I brashly squirted a whole dropper-full into my hand the first time I used it, and ended up having to spread it over a large part of my upper body. Oops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that, in my dry climate, this can make my skin feel tight if I&#x27;m already dried out myself. So, I use it after my shower when I&#x27;m wet and it helps my skin hold an amazing amount of moisture. Incredible! I will be buying this as long as they keep selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITING TO ADD: It&#x27;s January of 2016, and I&#x27;m still using this same bottle. I add 2-3 drops (at the most) to my moisturizer every time. My skin is smoother, and the fine lines are fewer and farther between. This is an extremely easy and inexpensive addition to my routine, and well worth the difference it makes!</li>
            <li> Great product and great price. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I do see this adding some hydration and moisture to my skin, which is great, but I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would buy this when now you can buy Hyaluronic acid with vitamin c and e added to it for only a couple dollars more. Try the Skingenixx serum [[ASIN:B00VXE0EEY Skingenixx VITAMIN C SERUM - Potent 20% Vitamin C + E Serum with Hyaluronic Acid &amp; a Powerful Amino Acid Complex]] instead. It is really a night and day difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like leaving negative reviews... yet over the past year I have ordered several different hyaluronic serums from Amazon. This one has a slightly unpleasant, rancid odor. I do not enjoy using this serum - but have been applying it every evening and some mornings. I have not found this to be moisturizing, nor does it seem to make any difference to my skin. It seems to sit on the skin surface and then evaporate, rather than penetrate. The price point is low... but I do not see value in the purchase. Disappointed to find I am out of the return window, which is 30 days, although that is how long it took for me to give it a chance to see if it made a visible difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> Will not be without it!</li>
            <li> the stuff works well, absorbs quickly......doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily, great for acne prone skin, dry mature skin as well</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME! I have difficult skin and sometimes put it through hell. I have very dry skin around my chin and mouth, along with tight skin, and acne hyperpigmentation/blemishes. I could clearly see my skin was dehydrated and nothing could \\&quot;quench its thirst\\&quot;... as odd as it sounds, that&#x27;s how it was. I could put layers and layers of my favorite, expensive moisturizers on and still not get much relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about a week or two now and my skin is looking great! No blemishes, dryness, etc. Not much is needed for it to be effective, I also received this product promptly from the seller. Definitely worth a try! ... I&#x27;m recommending it to others..</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and evening before I put on my moisturizer and makeup. I will definitely use this everyday. My skin craves it!!</li>
            <li> This item always makes me happy. My skin tight and reduce wrinkle instantly. I will repeat to buy this product from this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a short while but I like the way it goes on my skin and how it makes it feel.&lt;br /&gt;There are no perfumes or other additives and hyaluronic acid is naturally present in the human body and is also used to heal wounds and burns on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend that you put a regular moisturizer over it since it is quickly absorbed into the skin and does not feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit skeptic about this product. I&#x27;m interested in the percentage of hyaluronic acid, along with the other ingredients in it, but nothing is listed on the label. Why? Not sure what I&#x27;m putting on my face because it seems a bit strong. Skin gets a bit flaky (might be a good exfoliator) but I&#x27;ve never had this reaction to hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> Have this now for a while and will buy again. Skin is so soft after use and wrinkles are diminishing. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acid serums and this product is by far the best! To boot the customer service end is amazing. A great company to keep an eye on!</li>
            <li> After getting microdermabrasion my skin specialist suggested using hyaluronic to help keep my skin moist, and wow does it work! I put the smallest amount on before my lotion and my face stays hydrated all day and night! Super good deal too! Other products I researched were $60-$80. I will be ordering this again and telling my friends!</li>
            <li> a couple of days ago but wow! Already used 4 times (morning and night) and my skin is so soft! I&#x27;ve been having trouble with rough combo skin and was told Hyaluronic Acid would help and does it ever.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was young. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, just a couple of drops on finger tips and gently rub into the skin.  Don&#x27;t need but a little.  It dries very fast.  Best thing to do is use it right after washing your face while your pores are open. My skin is very sensitive and this didn&#x27;t bother it at all.  No stinging or burning. I will definitely repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> Used it religiously and no improvement... I still noted my fine line .. Not pleased</li>
            <li> I bought this product several weeks back and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and now I feel that my face is more hydrated and my pores have drastically decreased in size I&#x27;ve also noticed my skin isn&#x27;t as oily as it was before.</li>
            <li> My second order - definitely improves aging</li>
            <li> For the most part, this hyaluronic acid does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is to hydrate your skin and plump it. It also has a relatively light consistency and doesn&#x27;t carry a strong smell like some other skin products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it probably does its job a little too well! I&#x27;ve experienced having some tiny painless &amp;#34;welts&amp;#34; that look like acne develop on my skin, small pustules of clear liquid being trapped in the epidermis, which are pretty hard to get rid of since they are not exactly acne or whiteheads. Not sure if this is due to the fact that I have a pretty oily T-zone (which is where these pustules have appeared), or if it&#x27;s because I applied too much of the product onto my skin, but I am now left with having to combat these tiny bumps on my skin by pricking them with a needle.</li>
            <li> Made a big difference in my wrinkles, but use only sparingly as this will cause you to puff up a bit if you overuse it.  Works great tho!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this product by itself it dries my skin too much, but if i mix it with any other moisturizer it does wonder to my skin, i can see and feel the difference the next day, and people are complementing my skin.  Tha&#x27;s why i decided to give 4 starts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it on face as well as decolette</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few weeks, the serum turns into water and is no longer good.  I read about Hylauronic acid, once it turns into water it is no good.  It is supposed to be a little bit thick.  It was nice and thick when i first got it but soon turned bad.  I wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> Great consistency and goes on easy.  I&#x27;m surprised at the noticeable difference in my skin without any of the side effects you usually see like drying or redness from these kind of products.  This is my third bottle I think, and I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Seems pure and effective!</li>
            <li> Now I just need to learn how to play it!</li>
            <li> The consistency is great and blends well on the skin.  I have purchased this product multiple times and getting ready to order another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hyaluronic products in the past and decided to give this brand a try. Result is basically the same as with prior brands (better hydration and moisture than with regular OTC moisturizers, diminished pores and skin texture); however, this one beats the price :-) I&#x27;m a satisfied customer and will reorder again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It is amazing. I have been using it for a couple of days and i already see a difference. After i derma roll i put this one and it has been amazing!! Wil purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and Hyalunoric acid does wonders for me. However this one contains alcohol in it which was not listed in description. It left my skin feeling dry instead of moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and I think I need to used it for another 2 weeks before noticing improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Best serum and continue to purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited several months to review this product. I can now state that after several months of using twice daily that I&#x27;ve noticed not a bit of a difference. I&#x27;m suspicious of all the 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I&#x27;ve Been using it morning and night for about 2 weeks and already I feel a difference in my face. My acne has cleared up, my skin is super hydrated but not as oily as It was. My skin is more elastic and looks more youthful! Really really worked. I will use this for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> I like this serum, it does help plump up your skin and give you a more youthful look, but I think Dr. Oz&#x27;s hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin C is better. I got all kinds of compliments on my skin with the Dr. Oz formula, but this serum is much less expensive. So I&#x27;d say if you can&#x27;t afford the Dr. Oz., this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Leave my skin very soft and not oily at all. I have combination skin and this is the right product for me.&lt;br /&gt;Best results to use twice daily mixing with your daily moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Product is great! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Just made my face feel really dry. Stopped using after 10 days.</li>
            <li> So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li> Really plumps your skin.  I notice a big difference, especially as the weather is getting colder and dryer.</li>
            <li> I noticed instantly that my skin plumped up, and especially around my lips. All over smoothing, less noticeable little lines.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product, weird smell, watery application.  Glass bottle is not the safest to handle for me.</li>
            <li> COSMEDICA&#x27;s leading seller is this pure hyaluronic acid serum in the 60 cc (2 oz) bottle. Once you&#x27;ve tired the smaller bottle in the prep and tone set you&#x27;ll want to always have this larger size on hand. This hyaluronic acid is Vegan and completely free for oils, parabens, dyes, fillers and fragrances. After cleansing and toning the face apply this serum and watch your skin improve almost instantly! Though it is not advertised as such, this serum is also VERY useful for making aging hands look better. Apply to the hands twice a day and notice that the skin plumps, and the variation in color improves. Anther for buying the larger size bottle - use on both face and hands and see a return to that healthy younger look. Grady Harp, December 14</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 3 because I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working or now...if I apply it at night with moisturizer.. Next day my face feels soft but if I don&#x27;t put anything on my face....it feels very dry.. So it&#x27;s like superficial.. Not doing anything to my skin basically</li>
            <li> Still evaluating.  I am alternating Retin A one night &amp; this serum the next night.  We&#x27;ll see!??!!</li>
            <li> feels like I am literally using water for my skin regimine . I am in the industry and I was really looking for something to work and give me the promising results. I mean I guess that&#x27;s what I get for ordering skin care on amazon. So I guess lesson learned! My skin looked awful on TV. So not happy! Grrrrr!</li>
            <li> Really soaks in and smoothes skin.</li>
            <li> It has more water than hyaluronic acid, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It came fast and this product is the bomb!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product after 2 weeks of use  Originally I put the serum directly on my skin followed by moisturizer, but it made my skin feel tight and dry.  After a week I tried mixing a few drops with moisturizer, but it had the same effect.  It gives my skin an almost mask-like look and to me that emphasized any small wrinkles I&#x27;m seeing rather than minimizing them.  I&#x27;m thinking this was a big waste of money, I should have gone for the glycolic acid I was shopping for because I know it works.  At least this wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> It gets in the skin super fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and tightens up the face a bit. It tightens, more than it plumps, like with other serums. Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin texture yet - which may be for the best, at least it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or other bad stuff. I don&#x27;t think it could fast improve on any lines, fine or otherwise either, but...what it does is providing and keeping locked in a layer of moisture that the skin needs (pretty badly when you&#x27;re 40, I might add..)&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it does its job, without any miracles - which I didn&#x27;t expect anyway. I&#x27;m not like &amp;#34;in love&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;OMG&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a good product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;2 ounces for this kinda money? count me in.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because, after successfully completing a weight loss regimen, my face began to look drawn.  I naturally have a slim face.  It also started to sag a little and I felt I should not look this way at my age (46).  After Googling reasons why my face looked drawn and sagged and possible solutions, one thing that came up quite often was Hyaluronic Acid, along with collagen and RetinA.  It was the first time I heard about Hyaluronic Acid and decided to check if Amazon had it.  Well they did and the reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will admit that after 3 months of use my face has improved tremendously.  After about the first week I saw my face gradually begin to lift.  The line that was coming down from my eyes to my mouth has completely gone.  The crumpled look that was on my forehead has smoothed out.  I also have a brighter look to my face.  I was completely amazed.  The only thing is I also have under-eye bags. They are not very bad, but they are there but so far there has been no improvement there.  However, I am not giving up. I will give it a few more months. On the whole though, there is definitely a marked difference in my face. It is a pity I don&#x27;t have before and after photos, but I can attest that this product works to lift and plump the face. At least it worked for me.  I therefore highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 3 weeks and it feels ok</li>
            <li> You very little very strong and get the job done. Good company products!</li>
            <li> I used this with a derma roller to help with neck lines.  Saw improvement in two weeks.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Works wonders, I think...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and sad to report it has done nothing for my skin. I bought it to use after using the Dermaroller. It has never once burned/stung upon applying after rolling my skin, which I never thought anything of, but one time I tried a different product and felt the sting. That made me realize this probably doesn&#x27;t have anything strong enough to help my skin.</li>
            <li> The product feels good and my skin is smooth and a little bit cleaner, but further use will tell me more.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product twice a day.  Feels nice.  Use a moisturizer over this after letting it sink in for about 10 minutes.  Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough so far to see what lasting effects might be.  Will have to post again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. I don&#x27;t really know if I can tell a difference, but I&#x27;ll keep using it. I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great1 I&#x27;m a 60year old female, use it around my mouth every night along with the L&#x27;Oreal cream</li>
            <li> just another batch of worthless s***, marketed by two-bit hacks.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin looks and feels much better. The price is great too.</li>
            <li> Helps to rejuvenate the under eye wrinkle</li>
            <li> Does not hydrate at all. Instead severely dries skin.</li>
            <li> Non greasy and light. Not sure if it&#x27;s doing anything for my skin though.</li>
            <li> I spot treat my blemishes with this serum. I dab this on them At night and depending where they are the blemishes are usually gone by morning .</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it&#x27;s not watery like the Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using about a month and have noticed an improvement in fine lines and overall skin texture.  Also, my pores look smaller.  Don&#x27;t need to use much so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin. I normally use DDF Wrinkle resist plus and pore minimizer and this does not even come close to making my skin look younger or anything. I bought this because it had good reviews and I couldn&#x27;t afford my normal serum. I&#x27;ll continue to use it though and will update this if I notice something amazing. Would I buy this product again? No! I have also tried the OZ naturals also highly rated on amazon and I think that one was better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;...had better results with Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> This product actually works, has kept my face clear of breakouts and it does minimize the fine lines.</li>
            <li> It was a great price but I didn&#x27;t feel or see a difference as I have with hyaluronic acid serums.</li>
            <li> I do see a difference in my skin, it&#x27;s hydrated, softer, smoother. Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! It&#x27;s an absolute must in skin care!</li>
            <li> I dont like the smell of this product..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of months, but have noticed an improvement in the texture of my face, especially fine lines around my eyes. I also decided to use it on my hands (trying one hand first as a trial) and can see a difference between the two hands, so I started using on both hands (every morning when I am applying to my face before makeup, I also apply to my hands too.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Service!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any change under my eyes with wrinkles or anything BUT I still love this stuff. It hydrates my skin so well and gives it a vibrant mellow look like I just stepped out the shower. I also like to put a few drops over my foundation to help set it and give it a more natural look. I&#x27;m running low, def gonna buy more</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product.  I love it and have been using it for a few years.  Never disappointed!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the product.  All I can say is it really works!  No complaints at all.  Good value, and def will be purchasing again!  I use it every day and love the results.  So glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Love it. When adding to a skin moisture it upgrades it 100%. The crows feet around my eyes lessen greatly. Wrinkles under my cheek bones disappeared completely. It took a little while but way quicker than it took the wrinkles to appear.:) By the way I am 62.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know if this helps with skin tone ? I bought it because it said it did but none of the reviews I read said anything about it.</li>
            <li> Very good. Will re-oder</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t achieve optimum results while using this product, I was able to get better hydration when I added this to my lotions. When applied directly to my face, I did get a face-full of pimples. This was after a few weeks of use, however. I personally wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing this again due to the hyaluronic acid vitamins are more effective for me. I would recommend anyone to give this a try, especially since it&#x27;s so affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I use it every morning under my sunscreen</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle.  I love this stuff!  I swear my skin looks better since I&#x27;ve been using it.  My aesthetics suggested this to me (the brand that she sells), so I came home, looked on my beloved Amazon, and found this.  I have really sensitive skin and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> After using it for several days,  my face skin now is not so dull as before.  I would like to use more to see if my skin feel much better.</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble with oily skin but many products dried up my skin. I also had marks or small scars. After less than a month my skin looks so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I found the Pure Hyalronic Serum that I purchased from the Cosmedica Skincare line to be perfect in consistency and quality.  As a licensed skin professional, I use serums in many of my pre and post procedures.  Great product! I will order it again as needed.</li>
            <li> Saw results after the first 3 days! I did observe a bit of peeling, but the underlying skin was so much better than what it had replaced. I felt like my face was &#x27;molting&#x27; to give way to a much smoother, youthful epidermis. After a week, I was surprised by how much my pores have minimized, especially on my lower cheeks and the area between my eyebrows. I hope this Sellers offers a Subscription option for savings, because I sure plan to stock up on some more! :)</li>
            <li> it dried my skin..will not use it again..</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to complete my nightly skin care routine and this definitely fit the bill. I used it after toning and before moisturizing. The serum left my face hydrated. When I first started with the product, it immediately absorbed in my skin. After several uses the serum, my skin was feeling more refreshed. It&#x27;s not the most amazing product out there but for the price and function it is supplemental to any skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> good stuff for you hair and nails. Highly recommend to any one for their face and hands. Make it in your lotions</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a too early to tell a difference. After 44 years of not giving a dang about my skin I don&#x27;t expect overnight results. The product does absorb nicely. It was well packaged and arrived a couple days earlier than expected. One thing that I noticed is this product is thicker than another brand I purchased last month. I like that. I don&#x27;t feel a watered down product works as good.</li>
            <li> I received this as a review product, and it is s great product, works just how hyaluronicbacid should, it makes my skin feel tighter and healthier almost immediately after use!</li>
            <li> Love it! Saw a difference in just a few days. Especially the eye area. Goes on smooth and drys quickly. Going to buy for my mom next. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I can feel and see the change in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> There is a definite difference in my skin since I began using the Serum.  Our dry climate challenges any skin product. I will not only keep using it but will most likely purchase more.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, wouldn&#x27;t be without it. My skin is beautiful! Thank you for offering this at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. I have used one product better than this called MED PEEL (Hyaluronic Anti-Aging) but I have to say you certainly get what you pay for and a little more with this product. It is a great product and you get a lot for your money. I would purchase it again and again!!! It is not as thick as the MED PEEL Hyaluronic that I purchased but a little of this product goes a long way. It is light, refreshing, and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical feel to it. It certainly moisturizes my face and feels excellent.</li>
            <li> love this product, skin looks amazing</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
            <li> I love it.  It helps keep the moisturizer  in the skin and not just on the outside. I am very happy with the results</li>
            <li> This is an all natural product that really helps keep the skin soft and moisturized all day.  Prior to using this product, my skin was looking dull and I had several dry patches.  My skin looks great, the dry patches are gone and my overall skin tone is even and has its youthful glow back and I am in my 40&#x27;s.  I previously ordered the smaller bottle, which lasted me a long time a few months.  You don&#x27;t need a lot, a drop goes a long way.  This time, I ordered a larger bottle because I want to use the serum on other dry areas, like my hands, heels and elbows (and anything else that is dry in between).</li>
            <li> Really like this, you do need to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> I love it;  I was developing &amp;#34;lizard skin&amp;#34; -those tiny dry lines not associated with your eyes or mouth- on my face which has greatly diminished.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great hyaluronic acid serum and at a very reasonable price. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> i purchased this to keep my baby face before the wrinkles arrive.. Love it so far. Def recommend this product</li>
            <li> Actually, I do not see any difference in my skin by useing this product compared to the product I can buy in a dept store for less money. I truely think I&#x27;ve been ripped off.</li>
            <li> This works great as a base moisturizer, but especially for minimizing fine lines just as well as (if not better) than the high price brands one purchases in a high end retail store. I never leave reviews but this product impressed me,</li>
            <li> Since I reached my 50&#x27;s and menopause I noticed this past year frown lines and other lines around the lip area.  I happen to see a Dr. Oz show with a dermatologist on talking about Hyaluronic Acid and to buy a serum where that ingredient was one of the first three ingredients in the product.  So I started my search and found this product by Cosmedica.  I bought a bottle and started using it.  I&#x27;m not one of these persons that is easily swayed.  After two weeks, I was looking in the mirror and noticed a decrease in these lines.  Each day it is getting more noticeable.  What a great product!  It&#x27;s like a facelift in a bottle and you can&#x27;t beat the PRICE!  I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t see this unless you&#x27;ve received the product but it states that side effects occur which if known before hand I would not have ordered.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works at all, it&#x27;s probably just some random ingredients</li>
            <li> I like this product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Makes a visable difference in my aging eye area in only a few days, thanks! And doesnt trigger my fibromyalgia! Double thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! IT REALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic and has improved the quality of my skin so much.</li>
            <li> Face has a more even tone and nice texture to it after only one week. I read the other reviews so I too put lotion on after applying the serum.  I also use this serum in combination with my derma pen.</li>
            <li> Excellent product , keeps skin bright n fresh looking , I use it after using dermastamp .5 mm and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Overnight results ! Amazing product ! Im 41 and have started to feel and see changes in my skin, especially the texture of the skin on my neck - im not kidding when I say one use,  overnight difference !&lt;br /&gt;Im hooked ! Cant believe how soft my skin feels ! Success !!!</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I have bought multiple bottles over the last year.  It really makes your skin feel hydrated.  It isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, it feels almost like water, but you can feel it stay on your skin.  I wear it under moisturizer to keep my skin from drying.  Great serum!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple weeks now . My skin looks so much better less break outs smaller pores and no more dry spots. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great value. After one week I can see the fine line disappear, I will deffinetly be re ordering be for I run out.</li>
            <li> When used with my other moisturizer, I have seen a marked difference in hydrating my skin. Definitely worth it given the price point.</li>
            <li> I fell for all the good reviews. This product dried the back of my hands making them look crepey. Didn&#x27;t really do anything for the rest of my skin at all - either used alone or under moisturizer. Aside from a temporary wetness from applying the product, skin remained the same after application.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, service was good.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> I love this HA.  I tried another brand that I  didn&#x27;t like as well‚Ä¶ It had a watery consistency‚Ä¶ I feel this brand stays on the face better.   I&#x27;ll continue to order!</li>
            <li> I use Aloe Vera gel as a toner and this as a moisturizer twice a week. It made a huge difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product with Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizing cream. My face was extremely dry. Since using both products together I have seen a difference.  I am one happy person.</li>
            <li> I use this every night in conjunction with my vitamin C serum for a fresh and vibrant glow.</li>
            <li> I love this product an will continue to use an purchase more.</li>
            <li> Yeah, this stuff works wonders. I got this when I purchased a derma-roller and I am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I laid my eyes on these...this is now a religious regimen that I follow for my skin!!!!thank you</li>
            <li> Pro: I used on my eyelids before going to bed and when I woke up and I believed there was a subtle difference, enough that I am on my 2nd bottle. But it is really subtle in fact, on this second bottle, I am doubting there is any difference at all, making me wonder if I was experience the &amp;#34;placebo&amp;#34; effect of seeing what I wanted to see . . . leading to the con.&lt;br /&gt;Con: Like so many health and vitamin products on Amazon, this is another with reviews of people claiming amazing results that for me, no way are the results I think I noticed anyway amazing. I will probably purchase a third time when this bottle runs out but if I feel the results are barely noticeable then, I probably won&#x27;t buy. I&#x27;m going to give two stars to indicate it had some effect.&lt;br /&gt;Fwiw: I am a lawyer, investment banker, and currently a start up consultant. I am tired of the questionable positive reviews and reviewers on Amazon, and I am going to try to post more reviews that you can at least trust is coming from a real person and professional. I&#x27;ve only encountered less than 1 in 10 that made me actually feel they did anything and even less ever wowed me of having significant results.</li>
            <li> Very efficient in moisturizing.  You&#x27;re gonna feel like all the fluids absorbed into the pores instantly and the face skin more dry than before it was applied.  But that&#x27;s quite the normal reaction the skin to the acid serum should be.  So the skin overall will feel much more smoothed after several days of use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I have been using it for the past few weeks and I have received compliments on the glow of my skin and the texture is improving. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> It has been about two weeks since using this Hyaluronic Acid serum my skin looks better but it&#x27;s my pores that I&#x27;ve seen the most changes in, my pores are way smaller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving 0 stars because after opening it turned into water &amp; made my face feel like it is burning-can&#x27;t return because it is out of the grace period</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long but mixed with my llotions my cellulite cream and my face cream and it&#x27;s actually working great.</li>
            <li> I had the highest hopes for this product after reading all the great reviews, I also read the bad ones, and hoped they were the exception and not the norm. I waited until I used the whole bottle before writing a review to be sure i gave it enough time. Sadly  this was a waste of my money, the 5 star reviews must be fakes because this stuff did absolutely nothing for my skin. I am 26 with a few fine lines around my eyes and really thought that this would work. It didn&#x27;t even hydrate my skin, it still felt tight and dry after applying the serum, I had to apply moisturizer after. I used it according to the recommendations with no luck.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I apply it after cleansing and applying moisturizers and it&#x27;s light and absorbs easily.  I&#x27;ll order again!  And I did!!</li>
            <li> Best Hyaluronic Acid if have used.</li>
            <li> Love this it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Nice product works well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my skin yet.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using it, I stopped getting break outs. It was too irritating for me to use possibly because I also use alpha hydroxy.</li>
            <li> Love the moisture it gives.</li>
            <li> love it, my skin looks younger everyday. Using it with a vitamin C cream. 64 years young!</li>
            <li> Everything came on time, great quality, can be used at home and in a professional settings. I am impressed and definitely would advise to use the provider.</li>
            <li> My severe allergic face rashes are at bay since using! Now that&#x27;s miraculous for me!</li>
            <li> This serum works very well so far. It is great for my combination skin. I can put it on all areas of my face without any oily patches appearing later. Only drawback is it can leave your face feeling a bit tight but if you mix it with your face lotion it eliminates this problem. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late twenties and started noticing the first fine lines under my eyes and read wonderful reviews on this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 year. i apply it twice daily (after washing my face). unfortunately i havent noticed much of a difference in the last year and am now in the market for another HA serum.</li>
            <li> Hydrates wonderfully. Leaves my skin radiant.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after hearing about it on Dr. Oz. I tried to find it at a local store but no one seemed to carry even though the show said you could find it at your local drug store,(guess Walgreens does not know they are my local drug store.)&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the product and got it 3 days later! Not bad turn around!&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is really easy to use, it comes with an eye dropper top and you just put the desired amount on your palm then smooth it on your clean face. It absorbes in easily and is non greasy and does not smell bad. I then put on my normal moisteriser over the top of this. I use it at night before bed and then in the morning under my makeup. I really like the way this product smooths my forehead lines and the small lines around my eyes. It is no \\&quot;miricle\\&quot; cream but if used as described, you should notice a difference. I did!</li>
            <li> It is well known for the moisturizing ability.&lt;br /&gt;I would use as a serum or mix with other products.&lt;br /&gt;(Pay attention to the pH)&lt;br /&gt;The product is not greasy, instantly moisturize the skin. After that you need to apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I heard some reviews complained about the package, my doesn&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;I just appreciate it that may newly started companies using organic materials and making affordable quality products.</li>
            <li> With vit C serum for mornings and this at night, literally makes your skin like a baby&#x27;s butt</li>
            <li> my skin drinks this stuff like water - really feels good</li>
            <li> Omg this is wonderful serum. Immediately &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; up the lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I use this with my ceramidas of Esther Lauder I mix it they  work great together , I like the product</li>
            <li> I will go ahead and list my thoughts instead of paragraph so it would be more convenient for others to read (just like I do).&lt;br /&gt;Packaging:&lt;br /&gt;-Very simple and clean, looks like a medicine a doctor might prescribe.&lt;br /&gt;Texture:&lt;br /&gt;-More like gel rather than liquid. (surprising to me)&lt;br /&gt;Feel:&lt;br /&gt;-Slightly drying and stretchy (almost like you had a mild botox) P.S. I have a combination skin where my T-zone gets oily.&lt;br /&gt;-bonus: I also applied it to my boyfriend who has oily skin and he had the same thoughts&lt;br /&gt;Smell: (DEALBREAKER)&lt;br /&gt;-When it comes to lotions, creams, etc. they either need to be scent-free or have to smell good. This one, smelled horrendous. A smell that was rotten and sour. (I know its not a great explanation).&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;- I usually put it on the back on my hand after shower, and spread it over my face little by little starting with my forehead. It dries very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;-I do  go for the product after shower if I am going to go out and need something before make-up , however, I will not use it during summer since I feel like it will not be a good match with a tan. If it&#x27;s going to take me few hours to get ready, I prefer lotion and I will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Nice large bottle.  Moisturizes wonderfully.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, after reading the reviews I was very happy with taking a chance on this! It seems to work better for my wrinkles on my forehead than nerium :) I use nightly...</li>
            <li> I saw that Dr OZ was talking about hyaluronic acid and it could add years back in our skin.  I was looking for the best I could afford.  I have used it for two weeks and am begining to see a noticable difference in my wrinkles.  I was one, in my younger years, did&#x27;nt take care of my skin. Will keep using this product as one of my stables.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feel hydrated and not \\&quot;coated\\&quot;. The fact that the product is paraben- free and organic makes me love this product even more. My husband wanted to try it as well and he felt in love immediately!. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Helps to keep my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use it with my derma pen. It&#x27;s like a gel so gives a good gliding effect.</li>
            <li> i have  not seen any difference. was affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I mix it with pure vitamin c powder, pure vitamin A and E oil and it has been doing away nicely with fine lines. I am in my very late 30&#x27;s and armed this along with healthy eating, am looking forward to my 40&#x27;s and beyond!!!</li>
            <li> great for smoothing and adding moisture</li>
            <li> I love love this stuff! My skin looks amazing and it takes two drops!!!!</li>
            <li> This feels like how you would expect a product touted to be made from the comb of a rooster to feel. Very slick and skin-friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought some liquid Vitamin C, watered it down with distilled water, applied before using this product. The combination seems to be causing a change for the better on my forearms (after rolling the skin with the Titanium micro needle roller.)</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle, and as the first, it arrived promptly and in good condition.  I really like the way the serum absorbs into your skin right away, leaving it feeling hydrated and fresh, then I put moisturizer over it.  I don&#x27;t know that I look any younger (I&#x27;m 54) or anything, but I really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this a few times now, and am not disappointed at all.  I use this morning and night before applying a moisturizer and do believe it has made a nice difference in the overall texture of my skin.  Will continue to order this product.  A little goes a long way.  I also put it on my neck and chest area also.  Price is very fair in comparison to what I have gotten from other companies.  Thank you for an affordable product.</li>
            <li> A great product to use on your page. Its gooeyness is equivalent to placing aloe vera on your face.  I really like the weightlessness and quick absorption of the product, but I do not notice a slight difference for this working toward wrinkles.  Negative part: Instructions say to use a drop or two.  I had to use 4-5 drops for facial coverage. Having to use this much doesn&#x27;t make it last very long.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Especially when used after derma rolling.</li>
            <li> This serum is really nice, it&#x27;s a gel-like consistency, so a little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel (and look) really hydrated, which is a nice change from other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps yet, but very smoothing and moisturizing. I defiantly like it.</li>
            <li> This  dried  my  skin!  rather  the opposite  of  its advertising.  The  climate  in  Australia  may  be  too  humid  for  it  to  pull  moisture  in.</li>
            <li> I have good skin, sometimes it blemishes because of that monthly visitor but good otherwise.  I have noticed recently that my skin was dull and not healthy looking.  So I did my scrub and all that.  I use Kiehl&#x27;s products for moisturizing and hair.  I decided to add this to my regimen.  I have been using it for just over 8 days.  I noticed that the fine lines are not as apparent.  My skin feels tighter and it glows.  I keep thinking it was oily by afternoon but it&#x27;s actually my skin looking so good.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up daily, I&#x27;m more of a natural girl so I see the difference quickly.  When I do wear light make-up, it looks like I have perfect complexion, no wrinkles.  I use this product nightly under my moisturizer.  3 drops are more than enough to cover my whole face and neck.  So far I really like this product.  For the price, it is great.  I&#x27;ve paid 4 times the amount and saw the same results in other products.  My skin looks healthier and smoother.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using this product along with Vit C in the morning and Retinol serum at night</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It goes on smooth and not greasy at all.  I have told my daughter and a friend about this and they use it also.  I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Used it for about a week I use tonor before applying  and moisturizer after the hyluronic serum and my skin is now totally hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really popular product for removing lines and wrinkles on the face. It can be used with other products like pepha-tight to make you look younger. It works and I highly recommend this product. Just read up on how to use and you will love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I used it (among other well researched things) to try to tame my acne scars. It&#x27;s works wonders if used properly and I stress it that you research HOW to use this before you do. Or else face damage you will cause yourself to your skin</li>
            <li> I believe in this product and am completely satisfied with the whole transaction with the sellers.</li>
            <li> Great quality and good price. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot it feels good I have a very sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any problem I would keep buying this product excellent price and quality .</li>
            <li> Like the product and use it with a Vitamin C serum for adding moisture.</li>
            <li> I got this product on a very good discounted price. Its a really good product..My skin feels and look more brighter and softer..It has made my skin more hydrated and moisturised. I love this serum and would highly recommend this to people with dry and dull skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome serum - a little goes a long way and although it starts out feeling slightly sticky, the tackiness goes away when the serum is absorbed.  My regular moisturizer is working way better - my skin feels hydrated for much longer with this underneath.  And the fine lines by my eyes are all but gone.  Amazing!  You can&#x27;t beat the price, and the packaging makes it look much more luxe than it costs.</li>
            <li> I often hear dermatologists speaking to the benefits of this serum, which is found in SMALL traces in other products.  I decided to try the serum and have been elated with the differ ence in my skin.</li>
            <li> I saw no results with this product at all. I do not think it was worth the money and I would not buy or recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for less than I paid for only one product of a competitor for only 1 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the Serum to go on smoothly.  It makes my skin very soft.  I have noticed under my eye area an improvement that I did not have with the competitor product.  Also, on the neck area it has softened the lines not making them so pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to use this serum in conjunction with a more firming moisturinzer that I am waiting to receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product has returned my skin to a greater softness that I did not have before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is excellent for the amount received.  Three drops is all I need for my face and neck.  The product should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would highly recommend this to anyone needing a softer and smoother skin improvement.</li>
            <li> Ok. It will ball up if you put cream or make up over it. Feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. It works. Instant liposuction for the face. Use your favorite moisturizer/sunblock. Then any makeup you want.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a loooong way! Two drops on 2 fingertips, rub them together then smooth over face.  Add another drop and use on eyes. This is the best Hyaluronic serum and the least expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...if used properly will yield amazing results</li>
            <li> This really works i feel like i look much younger being 28.</li>
            <li> I use it with Vit-C moisturizer.  Still looking for positive results.</li>
            <li> i use a microneedle pen on my face and need this product on my skin while i am doing the needling. it makes the pen glide across the skin plus the serum gets to penetrate into the skin to hydrate it.</li>
            <li> Very good product! Improves skin texture, reduces blemishes and minimises wrinkles! Would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great product! I am noticing softer, more even toned skin after just one week of use. I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts. I have had no problems with using this product, if anything my breakout have cleared up. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love! My skin feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Best hyaluronic acid I&#x27;ve purchased! Great deal for the money and I love the consistency!</li>
            <li> My first time using this--I really like it. I have oily skin that feels dry after washing it and this helps it to feel hydrated but not heavy or greasy. Seesm to disappear once applied and dried.  Very light, seems to improve skin texture and quality. (As with any topical products, there are no miracles, only products that help the skin to some degree or another.)  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Use this after derma rolling.... Can&#x27;t even tell you how amazing this product is. I will never go without it! My skin looks fab!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used another other hyaluronic acid serum before and I think it is better than this one because it feels like it really penetrates the skin, whereas this product feels like it just rests on the top of the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this so far. I have no more dry patches and I notice the texture being much smoother. Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Love this product.non irritating and leaves my skin glowing.I have sun damage and even though I realize it is what it is I can see improvement or softening of fine lines!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....my skins feels so soft after using it!  Came as an add on and the price was low enough that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Love this particular one, it&#x27;s the right price for me, and feels so great on my face, I slather it all over my face, and neck after I wash, and I think it really is helping to keep my wrinkles a bit at bay; It&#x27;s hard to tell now that I&#x27;m in my seventy&#x27;s, but hay! I still care, and do try to keep my face from turning into a prune (wish me luck on that one.) . Anyway as long as it keeps at the price it is now, I will continue to keep getting it, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Just lovin these products. Using the Multi-Active Night Cream along with the Hyaluronic. It is doing wonders for my skin. You will not believe until you try it.</li>
            <li> I do like this product every time I use it my skin looks nice and hydrate.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy about the product. We will be ordering the second one soon.</li>
            <li> I have used several serums in my life, and this one is the best so far. A little goes a long way. Just a few drops cover my face, eyes, neck. The price is perfect for my budget too.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought Cosmedica Skincare&#x27;s product because of the stellar rating, and it turns out that a large portion of it is fake.  She gave a negative, but honest, review of this hyaluronic acid serum because the serum makes her face even drier.  She immediately received unhelpful votes, but it didn&#x27;t stop there - as her review grows more popular (71 out of 81 people thought the review is helpful) as of 2/21/14 in the morning.  It all of a sudden took a deep dive in the afternoon on the same day - 69 people all of a sudden thought her review was unhelpful in less than 6 hours.  It is my opinion.  this company (Cosmedica Skincare) manipulated the customer rating system to promote their product.  In fact, my girlfriend bought this product because of their stellar reviews, which now appears to be a total scam done by the company.  Don&#x27;t fall into the trap!  This company is NOT HONEST!  And this serum, for some people, will make your face even drier - a message you will only receive after you purchase the product (it is written on the serum bottle, but not mentioned on Amazon&#x27;s product description).</li>
            <li> I found this product to be a good selection. I am seeing good results and will purchase again. I appreciated the reviews. They had a huge impact on my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product of high quality. I always use this after doing a self acid peel at home. My skin loves the way it feels and it holds in moisture. It is like a little treat for my face. If your skin is dry or becoming dry this is a nice natural way to make it feel better.</li>
            <li> Using now, have one in stock, wont be without it........Cosmedica good  skincare....</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am a pretty die hard oil of olay fan.  I saw this product while looking for other natural facial products and it already had great reviews. I received it 3 days ago, but have noticed that it really rehydrates and gives your skin a polish. The only thing is this is not a moisturizer. You apply it before and then moisturize. I am still working on getting that routine down pat. Highly recommend this for women in their 40s and 50s</li>
            <li> I do not even have very sensitive skin and within 24 hours I have broken out in hives all over my face with an extremely itchy red rash. Also, my skin is so dry today even with my moisturizer on that my skin is actually flaking.  I am furious that I bought into these glowing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 2 days later, my rash (which is still all over my face) is starting to go down but I swear this product stripped every bit of moisture from skin possible. My skin was looking great until I used this stuff. It is so excessively dry and flaky I just cannot believe one use of this stuff could cause so many issues. Especially considering that I do not have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t know how it appears to be so wonderful for everyone else but it has messed my skin up! Be warned.</li>
            <li> This serum rocks! My pores are disappearing and my skin is looking more youthful. This serum is right up with the pricier serums. I will be a loyal user from now on.</li>
            <li> I use the Hyaluronic serum directly after micro needling my entire face. I do this right before bedtime, and wake up with glowing skin! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the best product you could invest in! I have acne scars and it makes them disappear. The first time I used it I fell in LOVE with this product. I HIGHLY recommended this product and promise you will not be disappointed. Your face will look brighter and younger in just days! This product also goes great with Vitamin C Prep &amp; Tone. I use both day and night and my face has an overall better appearance. Definitely try these two products !!</li>
            <li> The best hyaluronic acid have tried so far! My skin looks so beautiful now!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin was looking amazing before I started this product.  I was thinking that this serum would help me maintain my skin health.  It is true that this product makes your skin feel tight but I accredit that to its drying affect.  I rarely write a review about any product but when the product is such a stellar dissappointment such as this serum, I must comment.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this HA. It really works wonders. I used with my sonic infuser and watched my fine lines disappear. It is extremely hydrating and penetrates your skin very quickly. I follow it with my M Asam collagen serum.&lt;br /&gt;Great product I will buy it again, at Amazon.Com. Lynne</li>
            <li> For the money you pay for this product, it&#x27;s worth every penny. I am extremely happy with this product and I would recommend it to everyone, especially if you are over 40.</li>
            <li> This leaves skin feeling smoother in a matter of days.  I use it after my needle treatments and it helps remove any imperfections and allows skin to breath without being too tacky or heavy.  The acid isn&#x27;t strong enough to make you feel the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;, and with gentle exfoliation you can keep that young looking skin forever.  No false promises with this product, it&#x27;s affordable and I&#x27;d say the best product I&#x27;ve used thus far.  All skin needs to be hydrated both from the inside and outside.  You&#x27;ll notice a definite difference in a week.</li>
            <li> Very happy with results. It really changed my skin. I do think that my makeup applies and looks better. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Makes me look younger</li>
            <li> Love the service, love the product!</li>
            <li> Great. Good packaging. Worked as expected. Received this at a disvount in return for a review</li>
            <li> My second bottle . Use it alone, use it with lotion. Gets rid of chest wrinkles. Love love love</li>
            <li> This product provides the moisture I need: my face actually radiates and I have mature skin. The texture of my skin appears smoother and softer to the touch. I have recently purchase my second vial. Kudos!</li>
            <li> I use the serum before sunscreen. No fragrance or color. Inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> Really nice. Soaks right in</li>
            <li> At first I started using this serum and I really likes it...then my skin started drying up until it felt like sand paper. I did not change anything else in my regimen which is why I believe this to be the culprit. It has alcohol in it as well as the H acid which is why it is so drying. If you are planning on getting H acid...get something which has some oils in it to combat the acidity and prevent the dryness.</li>
            <li> I had used another, more expensive hyaluronic product before, but this one works just as well or better. I apply it first in a thin coat, then after it dries, put my moisturizer on top. My face looks a little smoother, feels nice and makeup goes on smoothly. You can also mix it with moisturizer and apply that way, seems to work well also. I have very dry skin and yes, the dreaded wrinkles are beginning to show, but while this is not a miracle worker, (and what is?) it does a very nice job for a very nice price. A little goes a long way also, which is pleasing to my budget. Will buy again when this runs out, which probably will not be for some time, as it&#x27;s a nice size bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product on advice from Dr. Oz. So far, after using half of the first bottle, I&#x27;ve been pleased with the results. I can&#x27;t be sure that it is having positive effects, but when I look in the mirror I think I do see an improvement. I&#x27;m going to continue using it and see how it goes</li>
            <li> I buy it for myself and my mom. It smooths lines and keeps my skin looks bright (I&#x27;m 37) and my mom (65) can not believes the look on her face...simply reduces her wrinkles very well.  We have been using it for about a year so far and we not changing it...</li>
            <li> I have to say that it is a bit drying for my skin.  Reading the reviews and seeing the alcohol content, that would explain it.  I am 56 years old, menopausal, with very dry skin.  I layer many products to my face -  serum/argan oil, moisturizer.  I have been reading a lot about hyaluronic acid serum, and have tried a serum that had it in it.  Decided to bump it up and get a stronger level of it.  I do however put Josie Maran&#x27;s whipped unscented body butter lightly around my eyes to sink in, and also my face.  I would highly recommend using Josie Maran&#x27;s whipped unscented body butter on your face if you find her face oil too shiny.</li>
            <li> Started to smell funny after a week. Threw it away and will not buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything- aging skin scares me... I use this after I derma roll my face and I can tell results quite quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. The quality is high and it feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> great discount! nice price! great product!</li>
            <li> Amazing hydration solution - two application of this serum in the morning replaces the moisturizer on hot summer days, leaves my skin silky and smooth for the entire day. Will order again and suggest to friends</li>
            <li> Good price for what seems to be a great product. It definitely helped with the hydration levels of my skin under my eyes. Feels good on the skin, and it lasts quite a while before I had to reorder. Got the next size larger the second time. a good value.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and glows, need I say more</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the Cosmedia skin-care product.  I really have to say that I noticed a difference in my skin within a week.  I heard about hyaluronic acid from my microdermabrasionist who told be to use the serum in between sessions for better results.  Instantly I felt a smoothness and clean feeling after applying the product.  I noticed that my skin was brighter and where there were little lines and pores before, my skin just seemed to plump up after using the serum.  I tried another product with Vitamin C because I wanted to make sure that I wasn&#x27;t missing anything, but I think that the Cosmedia hyaluronic acid is a much better product with better results.  I had good skin before, but I think my skin looks amazing now after just a few weeks of use.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is non-greasy and very refreshing to wear underneath your makeup.  Leaves my skin feeling fresh and flawless!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face for a month, and like the results.  The product has &amp;#34;plumped up&amp;#34; my skin, so that my &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; wrinkles above my nose are less noticeable.  My skin feels more elastic and soft.  But I am more surprised at what it has done for my hair.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and color my hair.  And now it&#x27;s mid-winter here in Minnesota, you get the picture.  A few weeks ago, I tried adding 8-10 drops of the Hyaluronic Serum into my conditioner bottle (John Freida&#x27;s Brilliant Brunette).  I was, and continue to be quite amazed.  My hair feels like it did when I was a young woman - soft, very silky, and no heavy residue.  This is the best my hair has felt to the touch in years.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter to use as part of her teen acne treatments. The mask works well at cleaning out pores from the gunk that causes the acne.  And she really likes the texture so she uses it. This review is for the wrong product but I can&#x27;t seem to delete it.</li>
            <li> I use this serum both day and night. I have sensitive skin and this serum doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use it for both my face and back to help with my acne. After this serum is absorbed my face looks brighter. My face doesn&#x27;t seem oily or greasy after using it. I received this serum for free to test and review then give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> Easy may emprove complexion. Soothing at time of application</li>
            <li> This is not very moisturizing, but it does feel like it tightens my skin.  You just need a little bit (half of a dropper) for face and neck.  I apply moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> Item shipped fast, I love this product, it is the best thing for my face I have ever found.  I would recommend this to all women.</li>
            <li> Please note that this product was received for free in exchange for a review. The following is my honest opinion and experience with the product. If you&#x27;re not for these types of review, you may want to skip ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was alternating days between using and not using the serum before going to bed when I first got the serum. I&#x27;ve noticed that this serum helps to boost the effectiveness of the cream I was using. While the results aren&#x27;t blow-your-mind amazing, I do see more moisturized and dewy skin on the day following the use of the serum. The product would probably work better if the moisturizer being used had ingredients that allowed the hyaluronic acid property to be fully utilized. I am now using the serum every night and results are more obvious with consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you rub the serum between your fingers, it has a very slippery feel to it. It glides effortlessly onto my skin, almost like a barrier. It sinks in incredibly fast to the point of looking like nothing was applied in the first place. This helps to move on with your skincare regimen or even your day quicker. It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy, which is great. It doesn&#x27;t affect my oily t-zone problems and still manages to help the rest of my skin that&#x27;s generally dehydrated. I find that 6-7 drops are enough to thoroughly cover my entire face and neck area. You can probably use less but I like this amount since it doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I&#x27;m skimping or applying inadequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the serum does have a somewhat unpleasant scent to it but I have a rather sensitive nose so it may just be me. I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint what it smells like so it may just be a result of the ingredient combination or what they naturally smell like. The scent is apparent when you apply the serum but it goes away quickly. It&#x27;s not enough of an issue to be a caveat and I would prefer this over added fragrance. I love the super short ingredient list since there are just three ingredients: distilled water, hyaluronic acid, benzyl-alcohol(0.5%). The serum is also noted to be cruelty free; this is always a plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, my experience with the product is a positive one.ter, hyaluronic acid, benzyl-alcohol(0.5%).

            <li> Great serum, use it every day and night under my moisturizer. Like the consistency and how little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly.....i think it is working great!  my skin definitely looks good and i think my forehead wrinkle is less noticeable.  will continue using.  a big plus....the &amp;#34;sun bumps&amp;#34; on my chest area, that i always have, are gone.  coincidence?  i don&#x27;t know but i&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> great product, you can literally see results overnight. Not greasy, in fact I put a little moisturizer on at night after I apply.</li>
            <li> Fantastic serum! I really like the way it absorbs into my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and it wasn&#x27;t oily. I really think its helping with some darker spots I have on my face and I can already feel a definite difference in the texture of my skin. This serum doesn&#x27;t break me out and the scent wasn&#x27;t strong for me at all. A great product and I will update this when it&#x27;s had more time to work on the lines on my forehead and these stubborn dark spots. Also it doesn&#x27;t take much, a little of this serum goes a long way so I expect it to last me a long while. It&#x27;s a great value. I&#x27;m loving it so far! I hope you found this information helpful for you. I did receive my bottle free for testing and reviewing purposes but my review is solely based off of my own personal experience having used it.</li>
            <li> I feel this works and the price is right.</li>
            <li> this is awesome and it has no smell- feels extremely light weight on my skin</li>
            <li> This will be the second bottle that I have started using and I truly love this product. I don&#x27;t have real oily skin but just very slight and so I like that it is not at all greasy.  Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Results are amazing. Smothed out fine wrinkle lines and cleared up blemishes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> Using  this product for nearly a year and definitely seeing the result. Even though it is not very expensive it works well . Would definitely buy it again and it is highly recommended base on my personal result. My face is looking young , beautiful and flawless the fact that I am in my fifties I look ten years younger</li>
            <li> I have been using DDF Microdermabrasion machine for 5 years.  I received this serum on Friday, today is Monday. I have been using it for 4 days and everyone is talking about how nice my skin looks.  Someone even asked to touch my skin!  First time ever!!!!  A keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had for a few days, but I think it is going to really make a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for my wife as reviews prompted her decision to purchase, and after several days of use she is extremely satisfied with the product and would repurchase this great serum anytime!</li>
            <li> I was excited about purchasing this product, but, unfortunately, the alcohol in it irritated my skin, so I didn&#x27;t see much hydration</li>
            <li> Okay I just received this in the mail last week. I have heard nothing but great things about HA but typically, beauty products do not have a high enough dose to see the results it touts. Let me tell you, this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face morning and evening, pat dry with wash cloth. Then I smear a dropper full on my face and neck. I really don&#x27;t wait too long to put my moisturizer on because the HA soaks right into my skin. No other products/serum used other than HA and my regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;What I have noticed is no more frown lines on my forehead! My neck even smoothed out. It jas only been a week. I started searching for something for my skin because my moisturize after years of use did not seem it was getting the job done. After spending too much money trying out different creams, I eventually went back to my tried and true Oil of Olay. I figured my skin is just changing (age does that). The HA really does boost the moisture level in my skin and helps transport the cream into the dermis. I am staring to see a &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; look. I wish I have taken a photo of my face before I stared because it took me a minute to figure out what changed (ha!) So working for me.</li>
            <li> This product is great, I use it to keep my skin more hydrated and to have smoother skin. I noticed after a week on my face that it&#x27;s brighter and softer. I also use it with my moisturizers and I stay hydrated longer. Great service, great product!</li>
            <li> Great product. Not too think or filmy. Dried light!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now after applying my vit c 20% serum and then apply moisterizer!  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> this really works i love this stuff and just bought some for my mother ..she is 73....but i can see results and it was like over night..use it with l&#x27;oreal paris revitalift triple power concentrated serum,,perfect together</li>
            <li> At 51, I needed a boost after a cold winter and my daughter&#x27;s wedding coming up.  I love my Bert&#x27;s Bees Moisturizer and this was the perfect thing to use as Step 1, under my current moisturizer.  Great results and much less expensive than switching to a high cost moisturizer with it as an ingredient. Definitely has made a difference in my face and neck!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time using hyaluronic acid. It is not moisturizing as it&#x27;s claimed to be... I used a few times already so I have to keep though.</li>
            <li> Love how fast it absorbs.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  It does hydrate and smooth out wrinkles when you use it with your regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> saw on Dr. Oz show, I live in a cold climate so thought it would help with hydration...so far its great with a face cream too.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and so far so good. It feels a little drying to me, but I think I was using too much. Nice product.I think to notice any difference it will take a few months.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin due to steroids and chemotherapy.  I thought nothing could help my dry skin.  I am 65 and was also developing some discoloration spots on my face.  I have tried Argon oil, rosemary oil, and many other traditional cosmetic lines.  I saw this and decided to try it.  From the first time I put a drop on my finger and rubbed it on my face I felt a difference in the skin.  I also tried mixing it with my moisturizer serum and both ways worked perfectly.  I can not say yet if it lessens fine lines, but I can say that it definitely has an effect on the texture of your skin and holds moisture.  If it does that, you have major improvement!  I am now going to order this to use on my arms for the thin skin with a moisturizer because the price makes that possible.  Someone else mentioned how it left a matt look to your skin that was quite appealing.  I agree.  I can&#x27;t believe how quickly my skin absorbs the hyaluronic acid serum and how wonderful it feels.  If you are thinking of trying this....just try it.  For the price, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> did not like, used for 4 weeks, no changes at all would not recommend, would like a refund not happy</li>
            <li> Very drying on my face</li>
            <li> Sigh, I don&#x27;t have a chance to try on it and wonder if anyone experience this before. The packaging of this serum is terrible! I have bought another serum(180 Ultima Pure Swiss, (Super Strong) Hyaluronic Acid Serum Forte with Vitamin C) at the same time and only this bottle is broken, not a single drop of the serum was left. I guess the manufacturer has to rethink about the packaging of the product, the outer paper box is very thin and there is nothing to support the inner bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However Amazon handles my complaint very prompt and good. Thanks Amazon! I dare not request for a replacement as I worry that it will be broken again when I receive it. I have bought so many skincare products(with glass bottle packaging) before and this is the first and the only one that was broken when it finally reached me. I wanted badly to use it but too bad, I would not purchase this product anymore!</li>
            <li> Did not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many many HA serum before, some are 10 time more expensive! But I do feel that this one works the best and it&#x27;s so cheap compared to others, it&#x27;s a 2oz too!&lt;br /&gt;My face does look firmer after using it, then I will use a good moisturizer on top it, I am ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product - it makes my daily moisturizer go much further and produces great results.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS&lt;br /&gt;First application looks great, feels great. used according to instructions. Then...it my wrinkles &amp; dryness even worse, after a week I looked 10 years OLDER, not younger. It was horrifying. Never again.</li>
            <li> The price is right, I use it at bedtime and my face is much smoother and tiny lines around eyes and mouth seem to be less pronounced</li>
            <li> I have only been using this about a week. Can&#x27;t see a difference yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful. Nothing negative to say about this product. I will update later when I have given this product enough time. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, I use it under moisturizers and with skin needling procedure. It works well, my skin looks and feels refreshed and fuller after use. The only negative is that It dries out very quickly once applied on the skin, but i think it is suppose to do that, so I&#x27;m not complaining. I also use it to mix with other products, like vitamin C (CosMedix Pure C ). I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product have been using it for almost a month. Debra</li>
            <li> Rapid shipping. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Instant hydrating results</li>
            <li> Loving it so far. I have always used a serum so I have therefor noticed any dramatic changes. But my skin looks and feels great. A beautician told me the other day that my skin felt soft and plum. So it&#x27;s keeping up the good work at the very least!</li>
            <li> This seems to hydrate my skin pretty well and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation. I put it on at bedtime. Two more words ....there they are.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1 % people and that&#x27;s the highest you&#x27;ll find on Amazon, works well with other facial moisturizers, nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I purchased the smaller bottle because this was a first time purchase however, I will probably order the larger quantity in the future.  Result is a smooth and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived in a timely manner and was wrapped in a very protected manner.</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol in this. Not enough hylouronic. Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin hydrated for very long. Don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s between a 4 and 5 star. This is a serum and not oily or such. I will be able to tell if it is indeed a 5 star after I used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> After researching..I decided to purchase this hyaluronic acid serum..very good choice I made..makes my skin feel lovely and really seems to be doing wonderful things..I don&#x27;t want to be without  this as I also do derma rolling and this product seems great in conjunction with that process..I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I been using it for long time and I think it&#x27;s make a difference on my face, so I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and definitely recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> Have only been using about 2 weeks, at first I thought I saw a difference but not so sure now.  I am, however, giving it more time.  It is worth a shot, not too expensive</li>
            <li> no smell, absorbs easily, non-greasy.I use it once a day. I love it. Gentle on skin. And, the price is right.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I see any difference in my wrinkles.....&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it because it can&#x27;t hurt.....right&lt;br /&gt;you really need to use a moisturizer after this</li>
            <li> Bought for my gorgeous wife, she loves it -</li>
            <li> Lightweight feel to it‚Ä¶very effective product!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I had deep lines on my forehead and they have diminished dramatically.  The ll lines are better but not completely gone, still working on it.  I have a sister who works for Clarins and she said they have a product &amp;#34;Clarins Double Serum&amp;#34; with a department store price of $115.00 and women will pay that!  She said if the product I am using works then stick with it.  Also to apply the serum to your neck and d&amp;eacute;colletage and to apply moisturizer after the serum has dried, if you have dry skin. Because the serum penetrates through several layers of skin.  With the moisturizer only penetrating through the top layer.  Be patient because this product really does work and for the price it is worth trying it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a few days, but it seems to be addressing my dry skin.  It is easy to use, is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking shiny.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed that huge of an improvement in the appearance of my skin, I have noticed that I don&#x27;t get new acne with this product (something that happens to me on a daily basis because I have oily and very very easily clogged pores which I fight with the clarisonic and bha product). I also believe this product helps my skin absorb other products better which is a plus. I like it, but the appearance of my skin has not changed. Also another thing is I heard hyaluronic helps repair skin so hopefully it&#x27;ll help with my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I love this Hyaluronic acid because it is real.  I&#x27;ve purchased others and the consistency was just a bit off, and I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin except that it felt dry.  I really notice my skin feels softer and smoother, and moisturized after I use the Cosmedica brand serum.  I will continue to use the Cosmedica brand of Hyaluronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> This is not as nourishing as i expected.  We have dry to normal skin.  It soaks right in but skin does not  stay moisturized but a few hours. By morning your skin needs more hydration, skin seems dry.  It seems to last a few hours.  That Is with a moisturizing cream over it.</li>
            <li> awesome, awesome, awesome!  LOVE this product!  it&#x27;s the first of it&#x27;s kind that i have ever purchased, and i am so impressed!  makes my skin soft and smooth, and evens out those lines and wrinkles!  i will definitely be ordering other products from cosmedica.  bravo!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serium is wonderful for your skin.  It brings moisture to your skin.  I have very dry skin and this has helped to tighten and bring moisture to my skin better then any $300.00 product I use to use.</li>
            <li> I think its working.  I am on my second bottle. I use in conjunction with the vitamin C serum 20%.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My face feels so good after using it! I&#x27;ll continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I like it, but honestly can&#x27;t say I love it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work as quickly as I had hoped, although, I can definitely see a difference in the appearance of my skin compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I was doing Botox but then lost my job and couldn&#x27;t afford Botox anymore. I was amazed at how quickly my skin tightened and improved. Botox is still better but this is a great alternative and u can&#x27;t beat the price in comparison to Botox</li>
            <li> make you skin brighter and softer. I have some deep lines on my forehead between my eyes , they seem a little softer. Been only been using this for a few weeks , you get a lot of serum for the money.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it with argan oil on my face, neck, chest. I love the dropper, no mess like the squirt tops. Will buy again</li>
            <li> prompt delivery, as described item,,,,thank you</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Non greasy, quickly absorbed, noticed a reduction in fine lines and improvement in skin tone within a week of using this!</li>
            <li> Great value for the $</li>
            <li> The solution is like water!!! Not like. Serum at all , after reading the 1 star reviews I never used it again, I guess you get what u pay for ... Not even worth it to try this on my face , positive reviews has a lot of fake and repeated ones ! Beware !!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Was using a different brand of hyaluronic acid and like this one better, and love that I can get it online through Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> No greasy, Very light. Used it for a week now and my skin looks brighter but no changes in my frown lines.</li>
            <li> quickly calms aches and pains...and joints use anywhere on your body&lt;br /&gt;everyone should try it and feel the benefits...it works</li>
            <li> I started using it all time, but dried skin out so not sure I really like.  Had good reviews tho, so maybe just my skin!</li>
            <li> I do like this product very much. My only complaint is that there is 0.05 of alcohol in it. It did not list this as an ingredient when I looked at it before purchasing. Next time I will search for an alcohol free brand. But it is nice, hopefully is working.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I can see a difference and my face and neck seem tighter.  I recommend this product to help with age lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This serum is not greasy.  It soaks right into your skin.  I have noticed a difference in the smoothness of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this.....and so is my wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hyaluronic acid brand for about a week.  It is a serum so it only takes a drop about the size of a pencil point.  A little goes a long way.  It absorbs into my skin and I actually feel like my lines are softening a little.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s and have combination skin. I really love this product. It is not oily at all and is similar to the consistency of a serum. The difference between this product and a serum, however, is that it actually soaks into your skin and quenches it from inside. When applied, it completely penetrates into your skin and there is no greasy feeling residue left on the surface, just smooth, soft, naturally plumped up skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will be throwing out all of my other serums and just use this morning and night under my moisturizer. I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was really pleasantly surprised at the size of the bottle. It was much larger than I was expecting, and seeing as I only need to use a little bit, it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 2 weeks but I love the way it makes my skin feel. It does seem to diminish some of my wrinkles. It absorbs fast and is not greasy. I follow it with DMAE serum and my skin is looking better. I think it may take a few more weeks to see a more noticable change.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day under a light moisturizer and it feels wonderful, even with my mild rosacea. It calms, does not irritate and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I saw dramatic results (been using for about 1 month now), but I do think by skin is in better condition overall due to use of this product. My face was quite dry, and moisturizer alone wasn&#x27;t cutting it. I applied this morning and might, under my other skincare. I&#x27;ve read that hyaluronic acid in combination with vitamin C works best, so I&#x27;ll be trying that product when this runs out. Good amount provided  for the cost. Arrived in good condition. Overall, not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> Started using this about a month ago.  I would massage a couple drops into my skin and then rub in Neutrogena Rapid Wrinle Repair Night moisturizer before going to sleep. I was expecting to see results up to a month out, but began noticing benefits in less than a week. My skin wasn&#x27;t in bad shape to begin with, but days after adding this product to my routine I noticed small spider angiomas and red spots totally vanishing. My overall skin tone has improved and seems brighter and more even. I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever felt this smooth, either.  My roommate had some small wrinkles on his face and after using HA over the course of a week they have all but vanished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I use this for my T zone on my face. it has made that part of my face dry and soft, no more oily skin. love it.&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning I used it all over my face and noticed that it was over drying the parts of my face that aren&#x27;t very oily. now the way I&#x27;m using it is perfect.</li>
            <li> It feels good to me and it does seem to hold moisture in.  I would purchase again.  I use it a couple of times a day almost every day.</li>
            <li> This product meets it&#x27;s claims. It is absorbed quickly, improves texture and brightness of my skin. My skin is plumper, softer and smoother. I apply it under my night moisturizer and again in the am under my morning moisturizer. I have seen and felt the difference...Love it!</li>
            <li> Plumped my skin...&lt;br /&gt;Easy storage.&lt;br /&gt;A spray would be a good enhancement.&lt;br /&gt;A great product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with purchase.  Product is pure hyaluronic acid serum which works very well to soften and hydrate skin.  The price is also divine.</li>
            <li> At first, I was unsure of this product. My face was dry and felt tight after using it so I&#x27;d use my regular moisturizer afterwards. The more I used the serum, the less I noticed the tight/dryness. My face doesn&#x27;t feel as oily during the day and my make up goes on more smoothly and seems to stay on my face longer than before. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and have already purchased a second bottle. My skin is very dry so it tends to look oily. Will be using this product from now on.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product,I have been using this about a week, I use it at night under moisturizer, My skin is very hydrated and soft, Not to sure about seeing any results yet about lines less noticeable. Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Very good product, does what it says it does. Hardcore moisturizer if you have dry skin, scar tissue, or keratosis.</li>
            <li> Seams to brighten my completion and moisturize pretty well.. It does say no studies have been done on pregnant woman . So I wont be using this while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I am 72 and have combination skin.  It&#x27;s not as oily as when I was younger, but still developed an oily glow within an hour or two of showering.  This summer I began using an Eliz. Arden moisturizer which eliminated that oiliness, but my skin still felt a little rough or coarse even though I use exfoliating gloves when I bathe.  Then I read about and decided to try this serum.  Now I smooth on 2-3 drops of serum and then do the same with 2-3 drops of my moisturizer.  The immediate improvement was amazing.  With this routine, my skin feels tighter and so much smoother.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great hydrating serum for skin.  Use it every night.</li>
            <li> Will definitely keep ordering</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I have been using.  Hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see drastic changes, but seems to have helped a bit.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast this works. It&#x27;s amazing and definitely worth every cent. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about one week and I am already experiencing some improvement in my skin.  It is softer, more supple, and the wrinkles are slightly less pronounced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see results yet because I started to use it recently but I can feel like my skin gets lifted right after I apply it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I&#x27;ve tried several expensive products to try and keep my facial skin smooth but so far I haven&#x27;t been satisfied until this product.  I know I&#x27;m going to always have this product as part of my skin routine.</li>
            <li> I use it day and night and I do see a difference. I have to say I would use it again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected to buy, I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> previous purchases ( 1 year) of the Nikko brand was expensive .  I wanted to try another brand to see the difference.  After 4 wks, there was no difference between the two so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this brand.  i recommend all to try, the $$ saved makes it a winner for me.</li>
            <li> This is my first usage of a hylauronic acid product. I can&#x27;t really give a true rating as yet as I haven&#x27;t used it for a long period but I can say it does feel nice on the skin.  A bit watery so use sparingly and continuously massage in until absorbed.  I also combine it with other ingredients to make a nice l-ascorbic vitamin c face treatment.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waster your money it does absolutely nothing for your skin. I am so disappointed that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not acne prone. Every blue moon I get a pimple or zit. I don&#x27;t normally use products on my face other than washing with baby soap. Now that I&#x27;m near 40, I feel that I need hydration. This product works amazingly! I use it in the morning then wash my face in the afternoon because it&#x27;s warmer out &amp; I&#x27;m afraid of clogging my pores. I reapply the product in the evening after I&#x27;ve washed my face again. I&#x27;ve not had any breakouts and my skin looks so much better. Not to mention the wrinkles are almost completely gone, although I didn&#x27;t have many to begin with. I also apply this to my hands and feet as well as Curel Rough Skin Rescue. My hands look a ton more youthful &amp; my feet are no longer dry or scratchy. Wish I&#x27;d of taken before &amp; after photos.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me! Easy apply, with no greasy residue. However, it did not plump up skin; even when used with derma-roller. I hope it works for others; just not me.</li>
            <li> excellent skin product especially for the cost.  does exactly what it says it will.  I have been using this product for 3 months on my face, neck and it definitely hydrates, plumps  the skin giving a more youthful affect...i always get compliments on my skin....thx for this affordable product.</li>
            <li> I usually never give any ratings, but for this product i must say : 1. Extra fast super delivery in 5 days (take in consideration am on APO address and everything we order is taking 12 to 15 days ) 2. The Hyaluronic Acid is amazing , my skin just loves this serum. I still dont have some deep wrinkles (am 30) but still i have lines from laughing . I put this serum once in the morning , once before i go to sleep. I can see immediately results -softer and smoother skin. You will read a lots of comments about this serum dries your skin. Well yeah, that&#x27;s what it should do, but also clearly says after using this serum always follow up with you favorite moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to everybody.</li>
            <li> This is now a religious part of my daily facial routine. After I wash I spray a little bit of a toner and while my skin is still damp I pat a couple drops of this and then follow with my moisturizer. I keep getting complements on how my skin looks dewy. I noticed it helping a lot when I&#x27;m using Rentin-A and my skin is really dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read about hyaluronic acid for aging skin for a while, and saw this on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I put it on at night before bed, and again under my moisturizer during the day.  It plumps up my skin, especially around my mouth and eyes where fine lines are more pronounced!  It&#x27;s only been a week, and already I see a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products but I&#x27;ve never found anything that equals the speed and quality of Hyaluronic acid.  From the very first time I used it I started to see softer plumper skin.  Even as an adult I still struggle with acne and this product has done wonders for that too.  I can&#x27;t rate this high enough.  It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth every penny and the amount you get will last for several months.</li>
            <li> This product does not compare to the others that I&#x27;ve used.  The price is perfect, but  didn&#x27;t give me the results I was looking for, as I have mature skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  I need to order again now.  The serum helped my skin immensely.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Moisturize my face well, but does not work on wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost a year and will buy again</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the negative reviews. I also can&#x27;t fathom that anyone&#x27;s skin got drier with the product. My creping disappeared and I use this product twice a day along with emu oil once a day. It took three months but I am amazed at the results. I have been buying it for my friends and family who desire hydration. With that being said, the product does not help with melasma or evening skin tone. It is a hydrator like no other! Which is the reason I tried it in the first place. One thing to keep in mind is no two people have the same skin texture, so what works for one may not work for the other.</li>
            <li> Absorbs well. Hydrating.</li>
            <li> I am over 60 with quite a few wrinkles on my face and neck. I have aged like my mom, unfortunately.  I tried this Hyaluronic Acid serum after reading about it on a health website. I have only been using this for about two weeks, so I cannot give a long term review at this point. It seems to make my skin look better, I am thinking it plumps up the skin so the wrinkles don&#x27;t show as much. I say this because some days, my face looks much better, but on a few days, not as good. It can be used two times per day,which is what I do. When I look in the mirror after applying this serum, my face doesn&#x27;t seem to have as many wrinkles. so far, it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect on my neck area.  I will have to write a revised review in a few weeks when I can have more history for this product. So far I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is my best kept secret to soft supple skin. I use it in combination with a gycolic acid peel (I double up on application of Hualuronic acid for about 4 to 5 days after a peel and then coat with pure vitamin A oil instead of a petroleum-based product that causes clogged pores and breakouts which estheticians and dermatologists recommend after certain procedures - tsk tsk naughty professionals). I also use this as my daily mositurizer. I have oily/acne prone skin and this is the ONLY, I repeat only product that mositurizes my skin without leaving it greasy or a film; thus, it doesn&#x27;t contribute to my breakouts! And since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve ditched my Oil of Olay eye cream which does work btw, but so does the Hualuronic acid. So why have both?! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also, I put this on immediately after I clean my face with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, while it&#x27;s still moist. Doing this seems to lock in additional moisture, and controls my face from overproducing oil. I wash my face with this cleanser and moisture about three times a day (8am, 3pm and bedtime) if I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot. I wash my face midday because after reapplying SPF 85+, my face feels a little heavy/dirty. But days of limited sun exposure, it&#x27;s just in the morning and then at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, those with oily skin are constantly battling their oil which a lot of products and regimens either leave it too greasy or extremely strip of all moisture. Have you ever had a dry, oily face? lol Yup, then it starts to crack and wrinkle in the dry areas while the oily areas are still an oil-slick. I think this product works really well with oily skin and the areas that were starting to crack/wrinkle are now supple and lines gone, and the greasy areas are even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put things in perspective, here are my stats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;32 yo, black female with caramel complexion, so darken marks from acne is easily visible on my skin. Extremely oily skin, battled acne since teensbut became worse in my 20s and required 6 months of Accutane, among other things. I&#x27;ve tried just about every OTC and Rx on the market for acne, and about a third of treatments for acne scar revision (mainly because most dermatologist aren&#x27;t experienced with cosmetic procedures and treatment for ethnic skin. News flash, we don&#x27;t all keloid). Currently live in Cal which is dry (used to live on east coast where it was much more humid and my skin hated it). Workout 3 to 4 days a week and drink about 65 onces of water a day. more on days I workout. I also take lots of vitamin B, A, E, and etc for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this with a combination of vitamin C serum also &amp; my skin tone has really  improved with less sun spots &amp; red areas. I have noticed much improvement in fine lines &amp; wrinkles &amp; also pore reduction.I will continue to use this. Feel It&#x27;s a great product that works for a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> it was ok, price was great, but I didn&#x27;t see any results. i didn&#x27;t feel like my skin was any more hydrated than before. i will keep trying to see if results improve...hopefully.</li>
            <li> my mom liked it. does it work? I don&#x27;t know. I mean you can&#x27;t expect miracles at age 65, but she has no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the best by far from any beauty store !!! My skin is so soft within just a week Thank you ..</li>
            <li> It is no better or worse than other products.  It was affordable and it seems to hydrate the skin well.</li>
            <li> there are only good things to say about this serum.  super smoothing, absorbs quickly, never clogs my pores, I use it over other serums, such as vitamin C and firming serums, under my foundation for happy skin..LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I can not give a true rating to an item I just brought with out know if it will work. As with any product it takes time.  I can say it has no Oder and feels smooth,  as far as anything else . Time will tell</li>
            <li> I have an acne prone skin and have taken steps to maintain a &amp;#34;very disciplined&amp;#34; skin care regiment.  I have spent many more $$ on branded name items for my sensitive skin care products and did not get the the same results.  The Cosmedica HA serum is a good and inexpensive product which has shown good results for my skin problems.  I mixed a drop or two with a no-paraben and organic moisturizer and started with a small application on my back to see if there is any allergic reaction for a few days before using the combination on my face and neck. It is always good to try a test area first on any new product.  I am satisfied with the outcome and gradual improvements, I can truly say that there is a 60-70% less breakouts now for my skin condition.</li>
            <li> After reading all the negative reviews I was hesitant to order this product, but did anyways because of the good price just to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I notice a lovely difference in my complexion! I use it morning and night mixing it with vitamin c. Every morning I look in the mirror and say &amp;#34;well good-morning beautiful!&amp;#34; I am 52 years and wrinkle free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now realize there is a product war going on with a lot of trash &amp;#34;talking&amp;#34; by all sides. With that said, I do endorse this product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff looks and feels watery but it does wonders for dry skin. I feel it best when I apply it to my face and neck after my shower, let it soak in, then apply my regular moisturizer on top. Bye bye dry skin and it&#x27;s non greasy too. Extra fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I try it but do not work.</li>
            <li> Watery, does not seem to moisturizing my skin, or it is just not for me. I don&#x27;t know. I have ordered another brand and it works much better.</li>
            <li> Wow really great serum double the size of most. Comes with a dropper and you only need a few drops to cover the entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Face is left feeling really soft and I don&#x27;t have issues with dryness since it is absorbed really well into the skin. Without the item moisturizer is not absorbed well and my skin feels dry later in the day or over a night but with the serum hydration is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels and looks brighter and healthier than before really good stuff. Item was received for review and evaluation.</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free for my HONEST review of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of these serums but this is the best one by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With in days of starting to use it I could see a Great difference in my skin. My Husband also said that my skin looked much healthier to him and felt so much softer than it ever has</li>
            <li> So far, so good  I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks, but so far it seems to working</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using this product, I&#x27;ve notice a difference in my skin tone; wrinkles are less noticeable.  Will be coming back for more....please don&#x27;t stop making this product :)</li>
            <li> I like it the serum make my face  look beautiful  this is my second bottle I give it five stars</li>
            <li> As everyone before has said , it&#x27;s great stuff, makes your complexion silky smooth...</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  When I saw this product in Amazon, I&#x27;m afraid the serum would make my face even more oily or greasy feeling because I have oily face.  Then I saw quite few reviews stated not greasy; so I thought everyone has different skin type, and their condition, so I give it a try and bought a 1oz size.  after I ordered, I have received an email from Cosmedica with a tracking number of my order. Once I received my order, I put one drop on my hand; then magic starts!!!! First, I do not feel any greasy; my skin absorb quickly and I did not feel any greasy at all.  Then, I try couple drops and place on my face.  WOO!!  Same result on my hand!!  My face loves this product!!!  I have been using for two weeks; day and night.  I notice my face spores smaller, better skin tone; and and it seems fine wrinkles are gone (no kidding!!).  l am definitely continues use this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this serum. Bought it before reading and doing more research. This particular acid can&#x27;t penetrate the skin. There for is seems&lt;br /&gt;More to have wicked the moisture from my face. I would recommend for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Like a water! I will never buy again</li>
            <li> I received it, it was great, and after a few days liquefied, now is like water. I don&#x27;t know what to think! I will NOT buy again, just for that reason!</li>
            <li> Save time and $$$. Rub water on your face!</li>
            <li> Love it! !!!.use with vitamin c and my wrinkles are disappearing and face and neck are firmer.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  In just a few weeks, I could tell a difference after using this product along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Cosmedica.  You can put your makeup on afterwards with no worries.</li>
            <li> Very diluted serum. Olay or other store brands are of better quality.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Made skin smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Good product. Can really see the plumping action on back of my hands. Must help on face.</li>
            <li> works very well, I feel my hands look better than they did before.</li>
            <li> I use this every AM and notice a huge difference. This is my second brand I have tried and am very pleased. The price is great and it will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks now. It goes on and absorbs quickly. Leaves my skin soft. However, I&#x27;m not positive if I&#x27;ve encounter any other benefits from this serum yet. May be too early.</li>
            <li> I would give this negative stars if I could.. After one day my face is completely broken out everywhere.. I never get breakouts this bad...Also, it Is extremely dry and looks old now I have to wait days before this goes away. These other reviews must be fake ---I will be sending this back today and stick to my vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid serum does wonders for my skin. I put some in my palm and then add a pump of Abella vitamin C , mix it and spread it on my face. It truly softens the skin, and gives it a glow. My skin feels hydrated. I started using it am and pm. It is good!!!!</li>
            <li> While this serum seemed to plump up my skin in a few days, it also made e break out horribly. Left it alone, and tried it a few weeks later, after my breakut was healed. Two days of using it and I break out all over again. Definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat customer for this product. It helps my skin stay hydrated and look smooth. I combine it with a favorite moisturizer or sunscreen and use it daily.</li>
            <li> Great serum. Purchased this product to boost my collagen level. Love this serum and use it nightly under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product... I am using it with my new dermapen.  Not sure really what to expect from either product.  Time will tell</li>
            <li> I normally use another, pricier brand of face serum so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and effectiveness of this much less expensive version.  I highly recommend this product.  A+++</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my 4th time, that I reordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders. I do annual mesotherapy and all kinds of staff, but it helps me to maintain my skin during the whole year.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the some age defying cream, twice a day and feel really happy that i found such an easy way to take care of my skin (and age :-) )</li>
            <li> Very good product, easy to use . Excellent results!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I did not feel any difference in the moisture of my skin.  It has the texture of Philosophy&#x27;s When Hope Is Not Enough serum.  It sinks in weightlessly and quickly, however it did not appear to increase the efficacy of my moisturizer at all.  My skin became very dry this winter, and I was hoping that it would help a little, but there was absolutely no difference:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the hyaluronic acid by Cosmedica for one month now. I use it after dabbing on a home made 5% Vit. C serum on my face, neck and hands. It&#x27;s helped my skin become soft and firmed it up. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, it won&#x27;t get rid of deep wrinkles, but it helps moisturize without being oily. (My skin tends to be on the dry side.) I plan on continued use of this 2x a day. I still have at least 3/4 of the bottle left and I use generously!</li>
            <li> I can really tell it&#x27;s working. The lines on my face seem to be less pronounced. I use this product twice daily along with my moisturizer.love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I think this serum is great! If you&#x27;re used to a face cream, you may want to add one on top of the serum or mix it in as others have suggested. I use it all over, but it is very effective for dry spots, including facial excema! I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I can see a difference!  My laugh lines have become less noticeable!!</li>
            <li> Great price. Great quality. Most products come as a blend. I like that this is only HA.</li>
            <li> This serum soaks right into your skin without leaving a tacky residue.  I like to use it at night underneath my other lotions and potions. When I mix it with Vitamin C, it helps reduce my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it right after I was my face or after a shower.  Under makeup and sunscreen.  It makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ur avg 30 something who was about I get Botox and fillers. But I thought is try ONE more thing before. I have deep wrinkles on my forehead and my complexion really took a beating after having my daughter after 35.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve tried Clarins, u name it. Every expensive name brand at sephora and Saks and NOTHING has come close to touching these results. It actually DOES WHAT IT SAYS.&lt;br /&gt;This whole line is great. My face is dewy and I look younger. Even my 67 yr old mom has been using it. She has pre-cancerous spots on her face and this actually reduced these spots! I&#x27;m not a doctor, but I know what I&#x27;ve seen with my own eyes after about 4-6 weeks of daily use. Wash ur face, pay dry and apply. That easy. If u want to really go crazy-get a derma-roller and use this after. Speed up results. Just be careful bc u can get an infection if your face or the roller isn&#x27;t totally clean and sanitized EVERY time.&lt;br /&gt;Came fast and packaged well. Will continue to buy from Cosmedica.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is the greatest since pools in the back yard. I love it, and it makes my face feel good. I had some psoriasis on my face and after about a week of the treatments, the psoriasis left my face, I was so happy! My face is so soft to the touch. Lovely!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I just ordered my second bottle- the 8 oz. size. I am in my mid-60&#x27;s and people frequently ask what I use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is remarkably smooth, with very few wrinkles. I am a customer for life!</li>
            <li> It has the perfect weight and consistency and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It doesn&#x27;t have the best odor, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after it&#x27;s applied. The amount you need versus the size of the bottle and cost of the bottle is too good of a deal to pass up!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.. I just began using it and in combination with my other skincare regimens, I notice a brighter complexion</li>
            <li> Is very good helps me a lot with my dry skin just 3 drops is all what I need for the entire face is really good and the price is really affordable ......</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time. I just started using this product, it makes my skin feel nice. I feel it will be a good product.</li>
            <li> Love this product  I am 50 years old and I love the way it makes my skin look so beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 48YO Male.  I&#x27;ve used no facial products until now.&lt;br /&gt;After a simple facial cleanser, I apply this Serum and notice an immediate response&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer, pigment even and no longer dry from shaving&lt;br /&gt;lines under my eyes are going away&lt;br /&gt;i apply two time daily and could not be happier&lt;br /&gt;the value compared to other products on the market keep me coming back for additional purchases</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a few days, but I like the &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34; of my skin now.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product it has great reviews.  But I didn&#x27;t see much difference on my skin.  My skin is a bit dry so this product was easily absorbed since it&#x27;s not very oily.  I have used it for several months hoping it would work if I tried it for over 30 days but I didn&#x27;t see a radical change.  I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles only lighter ones, I am trying to use more natural products to delay some of the wrinkling process as much as I can :) but I was disappointed to see that this wasn&#x27;t for me.  It didn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin so that&#x27;s good, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to taking Hyalorunic acid capsules rather than using a serum.</li>
            <li> This is a great hydrating serum! I wash my face, use witchhazel as toner, then this serum and finish my nightly routine with a heavy dose of moisturizer. This leaves my skin silky smooth and gives me a dewy luminous finish. My fine lines seem to rebound back, plus my acne has become better. Great serum!</li>
            <li> Product helped with my wrinkles. I only use a drop or two and that is enough to do all over the face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed one but it&#x27;s suppose to make a difference in  your skin.  I use it every morning and evening and haven&#x27;t noticed, it&#x27;s been about three weeks...maybe later?  :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much time using the serum. So far, I like the results, although they are not as notable as with a couple of serums I used in the past (one does not last at all, and the other has since tripled its price). I will keep using it, and will update the results after that. Hopefully, it will end up amazing me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently ordered similar products made by other manufacturers (brands). All have expiry (or some date of production). This product came with none on bottle or package/box! As most people know such cosmetics from leading brands must have some date on them, to ensure that the product is still good for use. Or outdated.</li>
            <li> After I wash my face, I apply this, then the Cetaphil-clone lotion that I added Vitamin C powder to.  Research into this is excellent, and the do-it-yourself approach is cheaper, and you know what you&#x27;re  really getting.  My skn has been much softer.  Now all I need is to be 20 years younger when starting this regimen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 drops will do your face and neck, so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have hard water. I also have had a problem with oily combination skin and have had a terrible problem with breakouts. I do not know exactly what the percentage is in this stuff, but I can tell you that since using it my skin is much more moisturized WITHOUT feeling greasy. It is dewy, clearer, more balanced and my makeup goes on better now too. I have found that for me the BEST way to use it is to mix it into my favorite night time moisturizer after cleansing right before bed. I just recently switched my nighttime lotion over to Aveeno from a more expensive one that was too greasy and causing breakouts. This serum and that lotion, for me anyway, is working wonders! I use it on my hands as well and that seems to help a little bit more with this dry weather too. A little bit goes a long way. You do seem to get some skin irritation when using too much directly on your skin every night or if you use it more than once a day (if directly applied). However, the mixing it into your lotion, etc. seems to alleviate any chance of that and it does it job well after that. I would recommend this or any good H.A. serum to anyone with skin issues or who would like to ease up on some fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably been too short of a while for me to judge efficacy.  I think my face is better moisturized and I&#x27;m hoping to decrease wrinkle formation.  Can update in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my skin care clients in my business&lt;br /&gt;Excellent hydrating properties - clients leave with beautifully glowing skin</li>
            <li> It has now been three weeks of use today.  Very hydrating and is what they have advertised for this product.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the HA product. I bought to improve my skin texture and acne scars. Pores look smaller and complexion looks brighter.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a short time, but it does leave my face feeling very soft. I do use it with a moisturizer also</li>
            <li> very happy with this product.  great moisturizer.  absorbs quickly. would recommend it. works better than some of the more expensive products that iI have used.</li>
            <li> That bothers me, and makes me suspicious that this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; is mostly water (the first ingredient). When I looked under the questions for owners section, I noticed other people have asked this question...and no one knows the answer! Until the information is provided, I remain skeptical about this product. When purchasing skin products, being an informed consumer is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a while. At first I was pleased, and at least thought I was seeing results. Then I had a major breakout and stopped using it on my face, in case it triggered the breakout somehow. The jury&#x27;s still out on that question. I have had no problems using it on my neck, though I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin tone yet. I will amend and edit this review later if I experience any of the benefits promised.</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic serum made my skin soft but thats it i didnt see any plumping in the skin as it claimed on pre mature wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have had delicate, sensitive skin since forever, and I finally got fed up with this latest flare-up. It&#x27;s covering my hands and creeping up my arms. I&#x27;m scientifically trained and work at a university, so I hopped on PubMed to look at what factors influence how well skin retains moisture. One of the only products that looked like it had potential was hyaluronic acid. It&#x27;s a humectant, so it helps your skin draw moisture from the air. (Lots of my other favorite active ingredients, like dimethicone, create a barrier that prevents moisture from escaping, since your skin&#x27;s mechanisms that are supposed to keep the water inside are failing, but humectants work differently.) I got a bottle of this figuring it was only fifteen bucks if it didn&#x27;t work and if it did, great. A difference doesn&#x27;t need to be dramatic for me to appreciate it--it can be the difference between staying up all night scratching my arms and being able to sleep. I&#x27;ve gotten in the habit of rubbing a couple of drops into my hands before moisturizing after I wash my hands. (I layer it in that order because my moisturizer of choice has dimethicone and heavier ingredients like that can prevent lighter ingredients from getting to the skin.) I use it at home, and I don&#x27;t use it at work, and almost immediately I noticed that on weekends when I&#x27;m at home all day my hands start doing better than when I&#x27;m at work. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but it&#x27;s an improvement. At this point I&#x27;m contemplating getting the big bottle for home and using the smaller bottle at work. I also use it on my face, particularly on my fine lines and wrinkles; it&#x27;s definitely not causing me any break-outs and I like the way it feels on my skin. It also seems to help provide a calming balance to retinol-based creams (though I had to give those up when I got an eczema outbreak around my eyes).</li>
            <li> This is an in-depth review of this serum, which I use in my 5-Step Japanese Skincare Routine.  This is the third step in the process, with the order being:  cleanser, toner, serum, eye cream, face cream.  I have never used a serum before and was initially intimidated by the word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; and the fact that it came in a medicinal looking dropper bottle.  But so far I have really enjoyed this addition to my daily skincare routine.  Not only do I have combination skin due to my Japanese-American genetics, but I&#x27;m also allergic to everything and live in both dry, cold Colorado and hot, humid Georgia.  I&#x27;ve been hunting a whole set of products to create the ultimate skincare package.  We all have hyaluronic acid in our bodies already, but is generally taken as a supplement to help with joints.  Instead of injecting this into my knees, I&#x27;m patting it all over my face to help with dry skin.  It&#x27;s supposed to be great for people with eczema or skin problems.  I&#x27;m using it to help prevent signs of aging, and to improve my combination skin and overall skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- gentle on sensitive skin (I didn&#x27;t have a horrible reaction)&lt;br /&gt;- helps trap moisture in your skin after your clean and use a toner&lt;br /&gt;- can mix it with other nighttime serums&lt;br /&gt;- has an initially oily texture that quickly absorbs into skin in dry weather (instant moisture relief!)&lt;br /&gt;- has helped with my poor dry hands&lt;br /&gt;- evens out skin tone&lt;br /&gt;- some lightening affects (or it has relieved my skin of any existing redness?)&lt;br /&gt;- no acne or blemishes formed&lt;br /&gt;- comes in a handy glass bottle with a rubber dropper&lt;br /&gt;- no dye, just a natural clear liquid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- a bit expensive, and lasts maybe a month or so if you&#x27;re using it generously&lt;br /&gt;- takes a while to soak in (you have to keep patting your face with your palms into it absorbs)&lt;br /&gt;- a bit tacky in humidity (not to bad if you use it after a shower at night, but in mornings it might affect your makeup)&lt;br /&gt;- takes a while to see a difference, especially if you&#x27;re not applying it evenly&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t contain vitamin c, which is supposed to help you absorb/process it better&lt;br /&gt;- if you spill any, it&#x27;s a pain to clean out of clothing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love what hyaluronic acid does for my skin.  It really helps to lock in moisture and works well once you get the hang of patting it evenly into your skin.  However, it is a bit pricey, which is why I knocked it down a star.  But I will buy it again, though perhaps one that includes Vitamin C to help my skin absorb and process the acid more efficiently.  There are apparently no studies that prove hyaluronic acid works.  I see subtle differences in my skin tone, but not my pores, wrinkles, or tightness of skin.  I believe this serum could be used for everyday maintenance, aging prevention in skin, and overall brightness and clarity.  But if you&#x27;re looking to reverse skin aging, wrinkles, or loose skin then you&#x27;ll need to mix this serum in with another cream that does the trick.  Think of this as a booster to your existing skincare routine.</li>
            <li> The hyaluronic acid serum is average, at best..I was hoping the results would be better--such as making my skin softer and plumping up lines and wrinkles..If I look REALLY hard, there may be a small difference in plumping up my fine lines after using (but I could be imagining the difference)..This product does absorb quickly, which is good..But, you can&#x27;t apply too much if you&#x27;re wearing it under make up--or you will get flakiness..As far as softer skin is concerned, I still apply a moisturizer on top as well..The product is okay..I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acids that plump up my wrinkles better and make my skin softer (Perlabella Hyaluronic Acid Pure Dose).</li>
            <li> i am tired of spending mega bucks on facial creams that DO NOT work.  i went to my doctor, got a script for generic retin a and now i only use the retin a (one tube has lasted me since the middle of january and i still have some in the tube on march 31) and this hyaluronic acid.  my skin has never looked smoother and softer!  and i am saving hundreds of dollars a MONTH!!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very very dry and with the serum I notice the difference just from the first time I applied it.</li>
            <li> About a week into using this product, I really appreciate its affordable price and truly beneficial results... I am glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> This serum has really made a difference in how my face feels and looks. It seems to have done a little plumping in a couple of weeks using it twice daily and evened out the facial tone. I love it and will be purchasing it repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I would not have believed that a product like this would work, to my surprise it does and I will only order this product its does what it says ............</li>
            <li> product seems okay so far. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet  but sure hope to in the many days to come</li>
            <li> My pores instantly shrink after using this, your skin looks so fresh! I love it</li>
            <li> Very smooth to my face!  I use it morning and night.  I get many compliments, even from my asthetician and daughter!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love Hyaluronic serum, particularly after a peel.  The best way to protect your skin. Makes it smooth and silky.  Good makeup base.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Would prefer this in a pump. It seems I was always knocking over the bottle.</li>
            <li> A really nice serum. Goes on smoothly and have noticed improvement after a week of use.  C. Jones Pattonsburg, MO</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t not work, but seems like more water than hyaluronic acid serum...... Just sayin, have had other brands that didn&#x27;t seem so watery.</li>
            <li> I liked how thr product went on smioth and drued fast. Since ive been us it for thr past 2 1/2 weeks my face is very dry and flacky. Ive been using a moisturizer as well and not helping. It may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and have been looking for something a little extra to help moisturize around the yes and thought that this was perhaps the solution.  This makes my skin feel baby soft.  I even decided to try it on my poor, winter cracked hands in addition to my lotion and WOW!  Softer than the summer in a humid climate. :-)</li>
            <li> I am using this in combination with collagen and have noticed a decrease in fine lines.  I have also recently switched to a satin pillow.  I am going to keep buying this product, it is priced reasonably and works great!</li>
            <li> I dont know how i feel about this product. It&#x27;s cheap, only $14, but the review/ rave makes me expect much more from this product. I honestly dont feel the difference. Maybe I&#x27;m still young so the effect is not that visible (my skin has been very great). Still, I dont think it works that well for me. but it&#x27;s not horrible either, dont make me break out/ irritated.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My skin is so smooth and my wrinkles have greatly improved.  Of course, they are still there, but they are less noticeable.  If you purchase this, make sure you wet your face first and then apply the product.  I watched several beauty reviews on this product and only saw one or two that recommended wetting your face beforehand.  Without using water first, my skin got dry from using this product.  The water was the secret!  HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best-Selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin--...has lessened the lines in my face and I am very pleased with it.  I had lost a lot of moisture in my skin over the winter and this product has really helped.</li>
            <li> So far so good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  Very light and soaks in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M A 55 YEAR OLD WOMEN AND YOU CAN&#x27;T TELL BY MY SKIN. LOVE! LOVE THIS PRODUCT WOULDN&#x27;T START MY DAY WITHOUT IT... MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS SMOOTHER.</li>
            <li> I add this to my daily sunscreen to make it more pliable. This definitely helps to moisturize. A good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> I use this after a derma-roll and it soooothes my red skin then top off with vitamin C - highly recommend</li>
            <li> Thsi product has definitely decreased the lines around my mouth and my chin. I especially like the thickness of the serum.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now and find it amazing for tightening your skin and reducing the appearance of fine wrinkles.  It really does work and I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  I always make sure I order more when I see that I&#x27;m close to running out.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum a couple of weeks ago, and was very excited to use it. Unfortunately my face became very dry and i end up at my dermatologist with a bad case of inflamation on my skin. I stayed home for a week due to the fact that this product made my face extremely red, itchy and very painful, basically my skin was raw and very rough to the touch, almost like sand paper. I was just sad everytime i looked at my skin, i have taken very good care of my skin since i can remember and used very good products, i have just made a major mistake ordering this product. I was put on oral medications as well as a cream to repair my damaged skin. Im doing much better now, but just beware of any skin reactions. I rather spend more and get a good known brand or ask your dermatologist.</li>
            <li> The price on this was best but the actual absorption was hardly noticeable like the smaller one by another company. I ended up not using it. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week and I can honestly say it has diminished all my lines on my forehead, and my skin is baby soft . It does slightly dry out your skin, so make sure you are using it with Moisturizer as well. but I am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> This really helps with fine lines around eyes, above lips &amp; on neck. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The best. Use with Vitamin C. Great results. Will use forever.</li>
            <li> Love  this stuff!  Can see almost- instant results--my skin looks a lot smoother, younger after just a week or so of use.  Also like the fact that it dries quickly--I have another similar product I&#x27;m trying that is more of a gel, but it takes longer to dry and ends up kind of sticky.  This is ever so much better.</li>
            <li> I first ordered a C serum from a different brand, -less product and a little more expensive-, but I totally saw the results! I decided on this one because is cheaper and has more product, however after more than two months of using it twice daily I haven&#x27;t seen the same results I was starting to see with the other brand. I agree that  a little goes a long way, but I guess at the end you get what you pay for. As for me, I will order from the same brand i did before.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician complimented me on my skin tone, and I let her know I was using this product. It&#x27;s doing its job, and I just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully hydrating product and great value for the money!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product! It moisturizes very well under face cream, and I feel like it PLUMPS up my cheeks too! At a great price point, I will be purchasing again.  Way better than injections!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic serum has made a difference in the appearance of my face and neck. It feels refreshing when it is applied and the skin has an overall appearance of smoothness.. When worn under make-up it provides a strong base for the makeup and the overall appearance of my face looks younger and healthier. I would recommend this product and I will purchase more. It does take a couple of weeks to really see the difference it makes so be patient. The results will be very evident soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good except it seems to leave my face a bit sticky. I have nothing else left to say, ok</li>
            <li> I am 55 and always looking for something to help my skin stay as nice as it can. This is a great serum and my face looks brighter and healthier using it. I am very happy with it and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> The moistureness goes away to fast, also the smell is not good.</li>
            <li> I really like the product ,it is the best selling Hyaluronic Serum ,delivering and everything was great I will order again&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Monika Ackley</li>
            <li> did not find that it worked as well as it said it should. I was disappointed, sometimes I wish that if you buy something, what they say in the add should be true.</li>
            <li> i love this skin product it makes my skin so soft and young looking,and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and works well. Would of liked to have a lotion added as well. Non greasy</li>
            <li> This product stopped dry, flaky skin, brightened complexion and gave me a slight glow. I use it under my moisturizer.  I&#x27;m very pleased.  I&#x27;m 65.</li>
            <li> This hydrates my face and any place that I put it on! It feels so hydrated and plump, cool, and soft to touch. It makes me glow too even on tired days. It has a very faint smell that I don&#x27;t like when putting it on but it goes away very quickly. Also, you don&#x27;t need to put a lot on, a little goes a long way. I don&#x27;t know yet about the reviews saying it&#x27;s helped with discoloration. I haven&#x27;t seen anything major....but it has help me with minimizing my oily skin. I use this as a &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; after I washed and used toner on my face. I&#x27;m glad this is a good product and does what it says.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to use this product, because the packaging was smashed, and the product was leaking.  I was afraid of contamination&lt;br /&gt;so I destroyed this.  I would like to try this again. Mary Ann Long; 2160 Snow Hill Road; Chuluota, FL 32766.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would work better than it does.  I expected moisturization but it seemed to be subtle if at all.  Just my opinion.</li>
            <li> Worst serum I&#x27;ve ever used.. After using it for 2 months my skin became extremely dry. This serum also made my wrinkles more prominent.. Would never recommend this product to anyone.. Sheer wastage of money!!</li>
            <li> I see an improvement in skin texture after a week of using this product along with my regular DHC night cream. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to supplement my regular facial moisturizer and used it specifically during the winter which was particularly brutal.  I&#x27;ve also used it now that its warm.  It gives my face a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid serum Is an excellent product. I did a lot of search before I chose to purchase it. So far I have used it for over two months and I am very happy with the results. Some previous obvious wrinkles were noticeably reduced. It had  more effect on the lower cheek area. I recommend it to my sister and to a professional skin care person. Both they have been use it for more than a month and are very happy with the results. What I really liked about this product is the fact that does not contain but one good chemical, which is very rare in most skin products.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great with proactive just the cleaner</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle of this hyaluronic acid serum and did not notice that much improvement in my skin. It is quickly to absorb and is not sticky, but I didn&#x27;t see the results I was expecting. Thanks</li>
            <li> The product is quite good. However, the packaging is really cheap. When I got the package at home, the box (not the shipping box, I&#x27;m talking about the box you see in the picture) fell down on the floor and the bottle broke into thousand pieces...</li>
            <li> Best and purest Hyaluronic acid!!!! I had recently bought and used the whole bottle of Pure Body Naturals Hyaluronic acid and it doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare.  This is the only brand on Amazon I have found that doesn&#x27;t have inexpensive fillers like Aloe Vera, vitamins C or D.  This product  absorbs better than any other competitor, almost instantly, where as the other brands I tried with fillers just sat on my skin for at least a minute before I could apply my moisturizer.  I will be this brand/ product again and again, I am sold on their quality of product.  Quick shipping with prime as well!</li>
            <li> I use this after I &amp;#34;needle&amp;#34; my face and so far I have seen a definite improvement in my skin and wrinkles.  I would give 5 stars but I&#x27;ve only used it four times.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any differences since I started using this product. I even use it with a derma roller and my face has not shown any results. I&#x27;m hoping it will soon and I can update this review.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and fresh. I use it at night, then apply a light moisturizer, the next morning my face and neck are soft and glowing. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My second bottle I ordered had a bad odor. I emailed the supplier, they responded the next day, apologized and investigating this issue,  I got the replacement in the next few days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product itself. I have read on google search to apply it on a damp/wet skin and let it dry. I tried it and I like it better.</li>
            <li> This serum seem to gets in the skin super fast, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and tightens up the face a bit. It tightens, more than it plumps, like with other serums. Haven&#x27;t noticed any change in skin texture yet - which may be for the best, at least it doesn&#x27;t make me break out or other bad stuff. I don&#x27;t think it could fast improve on any lines, fine or otherwise either, but what it does is providing and keeping locked in a layer of moisture that the skin needs.&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it does its job, without any miracles - which I didn&#x27;t expect anyway. I&#x27;m not like &amp;#34;in love&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;OMG&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a good product for the money. I was able to receive this product for free in order to give the company my hoenst review of the serum</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have definitely noticed my skin has evened out and generally looks healthier. I am always a bit skeptical when I receive a product to try for review but this turned out surprisingly well. My mother works in skin care and is always on my case, but she definitely saw improvements after I had been using this serum</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any changes besides helping with an oily face.</li>
            <li> I use this product for three weeks. Not bad.</li>
            <li> My skin did not show the hydration that I was hoping for.  Any hydration did not last through the day.</li>
            <li> Very good results front he beginning</li>
            <li> I bought this serum because this product advertised that: \\&quot;Heal dryness on face with intense hydration\\&quot;. The truth is, after I gently rubbed the liquid-like serum on my face, the serum quickly dried out from my skin (not sure if it was absorbed into my skin or simply vaporized), and left my skin even drier, like it has pulled all moisture out of my skin.  I have to apply other facial cream or other oil-based serum on my face to relieve the dryness and discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the terrible and confusing experience, I read the label on the bottle, and here is what it says: \\&quot; Warning: Allergic reaction, including: swelling, redness, itch or excessive dryness occurs\\&quot;.  So I did a quick research on the internet to find out what on earth is \\&quot;hyaluronic acid\\&quot;.  Apparently, this product is not a miracle for everyone: instead of feeling moisturized and hydrated, some people feel the total opposite.  Many sources on the internet, as well as the product label, recommend to apply another layer of facial cream or moisturizer following application of the hyaluronic serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, I guess this serum is really not for me and I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (1/2/14): unfortunately, this company cannot accept the fact this product is not for everyone.  So right after I posted my review on Amazon, I got bad rantings already. The truth is - I think the hyaluronic acid serum hurt my skin.  And it says so on their warning label (see above).  If I have known this already, I would not have purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any change after i used it, I used it after wash off the face, and I was expecting my skin should be turned very smooth, but I don&#x27;t see any change, I don&#x27;t see the face turn bright... may I return it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Hyaluronic Acid for a few weeks and my skin is starting to look and feel better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for the perfect moisturizer for the face, which would at the same time did not make my skin terribly oily and shiny. And I found it. :-))) After applying this serum skin on the face is incredibly soft, it even wants to touch. There is not the slightest greasy, and thus the skin perfectly hydrated. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for three weeks and I can say that I smoothed my only wrinkle on his forehead, I have gone rashes on the face, my pores are very clean and have decreased in size. I&#x27;m going to try all cosmetic products from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I have oil, acne prone skin, but found a routine that seems to work for me. When I get out of the shower in the morning, I&#x27;ll pat my face dry and right away applying the serum to my skin and let it dry. Because of the dry outside air, I&#x27;ve been using a little bit of natural moisturizer (earth science brand). Overall I noticed my breakouts have diminished greatly, less oiliness and softer appearance of the skin, so I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered fast and feels great. I&#x27;m 44 and my skin already feels tighter and smoother. I would recommend a good moisturizer to go with it however. I have been using it for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My skin has been dry because of the winter and this helped.  Even my husband noticed that my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product freezing solid would affect it, but I have not noticed any change.  Combining with a nightly moisturizer, and still nothing.  When it did thaw out, the consistency was like water.</li>
            <li> This product is great. My skin becomes more hydrated and healthy. With the big size and affordable price, I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I have very sensitive skin and was skeptical about trying this. This serum leaves your skin smooth &amp; tight!!! I am a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> Really works.  Generous size and reasonable price.  I ordered a similar product before and paid twice as much for half the amount.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than three years, and I have been very satisfied with its overall quality.  My face is smoother and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I like the way this serum goes on, it dries fast and leaves no greasy residue.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a good hyaluronic serum.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic acid is one of the very best things I do for my skin!  It really is for sensitive skin, reduces pore size, decreases wrinkles, and gives my skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Hydrates and goes on smooth.  I use it in the morning and night. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have used it now for about a week.  I try to use it &amp;#34;every-other-day&amp;#34; since this is intense and I have sensitive skin.  I am noticing that I need less lotion to keep my skin (arms) moist.  I am using it in combination with my higher end lotions and cremes.  As I said, &amp;#34;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not too sure about what, exactly, this product is supposed to do, but it seems to do nothing for me.  It doesn&#x27;t moisturize, firm, clear or reduce pores.  Hyaluronic acid is a key ingredient in most skincare products and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it might just be there to provide &amp;#34;slip.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t see that it has shown any kind of improvement to my skin. Sorry, I really wanted it to do something.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the product. It was sealed in plastic, inside the box, and the box was also covered in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;That made me feel safe. I know the product is clean and not damaged. I have been applying it to my face daily. I also used it to soften the tough skin on my husbands feet. We did just one foot first. I t was like magic. Now his feet are much better. It does not burn, it makes skin like silk. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for moisture. a+++++</li>
            <li> Very good and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product a week ago.  Not every day but maybe every other day.  I like it a lot, I am a licensed esthetitian and I find this to be very satisfactory and on top of which you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I recommend this product for skin care specialists and clientele that utilize good products.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  Works great on reducing eye fatigue from those late nights ...staying out late and drinking all night.</li>
            <li> I use this pre A.M. &amp; P.M. moisture &amp; sunscreen rituals.  Hyaluronic  acid is known to increase water retention capacity of the skin.  This is reasonably priced and my 2nd order.</li>
            <li> By the time you finish this bottle, your skin is looking much younger and healthier!  I can see on my skin!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It doesn&#x27;t take much, goes on smoothly &amp; dries quickly. I use it under makeup during the the day &amp; under my night cream at night. I am older but still have oily skin. It&#x27;s been hard for me to find a product that softens age lines &amp; wrinkles but doesn&#x27;t make my skin more oily. This is it! If you have dry skin you would use it under whatever cream works best for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands of Hyaluronic Acid Serum and am quite pleased with Cosmedica&#x27;s offering.  It was packaged in a dark glass bottle to ensure freshness, is reasonably priced and provides intense hydration as advertised.  Will be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT Product!!  Must have!!</li>
            <li> This hyaluronic acid serum seems to work just as well as some of the more pricey ones on Amazon. Plus, I like that it comes in a larger size. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I love the fact its not oily at all. however I don&#x27;t see visible skin difference. but still can b used with a moisturiser and excellen for oily skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now. In conjunction with my moisturizing regimen, it seems to be making a significant difference. I saw a dramatic reduction in fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead I did not see with different moisturizers, and with my eye cream alone. Definitely buying again!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a week, but it goes on nicely and is not greasy.  I do think you could use it without moisturizer, or I seem to be able to, even though I have aging skin.  I cannot tell that it has made any difference in the way my skin looks, but perhaps it is too early to tell.  It comes out like a loose gel and warms in your had and goes on more like a liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for over 60 days.  I used it many times but couldn&#x27;t understand why it was so drying.&lt;br /&gt;I love Google.  Just because its Hyaluronic Acid does not mean it is automatically good for your skin.  It can be drying.&lt;br /&gt;I was not pleased at all with this product.  Do not believe that it will automatically hydrate.  This information was new to&lt;br /&gt;me and I wish I had known before hand so I could have returned it.  Toss and learn!</li>
            <li> One of the only products I use on my skin.  Never feels greasy or thick.  Would highly recommend to any person wanting a simple yet effective facial routine.</li>
            <li> This serum really helps to aid in my dry skin treatment.  It arrived exactly when you said it would, and I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too early for me to tell you whether this product has made a profound difference in the appearance of my skin. If I see an improvement, I&#x27;ll report back. What I can tell you is that my skin isn&#x27;t any worse! The information that came with this product said it could be mixed with other things, so after using it for a few days to be sure I wasn&#x27;t going to magically develop an allergic reaction (which has happened many times with other things in years past), I mixed several droppers-full of this product into both my day and night creams, so I&#x27;m not layering on products that are just going to mix together on my face, anyway. The result is that both of those products are much lighter, which I really like. My skin seems to be well-hydrated, so far, but I&#x27;ve not been mistaken for a teenager or carded in a bar. As I said, if I see anything remarkable, I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but have heard that it can really help&lt;br /&gt;your skin.  I think it helps hold moisture in and therefore wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product. What a huge disappointment.  I used it for a week and my skin feels so dry that it hurts. I used it under my eyes and that was a huge mistake. That is where the skin irritation is the worst. I used a really good eye cream and moisturizer with it that usually work great for me but not even they can help me now. The skin around my eyes burns and is red and irritated. After this experience I researched hylauronic acid on google. Many sites stated that the hylauronic acid molecule is actually too large to actually penetrate and work in skincare products. It is supposed to be better to injest it for optimal results. Obviously do not injest hylauronic acid designed for skin care! I am disappointed that I wasted my money on this product but I am angry that it hurt my face and eyes so badly. I have to cancel a date tonight because I can&#x27;t wear make up and my eyes ard so irritated that I am blinking like crazy. Dont waste your money. Get a good vitamin c serum or cream. They feel great on your skin and actually work.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and seems to be doing the job. I use it after derma rolling to get the most out of it. My skin is already looking better.</li>
            <li> The price was great but the product was fantastic.  Application is great.  I would purchase this agian when Im finsished with this bottle</li>
            <li> I use this after a session with Dermalogi and my skin feels so soft afterwards. My only regret is that I should have gotten more.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m 57 and spent many of those years being mean to my face.  I have sun damage, large pores and dull skin.  I have seen, yes seen, an improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture and appearance after only 2 weeks.  I am very pleased with this product so far and I look forward to continued good results.  The very reasonable price is just a bonus!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of them. So far so good, too early to tell in terms of results but shipping was fast and it was a great deal :)!</li>
            <li> The product was as described by seller, arrived very on time, very good product and I highly recommend it. I use this product w vitamin c serum and derma roller which work great. Don&#x27;t waste your time in expensive product. This bargain product is just amazing.</li>
            <li> I love it , hydrate , smooth , from the first use you &#x27;ll feel good .&lt;br /&gt;i use it with derma roller</li>
            <li> this product was amazing for my oily skin, it look so mush better now and younger, I feel my skin softer and shiny.but the only problem is that Im from Chile, south America and i have some delivery dificoulties to get this product.please send it to my country .I would pay even more if you want, but let me get it becouse in my country is impossible.thank you and Buy it becouse is great¬°¬°¬° :)</li>
            <li> I believe one of the reviews compared this to water.  I agree.  After weeks of diligent twice a day use, I see zero difference in my skin.  I have tried it alone and under moisturizer and still no improvement.  The first ingredient in this bottle is distilled water, and I think that the hyaluronic acid is so diluted that it&#x27;s nearly non-existent.  Save your money and do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> Very nice  non-greasy feel. I use it in place of a moisturizer under makeup, Large bottle at great price.</li>
            <li> its a nice acid but it is a bit watery ... and it has a dropper and I prefer the pump.</li>
            <li> After using this for a while, I have noticed a big differnce in my skin.  It is glowing,  and tighter.  I have recommended this product to friends with the same result.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years. It plumps up my skin and truly makes as big difference. A wonderful  product! I highly recommend this serum. Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a must for beautiful skin.....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Cosmedica Skincare they have great services, their products are great.</li>
            <li> very good.  absorb quick into skin and help the dry skin a lot.</li>
            <li> It feels rather like a light Aloe Vera gel that dries nice and firm. I enjoy putting it on though after two months have seen no difference to my skin at all so won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I use it under my moisturizer and makeup during the day and under Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle deep wrinkle serum (Retinol SA) at night.  It has definitely helped my 56 year old skin - people think I&#x27;m 40!  It does work best if you apply it to clean skin first, wait until it absorbs and then add moisturizer.  It does make your skin seem tight when you apply it but that&#x27;s where using moisturizer comes in.  The combination of the two really helps me keep my skin looking great.  I am a beauty product junkie (in all price categories) and for the money this is a great product.  I&#x27;ve tried other hyaluronic acid products and always come back to this one.  I gave this serum as a Christmas gift to my sisters and friends last year and everyone was impressed.  This is a beauty staple for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any amazing results, but it is not oily and you get a lot for the price.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely softer looking than it was before.  Using Vitamin C Serum in the morning and this at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks morning and night&#x27; I am a African American with oily skin and what I love about the product is that it is not oily and it help control the oil on my face I have not experience the other affects it suppose to have&amp;#34; however I will continue to use and  find out.</li>
            <li> The serum came in only two days! I was really surprised that it came so quickly! I&#x27;m excited to try this product since I have heard that hyaluronic  acid is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews for any product I buy online but for the first time I actually have to say this is amazing. I think that people are so use to fake items that they are simply cautious in buying any item because I have gone through this but my boyfriend even noticed my change. He even calls me beautiful out of no where.., kind of creepy but I love it. I use product 3 times a week every night and I use just the right amount so my face is not too oily but meets the right amount needed for my skin pores. All I know is that, you have to try to see the difference! Amazing product, definite recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve notice this serum works best if I also take dr oz recommended phytoceramides ( search for PK Supplements Phytoceramides to find the ones I use).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them both for the best results!</li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S ALL YOU NEED TO FIGHT THE AGING PROCESS. I USE EVERY MORNING AND NIGHT. DON&#x27;T SPEND YOUR MONEY IN EXPENSIVE CREAMS. I FIRST APPLY THE VITAMIN C THEN I USE THE ACAI BERRY OIL, ALSO PURCHASED ON AMAZON FOR AT ABOUT $15. GREAT COMBINATION BECAUSE BOTH PRODUCTS FIGHT THE AGING PROCESS.</li>
            <li> My skin is somewhat plumper, softer and smooth. However, this does not have a moisturizing affect. I use a moisturizer following the serum. It is gentle, and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I rely so much on a product&#x27;s rating before I decide to buy . I did not regret buying this one because I immediately noticed a big difference from one application. I have oily skin and have a tendency to break out but it has not cause any spots. My skin looked luminous and smooth. I will definitely buy one again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to find this product. It is perfect for the aging problems. After the treatment my skin looks exactly as if I would just visit the cosmetologist. My Son uses it for his acne. Works great both ways.</li>
            <li> Applied 2 times daily for a month. Very little diminishing of my dark spots. Still hopeful and plan on using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> Great - - and great price; delivery was very prompt.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> The best Hyaluronic acid ever! I&#x27;ve tried over 30 different types!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I&#x27;m getting . I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now &amp; my skin looks &amp; feels much better after using it along with my other skin care products . I would definitely recommend it to others &amp; will purchase it again</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this. My number 1 beauty product.  Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Did not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years and I like the results so I will continue using it. It does help with  wrinkles around my eyes and goes on easily. I like this product a lot!</li>
            <li> this is really amazing serum for the skin would recomend it</li>
            <li> I have tried other serums and find this one very drying to my skin.  I&#x27;v used other brands with the same ingredient and not had this problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this three stars because the only difference I&#x27;ve seen is my skin is softer. Aside from that, I&#x27;ve seen absolutely no difference. I use it on my stomach after Derma rolling, it&#x27;s no different if I don&#x27;t use it, and I use it just on my face.  It does make it work better if you spray a light mist of water on AFTER applying the serum, or just wet your hands, shake the excess water, and rub on the skin that you applied the serum to.</li>
            <li> I did see some improvement in wrinkles under my eyes and frown lines.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended along with another purchase I was making and I thought I would try it since I have tried facial peels. Most of the reviews were positive and as someone who is in her 50&#x27;s, I was interested in trying different products to keep my skin looking healthy. I use this product along with my other facial products and while I don&#x27;t expect to see immediate results I hope that the hyaluronic acid serum will help improve the appearance of my skin. My skin feels smoother and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This time its thick does make skin soft</li>
            <li> Been using for 3 weeks nothing noticeable in fine line reduction, puffiness or dark spots area. There is not even a tinge from the HA serum when applied.  Reading reivews I was expecting it to be better.  Other more espensive products reveal results quite quickly.  For the price of this product my skin is soft and I will continue to use it. The 100% pure-highest quality apparently means what they could get and make for the money.  May try another product before reordering for comparison.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and having not used anything like this in a while, expected more pronounced results.  My skin does appear to be a little smoother, and maybe a little more even toned, but no one has noticed any difference, and usually when a product is working well, I get comments.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Has helped my dry skin, and helps other products absorb more thoroughly and more quickly.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and my skin is very soft! I have noticed a glow to my skin and some evening of my skin tone. It did not make me break out with acne or a rash which is VERY GOOD! I don&#x27;t notice a difference in helping with my wrinkles tho :( Overall this is a product worth having to boost hydration! I will continue to use the bottle til gone &amp; will definitely be ordering some more!</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim...looking for a skin treatment that might relieve the psoriasis on the top of my foot.  This, combined with a Vitamin C moisturizing cream, has greatly improved my plaque psoriasis.  The redness and flaky skin has turned to smooth &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; skin after 3 months of morning and nighttime application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this keeps working, as it is now, in another 3 months...I might get back to normal!  Today, I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
            <li> it has a funny consistency, but once you apply it and it dries, you wont even know you have it on. I have oily skin, and use this instead of moisturizer and it works very well</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the stated purity of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other lotions and creams containing hyaluronic acid and,&lt;br /&gt;although they contained other ingredients that I&#x27;d rather not use,&lt;br /&gt;at least it appeared that they were doing SOMETHING to my skin...&lt;br /&gt;softer, smoother, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with an eyedropper and has the consistency of water.&lt;br /&gt;It just drips off your face and dries just like water. I have to&lt;br /&gt;question how much hyaluronic acid is actually in the bottle because&lt;br /&gt;distilled water is listed as the first ingredient with hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;second. True, it contains nothing else. But, it also does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;According to the directions, you still need to use a moisturizer after&lt;br /&gt;applying and trust me, you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I often wake up with puffy eyes but since I started putting a few drops around my eyes before bedtime I wake up looking refreshed. Awesome stuff and so light, yet nourishing. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product. Given that I am nearing 40, my skin is beginning to dry and fine lines are starting to show(though I have a young look and have been able to pass for mid-late 20&#x27;s for many years now). I wanted something that could help to &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; up my skin, especially near the eyes. Thankfully, I have never had bags under my eyes, but I have always struggled with the dark circles along with the dreaded &amp;#34;sunken&amp;#34; problem. Lately, I would have people asking if I was sick or overly tired. Hyaluronic Acid has definitely helped with some of those issues. It leaves my skin well hydrated as well as helping to keep the lines at bay. I would recommend this to others, esp. those who over 35 and are starting to experience more dryness in their skin. Although it helps, it is not a cure as we all will age, but this does help to slow things down a bit. Exercise, a healthy diet, and PLENTY of WATER are a must when trying to maintain your skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Feels great, Not greasy. Still not sure if I notice a difference, but I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had enough time to see any real results but i&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle.  Does a number on fine lines.  I&#x27;ve been very pleased.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Hyaluronic Acid and I&#x27;m very impressed! It helps me with dark spots, fine lines and gives an overall healthy glow to my skin! Will keep buying more..</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of days I could see a difference. I have been using this product for two weeks or so now and my face looks more youthful, however it didn&#x27;t do much for the circles under my eyes. I was using the product in the morning and in the night and it started to dry out my face, so I&#x27;m only using it in the morning now. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> I tried to find out where the lab is located that makes this stuff and was unable to do so.  After a couple f months my wife says she notices no difference.  I really wonder whether this even is what it says it is.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Really firms skin! Little wrinkles disappear! Great price! Try it ..you will not regret it  Have a good day!</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a wonderful moisturizer and hydration system for your skin, especially the lines.  It is non-greasy and plumps out the skin to make lines mostly invisible.  I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, noticed a change in just a few days....have already ordered 2 more, one for my daughter and one for a friend.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  I am 65 years old, have been using the product for about 10 days with great results.  I use it in combination with ROC Retinol Correction Deep Wrinkle Night Cream.  The products are very inexpensive and do a great job for me.</li>
            <li> I am hearing this from my friend&#x27;s strong recommendation. I have oil skin and pretty sensitive, but it just works perfectly for my skin without any uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> I am using this product for some years, I love it, works very good, I am 56 and I dont look like my age, I recommend this product</li>
            <li> seems to be a good product</li>
            <li> This a really good HA compared to the other highly reviewed ones on amazon. It has the most HA content that I have seen in other products. Absorbs well and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!! I like to say that I use this for wrinkles but ever since I have been using this I haven&#x27;t had one pimple on my face. I use it twice a day and load it on. After application drys I use a moisturizer. Skin tone has improved and everyone notices!! Think it helps with preventing wrinkles and helps fine lines for sure.  ORDERED other products and they are NOT AS GOOD TRUST ME!!! Others made my skin flake and turn red and don&#x27;t have that tightening feel this one gives you. Only buy this one!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no results. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I have fair skin very dry, this helps hydrate my face.... I will buy again</li>
            <li> This makes me feel drier because the ingredients contain &amp;#34; Benzyl Alcohol &amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> nice serum for the money</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a product that would moisturize my dry skin. This isn&#x27;t it. It goes on a little greasy, but the moment it&#x27;s absorbed, my skin is noticeably still dry.</li>
            <li> Hydrated my skin just like it said. My fine lines have mostly disappeared around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I used the entire a bottle and never saw any difference. I only have a few fine lines, no wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Could see a difference straight away.  Non irritating and absorbers immediately.</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old, and used to be a sun worshiper...After using this product faithfully for the last two months, I can see and feel a huge difference in my complexion. My skin is smooth and tight. I use it morning and night. I love it, and I love that it comes in a 2 ounce bottle instead of just one.</li>
            <li> Hydrates and dries quickly. The smell isnt great but it goes away quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying a microneedling facial.  It hydrated my face rather quickly and helped to end the peeling one gets after the procedure.  The serum is a little thin compared to another serum I purchased previously, but it seemed to work just as well.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product, but the bottle has the smell of a medicine!</li>
            <li> Great facial serum!  I mix this with a Retinol product and you would never know that I am 55 :-0 And a sun worshiper at that.  This product is saving my skin&#x27;s life!  Thank you!  :-0</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two weeks now and I love it.  Already notice my skin looking so much better.  It just looks healthier.  You only&lt;br /&gt;need a little bit and it never feels oily or greasy.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results as I continue to use it.  Lines on my forehead are&lt;br /&gt;not as defined as they used to be that&#x27;s for sure!  So I know it&#x27;s working!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Good company. This is my second bottle.....</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work!  If you look at alot of the reviews past the first page they are 3 words or a little more, so I suspect something is going on.  I won&#x27;t buy this brand ever again.  If I ever get hyaluronic again it will be the silver packages from China and hope my face doesn&#x27;t fall off....LOL!  But this brand is a rip-off!</li>
            <li> This product is spectacular!! Delivery was very quick. It tightens the skin and evens out the tones. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Smells bad didnt do anything for my face to be honest.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, big pores. Did nothing for me, I&#x27;d rather purchase Witch hazel waters, it keep moisture and refine the pore much better then this product.</li>
            <li> I do like this product and I think it goes a long way towards helping how my face looks.  My only complaint is that it is drying.  I have tried using it a few different ways, but my skin still is dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin with acne and currently I am on Retin-A. As a result of Retin-A my skin sheds at a higher frequency than I have ever experienced and I have been desperate to find a product that alleviates this without making my skin break out. This product has been my saving grace. Since starting to use it two weeks ago my skin no longer looks horribly dry, it hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, and it looks as if my acne scars are lightening. While it is hydrating I also have noticed that the  oiliness I experience in my T-zone has also lessened which has made my make up stay on longer during the day. I could not be more pleased with this product and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Used up the entire bottle and never saw the slightest improvement in my skin! HELP! Is there anything out there that really works?????</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for 2 weeks and it has done amazing things. I HAD  combination skin that would get so incredibly oily yet I would have dry spots.. until I found this product. Now I&#x27;m not constantly worried about my face being oily, it use to be a huge insecurity but I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I had some redness around my nose and that has improved greatly. I spend a lot of time reading/ on the computer and would always end up touching my face or chin and would get pimples. That has nearly all gone away too. It leaves my face incredibly soft and my skin looks even in tone and texture. I&#x27;m truly shocked by what 2 weeks has done for me. I&#x27;m am a lifetime user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use it is right after a hot shower while my face is still moist from the steam i apply the product. I apply 3-4 drops all over my face neck and upper chest. It&#x27;s surprising how much you get from a few drops. Especially fresh and still a little damp out of the shower (best time for application). It drys instantly and is odorless. Then I apply my oily of Olay then makeup. I usually apply it again at night after washing my face before bed. I am really addicted. By the looks of the bottle (bought the 2oz) it will last me at least a few months even using it twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this and will be buying it as stocking stuffer for my mom and mother in law. :)</li>
            <li> Great product, my wife loves it</li>
            <li> I am 52, and have had a terrible time with facial dry skin. Especially in the winter months, the skin on my nose and the apples of my cheeks actually peels as if I have sunburn. No moisturizer works. I could not even wear BB creams, because after a while the skin would peel up, taking the creams with it, and I looked like I was wearing a Halloween mask. I watch Dr Oz, and he recommended this for dry skin. A few drops, smooth over your entire face right after washing, then follow with your moisturizer [I use Cera Ve, the green bottle [for regular to oily skin] to wash, and Cera Ve, the blue label, moisturizer] I AM ASTOUNDED by how well this stuff worked. I am not wearing ANY makeup, this morning my husband noticed [!!!] that my skin looked really good, and it wasn&#x27;t peeling anymore. The serum is not greasy, is rapidly absorbed, and has no fragrance. I cannot tell you how much happiness I am getting out of this little bottle :-) I have been using it for a month now, and will definitely continue to do so. I can&#x27;t speak to the anti wrinkle or uffy eye thing, but this stuff is magic in a bottle for ultra dry skin. Hubby has very dry skin on his ankles, around the sock line, I will start him using this tonight.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling beautifully smooth and soft.  I can already see reduction in fine lines and deeper wrinkles.  Nice formulation, not greasy, absorbs &amp; dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It seems watery to be a serum. I&#x27;m almost through the entire bottle and haven&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin. Not a repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love reading reviews on Amazon. I purchase almost everything based on reviews and it has yet to let me down. This might be the best product I have ever recieved based on reviews. I am in my late 20&#x27;s but have been keeping good care of my skin, well trying too! I have noticed some wrinkles here and there that have been bothering me, especially on my forehead and neck. I have been using this day and night for 2 weeks and they are literally all gone. I know they might not be as tough to get rid of for older skin but I am absolutely amazed. I decided to put some on my hands now as well. I cant wait to continue using it and see what else it does!</li>
            <li> I only recently started to use the Hyaluronic Acid, so results are pending. The packaging is lovely, I love a simple design and the dropper works well will the product. It arrived very quickly and was protected against any damage that might occur in shipping. The serum is fast-absorbing and there is no aroma. I would recommend pairing with a high quality moisturizer (as recommended) it does tend to dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Feels great!!! It leaves my skin looking brighter and feeling way more moisturized. I can see a big difference in fine lines.</li>
            <li> this product does everything it says it will do. My skin looks brighter softer and has l softend the lines around my eyes and mouth.I would definitely recommend this item and I plan on ordering as soon as I am done thank you for introducing me to this item</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks on using the product, my skin is softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> The good&lt;br /&gt;-The serum helps my moisturizers absorb into my skin much better.&lt;br /&gt;-it helps my physical sunblock stay on my skin. If you use a sunscreen with zinc oxide, you know how it can leave your face looking very white. This doesn&#x27;t make it disappear completely, but it does make it less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;-Sensitive skins will love the lack of fragrance and fillers.&lt;br /&gt;-It balances the skin. I haven&#x27;t really had a breakout since using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neutral&lt;br /&gt;-My skin looks much better since using the serum. My fine lines are slowly disappearing. I know it&#x27;s weird not putting that in the positive category, but I cannot pinpoint if it is because of the serum itself or because I can use my sunscreen more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad&lt;br /&gt;-DO NOT USE THIS ALONE. This serum is more like a delivery system than a stand-in for your moisturizer. If you do not put something on top, it will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Me neither. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not going to buy this product anymore. I understand that it needs a preservative, so I don&#x27;t fault the company for that, but I&#x27;d rather not put that on my face. Perhaps that&#x27;s why several people said this product dried their skin out. The next reason why I&#x27;m not going to buy this product again is because the company is manipulating the rating system and posting fake reviews. I won&#x27;t explain in detail because other reviewers have already done so. I do give this product five stars for performance, but that&#x27;s not the only important aspect of a purchase choice.&lt;br /&gt;In case you don&#x27;t know, hyaluronic acid is nothing like what you think of when someone says acid. It is a wonderful, thick, gooey, serum that soaks into your skin and: tightens it, lessens wrinkles, plumps, holds moisture in, softens, adds luminosity, and improves texture. It is FANTASTIC stuff, and it does all of the above for me. Both of the major brands here on Amazon did. Hyaluronic acid is naturally occurring in your body, so you can be assured that you&#x27;re giving your skin something it loves. I do believe that results are improved by taking it internally as well. Doctors Best has a good hyaluronic/collagen blend. I actually also use Great Lakes Collagen (in the green container) in my coffee. You can&#x27;t taste it. If you read the reviews on that stuff you&#x27;ll buy it!  Next up, the reason I mentioned wasting money in the title is because it is absolutely ridiculous to pay this amount. I mean, I did it! I admit it. I actually did it twice. BUT, right here on Amazon a cool company called Bulk Supplements sells powdered Hyaluronic acid. For 18 dollars, you can make at least 20 of these 2 oz serum bottles full. If you can measure out a half teaspoon of powder and mix it with two oz of cold distilled or spring water, then shake a small bottle vigorously, you can make this serum yourself. If you cannot perform the steps listed above, or don&#x27;t know anyone who can, I&#x27;d say you have biggerproblems to worry about than imperfect skin. You should let the bottle sit in the fridge for a few hours til the magical gelling happens. It&#x27;s a tad clumpy at first. But, you can&#x27;t mess it up, and it&#x27;s safe to lick it off your fingers if you get sloppy and you&#x27;re a weirdo. The above recipe actually makes a gel that is slightly thicker than Cosmedica&#x27;s, so you could use less powder and it will make even more serum. I have found that the thicker serum that I made is even more beneficial for my skin than Cosmedica&#x27;s- especially with smoothness and moisture retention. I probably wouldn&#x27;t normally try to hurt a company&#x27;s sales by posting recipes on how to make their product in 7.5 seconds for less than a dollar, but I rely on honest Amazon reviews. How maddening is it to know that a company wants to dupe you? Was that too rant-like? Sorry. Here&#x27;s my final tip, which I owe to another reviewer somewhere here in hyaluronic Amazon land: apply your hyaluronic acid, then whatever makeup you use, then spritz with rosewater! The more &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; of rosewater the glowey-er you&#x27;ll get. Let it dry between spritz overs. If you&#x27;ve ever seen that beautiful glow on celebrities&#x27; cheeks and wonder how they do it without being oily, that very well might be the way.</li>
            <li> Seems to add with other series nicely... I&#x27;m seeing results with the natural serums... takes time to see. Only new to these..</li>
            <li> I bought this the first time and it worked wonders on my dry patches. This is the only product I&#x27;m using on my face. I will keep buying it</li>
            <li> BEEN USI&lt;br /&gt;NG IT AWHILE, SKIN FELLS SMOOTH. Noticed by many</li>
            <li> Very good product. I like it and recommended to my friends.</li>
            <li> my combination skin (dry-tzone) has completely corrected thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I use to have extremly oily skin and bad break outs. I use this product along with tamanu oil and hazel nut toner and my skin looks and feels AMAZING! A little goes a long way too. I only apply a rain drop size to my t-zone, let it dry then, apply the toner and then the tamanu oil.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, had really high expectation but doesn&#x27;t really hydrate or plump or do anything.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and easy to apply. Whole face appears younger, more defined and youthful after only a two week period.</li>
            <li> I love this product I am seeing great results my skin looks more youthful and the fine lines and wrinkles have softened so much and I see my skin tone is evening out .  Only been using a few weeks. I really love this product and plan on continuing to use  glad I ordered it to try one of the best products I have ever used</li>
            <li> Does not feel hydrating</li>
            <li> Very watery, runs down my face.  I have used another serum in the past that did not have water as the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I&#x27;m a 68 yr old woman who still has oily skin so if you have really dry skin, I wouldn&#x27;t try it. It does tightened everything up and make the wrinkles less visible. I firmly believe nothing gets rid of wrinkles unless you have cosmetic surgery but this hylauronic acid softens them. I do use moisturizer and sunscreen after applying this product.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results. Very disappointed with product.</li>
            <li> Really good product!  Fast delivery, seems to be hydrating already!  I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> I am a doctor, I used this item, very nice product, i will use it for myself and my patient</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!  I have skin irritations on my face where I have really dry patches.  I have tried everything and this is the first product I have tried that have finally softened and almost eliminated  my dry spots.  I have only been using it for a month so I think if I keep using it my dry spots will totally disappear.  It totally hydrates skin and makes it so smooth!!  LOVE!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom...my mom have used it for about a month . Havent seen any difference yet. Will give it more time though. My mom bought it to get rid of dark spots, dullness and wrinkles. About 5 weeks of regular use did not change anything but like I said, will give more time before concluding anything  UPDATED: Used it regularly everyday for almost 3 months but no difference in wrinkles and skin texture. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> With a little patience, this product does exactly what it is supposed to do:  it binds to water and allows greater hydration of the skin.  i have found that my (older) facial skin needs application in the morning and at night.  It should be the very first product to hit the face after cleansing and toning.  It seems to work better for me when applied to a wet face, then waiting until the skin has absorbed both the water and the acid before applying other serums or moisturizers.  It is not a miracle cure: this is a product that replaces something that is naturally produced by the skin but that production decreases as we age and/or when the skin receives multiple environmental or other insults. It will take time for the skin to adapt and take in the extra moisture.   I also highly recommend this for other parts of the body that do not seem to improve even with the best moisturizing habits (like knees and elbows.)    Seller delivered as promised and was very professional.</li>
            <li> very good product. I have tried few different Hyaluronic Acid. So far I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. I notice an immediate difference to skin after one time use! I recommend this for anyone&#x27;s anti aging regimen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look any younger, but every day I am getting older anyway.</li>
            <li> I have known for a very long time that hygienic acid is good for your body, from head to toe!!  I was looking for a HA that I could use on my face, I went looking on Amazon and there was your product!! And it was within my budget, I was happy!!</li>
            <li> Great price. No greasy or tight feeling. Goes on beautifully. To soon to tell how it works. Put under Vit C serum.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS, AND HAVE NOTICED AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE APPEARANCE  OF MY FACE AND NECK. WILL NEED MORE TIME FOR FINAL RESULTS AND REVIEW.</li>
            <li> very good and easy to use. i can feel my skin is getting smooth and soft. i live in really dry cities and i recommend using other moisture products with it to enhance the hydration function. :)</li>
            <li> Love this particular Hyaluronic Serum.  I have sensitive skin and this serum has 3 ingredients and does not bother my skin.  On all products the less ingredients the better.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I was concerned about some of the product  reviews but I decided to give this serum a try. I bought and use it twice a day and put it on after cleansing my skin. I then follow it with either a daytime moisturizer or a night time product. I noticed a difference in my skin about a week to ten days later after first use. It helps with fine lines and made my skin feel softer.  I  have purchased this product  3 times and I am experimenting using it with other skin care products to see if it will enhance the effects.. I have been very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, the more you use it the more results you will see.I have used several serums and this one I give an A+!!! Please don&#x27;t stop making this product!</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly, absorbs fast, leaves no residue, but neither does it do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is better than Retin A. Really improves appearance of skin and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Omg! I have only been using this for three nights now and already I can see a difference! My skin has been GLOWING! And it is sooooooooo soft! My skin has NEVER felt like this before. I have combo/sensitive skin and this is literally the best thing I have ever put on my face. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens when I start using it with a derma roller I have on the way. Love, love this!</li>
            <li> I have used better BUT is a third of the price and it still works well.  So I have to give it 4 stars...</li>
            <li> it seems to be a nice addition to cream , I apply it first . hard to tell alot yet.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2.5 weeks. Hardly long enough to give a fair assessment. However, I have gotten several emails from the company seeking a review, so I will do my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I cannot tell any difference in facial wrinkles, which is the reason I bought the product. I have used it 5 or 6 times in 2.5 weeks. I will continue using this on a cleaned and toned face and see if there is a notable effect, and will update my review accordingly.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell much with using it. Does dry skin fast, so put on moisture cream after using it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I love what it does for my skin, at a smaller price than Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> I ADORE HYALURONIC ACID SERUM, these people deliver it quickly, a little goes a very long way, my skin adores this product and cannot give it enough stars...my skin really glows on this...amazing product.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a week but i can see my skin brighter already  its so good. clear n smooth</li>
            <li> Not sure it did much for me</li>
            <li> The serum is working great!! I love it and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is helping with my problem dry skin. I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate like other things.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a week or so and I cannot honestly tell you that I notice any difference in my skin.  BUT, it makes perfect sense to me that if it says it helps seal the moisture in, that it may just help prevent deeper wrinkles down the line.  Hopefully by then the world won&#x27;t be so superficial and wrinkles won&#x27;t be so scarey.  For now, the stuff feels great, absorbs quickly and I am choosing to believe that people will definitely love me more if I have fewer wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, so it is probably too early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;But I do love that you use such a tiny amount and my skin does seem to feel smoother after I use it with my roller.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I am using this product so I won&#x27;t know the results until close to the end of the bottle. Using it in conjunction with another product for quicker results.</li>
            <li> I SEE A LOT LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked! This is such a great product. 43 year old recovering tan-o-holic, lots of sun damage seeing marked results half way into 2nd bottle. Using nightly on my face,throat,chest,and back of hands, then retinol cream after. Getting ready to order my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about a month - no change in skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since delivery (April)  and to be quite honest my skin is the exact same.. I use it at night with my other bedtime facial routines.. Maybe this is the issue? So... I&#x27;ve started using twice daily for the past month and still NO change. I&#x27;m a single mother &amp; when I splurge on beauty products or ANYTHING for myself.. I ALWAYS google reviews and feel let down with all the positive 4 - 5 stars, because this is anything but &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.  I plan on checking on that 100% money back guarantee and see how that pans out.  We shall see how long my true &amp; accurate review lasts.. Hope I&#x27;ve helped.  Also a few side notes: I&#x27;m a caucasian female, early 30&#x27;s, fair skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this serum for two days, but I can already see a difference in my skin, which is very old I might add. I hesitate to recommend it after only two days, but I really like it so far. Maybe I will add more later if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> This is 100% pure hyaluronic acid at a very! very good price. I tried it after using Oz Naturals Hyaluronic Acid (which has witch hazel, aloe and Vit C among other things) but found that the Oz Naturals had a better effect. My skin feels smoother, my cystic rosacea totally regresses to un noticeable, and all dryness disappears.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smooth and cool to the skin.  After it dries, my face look tighten and my forehead look like it&#x27;s been ironed.  I use jojoba oil to moisturize and it soaks right in.  I also used this on my eczema spots and it helps a lot.  Jeanne gives good customer service, she&#x27;s very responsive and great to deal with.  This is a good serum and a good company to reorder with.  Thank you Jeanne!</li>
            <li> My wife use this acid for her face care and noted that this is very good quality. She use it for removing of dead skin particles in pair with facial scrub. Also she use it with her mesoroller.</li>
            <li> The best serum I have ever used - best for hydration and smoothing out wrinkles. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I use this every morning - I mix it with my spf moisturizer. my skin feels very nice and looks firm</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different brands and this is by far my favorite!! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! It intensely moisturizes, without feeling greasy! Instantly, you notice firmer, brighter, healthier looking skin! My husband always rubs his cheek against mine after I use this product because he says my skin feels like silk! Lol :) Anyway, it&#x27;s the best! Try it!</li>
            <li> this product is very good I use it for my undereyes bags and dark circles n it has worked  very good. I have bought $200 creams for my dark circles and they haven&#x27;t done anything promised. The only bad thing is I couldn&#x27;t put this in my face other than my eyes because it would make me break out a lot. If u mix this with an other eye creams its gonna work amazing. Definetly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for a short time and already see results!  I&#x27;m 57 and my skin is so dry during the winter so this has been a real test and it passed 100%.  My skin feels so soft now.  No more spending $$$ for other serums.  This will be my one and only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use it at night and follow with a night cream.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin. At 53 &amp; fair skin &amp; freckles.  I have to be careful what products I use, as several cause irritation &amp; redness. Reading the great reviews &amp; talking to my hairdresser that also works in a skin spa...this came highly recommended.  (Her price was $80 for a 2 oz bottle!) So, I decided to try it for a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it about 1 week now. Still too early to tell dramatic difference. But I can tell immediate tightening &amp; smoother skin surface, fewer blemishes in \\&quot;breakout T zone\\&quot;.  I follow the application with my usual facial serum \\&quot;Oil of Olay\\&quot;&amp; it seems to be working well.  The long term effects on fine lines will be wait &amp; see, as it&#x27;s to early to tell yet.  It just takes about 2-3 drops &amp; glides on smoothly &amp; leaves no residue. I dislike heavy after residue on skin, so this product for that is perfect, if you like \\&quot;light weight feeling on your face\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/2/14 Update&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product every night &amp; sometimes mornings after I shower.  I like the feel of my skin, so much smother &amp; tighter. Fine lines wrinkles are improved. NOT GONE but noticeably improved.  I agree with using a favorite moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;over the HA. It truly brightens the skin tone. I&#x27;m of fair completion, blue eyes, reddish undertones &amp; many freckles. My freckles are almost gone...my husband is disappointed. He love my freckles. He also commented my skin was brighter/lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will def keep using this product, I&#x27;m hooked for life.  I started using this with Derma Roller .05mm today.  I will update in a few weeks on effect alone &amp; with Derma Roller.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Love the look and feel of my skin when using it. I use it in combination with 20% Vit. C. Skin seems softer and smoother. Only been using a couple of weeks. Will continue using and report back in another month.</li>
            <li> This product enhances your regular moisturizer. When I use I apply a few drops and mix my regular moisturizer and pat all over. Don&#x27;t use too much or it takes a while to soak in, but you will be able to tell after the first couple of times what amount works best for you. Leaves your skin more plumped than moisturizer by itself.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to get a 100% product, rather than have it just as an ingredient.  I tried it first and now have both sisters and both daughters using it.    UPDATE: I have been using this for about 15 months now.  At first I used it only on my face and neck, including my eyes.  But then I began to notice that my eyelashes were looking longer and healthier so I read a little and learned that hyaluronic acid is good for hair as well.  As part of my daily routine I started using it on my scalp too and my hair is now thicker and healthier - so much so that I have quit using products with minoxidil!</li>
            <li> I love Hyaluronic Acid Serum! It is not greasy and it makes my make go on smooth and stay longer, not to mention it helps with my wrinkles which have started to fade at my ripe old age of 60.</li>
            <li> Repurchased! Good value and hydrates like a dream. Use under regular moisturizer am and pm.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing out skin, probably better on less mature skin</li>
            <li> Closed my pores!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using another brand of hyaluronic acid for two years and have experienced a tremendous amount of success.  My skin looked (past tense) great.  When it was time to order a refill, I decided to give this brand a try based on the &amp;#34;customer&amp;#34; reviews and lower cost. HUGE mistake.  While the consistency is somewhat thicker than the other brand, it has caused horrific breakouts on my face. I did not find it overly drying, but it is obviously clogging my pores. I have stopped using it and will try to get a refund.  I just ordered a refill of the original brand.  While it is pricier, I would rather pay for something that works vs. continuing on with a cheaper, far less effective product.  Classic case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am 37 and bought 2 bottles like a half year ago. Using it every day under my usual mosturizer! I love this product, i always had irritated and sensible skin, looking tired. Now it seems my skin is really flawless and a lot more firm! People keep asking if i did something on my face! and for this price it&#x27;s really incredible and cannot be topped! I will order this again and recommend to all my friends!</li>
            <li> Great product- visible skin improvement in 2 weeks! Just ordered another one!</li>
            <li> Great product. Does what it says it will do. And for a great price.</li>
            <li> This helps remove scar tissue.  It does moisturize face, but isn&#x27;t a miracle.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! it is amazing. after I put it on my left side of my face, I feel it like silk.</li>
            <li> Used for some time...did nothing.  Total WASTE of money.  Don&#x27;t be duped!</li>
            <li> After using for just over a week I can already tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great price for the size and quality. I&#x27;ve bought much more expensive HA and given the same results. I use about 3 drops and it leaves my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely however my Dermitologist says it will do very little topically.</li>
            <li> I love the cost and quality of this product. I order a bottle every other month. Product seems to make my skin feel firm and wrinkles are less visible. I am very satisfied with product and customer service and the cost! Thanful for all 3 qualities.Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use as part of my beauty routine, just after my Derma Roller Needle or some nights before and after my Tetrinoin 0,05 Cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is  absorbed in seconds but didn&#x27;t like the consistency, too watery, so I am keeping it in the fridge and it is a little bit better.  I like the bottle and the package its as shown in the picture.  The serum has a slightly smell, ok smell.  I apply four drops in my face, neck, d√©collet√© and my hands and those four drops are more than enough.  Im going  to finish the Serum but I won&#x27;t buy it again. So if you are looking for a non watery serum don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> Product feels clean and nice...no negative residual feeling on skin.  I have only used the product for about a month which I believe is really too soon to do a fair rating.  However, too date, I see no changes in my skin (ie: no wrinkle reduction).</li>
            <li> Three weeks &amp; nothing of difference. Used it with vitamin C and got no results. Applies good &amp; no skin irritation. Just does nothing for me.</li>
            <li> WAITNG TO SEE IF IT WORKS</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and I notice it gives my skin a glow and has diminished some of the fine lines I had around my eyes.  It absorbs really well and you don&#x27;t have to use much to cover your entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this again to go with my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. Best I&#x27;ve ever used. Keeps my skin hydrated, has helped eliminate break outs and has faded sun damage significantly.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it morning and evenings - ordered four of these to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product on top of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;Seller - A+ service</li>
            <li> In the process of applying it on my face.</li>
            <li> I apply it once in a day before sleeping. Avoid applying on lips. It has reduced the appearance of acne scars and made the face plumpy n nice but the skin feels dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been looking for something that moisturizes my skin without clogging my pores or feels like oil is just laying on top of my skin. I will keep this apart of my skin regimen for sure!!</li>
            <li> You will look years younger instantly!!!!</li>
            <li> This seems to soften fine wrinkles around my eyes and forehead.</li>
            <li> really hydrates the skin, but it has to be followed up by spray pure water and pat them into the skin several times for moisture absorption, then followed with a high quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It really works.....&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for three days now and I can feel the smoothness and softness of my skin return.  Would recommend.  As a matter of fact, I&#x27;m re-ordering another for myself now.</li>
            <li> Works great! Plumps skin and minimizes the look of wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I recommend the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  The deep vertical lines above my mouth are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> I have had a really hard time finding a skin care regimen for my sensitive, reddish, acne-scarred skin, but I absolutely love this product.  I mix it with my night cream, with my daily moisturizer or sunscreen, with my foundation, or just apply it straight to my face.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and has kept my skin clear, and makes it look actually dewy instead of oily.  I use it in conjunction with a glycolic acid cream at night, and the combination of the two has sloughed away lots of my acne scarring and redness, so that I feel fine going without makeup.</li>
            <li> great product! and proven to make a difference in your overall skin health! I appears to be exactly what it is said to be -- pure HA. I consider it essential to my regimen. no complaints here.</li>
            <li> High quality.  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says I have used for a week and I see improvement in skin tightness and less wrinkles.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Simple ingredients, gel consistency that spreads and penetrates easily.  Takes a couple of weeks to see results, but definitely plumps things up a bit. Was a little drying at first, but my skin has since adjusted. Once absorbed, does not interact with makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it when I get my order when it&#x27;s expected. It&#x27;s hard to say right now the effects of the hyaluronic acid but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s good. It goes on smooth and in less than a minute no more greasy feeling. While I can&#x27;t really comment on the product, I like the service they&#x27;ve provided.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin looks hydrated, pretty, younger and rejuvenated.  I am always looking for a great product without having to pay outrageous prices.  I was apprehensive about purchasing this product because it is inexpensive so I felt it must be of inferior quality.  I was completely wrong.  The first time I used it I notice the difference.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Poppins.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with retin a product for a few months....I see a definite improvement in my sun exposed, senior citizen skin....Affordable, easy to apply and Effective.....</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased an acid serum before so I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m really qualified to say if it&#x27;s good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;But this just doesn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything. Ive never really had dry skin or anything though so maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s not really a noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve need using it for about a month now. It feels nice going on and it didn&#x27;t cause me to break out or anything. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a try. Not really a wallet breaking purchase. ^_^</li>
            <li> Very good, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Ok but I&#x27;m 45 and don&#x27;t see that it has helped fade any of my age spots but I do think it helps with wrinkles</li>
            <li> Fantastic My skin looks amazing and much tighter. I will definitively buy it again A+</li>
            <li> I discovered serums a couple years ago, and I loved them.  I decided to try this one by chance, and it is very different from the others I&#x27;ve tried.  You use less of it, for one thing.  Also, afterward, my skin felt tighter, almost drier.  But, as I&#x27;ve done with other serums, I leave it for a few minutes and then put my regular moisturizer on top.  It works great!  I notice fewer lines and discoloration...and it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.  I recommend it...don&#x27;t be afraid of the reviews that mention dryness.  If you use a moisturizer afterward, it really seems to HELP that moisturizer work.</li>
            <li> I saw results within a few weeks of use.  I have a smoother look to my skin.  Some of the buildup is gone between my eyebrows.  The place between eyebrows is difficult to smooth out and the serum took care of it.  I haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity to the serum.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Have been really pleased with this product!!!  The product itself if great... and I use it with Rose water, and then my moisturized over it.  I love it... It also arrived quickly, and without any issues!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Cannot wait to see the results, cause I know they are not instant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month - it does tighten my face but not reducing the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Nice product I will order again. Hydrates my skin, nice skin glow afterwards. I also use this to \\&quot;thin out\\&quot; my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I only bought this a few weeks ago so that is why I am giving it a four star. A little too soon to tell yet. However, I bought this particular brand based on everyone else&#x27;s excellent reviews. I received a sample of a different (more expensive) brand during a visit to a spa for a facial. I liked it so well, they say it&#x27;s a great anti aging product. I liked the product so I found this one on Amazon and it had great reviews. So far so good, so I will continue to buy moving forward. I will update as more time goes on. Thank you Amazon for being able to offer it at such a great price!! ;)</li>
            <li> what a super item,  love this seller</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this product, and consider the price a great value. I have ordered many times, and would highly recommend the seller&#x27;s prompt and reliable service.</li>
            <li> I broke out all over my cheeks after just two applications. I want to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple weeks, but it has softened my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Part of my daily skin care routine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for using after applying salicylic acid on your face.  It is very soothing!  I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but hoping for great results in the near future!</li>
            <li> Great good size .&lt;br /&gt;Product smoothes nicely over skin with no smell.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hands after  putting it on my face,</li>
            <li> my skin looks much better after using this hyaluronic product for a few months...I thought &amp;#34;why pay for creams with it in them when I can get the pure product?&amp;#34;  Hyaluronic acid is also the main ingredient in the popular Juviderm injectables...Just remember to put an oil or cream on after the acid dries to seal in the moisture retaining properties...( I use Weleda&#x27;s Skinfood  or organic sweet almond oil)</li>
            <li> I have been using it rather regularly and I don&#x27;t see what it does and have noticed no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Helps really well for the back of my hands. At my age the skin on the back of my hands has gone thin and wrinkly. This serum makes the skin smooth and seems to plump it up with continued use. Will write an update after using it for a while longer. Not so much difference in my face, but again, it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> As always I&#x27;m nothing but pleased with my purchase and delivery through amazon. Keep up the good work;)</li>
            <li> Best! Hands down. I use it with a vitamin C Serum. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> As I told you, this product was also for a friend, But she is also satisfied with this one too.</li>
            <li> best product. I bought two</li>
            <li> I am very impressed how quickly I see and feel a difference - and I&#x27;m not even using it fully yet. My skin is smoother and the tone is more even. I had an area of keratosis that is now gone since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I am an RN,Aesthetician and will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I started using the product and mix it with my daily moisturizer. Although I can&#x27;t see a difference now I am sure it is helping my aging face!!! I am happy because the product is hyaluronic acid serum and it was reasonably priced, considering many higher priced products only  &amp;#34;CONTAIN&amp;#34; hyaluronic acid serum this is 100%.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. It feels okay going on and quickly absorbs into the skin, but I&#x27;ve seen no change in my skin, whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Need to use with a moisturizer over it!</li>
            <li> I have used other brands but this is the best!  And a very good price</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a month now. I add it to my moisturizer and was hoping it would increase the effects. I don&#x27;t really see any difference in the level of moisture or texture in my skin. Won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> I have paid double at my derm for pure hyaluronic serum and this one does the exact same thing.  Great results.</li>
            <li> This product works great on any skin type. I have a combination of oil and dry skin whereas my mom have dry facial skin. Both of us tried it and it didn&#x27;t irritate our skin and also gave a very nice feeling. I am not really old so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or such but I believe in caring for your skin early on and this serum works a great job at helping me do that. Its made of natural ingredients which is great. My skin is very sensitive so I am glad it didn&#x27;t hurt me. It&#x27;s also paraben free which is great. I do recommend this product to others as well. I received this at a complimentary but all views presented above are my own.</li>
            <li> Great---have used it for a year---am a 70 year old redhead with weathered skin and it really has reduced the wrinkles and skin aging flaws.</li>
            <li> I love this product, great value and it works!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product after reading reviews but it is good. I feel my skin looks brighter and smooth.  The item came as promised, delivered on time.  The only thing is that I have noticed was you have to put moisturizer on after or skin will feel dry.Especially if you have dry skin like me.</li>
            <li> This serum glides on easily. Not greasy, gives a nice fresh plumpness to the face.</li>
            <li> I use this product once or twice a week, after I do a dermal roller treatment.  I put on this serum, wait a few minutes, and then put on argon oil.  My skin is looking great - smooth, plumped up, and clear.  This hyaluronic acid serum is supposed to increase moisture in the skin because it is a humectant.  It seems to do a wonderful job.  I think it would work great on its own, separate from the dermal roller (needle) procedure.</li>
            <li> Eye dropper applicator came broken, burns my skin but I have dry/sensitive skin.  Attempting to mix with lotions.  Using on and off for a month, not seeing results but i cant use it as often as you&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> and gives a fresh feel however if you are expecting it to work miracles , its not what you are looking for. In fact it dried my skin in certain spots on the lower eye area, not sure why... Bought it second time: BAD packing and bottle not sealed properly... quite a bit of the serum was wasted ( lost product due to their fault) consistency too seems to be too runny (</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve only had this product for about 24 hours but wow, it works fast!  Used it at night before nighttime moisturizer and then again in the morning before my spf moisturizer and I can already see a difference!  Skin is very, very smooth and just feels more hydrated overall.  Fine lines around my eyes seem smoothed and I believe that continued use of this product will just produce even greater results.  And such a great deal too for the price!</li>
            <li> It works on me and the price is affordable! Great product! Thank you</li>
            <li> This is an average product, it&#x27;s ok for the value.</li>
            <li> I noticed an immediate change in skin texture in comparison to another product I was using.  It seemed stronger.</li>
            <li> I plumps up your skin, as long as I use it.  You have to use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and buying service experience. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Thick so you can put a few dabs of water in your hand with it and put on your face to really hydrate it. I use it pretty much every day and put Retinol cream or make up or sunscreen, etc. over it. I think it does help a lot.</li>
            <li> It seems to tighten my face when I first put it on, but the sensation isn&#x27;t permanent. So, that&#x27;s that.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just water with thickener. Did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging.&lt;br /&gt;High expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;I will try it again but for the week that I used it, it was giving me breakouts, nothing major but I definitely noticed a change when I stopped.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin or skin tone even after several months usage.  Have switched to a vitamin C oil which is AMAZING!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awsome it keeps my skin really soft love it</li>
            <li> Thanks! I got my order! Fast shipping and easy to order! I love this product, the price and quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this upon a recommendation of a friend. She is 12 years older than me and looks my age! and I could see the improvement on her face. She told me that she only used this product. I did not have great expectations. I never used a serum before. It felt like egg whites on my face. My skin looks better. But I don&#x27;t know if its just the serum or the serum less stress, love.. :Pp or my new maybe line powerless foundation.... Overall I am satisfied with it! I will buy it again!! My pores looks smaller and my skin looks more radiant.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST buy! It is relatively inexpensive and really does help improve skin texture. I put it on each night right before putting on my night cream.</li>
            <li> 100 % pure hyaluronic serum. This stuff is great. Anytime you read about anti-aging products this is always touted as the best humidicant as it holds 100 times its weight in moisture. Look for products that have this ingredient and it is expensive or way down on the list. Being able to find the unadulterated ingredient at a reasonable price was excellent.</li>
            <li> words can not give this serum justice. i am beyond satisfied. visible results within a week. it has done wonders for my skin and my self esteem. Thank you cosmedica for helping me to be proud of my face once again!!</li>
            <li> A lot of products offer fixes.....this one delivers. Even my &#x27;thinking wrinkle&#x27; (that pesky wrinkle right between your eyes), which I&#x27;ve had since my early 20s, looks better. It may not be injections, but for the price, it&#x27;s pretty darned close. I&#x27;m not one to write reviews, so when I say something works, it works. And this stuff? It works. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> My face definitely feels alot smoother! Will continue to use to see if it helps with my dark spots and dark circles. I use it morning and evening and wear it under my face cream. They texture is liquidy, but I don&#x27;t think it was designed to moisturize, more just to hydrate your skin.</li>
            <li> I use this with my moisturizer and I see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on skin and you can feel the tightness as it works.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> Product seems ok, not sure if I will repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for the past year and have seen excellent results.  It&#x27;s quickly absorbed into the skin, and other product can be applied over it.  Excellent value, one bottle lasts 6 months.</li>
            <li> Best hyaluronic acid serum product out there!  Pure and with no additives, this serum makes a huge difference in your skin&#x27;s hydration levels when used over time.  Mix a drop or two witth your moisturizer and enjoy the benefits and results.  Skin looks visibly plumper and &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34;.  Give it a try; you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this brand and I feel like it has made my skin smoother and brighter already! I don&#x27;t think the dropper is necessary but whatevs.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m not giving it 4 stars is because I&#x27;m new to skin care products. I received my order quickly, and the stuff really worked. It removes a ton of my light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This a most remarkable product.  After one week a saw a difference in my facial skin.  It adds a youthful brightness to your face.  I use this product at night and morning followed by a facial moisturizer. Also this product is a good value as compared to other products.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. It does rejuvenate. Takes a little discipline to use twice a day. must was face first, let it dry. Apply hyaluronic acid serum to face, neck, upper chest and let it dry, the apply moisturizer. Can use on arms, legs and hands with good results also.</li>
            <li> Brow wrinkle is slowly disappearing. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for only 2 weeks and in combination with the Sibu Sea Buckthorn Seed Oil I am noticing that my brow wrinkle (the crease between the brows) is starting to smooth out. My skin is very soft and supple. Bought it specifically to use when flying to keep my skin from dehydration when flying.</li>
            <li> The serum is good but the alcohol harm the skin by making it so dry .</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. I&#x27;ve used much more expensive Hyaluronic Serums, and I think this one is possibly just as good.  I always use this after I use a facial peel, and follow that with a quality oil.  For the price and the quantity that this product provides, it&#x27;s a no-brainer!</li>
            <li> Very good ‚ù§! It keeps my face very fresh, specially wearing make up.</li>
            <li> Works great. My skin feels softer and it has been gently exfoliating my skin and moisturizing at the same time.</li>
            <li> was not happy with this product. Not what i thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this serum every night! Since I started using it along with my Derma -e anti-wrinkle night cream w/peptides,etc my skin is looking healthier than ever.  Along w/getting my facials every 2 weeks (sure this has a lot to do w/improvements) I am turning 50 this month &amp; am told I look 30!</li>
            <li> The serum arrived on time, was packaged well and matched the description mentioned in the website. Packaging and shipping was great!&lt;br /&gt;Now coming to the product, I primarily use it on my face and neck and apply it before putting moisturizer on. I mainly started using it to fix some areas with uneven skin tone, reduce fine lines under the eye and also reduce the number/size of pores.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and because it is a clear liquid, it can be used under a moisturizer or even light makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for over two weeks now and haven&#x27;t really seen any difference. It however did not cause any side-effect or acne or any other skin-issues-- So I guess that&#x27;s a positive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it for two more weeks, give it a decent shot before discontinuing use.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it at first but after using it for about three weeks I see a Big difference in my skin! Fine lines are disappearing and my skin is sooooo soft! I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Money well spent!  My skin is very sensitive, but it has become less so since I started to use this product.  I feel like it has given my skin enough moisture so it can heal itself.  I am 37 and have a new glow about me.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have had laser resurfacing  done.  It is a little early to evaluate it properly. It has not been uncomfortable for a a tender face.</li>
            <li> Ok, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s all in my head, but my face looks amazingly refreshed from using this. I do use it with Vitamin C serum though, so it may be the combination of the two. Definitely not disappointed with this purchase and will buy again when I run out, which will be a long time because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Its only been week with no bad skin reactions. Only a few drops are necessary to cover face, so it will last awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Will write another review when I&#x27;ve finished product.</li>
            <li> Lots of product for little money, and it does the job. This will last a long time and will continue to be a staple in my vanity.</li>
            <li> This product has clogged my pores and caused me to break out where it was applied.</li>
            <li> I can see the different in 2 weeks. Love the product.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  This stuff makes my skin feel moist, soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s 80% as hydrating skin as Estee Lauder&#x27;s awesome Night Repair Serum, but at a fraction of the cost. (Together they are awesome). My skin at 54 feels softer and smoother and healthier than it did in my 20s.  I have fewer wrinkles than in my 40s.  Yeah science.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum, 100% Pure is fantastic. It really helps to moisturize your skin. I use this along with Life-Flo 1% Retinol cream to help with the skin peeling you get with a retinol product. It really helps to hydrate around your eyes too. Great product, great price. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, however, I found another product that incorporated Vitamin C in their product, which adds to the benefit of using Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> Bought this product on a whim &amp;amp; I was pleasantly surprised. This serum plumped up my skin instantly &amp;amp; tightened my pores...  I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It works as described and is a \\&quot;must\\&quot; for dry climates! I have purchased several  and would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hundreds of beauty products and this is by far the worst packaging/cheapest glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I received it broken and almost injured myself on the shards of glass.  Really aggravating. I just can&#x27;t believe they would use such cheap bottling....this is a future lawsuit as someone can get hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise investing in a stronger bottle and just charging a dollar more!</li>
            <li> I t s e x c e l l e n t p r o d u c t, Im very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> The feel of this product is wonderful. Soothes the skin and under the eyes! I use it after my derma ruler and it absorbs better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a little over a week and feel that it has helped to re-hydrate my very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks~ I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks, and I have already noticed a change. I have tried many other products including prescription products, that were quite expensive without any results. I will definitely continue using this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of the visage.  I have been using the hyaluronic Acid and am waiting for results.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff!  I like the way it makes my 47 year old face look and feel!</li>
            <li> You can see the difference in your skin quickly when using this</li>
            <li> I asked for a sample and WOW were they generous! The customer service alone deserves 5 stars regardless my opinion of the product. I received this today, I know I know, too early for a review but I will do a follow up later. I want to say I have the Vitamin C prep &amp; tone and this hyaluronic acid serum and the two together is LOVELY! My face looks brighter and much healthier instantly! I have been using HA serum by Timeless Skincare and in comparison, Cosmedica&#x27;s HA is much much thicker consistancy and with less ingredients and also with HA being the second ingredient. I will do a follow up soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/30:&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff but for some reason this and also the one from timeless skincare makes my pores noticeable. My pores are only noticeable if there are irritating ingredients?! My face is NOT irritated by any means but I hate noticeable pores and my pores are not noticeable when I use my 0 hazardous bioelements cream \\&quot;all things pure!\\&quot; So I guess I will use this on dry patches of skin or for my Fiancee&#x27;s psoriasis?! I love it but maybe I will use it time to time, HOWEVER, I LOVE their Vitamin C prep &amp; tone...NOW THAT, I will keep purchasing when I run out! I use Thayers toner but I do love this toner as well (maybe not for everyday use) but for that quick pick me upper and that bright Vitamin C skin, this will do! I am currently using 100% Natural and USDA Certified Organic Grapeseed Oil and WOW this stuff blows ANY product out of the water! just the anti-aging benefits and what is does...it does WONDERS and I will NEVER go without it..I suggest you look it up, I saw results INSTANTLY! It&#x27;s even edible and my babies cradle cap and dry patches on her legs have disappeared overnight. It even blows HA serums out of the water!</li>
            <li> i have been paying twice this for 1/2 the amt.  This is just as good as the &amp;#34;big brand&amp;#34; product but a much better deal.  i use it to prep my skin for using a retinoid hydrogel that is otherwise too hard to apply smoothly and evenly.  now not only does it go on with ease, but my skin is no longer dry and flaky!  yeah! less expensive and no compromise n quality, you cant beat that!  and shipping was prompt  will go back for more.</li>
            <li> Very good hydration in warm climates and good all year long. Good value</li>
            <li> no noticeable difference even after a month of use</li>
            <li> easy to use dropper measures out the small amounts needed, great price. Fast delivery and well-done packaging.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this product for a couple of weeks before reviewing.  I take my beauty/anti-aging very seriously!  I am not experiencing a great surge in moisture as promised.  The package arrived on time and well packed, but other than that, I am not impressed.  I am also taking phyto-ceramides, thinking the combination would really deliver soft, youthful well moisturized results.  Sad to report no change as of yet.  I still have a half bottle and if I start seeing a difference (fingers crossed) I will let y&#x27;all know.</li>
            <li> Used as recommended  and doesn&#x27;t see any result...just one star because have to mark something..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It isn&#x27;t the most hydrating thing on my counter but it isn&#x27;t supposed to be. It&#x27;s a great lightweight moisterizer. Would recommend to those with oily skin</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness this product is amazing. I bought it to use along with the derma-roller and am loving the results. When I apply this my face feels so soft and I am already seeing results only after 1 week of use. I am 53 with age spots from too much sun when I was younger, also wrinkles around the eyes and deep furrow lines and I am noticing everything softening up. The furrow lines may take longer but even a slight softening is better than the opposite.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...something that really hydrates my abnormally dry skin!</li>
            <li> Smells strange but very firming to my face</li>
            <li> good price for this product</li>
            <li> I have purchased and used this product before.  When I was about to run out of it, I reordered.  The first bottle of the serum contained a liquid serum.  The current bottle contains a gel-like substance.  Don&#x27;t know which one is of the correct consistency.  Not fond of the gel-like serum.  Maybe it was because of cold weather and during shipping the liquid changed to gel.  Not sure if I will reorder.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, it just isn&#x27;t quite moisturizing enough for my skin , I had to combine it with a facial cream.. It is a very affordable and easy to mix with daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am 43 years old, and I have tried other hyaluronic acids and this one is the best so far. So far my skin is firmer and more plump.</li>
            <li> I feel some level of tightness. I think it may take more times with my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin oily as f</li>
            <li> I love the way it&#x27;s bottled with the dropper, makes it so easy to use. I use this serum morning and night, it&#x27;s such a great bang for your buck! It really helps my skin draw in more moisture and helps fade my dark acne scars (I use this along with my moisturizers and creams, of course). I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 4 weeks now and I can honestly say it&#x27;s been a lot of help for fading my scars and dark spots as well as evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing stuff. I have really bad dry skin and this smooths it out immediately.</li>
            <li> This is the best best hyaluronic acid I&#x27;ve ever used. When I feel like I&#x27;m getting a pimple I put some of the HA and it works so fast I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old with combination, sensitive, acne-prone skin. Nothing has worked. Regular moisturizers tend to irritate my skin or cause acne flair-ups. My skin also requires constant hydrating because I have to use strong facial cleansers and wipes sometimes, as I am in the theater/stage industry and am required to use certain make-up and cleansing products. Unfortunately, these products tend to wreck havoc on your skin, but this serum from Cosmedica has greatly improved my skin since I started using it in February.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No more annoying dry skin peeling/flaking&lt;br /&gt;- Deep, clean moisturizing that actually makes your primer + foundation go on SMOOTHER!!!&lt;br /&gt;- Skin elasticity and overall &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced redness and uneven skin tone&lt;br /&gt;- Combined with your dermaroller, you get even better results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say enough good things. I&#x27;m probably going to buy the vitamin c + retinol serum next to help with my acne scarring.</li>
            <li> feels good and works great on some areas of my skin.  other places on my face it creates cysts in the pores. I avoided another product I was using  with this for a while so I could tell which was the culprit.  It was the serum.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I like how my skins feels tighter after use. Make sure you pat it on or skin does not feel tighter.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so good for your skin. It makes it feel soft and cool. Ordering another bottle soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sooo many hyaluronic acid serums but never found one I felt truly penetrated the skin... Until now. I used to get Botox every cpl months and I&#x27;ve been able to go several months without it after using this. It helps my face look full and so smooth, I can&#x27;t say enough about how pleased I am! Will def be a long term customer</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about a month, love it. I am 58 and very fortunate for my age as I look years younger that that. However, when I started noticing deeper crinkles and lines in my face I wanted to try something to slow the inevitable. After 2 weeks a subtle change. After a month of use Whoa! Friends and family say I look great. The lines have plumped out and crows feet are all but gone. Very happy. This product isnt a facelift in a bottle, but I will say it is the best serum I have used so far And I have tried many products.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> Although the consistency is more watery than I expected, it still hydrates my skin. I use it everyday and I love that this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I&#x27;ve used $30 serums with both hyaluronic acid and vitamin c, and honestly this is much cheaper and gives the same result.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. If you want a glow to your skin, this is the product. Applied in the morning, evening, even during the day, it absorbs well and moisturizes like no other. I use it with other creams as well. Great for the dry weather!!</li>
            <li> I am using the product, but maybe it&#x27;s too early to see any results.  I will post again later.  The product was delivered on time and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> It mad my skin dry... as of now i stopped using it until my skin is less irritated...</li>
            <li> Works very Well!  Make sure you put water on your skin before applying this, then rub it in!</li>
            <li> I use this after washing my face in the morning and before going to bed. Moisture for your skin, definitely use it before the moisture cream. Heavenly product!</li>
            <li> I have excellent skin for a 77 year old with very few wrinkles, no crow&#x27;s feet at the eyes or mouth lines. I only use this and a liquid foundation from Mac. I may take the advise of some of the earlier reviewers and add a second moisturizer but I&#x27;m on my third bottle of this and it seems to be enough so far to keep my skin smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last two months I didn&#x27;t see any changes to my skin it feels like water every time I put it in my hand to use it on my face I won&#x27;t buy it again. Disappointed with my purchase big time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it, smells funny....pretty sure it&#x27;s missing something</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m leery of all the bad reviews here and do believe if i used this daily it would dry my skin since it has alcohol in it. i don&#x27;t use this daily so cannot be sure i see results. i&#x27;m going to add some to my hand cream and try that.</li>
            <li> Great product, I received it right away and packaged very well. First time I&#x27;ve ever used hyaluronic acid, seems to help your skin shed cells and creat new so it&#x27;s working. I would recommend using it before a good moisturizer and don&#x27;t use with other strong products like vitamin C serum, alternate days for each.</li>
            <li> Liquids and gets all over the place, not gel like or thick, too runny.</li>
            <li> It keeps your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good, but not the best thing since sliced bread. You hear how hydrating hyaluronic acid is supposed to be. I&#x27;ve been a little underwhelmed. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this has some alcohol in it? I know that sometimes alcohol is necessary, but it seems counterproductive for a moisturizing product. I&#x27;m certainly not an expert, though.    That said, the quality of the product seems very good. My problem skin hasn&#x27;t shown ill effects. There is no smell. The packaging is of high quality. The product has nice viscosity. This seems like a very nice hyaluronic acid serum. I bought a 2 oz. bottle and am down to less than 1 oz.</li>
            <li> I love this serum for my face.  It seems to lessen the deepness of the wrinkles on the face.  I apply at night because it takes a few minutes to dry.  It does dry out your face more in the winter so I use it first and then put on a moisturizer.  The bottles that I have received have a thick liquid that goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is hydrating and feels wonderful on my skin.  I hope it keeps the wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t know if anything will turn back the hands of time on my face.  But I feel that this product is working and I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good!</li>
            <li> Best beauty trick ever!&lt;br /&gt;I really love it and recommend it to every one, you will be amazed to see the results in just few days.&lt;br /&gt;Also the shipment was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> Really good serum for under a cream or lotion.  My face feels hydrated for hours.  The only problem is the dispenser rubber does not dispense well.  To get enough product I have to depend on the glass of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> Great product, as described my skin looks and feels younger &amp; softer. Fine lines are gone and deeper lines getting smaller every day &amp; pours are shrinking. Will definitely buy again when I run out. A little bit goes a long way thank you so much for putting out such a great product. Fast shipping. Highly recommend product and company to everyone showing signs of ageing.&lt;br /&gt;No complaints</li>
            <li> Results yet to be seen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for only a week. When I apply the product to my face and neck, I place a few drops on the back of my hand, and work from there. To my astonishment, there is a circle of smoother, more even-toned skin on my hand where I put the serum! The fine wrinkles on my hand are disappearing. The difference in the skin on that part of my hand is obvious. My face and neck are growing smoother and softer, and fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.  This product is pleasant to use. It has no odor, and absorbs really quickly. It feels like the skin is drinking it up like a sponge! I&#x27;ve tried other, more expensive serums, and had no results at all, so I am amazed by this product.</li>
            <li> Used it a few days now and it is helping keep my acne down and I sure don&#x27;t mind my smile lines fading away. Will post an update after more time passes</li>
            <li> Used it up! Great product, need to order more.</li>
            <li> I see positive results after only 2 applications, one last night before bedtime and one this morning. This appears, so far, to be an effective and safe product as well as being a good value. I was concerned that there may be some skin irritation (redness or soreness)  but so far, on my face, I see no negative side effects. In my opinion, there are very few common name brand products on the shelves that do much of anything. This appears to be an exception.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this serum.  I&#x27;m not sure if it actually is helping my skin but I have to say that after I apply it and it dries or is absorbed, I like the feel of my skin - so smooth.  I use the Vitamin C toner first, then this and then my moisturizers before I put on my makeup.  I do the same at night (without the makeup of course).</li>
            <li> Water. Just plain water. I bought a similar product from a professional and I knew when I applied it. This is basically water. Not the real deal</li>
            <li> I am 48, very nice skin bought it to see if it would help with pores and a fine lines, have been using it daily for almost a month and I have ZERO results, my ski became  dry and opaque, threw it away, not even with the help of derma roller.</li>
            <li> I purchased this, honestly without much faith that it would work. I&#x27;ve tried just about every skincare line on the market, and none delivered what was claimed...you know those claims \\&quot;see results instantly, full results in 4-6weeks\\&quot;, only those results never happen. Better yet, those high end products mysteriously are never shipped yet they still bill for the products that were never received. So upon ordering this, me of little faith, was surprised by the speed it arrived, and i saw results the first time i applied it, and with no adverse skin reactions. A friend that has known me for years asked me if i had invested in those injections we oft times resort to, so i showed her what i&#x27;ve been using, she tried it, and now has asked me to order her the same product. This serum actually works, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (i have very sensitive skin), and it works not only on the face, but it also works on hands (which we tend to forget and hands, no matter how perfect our facial skin may be, our hands are often neglected and show our true age). I use it on my face, my hands, and my chest and a believer i&#x27;ve become. My husband even commented on the difference of my skin, and he can be brutally honest (which i respect because i&#x27;d rather him tell me the truth than to tell me an untruth, especially about skincare). He told me that out of all the many $1000&#x27;s that i&#x27;ve spent over the years on skincare, this $14.95 Amazon Prime product has literally proven to work and show results immediately. I will be purchasing this item from this point on and my former products are truly a thing of the past. A wonderful investment without hurting your skin or wallet!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It makes my face feel really nice. It looks even better the next day. it is not greasy at all, and that was very important to me. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used many products over the years.  with high hopes it would be as good as promised from reviews and product description It was and is as good as promised. I use it first in the morning and evening followed by my moisturizers and such. This product goes a long way and I do not have to buy it very often. The price is very economical for such a great product. Yes, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> A+ A+ A+... I have parched, desert dry skin with wrinkles of a 50 year old on my 36 year old skin &amp; in the first hour of applying this, I saw glowing improvement!!! I had tried some other vegan moisturizing products which ended up burning my face, this is amazing!  My skin is so sensitive and this worked wonders!  I could shout from the mountain tops (if I lived in the mtns) that this really has helped with my excessively dry skin, wrinkles around eyes, smile lines, and overall glow of my skin.  Again, I just got this in the mail three hours ago and already see an amazing glow.</li>
            <li> SEEMS TO BE OK..HAVE ONLY USED IT FOR ONE WEEK...HOPING IT WORKS ...</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to - my wrinkles aren&#x27;t as noticeable . . I love that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shopping on Amazon using my Prime membership affords me the ability to shop, compare, read reviews, and buy things that turn out to be the best buys.  In addition, there&#x27;s no crowds or other hassles, i.e. traffic, etc.  Today, shopping in town is a nightmare, so Amazon is perfect for most things I need to purchase.  I do recommend that you shop and trust Amazon for things you need to buy.  I&#x27;ve even been purchasing cleaning products and have done the most of my Christmas shopping right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped my 50-year old skin with dryness, fine lines.</li>
            <li> Love it this hyaluronic acid and dispensing droplet! has not smell to it and clear. Bought it after researching the new &amp;#34;face uplift&amp;#34; cream and combining this with Vitamin C (liquid in capsules), rosemary extract, mint extract and vitamin D to make my own cream. Have seen results almost next day and already got some compliments after using only for couple of weeks. However need to use it all the time and not skip days. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It leaves my skin soft and with an even texture. I apply it after doing the derma roller.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for every day use but strong enough that day by day you notice the difference as all the uneveness, dull skin, dark spots start to slowly lighten up. It is important that you use a strong SPF sunscreen on your face.</li>
            <li> I like it, it works for me and absorbs well.I don t feel like a grease ball with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and I want to delay wrinkles and other signs of aging before they show up. I&#x27;ve researched a lot and found out that delaying the signs of aging and preventing them is the way to go to stay &amp;#34;youthful&amp;#34; as long as possible. And in fact, people should start taking care of their skin in their 20s because it&#x27;s easier to keep a smooth, wrinkle free skin rather than trying to erase or hide wrinkles and other imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product about two months or so ago when I saw lines around my eyes and on my forehead. I see a lot of my peers who are still in their 20s, but look like they&#x27;re in their 30s and 40s. They look tired and have lines all over their faces that weren&#x27;t there before. First off, I&#x27;ve tried to consciously stay out of the sun if I could help it. I use sunblock if I can&#x27;t avoid the sun. My peers didn&#x27;t really care for that when we were younger and the sun damage on their skin is obvious. Their skin looks dry, cracked, tan but old. I say this because if you want the best benefit from using this product, you should try to stay out of the sun and use sunblock if you can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product works really well with a moisturizer. I apply this product first on clean skin and let it dry for a minute. Then I apply Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair for Night because it&#x27;s a moisturizer and also has retinol, which really helps with skin repair (wrinkles and uneven tone), smooths skin by promoting new growth, and also helps keeps my skin clear from acne. Once a week, I do a 1 minute glycolic peel (30%) then rinse off and apply hylauronic acid and just a simple moisturizer on top. I skip retinol products that night because it will burn/sting the newly treated skin. Also skip anything that would sting if you are somehow still using any other products like salicylic acid, etc. The glycolic peel makes a huge difference. I could tell the first time I used it that my skin was softer, smoother, more even toned, andjust feels better. Read up about it for sure before using it because it can be strong. It&#x27;s supposed to help peel away dead skin and stimulate new smooth skin. It seems to do that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these products I&#x27;m talking about like retinol and glycolic peel will make your skin sensitive to the sun and will easily make you burn. So, definitely stay out of the sun if you can help it, use sunblock, a hat, and whatever else you can do to avoid sun exposure. Otherwise, your skin won&#x27;t look great and it will all be for nothing. But if you take care of your skin consistently and follow directions well, you will see a big difference. It&#x27;s like exercise. You have to do it everyday, but you won&#x27;t see a big difference until after some time. I wish I took pictures of my skin before I started my regimen. I&#x27;d really love to show what has changed for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I recently got married and was showing people my wedding photos. A lot of people assumed I was the &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; in my family. Just looking at photos, they thought I was the youngest out of all my sisters (also my bridesmaids). I am 7 years older than one of my sisters and 10 years older than the youngest. People were blown away and actually felt bad for my sisters. And I can still hang out with my siblings and their friends if I need to. Their friends also mistake me as someone closer to their age and wouldn&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m much older than they are.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it starts working immediately to hydrate and moisturize. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this on my skin, good consistency, not greasy, just feels good.</li>
            <li> This serum is pure hyaluronic acid. It doesn&#x27;t have other unnecessary stuff, like fragrances or other actives, so it is non greasy and great for sensitive skin or if you plan to mix it with other products.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very moisturizing and gentle, specially for winter or if you&#x27;re using a retinol product.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice too and easy to use. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product especially for the price</li>
            <li> I got this so I could have it penetrate into my skin while I was microneedling my face.  And I put it on immediately after microneedling as well, just in case any might still penetrate.  As far as I can tell my skin looks better than it did before I did the microneedling 2 weeks ago!</li>
            <li> My friend had introduced me to hyaluronic acid and all its perks. I was skeptical at first, but she fed my curiosity. So I ordered the serum (which arrived promptly and neatly packaged), and I would mix two drops from the droplet into my facial moisturizer. My skin normally has a few dry spots, but I&#x27;ve noticed that the hyaluronic acid diminished the dry patches immediately. I also have slight acne. The serum does not clog pores thank gosh!</li>
            <li> It also seems to refine my pores, but then everything I&#x27;m saying here is subjective.  So, subjectively speaking, I&#x27;m quite happy with this serum.  It&#x27;s paraben-free and fragrance-free and that&#x27;s another good thing.  I&#x27;ve been using the serum twice a day for about two weeks (3 small drops for face [right side, left side, forehead] and one drop for neck), have had no adverse reactions (no breakouts, rashes, etc.) and actually feel that it makes my skin smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just let the serum absorb into the skin and then apply my usual facial moisturizers, such as an Oil of Olay Regenerist product.  It absorbs quickly so that&#x27;s not adding a lot of time to my daily skin care routine and I&#x27;m pleased with the results so it&#x27;s worth the extra minute.</li>
            <li> This is the best product that I have used in years. My dark marks are fading and I can&#x27;t wait to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well and  and does not dry out my skin. It also seems to make my skin seem supple and has cleared up my acne a bit.</li>
            <li> I Love my Hyaluric Acid. It makes My skin shine and soft . Really like it! I would recommend  to a friend</li>
            <li> This product caused me to break out in itchy hives. Beware if you have allergies or sensitive skin. I usually buy kiehls but thought I&#x27;d try something new. Wasn&#x27;t a good idea.</li>
            <li> Definitely follow with a moisturizer. My skin is a bit smother</li>
            <li> Skin glows and looks smooth. This product is easy to use. I definintely recommend it to anyone who cares about their skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hyaluronic acid serum for five days now and have no complaints. (It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve tried, though, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others.)  It goes on easily, is completely non-greasy, and it absorbs quickly without drying my moderately sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very little product is needed for complete coverage, and I use it on my face and neck in p.m. after I take off my makeup and in the a.m. before I put it on. I use a moisturizer after, either Bel Essence or Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair, and it works great with both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am using the acid serum along with a &amp;#34;wrinkle-repair&amp;#34; moisturizer, I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s one or the combination that is helping my skin, but at this price I don&#x27;t feel driven to find out. They have helped my skin&#x27;s general appearance so that when I am make-up free, I look better. My skin tone is more even, the enlarged pores and shadows under my eyes aren&#x27;t as visible, and the fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes have diminished a bit. I can definitely tell a difference in the deep wrinkle between my eyebrows, too. My skin is much softer and doesn&#x27;t get oily during the day (no shine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, it&#x27;s not a filler or surgery, but I&#x27;d rather just soften the lines and even out tone than have to maintain expensive injections every other month in order to look unrealistically wrinkle-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say this product coupled with a good anti-aging moisturizer are a good skin regimen for women wanting to soften skin, lessen the appearance of wrinkles, and minimize that annoying &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; that has to be blotted away all day long.</li>
            <li> I use this every night mixed with my moisturiser and it has cleared up my acne and dark marks really fast.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed.  After only a few days of use my skin is brighter  with fewer bumps.  I&#x27;m buying this for all the women in my family!</li>
            <li> The first time i wrote a review for this product i received an email saying it needs to be revised, only because i used &#x27;actual&#x27; words describing this serum. I don&#x27;t get it how this product gets five star reviews, and even i bought it considering the stellar ratings. The serum makes my skin so tight that it almost feels like a mask. I threw the box but would still return this serum, and request anyone whose about to buy it looking at the stellar ratings, please stop and read through the negative ratings as well.</li>
            <li> This serum made an improvement in my skin after only one week.  I am so very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> First time trying hyaluronic acid, enjoyed it quite a bit. It&#x27;s gentle, and really plump the skin to make it nice and soft. Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> has been using this product for about 1 month, the result is promising, it clear off my pimples and tighten my pores too.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. Words are just not enough, you would have to actually use this serum to see how great it is. Today I am going to order my second bottle and I am hooked up for my life. I have been using this for about three month and people think I am 10 years younger. My face is now youthful, more plumper, clear, and glowing. I use twice in the morning and before bed, followed by a moisture. You can use this under your eyes all over face and neck. You would see a noticeable difference within 2 weeks. Loveit,love it, and love it.</li>
            <li> Beware..... I considered trying this product until I noticed some of the reviews are almost identical (a few words changed). Spooky.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a short while, but it is so refreshing.  It seems to moisturize (soaks into the skin) and then leaves tight-looking and smooth skin where there had been a &amp;#34;shriveled&amp;#34; look.  I love it.  Cannot wait to see what happens as I continue to use it.  And, yes, I would recommend it to others.  In fact, I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I am using this product after spraying on the Vitamin C spray toner.  My pores are still large but I think it is helping hold moisture to give a more plump appearance of my skin.  I honestly don&#x27;t know whether to credit this serum or the other products i am using with it.</li>
            <li> I got it on the sale. Pretty good deal!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been browsing for Hyaluronic acid but usually cost a lot for a tiny bottle. 2 oz seems a lot for this kind of product because you only need a dime size drop for your entire face. It is thick but you can spread a small amount smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t sting or anything. My skin feels moist and feels softer in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> I do not usually write Reviews but I LOVE this product~~ I am 51 yrs young and I have tried other HA products here and there but I am so Happy that I decided to try this one!  I love the way it feels so silky and a little goes a long way and I do NOT use it sparingly!  I use it in the morning and at night a whole dropperful each time..when my eyes are puffy and even when they are not.. I take one drop for each eye and dab it under my eyes ..the wetter the better and just let it air dry and it depuffs and smooths the fine lines and even gives a tighter appearance.  I have very dry skin and it hydrates better than any moisturizer I have ever used..I don&#x27;t even waste money on a moisturizer any more!!  My face feels smooth and soft..my complexion is brighter and fine lines have seemed to disappear!!  An added Bonus for me is that I have dark patches of skin under my jaw line that I have used lightners on without results and recently I noticed that they have started to look lighter since I started using this HA serum.  I bought my first bottle (2oz) on Feb. 27th and still have 1/3 of a bottle left and I am on here now to buy another and one for my Mother.&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments all the time on my complexion from Family, Friends and Strangers.  My Brother recently asked me \\&quot;Sis, what do you do that makes your skin look so smooth?\\&quot;  So, Yes!  I Love it!!  I use it and I will continue to use it!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that it will be all that for any one else..but it is for me.  Like I said..Love! Love! Love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read reviews before purchasing this serum. It totally met my expectations and confirmed positive reviews. Very refreshing. Feels great on skin. I think I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks brighter and the tone is more even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the product twice but so far I like the way it makes my soft &amp; supple. I apply this before I apply my moisturizer and I like the way it allows the moisturizer to glide on</li>
            <li> I mix this in with my cream in the am and at night with my night cream. I use just one drop. I love it. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> product is as expected</li>
            <li> Your product is just ok. It take a long time to Obsorb &amp; has a odd texture. I normally use SkinCeuticals &amp; was hoping to find a product comparable to that. I will use it on my hands &amp; feet but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on my face. The price is great but the product doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> unusually smooth liquid.  seems to soak in and hydrate beautifully.  either my concealer is working better or this is really starting to make a difference to the texture of my face and neck.  i&#x27;ll be a return buyer of this product.  thank you!  (oh; communcation was great!  1st shipment was lost.  company had my replacement within 2 days!)  great customer service on top of superior product!</li>
            <li> I will admit that I am not familiar with the science behind why this should work but based on reviews and internet reading ( yes I know that I should not believe everything I read on the internet) I thought I would try this product. At the price it seemed like something I could blow some money on.  So I decided that I would massage this into my skin morning and night and then use my regular moisturizer. After about a week I started noticing that skin seemed to plump up and wrinkles were less noticeable. I am not young and I don&#x27;t have absolutely perfect skin but this product seems to help with what I consider problem areas. So I am going to continue using this to see if there will be dramatic improvement. Right now I am content with noticeable improvement but a miracle would be nice too.  The bottom line is I believe this is a good weapon to have in the arsenal to fight off visible changes caused by aging.</li>
            <li> I have notice my deep line softening and some finer lines disappearing.</li>
            <li> I apply the hyaluronic acid serum after using the micro needle roller.  After rolling, I use a vitamin C cream followed by the hyaluronic acid serum and when I rub it on, the dead skin comes off easily.  I then follow up with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Only been using this 1 week so as far as results not sure but love the smooth texture of product.  Feels good going on and feels like it goes in doesn&#x27;t just stay on top.  It came in great shape and quickly</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for a long period of time but it seems to be very hydrating. I will review it in a month.</li>
            <li> After consistently using this product I truly see a difference. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week so far, so not sure of all results.  So far I like it.  It&#x27;s a mix of a gel and liquid texture.  Seems to absorb pretty good and hydrates my skin.  I used it after having fractional laser to help with the post healing.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, saw immediate results, now few days later, my mature aging skin looks &amp; feels almost like a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> It work&#x27;s really good... its the best one yet! I am sure to tell all my friends about this product..</li>
            <li> I dont know if it works yet - but it feels good, doesn&#x27;t hurt (have sensitive skin and often good stuff hurts!) so if I see ANY improvement -I&#x27;ll be thrilled!</li>
            <li> It is ok.  I have found this product to burn my face. I guess I will try using it again after giving my skin a rest.  I do not recommend using it under your eye area though.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT COMPARE TO DR. DENESE&#x27;S FACE SERUMS!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> The problem I have with this has nothing to do with the seller, but the product itself.  Not only did this not make my face feel great, but it actually dried it out.  Apparently, this is just not a good product for me.  I read the reviews which is why I bought it so it does work for some people.  Just be aware that it could have the reverse effect.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. I am quite sure it is the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I personally thought this product was excellent! I  have tried a few, this one is the best, purest so far!&lt;br /&gt;It goes into your skin ...and I like how my skin looks after wards. I will order this one again! Gives you a much younger appearance.</li>
            <li> Great, affordable, 2 small drops are all I need to cover my face and neck, sinks into the skin really quick.</li>
            <li> Very good product, after applying this product my skin was glowing. Gives your skin a healthy glow without an oily face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels younger already!  If you have and scars or acne probs this stuff is fast acting!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this in combo with another product by same company for a month. My really small super fine lines have gone but really no big change. I was hoping for more drastic results this far into using. I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect! I dont use it for wrinkles,  I&#x27;m only 19, but its great for dark spots and giving your face a smooth glow!  For the price i don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anything better, I love it.</li>
            <li> It is a great product! I can feel softness on my face.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone-sensitive-moody-adult-woman skin! That being said, i am always on the hunt for a good skin product. So far it was always a battle of pros and cons (if it helps with acne - than it causes over-dryness, if it is a good moisturizer than it&#x27;s causing acne etc). This seems to work with no cons, It&#x27;s not helping my acne so much (but not aggravating it either), but it&#x27;s definitely helping with moisture (especially in these cold days). It&#x27;s hard to say if it&#x27;s one of those keeper products... I&#x27;ve been using it a little bit over a month now.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite Hyaluronic acid thus far! I love the texture and the quality. You only need this serum and all your troubles go away. It&#x27;s the best hidden secret to skin care. I utilize this as my everyday regimen before I apply my moisturizer and my skin is brightened, and moisturized. This product also boosts cell renewal so any scars or pimples, it&#x27;ll heal quick!</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I bought it twice and will buy more!</li>
            <li> Great product.  After 2 weeks of using it, my husband said &#x27;are you using something different on your face, your skin looks smoother&#x27;.  This from a man who notices almost nothing.  Great product.</li>
            <li> happy with this product</li>
            <li> Too soon for an opinion. Seems good</li>
            <li> Delivered in timely manner even during Holidays.  Love it</li>
            <li> Been tested, it should be genuine, but not used in the face, I think it should be good.</li>
            <li> I love it  I have ordered it 3 times. it has made a difference</li>
            <li> Great product. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great hyaluronic acid serum. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin really soft</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed anything different from using this product. I primarily purchased it because of its high ratings and reviews. Maybe I have to wait longer to see a difference?  Who knows?</li>
            <li> I love this hyaluronic acid!! It instantly tighten my skin and it made my skin silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing again once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I have used a different product in the past that was in a gel composition.  This is a pure liquified form.  I am unable to determine yet which product is more effective, if there is going to be a difference in results. The only thing I can say is that I prefer working with the gel formula.&lt;br /&gt;--UPDATE--June 18, 2015.  I have now had the opportunity to use this product on a regular basis for about 3 to 4 weeks and I LOVE this PURE FORM of the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  As I previously stated, I had always used a gel formula and was happy with that product.  This is truly the pure form and completely liquid, dispensed with a dropper.  I was at first hesitant but I AM MUCH HAPPIER with this product.  My wrinkles seem to be responding better to this pure, liquid form.  I have revised my rating to a five star and am getting ready to order another bottle while it is available and very reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li> The serum is wonderful makes your skin feel renewed.</li>
            <li> Healing and moisturizing to skin love this product have suffered from acne and through the healing process this has helped with dark spot removal and scars will continue to use this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on 49 years old and this is exactly what I needed. Non greasy, goes on smoothly and feels great. The best part of this is to see your face in the morning. Awesome looking and ready for your make-up. I only use at . Nights. Will definitely be buying more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Loving this product! Great deal! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product a year ago, and never got around to writing a review.  I came across this when I was looking for a serum.  I was intrigued by all the wonderful reviews.  I took a look at the one star reviews and saw reviews that said it dries your skin, but I took a chance on it anyway.  Maybe my skin was sensitive to it, but it really did dry my skin!!!  I only used it twice and I just had to stop trying it again, thinking that maybe it was just a fluke.  I was so disappointed and annoyed thinking I finally found a great serum.  My face was SO dry that my face was white all over! It made me wonder whether all these positive reviews are real??</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really plumps your skin.</li>
            <li> This one did not do anything effective for my skin...</li>
            <li> Love it!  Need to buy a new bottle...I wish they could offer this in a way you could use on your whole body!  I had some contact dermatitis, it cleared it right up, and it makes your skin really nice, especially in the cold air.  I use it it with a little coconut oil and sunblock.  Don&#x27;t use much, it goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think does anything for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the result yet</li>
            <li> I only gave it 2 stars as I&#x27;m just on my first bottle...and it&#x27;s half-way there.&lt;br /&gt;I shall keep check back within a month.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as faithfully as I should, so I haven&#x27;t seen any major, long term results (my own fault) but when I do use it as consistently as I should my skin feels so incredibly soft, without exaggeration, I can honestly say it truly does feel as soft as baby skin.  And I&#x27;m 65, so that&#x27;s saying something.  It&#x27;s a serum, but it&#x27;s so light it sinks right in, and a tiny bit goes a LONG way. I would certainly recommend this to others without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smooth and non-greasy this serum makes my skin look and feel great. Great as a base to any moisturizer and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, does exactly what it says on my skin. I use it after my mandelic acid to prevent dryness. So far it keeps my skin soft and supple and moist.</li>
            <li> I mix this in with my c serum, works great, so I give it 5 stares for quality and quantity</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the product on my skin...it&#x27;s none-greasy as advertised. It was easily absorbed by the skin and left a silky, fresh feel. I saw immediate glow of my skin the morning after I applied it. I&#x27;m highly satisfied and have recommended to my sisters who have already placed their orders. I will re-order for my continuous use.</li>
            <li> not sure I see any plumping of skin occuring, which is why I bought this.very thin, clear liquid, is it really doing anything beyond a little moisturizing?</li>
            <li> My experience with Hyaluronic Acid Serum has been amazing. The package is nice and secure with thick bubble wrap. I am in my mid 30s and have always had skin problems especially acne scars and uneven skin tone.I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 2 months and I have gradually been seeing positive results everyday. I highly satisfy with the effect it has on my skin. That made me feel so good that I did work well on my skin tone and my scar acne had faded. My skin is soft and tightened. Amazing product and can recommend to anyone. I will definitely get more bottles when the first one is finished :-)</li>
            <li> Ordered this serum because it is only Hyaluronic acid without other vitamins etc. It seems to be just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Meh, didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. Didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference. The consistency is like water and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to mix with another product for a facial treatment and I love it. Great product for the money and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why they say is 100% pure- highest quality. It is not! I have used Hyaluronic Acid Serums in the past for Micro needling treatments. This product dries almost instantly when applied- which is the complete opposite of what it supposed to do. It contains mostly water and alcohol. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the &amp;#34;Best- Selling&amp;#34; title. It may be the best selling but it is not the best product. It also took forever for shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44, purchased a month ago, haven&#x27;t seen any difference in look or feel of my skin, used it morning and night.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money. I was really hopeful :-(</li>
            <li> I am so sorry that this product wasn&#x27;t right for my skin type.....I would have loved for it to be the ome, but it wasn&#x27;t and the Cosmedica people were very nice when I needed to return it......the got back to me quickly and realized that every skin is not alike.....thank you Cosmedica for acting so quickly!</li>
            <li> This hyaluroic acid is the best! After washing my face and neck I apply the HA, to both my face and neck, even under and around my eyes. It absorbs quick and it really boasts the abosbtion of retinol and mosturizer. Lines fade much faster and plump up. I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I think it has only been a week and already I see a big improvemnt in my skin. My wrinkles don&#x27;t seems so deep. I spray either a rose water or lavender spray on then the HAS. Then I apply my regular moisturizer. I use this am and pm. My moisturizers seems to work better and leave my skin softer. I used to have to reaply my date morsturizer a couple times a day. Now just once an I dont&#x27; feel so tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recomment this and I know I will be buying again. The size is big, so purchase for awhile.</li>
            <li> I will be 75 years old next month. My face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom. I use it as a base and then use coconut oil to do my face exercises. No one believes that I am (almost) 75 and have been through cancer surgery, open heart surgery and eight other major surgeries.</li>
            <li> Seems like just water in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I Love this product it goes on very good. Hope ladies will try this it has made my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> Wow... this product gave me what it talks about. I am fully satisfied and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product and I am happy with the results.  My skin feels soft but I must use a moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now...but not religiously. I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s doing anything. They say it helps moisturizer absorb into your skin. My skin seems a little less dry I guess.</li>
            <li> I order this product for my wife...she like it and said it&#x27;s a wonderful product</li>
            <li> awesome! and resolve my problem! I love it.</li>
            <li> The Price is great! The quality is great! I haven&#x27;t had long enough to be 100% sure that its as good as my regular Hyaluronic , but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> My THIRD order of this, and I will be reordering a fourth. It truly adds moisture after I apply my Vit-C serum. A great product, a great price for the quality. I keep it in the fridge with the Vit-C and it is cool and soothing after a good face wash with my Clarisonic face brush.</li>
            <li> i like the one with the pump better, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I can&#x27;t even tell you how happy I am that I found this product. So many compliments on my skin. Texture has improved. I ran out and have gone w/o it for a few days and my skin looks dull and my pores look huge. This product is one I will order again and again. It&#x27;s an amazing deal, it lasted a little over two months using it twice a day on my face and once a day on my chest and tummy.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this brand for awhile . I have used another brand for a little longer and have seen results, but with this brand it seems to have gotten more hydrated and fewer wrinkles around the eyes. It just takes a small amount for face, eyes and neck and should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I just got this, today, and applied it. I&#x27;m switching from a &amp;#34;medical grade&amp;#34; that I&#x27;d gotten from the spa- it was a small sample-sized tube included in a kit for problem skin ($20 for a week&#x27;s supply). This stuff has the same feel and consistency as that (the larger bottle of the other product was $60), though it almost seems like it smelled a bit different. It feels wonderful- hydrating, but doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;heavy,&amp;#34; like it would clog the pores. As long as it doesn&#x27;t make me break out (and if it does, I will update this), I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is soothing and comfortable on my skin without making me greasy.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> So far , I like the serum. Several people have mentioned how nice my skin looks and asked what I&#x27;m doing. I hadn&#x27;t really noticed but if people keep commenting I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m doing something right . So yes , the serum is spot on!!!</li>
            <li> I agree this product delivers. My skin felt youthful with continued use. Highly recommend it. Combine it with vitamin C for better results.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of Hyaluronic Acid Serum I&#x27;ve tried, and I like this one much better.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night after I wash my face, and in the morning under my make-up, with just a dab&lt;br /&gt;of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been researching skin care products for some time. My goal, to find products that are pure and does not contain sodium benzoate. I am thrilled with this product and the customer service is INCREDIBLE. I received several notes on the best uses for products I order from them. Very happy and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Just got done using it and I don&#x27;t see any difference however I have used others with the same result (no difference).</li>
            <li> I am still hopping to see better results , and I may order another one since every one say I should use hyaluronic acid with my derma roller .</li>
            <li> The term &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; is definitely misleading.  I expected it to burn but, of course, it did not.  It does seem to rehydrate my skin very nicely!</li>
            <li> Works great for my skin.Has been using it for more than a month and my skin fells and looks younger .</li>
            <li> My girl has been trying to get me on whatever creams and moisturizers she could for a couple of years. Crows feet, forehead lines, whatever, name it. So I found this browsing on my own here and bought it. Three months later a miracle has occurred and I&#x27;m looking smoother. Much smoother. Toned face, seriously 10 years younger sometimes. Especially when I do the salmon, salad and berry diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my girl starts really complimenting me and the comments about the lines on the face have completely stopped. Now she noticed that my ears are bigger than she thought.  Great. After I fix them I&#x27;m afraid to ask what&#x27;s next. Seriously, great great stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much difference.  I&#x27;ve had cr√®mes with this type product in it and liked it.  This just seemed to not do much of anything.  Again,  may just be me.  Shipping was as promised.</li>
            <li> When I used this product the way it said to do, I was thoroughly satisfied the way it worked. I used Amazon&#x60;s Retinol as the moisturizer and my skin felt so soft and a I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and live in a very dry climate.  This has really helped.  Love the additional moisture and I can use it around my eyes without irritation.</li>
            <li> Absolutely THE best serum to put on your face!!! I use this serum daily to keep my face moisturized. After washing your face (or hands, arms, etc.), use the serum before your lotion. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now and I can&#x27;t live without it! Highly recommend!! Great price!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum .. while i bought this as a anti aging treatment and I am sure that&#x27;s the intended use ... Hyaluronic Acid is a incredibly versatile substance. Good for joints as well ! I love this product .. you will see an instant change!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve noted only slight changes in my skin. We&#x27;ll wait and see if my skin really changes to know if I&#x27;d purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable improvements to skin since I started using it religiously twice a day for over a month. Must be followed by a moisturizer as the serum feels a bit dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have spent a LOT more for half the volume!  Will last a VERY long time and does such a nice job.</li>
            <li> No weird chemicals in it and it goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to try it for a longer period to actually see if there are improvements</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hyaluronic acid serum over my anti-oxidant (and under mu moisturizer) on my face, neck and chest  for the last year and love it!  It&#x27;s great for hydration, and really plumps up those fine lines.  This brand is reasonably priced and ships quickly.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I thought I would give it a try. Been using it nearly 2 weeks and although I don&#x27;t SEE any improvement in my skin; I can FEEL that my skin seems tighter. I will continue to use it and see what happens. It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very light and moisturizing. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out on a whim- this did not cause breakouts or any other skin problems. I usually mix 2-3 drops of this with my favourite moisturizer or 100% pure shea butter and it does wonders to keep skin hydrated- which is a huge plus in harsh Canadian winters!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommended!</li>
            <li> I had heard many great things about this serum and wanted to try it. It seems to be working. My skin feels softer and much more hydrated since I have been using.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> After reading about this product and the good reviews by others who have used it, I decided to give it a try.  I have not used it very long but so far I like the results.  My facial skin is softer, smoother and brighter looking.  No adverse reactions noted thus far so I am going to continue to use it.  So far, I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate skin like the advertisement says. Temporary hydration lasts only and hour or so? Also, I swear after the first two times I used it I broke out.  Such a shame.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Thank you so much. I&#x27;ve tried so many products throughout my 45 years and they all feel oily or heavy or both. None of these products leave me feeling those things. I have been running around without makeup! My cheeks are naturally pink and soft with no breakout and about 15 minutes after application my face has that feeling you get when you walk out after a facial. And all I did was wash, spray and pat! Amazing! Awesome job! Don&#x27;t forget your neck! Also, if you have excess don&#x27;t wash your hands, rub it into the backs of your hands. Every part of you deserves to look young.</li>
            <li> I got for my mom and she really likes it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple months ago and use it a couple times a week. It makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t report any extraordinary results from it. Didn&#x27;t hurt either...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. Also available in time without problems.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this here because of the price.  I&#x27;ve used this product before and really like it.  If you want to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, this will do it.  It hydrates the top layers of your skin and plumps them up so your lines get smoothed out.  Works brilliantly for that.  It does dry your skin if you use too much, so go easy with it.  I also had skin irritation when I used too much, slight burning and redness.  But with the right moisturizer, this isn&#x27;t a problem.  I also want permanent change in my skin, so I have experimented with a whole lot of products and now have a great, affordable anti-aging skin care regimen.    First, I beg to differ with the other commenters here that you can&#x27;t reduce lines and wrinkles.  Yes you can.  It&#x27;s more difficult if you are addicted to sun or cigarettes - they are the worst for your skin (alcohol isn&#x27;t great either), but I had deep crevices on my forehead, heavy lines around my eyes and lips and they are gone.  Not anymore.  In addition to this product (this is the best hyaluronic acid product), I made a daily ritual of a retinol cream at night - best results were from [[ASIN:B00027DMI8 RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream, 1 Ounce]] - this product in the morning, and morning and night I use my all time, never live without, the one thing I would pack for a desert island, [[ASIN:B00BD822BI Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment - Intensive Anti Aging, Facial Lift Skin Care Formula - 1.5oz]].  The retinol helps your skin turn over faster so that helps eliminates lines and wrinkles.  The hyaluronic acid plumps up your skin so they aren&#x27;t as noticeable, and the bel essence gives your skin the vitamins, fatty acids, omega 3&#x27;s and 6&#x27;s that are needed to build healthy new skin, minus the lines, wrinkles and dark spots.  The bel essence also relieves the harshness of using retinol and hyaluronic acid, especially if you have dry to sensitive skin like me.  I was shocked that an all natural product could erase wrinkles, but the bel essence is fabulous and even when I stop using the Roc for a while, the bel essence keeps working on the lines and dark spots.  Only product I have ever used that gave consistent and permanent results.  Add weekly exfoliating (I use a clay mask), and my skin is now, after a year, so smooth, soft, and skin tone is so great, that the only make up I wear is blush and mascara.  I started seeing some instant results, the bel essence and hyaluronic acid hydrated my skin immediately and made it look good, but after a couple of months, I was seeing permanent change.  I use the same regimen on my neck and hands, and I get compliments all the time about how young I look, how soft my skin is and that I have a glow to my skin.  The lines on my neck are gone, and my hands don&#x27;t look like old lady crepe skin.  I look better than I did 10 years ago.  The right combination of products makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I use it right after getting out of the shower. My skin gets really tight and dry after i shower. This keeps that from happening. but not sure if it really helps skin retain moisture in the long run (i&#x27;ve been using this since sept of 2014). The first time I bought the 2oz bottle. I liked the product and bought the 8 oz because i&#x27;m planning to make this product part of my regular regime. I also bought the 1 oz bottle so that I refill the smaller bottles when they run out (i keep the 2 oz in the bathroom for after shower use, and the 1 oz in my bedroom for before going to bed). The 2 oz bottle was made of glass. The 8 oz is plastic, not glass. I was pretty disappointed about that. didnt expect that at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks (consistently) and have seen great results. I like that its not too greasy and very light, so my skin hasnt had a bad reaction or broken out. Usually, when I try a new product my skin will go through a period of adjusting but not with this! It has been wonderful. My skin feels really soft and smooth- so far, so good! I know this will be heaven during the winter when my skin gets really dry. I would definitely recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use it but its definitely not as amazing as the reviews say about it. I can&#x27;t really see if its working, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference like many of the other reviews make it seem like it does.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Goes right into the skin. Makes your skin more even and younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;And can&#x27;t beat the price, its great!</li>
            <li> Just got this product in the mail a week ago and the difference in my skin is so noticeable to others and myself. My skin feels hydrated and fresh, been using it with my usual skincare and it has made a difference. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Perfect for those who don&#x27;t want to put heavy cream on your face at night! I apply this on my face and neck two times a day.&lt;br /&gt;I tried out other hyaluronic acid products but this one is the best so far. Try this product if you have oily combination skin (or acne skin). Perfect combi with Mario Badescu glycolic acid cleansing lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I decided to see what all the hype is about, and let me tell you the stuff in this little bottle is amazing. I&#x27;m a bit of a beauty product junkie and always looking for a way to help combat those little lines and wrinkles. Lines are minimized and my skin feels like butter. I not only use it on my face but my hands as well. I&#x27;ve even tried it on my legs which are always super dry no matter what and now they are smooth as can be. Great value a def must try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a bit over a week and am very pleased with the increased hydration in my skin.  The first few times I used it, my skin was so dry that it immediately absorbed the product.  Now, after only a week, I have to lightly pat my skin with my fingertips for about a minute so that it will absorb the hyaluronic acid!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer, highly recommend.  Does not feel greasy &amp; is quickly absorbed into the skin.  No fragrance, too, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this serum. Price and quality make it a great value.</li>
            <li> Sorry but I didn&#x27;t see any difference before and after using this product</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a couple of months now and think that it is giving me some good results.  My skins appears to be smoother and less wrinkled.  I will continue to use this product as it works better that a lot of other products for very little money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beauty junky and I came across the product and purchased it simply for that reason. I love the texture of this! It&#x27;s smooth and doesn&#x27;t need a ton to cover my whole face. It immediately softens the skin, is not harsh at all (and I have very dry sensitive skin), and I love that I can just apply it before putting on my sun screen. This is my easy, on the go product in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Very pleased, I have been using this for over a month and can feel &amp; see the difference</li>
            <li> I waited several weeks before posting to give this product time to work. It&#x27;s good stuff and I will buy again.  Makes my skin very smooth and has also improved my complexion. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have had lines around my eyes  for quite a while and this product really reduces them. I have even had a few (yes, more than one!!) people tell me I have no lines!! WHAT!? HA! Being a FL girl who never wore sunscreen or sunglasses I had lines at 16! (I am in my 30&#x27;s). Hearing complements on my eye area skin was something I never expected.&lt;br /&gt;I add a drop to my eye cream and to my night cream about 4 drops to cut down on time. However, I often dab a few drops on, allow it to dry, and then apply my lotions -better result this way in my opinion. The bottle will last quite a while. I have had it a couple of months and it is 2/3 full still (I even used it all over my chest for a few days after a sunburn -and I didn&#x27;t peel!). I have considered putting some in a smaller bottle to keep in my bathroom and put the large bottle in the fridge to keep it fresh longer.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t going to make deep creases vanish but for tightening and plumping squint lines it is amazing! I can&#x27;t say enough about it and am very pleased with what it does for my skin!</li>
            <li> This one I am using over a month or so. Now I am seeing some visible changes in the appearance of my skin. It is visibly smooth&lt;br /&gt;Can suggest this one to friends.</li>
            <li> I love this Dr OZ had it on his show so I Thought I would give it a try . I have people ask me what I use on my face. You have to try this it has been the best</li>
            <li> Love it!  My face feels tighter and moisturized... will always use it and have it as part of my daily routine.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is my favorite for moisturizing my face. I use it with a little bit of bio oil. It goes on smooth, with a little bit of thickness to it at first but dries weightless. The bottle is a good size, as you only need a very small amount per use. I&#x27;ve tried other brands ans this one feels like a better quality to me.</li>
            <li> No complaints for the price. Wish it were thicker. I used another brand prior to this (dr grandel) and that brand really made my face soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> nothing to mention.  It is ok..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of it&#x27;s because of this product but not only I love my skin, but everyone around me! Just for the record I have 3 year old and 3 months old babies, no sleep ever and yeah, I am a hundred thirty one years old!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and company! My wrinkles seem to be going away, amazing stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> I try in many kind of serum. But I love this one it helped for skin. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels going on. I hope its working on my skin. But I think I have to wait a few weeks to see if there is a difference. Its suppose to be good for your skin, so that being said, I love it. The price is right, and it feels real nice going on. Nice and slippery, also dries quickly and non sticky.</li>
            <li> I received on time.  My face is very soft.  I also use on my hands as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on a friend&#x27;s recommendation, and I have been using it for a while but have not noticed any change in my skin. You dont need to apply to much. For me, I drop one drop on each cheek and that&#x27;s plenty to spread all over your entire face. It has a sticky feeling as you pat it on, and like I said, I did not notice any major change to my skin. It&#x27;s still dry and I felt that it didn&#x27;t do much for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin, which was why i bought it. I do not think that it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Have only used for a few days now but I can already see my skin glowing and brightening! great price too!</li>
            <li> works to brighten your skin... lots of compliments</li>
            <li> This is my go to serum right after I wash my face. It makes my skin feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Dear reader,&lt;br /&gt;As most of you are skeptical when buying something for the first time I‚Äôm sure, so was I when decided to try this product. But I figured, why not? I tried so many other things; how else am I going to find out if they work on ME?&lt;br /&gt;My face is mixed oily and dry. I‚Äôve got a lot of acne scars- I used to have a bad habit of touching my face with my hands all the time and that didn‚Äôt help either. A lot of different things I tried either over dry my skin or make it oilier. This time I used baby wash for my face, derma roller with 0.5mm needles and this product.&lt;br /&gt;After only 2 uses, my skin tone is more even, my skin is brighter and all-in-all it looks better. No matter how much of this product I put on my face, everything just soaks in. I used it 2X a day: in the morning I wash my face and apply serum first and facial cream with vitamin C on top of it. Before I step out I apply CC cream with SPF and that‚Äôs it. My skin still looks radiant and beautiful. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, my scars are still visible but less noticeable since my skin tone is evening out-with no pronounced redness or discoloration. Before I go to sleep I wash my face again (I do it religiously every night), apply derma roller all over my face and neck and then I put serum and Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;I‚Äôm not saying you should apply the same regiment as I do but what I‚Äôm saying is that every woman deserves to be beautiful. But not every woman can afford to buy expensive creams or go to spa every month. This serum is dirt cheap when you compare it to results it can produce and when used in combination with derma roller (they call it a miracle tool for skin perfection-cheap alternative to derma fillers), at least for me it does wonders. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly, but initially gave me dry patches around my lower lip.  I only got to use it for about 5 days. Then, I accidentally knocked it into the sink and it shattered.  So much for that.  My fault, but wasted my $.  Company should re-think their packaging.</li>
            <li> This product is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hydrates, it brightens slightly and it&#x27;s so inexpensive!&lt;br /&gt;I find I need less moisturiser after applying the serum yet my face feels smoother and softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even use it occasionally on my legs. And it has helped tremendously with my ingrown hair. Sorry if it&#x27;s TMI&lt;br /&gt;but I just wanna help follow sufferers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please keep selling this product at the same price!!</li>
            <li> This is a great hyaluronic acid. I have used 4 other brands and this one tops the list. I will be reordering again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a day but I love the way my skin feels already. I cleansed my face like I normally do every morning. I used a small amount, about the size of small button on my face and neck. Then I applied my moisturizer on top. My skin feels amazing!!! If it feels this good after one application, I can&#x27;t wait to see how it is in one month. I will check back then with an updated review.</li>
            <li> it is ok and it works</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and was pleased with the results. It really did reduce the appearance of a couple of stubborn lines I had on my forehead. I love this in the summertime when my combination skin needs a more lightweight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The tube is after 2 weeks almost empty and I have missed a few nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My overall application was sparse to save the fluid. Applicator  is bad</li>
            <li> Soon as I put this on my face I felt fabulous. I received this yesterday and already see a difference. I wash my face, put on the product and then use my moisturizer. Can&#x27;t wait to see how I look in a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> I had heard about hyaluronic acid and I want it to try it myself. I&#x27;m glad I did. This is a great moisturizer!! I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now and my skin feels softer and plumper. I apply it at night after rinsing my face, and the next morning I can feel the product is still there when I wash my face the next morning.  It doesn&#x27;t rub off! This is great because the product works all night on my skin, nourishing and moisturizing it. It&#x27;s so good that my dry and rough patches are gone! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum! Just love the thickness and quality of this product. It also helps keep my skin clear and hydraded. I&#x27;m definitely ordering this product as we speak. I have only used it for a month but really like the results. I would recommended this product for sensitive or acne prone skin. I have a heavy routine in to clearing my skin. This has played a big part into helping prevent future acne.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and have been for the past week or so. It&#x27;s truly fabulous!! Never before have I  found a product that actually works....wonders!!! My fine lines are disappearing and blemishes seem to fade like magic. The overall quality of my skin has become at least what it was 5 years ago!!! Bravo!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very runny and watery.  Nothing like the Hyaluronic acid I&#x27;m used to - not soothing nor plumping.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this serum, after carefully reading all of the reviews, as well as reading in a magazine that hyaluronic serum holds up to 1000% its weight in water. Not only does it not hydrate my skin, I think it makes my skin even dryer. I&#x27;ve bought hundreds of products on Amazon, and this is the first time that I&#x27;m completely baffled by why something received so many glowing reviews. My advice: try something else!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product in comparison to other hydrating serums/creams but if used alone,doesn&#x27;t make miracles.I mean before you apply it on the face, take care of your pores(open them by keeping your head over boiling water because steams open pores and Cosmetics penetrate better your skin), apply the serum and after that, apply a good moisturization cream.Only if used daily in that way before you go to sleep, you will see a significant difference(sorryfor being strict, my skin has always been dry)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I saw a difference in my skin in one week.  Great when you use a moisturizer on top.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and the results are MIRACULOUS!  At 63 years old I am mistaken for someone in my 40&#x27;s daily! I&#x27;d love to be a spokesperson for this product because it WORKS!</li>
            <li> Purchased as it was well rated...I have dry skin so I wanted to add this to my moisturizer.  Works great and holds moisture a long time!  I like the feeling of my skin when I have it on...a nice barrier in dry conditions, such as flying, cold weather...good stuff!</li>
            <li> Really like this product,. It is light, absorbs quickly and leaves skin moist and looking refreshed.  I use it daily with another day time moisturizer or alone at night.  I think fine lines are less noticeable</li>
            <li> This product is so good for aging skin, fine line, and wrinkles.  It isn&#x27;t greasy or oily, has no odor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go a day without this stuff! Gives my skin more life and leaves it plump.</li>
            <li> Waste of money! Does not do anything to your skin. Like one person said before, it&#x27;s just like putting water on your face. Overrated.</li>
            <li> I actually really enjoy this and am seeing results. I mix 2 drops of it with my moisturizer and apply before going to bed. Skin looks radiant and feels so soft!</li>
            <li> Noticed a change in skin after a couple of days of use. It is definitely a good product, give it a try if you&#x27;re thinking about it.</li>
            <li> This was the first skin product that was way above expectation.. my skin never been better and the results were almost immediate.. i will be a regular customer and i feel happy that i gave it a try</li>
            <li> I am on Retin-A 0.05% for adult acne. The Retin-A works very well for me, but there are certain parts of my face (right below my nostrils, and the center of my chin below my lip) that just peel and peel and peel and still haven&#x27;t adjusted to the Retin-A even after being on it for 3 years now. It&#x27;s downright embarrassing and so awful looking to go out with skin just falling off all the time. I would have to exfoliate the skin off quite abrasively regularly to keep it from looking disgusting, which would then just aggravate that area and cause breakouts. But I didn&#x27;t want to stop the Retin-A because it makes the rest of my face look great from it. So I tried this product. It is FANTASTIC. I have no more peeling!! It seriously eliminated that side effect of the Retin-A. LOvE IT. Already on my second bottle and plan to be a regular user.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff when I put it on by itself. But I put a few droppers-full in my lighter lotions and now they go on like oil. Instead of the skin absorbing it and going back to how it normally feels, it makes the lotion act like sunscreen- an oily, shiny layer that collects dust. I think my lotion is ruined.</li>
            <li> To me this product is essential morning and night.  It is the first product on put on my face after I clean it.  Soaks right in the results and the wonderful.  It is a must!!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever!  My skin looks and feels fresh!  It practically glows!</li>
            <li> This worked wonders on my face!  I bought this because small bumps started growing on my forehead and I am already 30 years old, no history of acne or whatsoever.  After 1 week of using this product my whole forehead was clear again... thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent combined with Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> I hesitate to leave a comment as I don&#x27;t want demand and subsequently price to jump. This product is amazing. I noticed improvement in small eye wrinkles in 2-3 weeks. I did mix the serum in straight organic shea butter. It blended easily and leaves no greasy feel. The other great thing is that you do not need a ton of this to see results. If you use it directly, just a couple of drops for under each eye is it.&lt;br /&gt;This has turned out, for me anyway, the find of the year.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I use it twice a day under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product. I noticed the different on my skin. Might not affect immediately but after few weeks of using, my skin looks better, fresher and smoother. This is my 2nd time purchasing this product. I recommended to my mom and she is getting one. Let see how she likes it. I hope she likes it as much as I do. Plus good price.</li>
            <li> I add this product to my other moisturizers and it blends in well.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short while, so haven&#x27;t seem significant results just yet.  My opinion is that if you can use or add hyaluronic acid serum to to your normal moisturizing routine, it&#x27;s a good thing since it helps your skin retain moisture.  This is especially important to me since I live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> I saw hyaluronic acid while browsing another seller&#x27;s page , I didn&#x27;t know anything about it but I&#x27;ve liked the few \\&quot;serum\\&quot; type products  I had tried these last months, so I added it to my \\&quot;cart\\&quot; However, as tends to happens (all too often!) on \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;, the price increased $2.00 before I completed the purchase. So, I deleted it, but still curious about the product, and found this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  There is a wide price range for this stuff depending what brand and who&#x27;s selling it, from this seller I got twice the product for $4.00 less than the brand I originally intended to buy before they got greedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  True, other lines have vitamins as well in their serums, but I get enough of that from other face products I think. This product&lt;br /&gt;works as promoted, that I am sure about! I&#x27;ve had no negative skin reactions whatsoever! Dries quickly and odorless, (to me!) Anyway, just throw some moisturiser on after and go!&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m a 60 year old \\&quot;wash and wear\\&quot; male, and am always looking&lt;br /&gt; for a more efficient, faster method with fewer \\&quot;steps\\&quot; to get from the shower to the door, and so this product is ideal for me. The left side of my face/head has proven to be resistant to products that work great on the other side, you know, the side that HASN&#x27;T BEEN HANGING OUT THE DRIVER&#x27;S SIDE WINDOW FOR 40 YEARS! This product has DRAMATICALLY improved those areas, softening and blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  For a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; person, one bottle would last forever, but I&#x27;m a guy, clumsy, usually sleepy when applying, and always in a rush, so of course I&#x27;ve dumped the bottle twice! Still have a half a bottle, but ordered another yesterday, JUST IN CASE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  All things considered, a very good product at a price almost anyone can take a chance on, which is always a factor when I&#x27;m considering the purchase of a previously unknown product!</li>
            <li> I really like this. It goes on non greasy, and I can actually feel it tightening my skin a bit. It seems to make the wrinkles less noticeable. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> I like the hyaluronic acid serum. Considering I buy it from other companies for as much as $75 a  bottle. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and that is plump the skin temporarily. The price is right and it lasts a long time. Would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, the product is great and I really like. I go asthetics schools &amp; I know from my classes how much benefict Hyaluric acid can be so beneficial. I am suprirse for the price. I added to my moiustureser, my skin looks more bright. I will order another bottle for my mom &amp; sister. You just nee a few drops.</li>
            <li> My mum has refused to use almost all skincare products, except this one. She&#x27;s been keeping telling me that she really loves it.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my normal moisturizers day and night for an added boost. Love it! It absorbs quickly and, while I&#x27;ve yet to notice any miraculous results, peps up my complexion on dull days after late nights just fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and cannot say how much I love this. I have used serums under my moisturizer that cost three times this amount and have never seen results like this. My skin looks amazing. My pores are smaller and I have smoother skin with fewer fine lines. I highly recommend giving this a try if you are considering it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Absorbs quick and moisturizes well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is wonderful. it goes on nice and clean, absorbs quickly and make up glides over it. i will use it forever and i highly recommend it. you will notice lines softening and a nice healthy luster. this never feels oily.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my moisturizer after I tone and apply retinol. It has made my skin look great. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel pretty good, but I got more out of it when I was younger.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it on my face and it feels so smooth and non greasy</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;m just not sure, but I feel like my skin is getting more even toned.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle of Hyaluronic Acid Serum,  It could all be my imagination, but I think the product works, makes my skin look better.  I&#x27;m 67....of course I have wrinkles and nothing short of plastic surgery will change that. The product is so easy to use and absorbs into the skin quickly. I would recommend it for anyone interested in trying something different than the creams that are out there.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I believe I was sent an old bottle of serum. The smell is awful - smells exactly like urine..cannot get past it. I am requesting a full refund and sendinf this back.</li>
            <li> So far so great! I layer it on top of my retin-a at night and under my sunscreen during the day. Only been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year.  It helps to soften the skin and any fine lines.  I put this on before any of my serums and creams.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she thought it would act fact than it has.  still using it and hoping it will do what it claims to do.  won&#x27;t purchase it again,</li>
            <li> I am only giving one star for the following reason:  This product arrived very quickly - five stars for that; The packaging looked ok on the outside, but the actual product box was damaged and the product was not sealed.  I am not even going to try this product on my skin for obvious reason.  Unfortunately, It was a waste of money, in my case.</li>
            <li> This product is satisfactory but does not absorb as well as other brands I have used.  You have to be very careful about the amount you apply or it will cause your makeup to pill.  I will try another brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase a $300 moisturizer but my sister insisted I looked for the pure ingredient that made that moisturizer extra especial. It was this! This serum is amazing, in 5 seconds you feel the skin tighten and absorbing. It just gives me a healthy appearance, not once has my skin dried up during this harsh Boston winter. I am 23 years old and I&#x27;ve been using the product for 4 months now and I will continue to use for a very long time --it&#x27;s all about prevention!!!</li>
            <li> Has made a huge difference in the lines around my mouth.  My skin loooves this product.  Highly recommend !!!</li>
            <li> Used in combination with the derma roller this is quite effective.  I&#x27;m sure even without the roller it would be effective.  All I can say is that it worked for me.  Your results may differ, but I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Great to use with needling. No smell, no reactions, right consistency.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum hoping to find a less expensive hyaluronic acid than what I have been using.  The number one ingredient in this serum is WATER, so it&#x27;s very runny and therefore hard to mix in with moisturizer or liquid foundation.  I also question whether it&#x27;s as effective as the other serum I&#x27;ve been using by Image Skin Care where the #1 ingredient is **hyaluronic acid**.  Yes, the Image Skin Care is much more expensive, but in this case I think you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;m not going to use this ... going back to what I know and what was recommended to me by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Good quality hyaluronic acid. Use in conjunction with vitamin c serum</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with Niacinamide Cream and it has made a huge difference in the smoothness of my skin and fine lines</li>
            <li> This product has done a great job on my facial skin and I though it quite affordable compared to the prices other vendors were offering.</li>
            <li> very good , I will get another one.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this product as a entry into some of the &amp;#34;Anti-aging&amp;#34; serums. It has surpassed my expectations. My skin looks smoother and feels amazing. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working....it&#x27;s a much cheaper version that I have previously purchased at Amazon, so let&#x27;s hope the long-term results are as good!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I think you should only have to do this one time-it is always the same I said it was good</li>
            <li> We appreciate the product.&lt;br /&gt;We are going to use them for a long time until we see some real benefit.</li>
            <li> Love this my face looks ten yrs younger- I&#x27;m 40 and look 30. Started using this two months ago &amp; what a difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been given the opportunity to try a couple different hyaluronic acid serums (at a reduced price for a review).  I am happy with the results of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I didn&#x27;t go into the testing phase of these serums believing that they would have miraculous results.  Let&#x27;s face it, there are very few products out there (if any) that can completely remove all your aging skin ailments.  But instead I rated the product on how well it does what hyaluronic acid is supposed to do - which is hydrate the skin.  I have combination skin - some patches of my face get extremely oily while some stay extremely dry.  So it is difficult for me to find that good balance where the oily spots are cleaned up and the dry spots are not dried out more.  So I&#x27;ve been testing each of the hyaluronic acids on a different spot of my face or hands where I have dryness issues.  I also have fairly sensitive skin, and my review also includes how well the product does without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular hyaluronic acid serum was tested on my forehead between my brows, where I often fight with dry, flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydration - As far as hydration goes, the product did well.  I did see a noticeable difference in the &amp;#34;flakiness&amp;#34; of my skin between my brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity - Unlike another product I had tried in the same area, this one did well to not irritate my skin.  I did not notice any redness or itching after using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application - The product was easy to apply.  It comes with an eye-dropper cap.  I just put a drop or two on the tips of my fingers and massaged it in.  I didn&#x27;t apply directly to  my forehead because I didn&#x27;t want it running down my nose.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product, and you can target just the areas that need hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel of product - I am generally not a fan of skincare products as I can always feel them lying on my skin.  I don&#x27;t like that sticky, heavy feeling that some products (especially sunblock) leave on your skin.  This serum did not leave me feeling sticky or uncomfortable.  It absorbed quickly and had no weighty feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on those categories, I think this product is a good hyaluronic acid serum.  And top it off with the fact that it is made in the USA, I do recommend it for your skin dryness issues.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not as good as the reviews make it seem. It is nice, but I have used far nicer serums. As with most other serums, you do need a moisturizer. The reviews said that a little went a long way, that&#x27;s a little misleading cause I feel like I use more of this than other serums.</li>
            <li> I add a few drops of this to my favorite moisturizer. Love it : )</li>
            <li> I am in my late fifties with dry skin in certain areas.  I have acne scarring and large pores.  This product has given me the appearance of smoother skin.  Also, when you first apply it, you can actually feel your skin tighten.  I highly recommend you give it a try.  I have been using for about two months.  I also use a moisturizing vitamin C cream at night.  Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Can see a visible difference in your skin after first use!</li>
            <li> A general,&lt;br /&gt;I do not like&lt;br /&gt;Maybe someone else like</li>
            <li> Wonderful. My skin showed a marked improvement in less than a week. I love this product!</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, my coworker told me my complexion looked great. He&#x27;s a guy, I didn&#x27;t think they noticed those things.</li>
            <li> My skin did not look or feel &amp;#34;ANY&amp;#34; different! Not impressed.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent. This is really a nice serum. Light and smooth. It reduces fine lines and keeps your skin looking radiant.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> this is amazing you know it gotta try</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Next time I will try the serum with Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels after I apply the toner .&lt;br /&gt;It is not sticky and penetrates well after a minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;Also it is so light that you don&#x27;t feel overloading your skin with products.&lt;br /&gt;I did not put the 5 stars , only because ,  you feel that is right for your face , neck and decollete , but I hope the benefits are long term and underneath.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product, results on my face and the price!</li>
            <li> I felt like it did help with the hydration level of my skin.  I used it after I washed my face and before I used my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a about one week now.  So far, I really like the way it feels under my regular face cream.  I will provide another update in about one month.  ps. Service was great!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Noticed results right away.</li>
            <li> The #1 ingredient is water. Have used faithfully with no results.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and moisture..</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. It seemed to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves skin soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Honestly have not noticed any difference. Feels like some layer on my skin that did not absorb. Not using it any more</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> Girls this is a miracle.  True miracle.  Used it just yesterday and today,  twice each day and already feel difference.  Happy!</li>
            <li> Great product, I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see a reduction in fine lines, but so far I really like it.  2 drops are plenty, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel oily or sticky.  Other products I&#x27;ve used, feels like I have a layer of make-up on, but this absorbs completely leaving my face feeling clean and fresh.  Hopefully, with time, I&#x27;ll see some of those fine lines disappearing!  From the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, I have faith that it will.  I would definitely recommend for others to try.</li>
            <li> Love the serum.. a little sticky but I layer it with other products.</li>
            <li> A repeter good product</li>
            <li> This is the best of the best serum that I have ever used in my life :) very good!!!!</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a little while but so far its great and it feels wonderful on my skin</li>
            <li> compared to my last bottle this batch has an oder. I can only hope it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> Tried the product for the first time based on  reviews by other users who have tried it.  Not effective as I&#x27;ve expected. Did not notice much of difference since I&#x27;ve started using it. Going back to the previous product.</li>
            <li> Love this! it absorbs well, I use it with my derma roller, because they say don&#x27;t let the skin dry up after derma rolling.  This serum keeps my skin soft and supple, and does not cause it to itch or become red like other harsher serums would after your skin has been &amp;#34;torn&amp;#34; by derma rolling.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected;however, It seem comprable to those product beginning with Regen...st  A bit strong for new-commers, but effective- watch out for fluid accumulation around nasal-labiel fold that causes drying/flaking.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> it was delivered promptly It was packaged properly&lt;br /&gt;the product is exactly what l expected&lt;br /&gt;i use it on my face everyday and it is doing what it is supposed to do  love it</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve ordered this. Helps keep my acne at bay. I dont&#x27; know if it helps with my PH balance or what but whatever it does it works for my acne prone skin. I usually don&#x27;t put anything on my face after applying this besides makeup. I use it in the morning and night. I feel like my acne gets out of control when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I purchase this regularly now. I can&#x27;t be without it. I add it to other products and use it on it&#x27;s own. This product has more benefits that can be listed and I particularly like this company.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell how the product works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a several months and after approximately 4 weeks I noticed my skin is smoother, less dry, brighter, &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; (in a good way) with less uneven skin tone. I do believe it has even smoothed out very superficial lines. I am extremely pleased with this product and was surprised with such positive results. I am in my late 60&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t expect any product to do as much as this one and I have tried many different products for aging skin over the years. The price is very inexpensive relative to what this product does. I do use more then the &amp;#34;suggested&amp;#34; amount each morning but my skin can handle this without any irritation. GOOD STUFF!</li>
            <li> Zero changes to my skin</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Eliminates wrinkles in minutes.  Adds lots of moisture to face.  Very easy to add to your face cream.</li>
            <li> works great with Organic Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;fine lines on upper lip have started to disappear and the pore around the nose area already appear smaller in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Thi is my second order, love this stuff my skin is so smooth after I apply this, I use morning and night.</li>
            <li> I have used only couple of days but really like so far. I can see some difference in the lines around my lips.</li>
            <li> I felt I needed to try this product due to my skin being so sun damaged from years in the sun. I am pusing 30 and I am starting to notice changes in my skin. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most of the harsh chemicals that are in other products. My skin is very acne prone as well and will normally flareup in breakouts if I try anythng new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that this product came with a doppler, making it easy to apply. I used this product on my face, and my chest and neck after showering at night. It comes in a 2 oz dark bottle. It didn&#x27;t have any strong ordor. It didn&#x27;t leave my face with any nasty residue. Went on very smoothly as I gently patted on my face. This  Hyaluronic Acid Serum was quick absorbing and was not oily or greesy. Every morning I would wake up with a fresh, clean, and smooth feeling face. I truly enjoy using Hyaluronic Acid Serum by Cosmedica because it is all NATURAL! I always appreciate when a product is ORGANIC. Yes it is VEGAN, free of parabens, does not have oils making your skin oily, dye free, free of any fragrances (which normally cause headaches to me) nor does it have any persavatives or fillers; which is amazing to me. Since using this best-selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum on my skin, I have noticed an improvment to my skin texture as it leaves my skin looking bright and feeling moisturized while the lines that I have noticed due to natural aging are diminished and appear much much softer. This must be due to the PROVEN anti aging properties the serum has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite things is the confidence Cosmedica has with the product results. They off 100% MONEY BACK GUARANTEE if you are not completly satisfied...but You WILL BE satisfied. I like that this best selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum for skin is 100% made in USA. This company also incorporates charitable donations made to Susan G Komen to support Breast Cancer Awareness. Any company that has great integrity such as this is good in my books. After using thisproduct for awhile, I am extremly satisfied with my results. I recieved this product for free or for a discounted price in exchange of my personal Honest and unbiased review. I am very appreciative and satisfied with the product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff.  Leaves my face so soft. As I have only used this 3 times, I can&#x27;t speak to long term.</li>
            <li> Recovering cystic acne sufferer here! Acne medication can leave your skin dry and peeling. This product immensely helps with skin hydration. I no longer need globs of moisturizer; my skin feels a lot plumper, the residual scarring seems less red and make up goes on smoother under this. I will be reordering! :)</li>
            <li> you can feel the difference</li>
            <li> great product!  will keep buying it!</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight as soon as I put it on. Not sure if it will keep the signs of aging at bay but does brighten the skin.</li>
            <li> I was expecting my skin to plump up like some of the others I have used like Kinerase. It&#x27;s sticky after its absorbs. Didn&#x27;t notice any results. It did come on time and in a clean package.</li>
            <li> This stuff is truly amazing. I&#x27;m a bit of a skin care addict--something tomdomwithbeing 65, I think.,this is one thing that truly does work and is very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Great Stuff,  I use it twice daily and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> This has been a part of my daily routine for about 3 weeks now and im seeing good results. A little goes a long way and I think I will be repurchasing soon. Ive seen a difference with my skin, its less flaky and some of my dry patches has decreased. I still use this with my night cream and in the morning my skin feels really moisturized. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels when I use this. I use it after cleansing, scrubbing, and toning. My skin is supple and smooth. It&#x27;s so well hydrated that my combination skin is now normal! I had to replace my oily skin makeup. I love it. A little goes a long way and it helps to put it on damp skin for maximum effect.</li>
            <li> Used after derarolling and love it! Cool gel package came fast and bottle was in tact and sealed. Very happy, will purchase again when I run out!</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing, I have no idea where these positive reviews are coming from but they must be paid for!</li>
            <li> Im so glad i bought this serum, it enhances every other serum to performe in a better way, I mix it with my other serum and they penetrate better in skin and show amazing results than before used alone without this hyaluronic serum.&lt;br /&gt;I need to use this evertime in my skincare regimen, this is a keeper , and the price is so good for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> works great. applied on face and heel :)</li>
            <li> Love this product !!! Extremely hid rating and non greasy :)</li>
            <li> I am 64 yrs old and have been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum for 2 yrs. My skin is soft and smooth. Wrinkles are there but softer too. I always have 2 of these .... 1 bottle I am using and 1 bottle in the cabinet so I never run out!! Love this product!</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.  I highly recommend it.  I also use it with vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything!</li>
            <li> the first time, I felt disappointed ... nothing because nothing smells like, do not like anything .. is soft., but after the passing of the day ... I began to see the difference, clearer skin, better. so ... I began to believe .. I use it with other products Obagi clear, obagi tretinoin and Elastin Collage St. Ives.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I have noticed the softness and the lines has soften or disappeared. Ordering again.</li>
            <li> skin feels firmer.  will I stay younger looking?? who knows for sure</li>
            <li> Perfect! Love this! It&#x27;s absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> Loves this serum. It dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is Great.  Will buy again.  Seems like it will last a long time.  Skin seems brighter.  Good price</li>
            <li> moisturizes no break outs and greasiness</li>
            <li> I gave this only one star because after two weeks of use I developed a rash all over my face which took another two weeks of slathering cortizone all over my face for it to go away. I had high hopes for this product which did seem to work then bang!! Now I have an almost full bottle that will have to be thrown away!!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. False advertising. Doesnt do anything.</li>
            <li> Best hyaluronic serum out there.  Ikeep reordering this brand, it is high quality, with budget-friendly pricing.</li>
            <li> This serum is a great find.  I&#x27;ve known for some time that hyaluronic acid was one of the best moisturizers, but the &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; products have only a small amount in their formulas and the companies charge a ridiculously steep price.  I&#x27;ve tried several moisturizing serums but would never re-order.  Using this serum  makes perfect sense.  It is easily applied and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell as some serums do.  You can even  use it in conjunction with another moisturizer.  I like a matte look, and this does not leave my face looking shiny, because it penetrates so quickly.  I&#x27;ve been applying this serum at least twice a day since I received it because it feels so good. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I just turned 40 and noticed my skin is much dryer than it used to be.  I put this on every day and my skin is dewy and soft.</li>
            <li> my skin is nice and  I can see my face getting tighter love it..</li>
            <li> Love it and my skin loves it !!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products for my skin and rarely feel there are any improvements in my skin, but I am ordering more of this product, which says I think it is worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After cleansing my face I use the Hyaluronic Serum on my face and rub it in with massage and then add Clinique  Repairwear Focus Factor on top of the Hyaluronic Serum, again massaging my face. Makeup for the day or moisturizer for night.  I really like the way my skin looks with these two. Since using the Hylaluronic first after washing I seem to get fewer annoying breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very hydrating for the skin and helps fade sun spots.</li>
            <li> Great product makes skin feel so hydrated!</li>
            <li> COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS</li>
            <li> Great product! Shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I use this after applying my vitamin C serum.  They work beautifully together!</li>
            <li> very nice product. i love it. make me feel very good and for the price is very recommendable. nice choice</li>
            <li> I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for the last couple of months. My face feels great and seems to look younger too!  I can really feel the difference on the days that I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> excellent product as advertised</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great......</li>
            <li> I am 24 and am using this serum every day in the morning. I really like the way my skin feels after it. I will see in the long run how it benefits my skin. I have extremely sensitive, acne prone skin with lots of acne scars and I feel after using this for the past 3 weeks, my scars haven&#x27;t gotten a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I saw an episode of Dr. Oz that recommended Hyaluronic Acid Serum for wrinkles for about $8 an ounce.  I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s so am always looking for ways to fight them.  I was spending over $100 a month on skin care, not any more.  I use this along with Vitamin C, E and A serums and it seems to work a lot better and cost a lot less than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> I am a little torn on this product.  It&#x27;s my first oil type serum. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin, no break outs that&#x27;s a plus.  Bottle states just a few drops.  Not the case I find I need a full dropper in the palm of my hand and with a quick (and I mean quick) pat of the hands together to get the product on both hands so you can apply it to the face in a quick fashion. Once it&#x27;s on the face I then pat it in which literally takes maybe 3 pats, then it goes slightly stick for the last 2 pats and then dry.  I often wonder if it does anything.  There&#x27;s no real scent, leaves no greasy feeling and honestly right now I&#x27;m still questioning it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This was first experience with this product.  I have found it to be very good for my skin, and simple to use.  It is not drying as the hyaluronic acid in the description would imply.  I have noticed a slight but consistent firming of the skin around my mouth and forehead.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff. I&#x27;ve ordered it for her about a half dozen times now and I&#x27;m about to order another bottle. I have to admit that I don&#x27;t see any difference but that might because I don&#x27;t think she needs it. I don&#x27;t think she needs makeup either - so what do I know? She sees a difference in her skin and so does her friends and coworkers. Perhaps women are better at seeing those things than men, so I would take their word for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used now for about 5wks.I have to say,my skin looks tighter &amp; brighter. I told a good buddy bout it.He purchased the 4oz bottle.Said he is enjoying it.I&#x27;m 37,I&#x27;ve taking care of my face best I could w/ Nivea for men products.I usually get pegged for 29/30yrs old.I&#x27;d sure like to have used this stuff for last several yrs.I will continue to use!!!!</li>
            <li> It works! I use it with Derma rolling. The change in my skin is unbelievable. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now and am so satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I keep getting compliments on my skin. My husband wants to know why I&#x27;m looking younger and more beautiful. This is my secret, and I&#x27;ll never tell him. Why? I love the compliments from him and how he wants to show me off. His friends tease him about marrying a much younger woman. I&#x27;m 58 and a year younger than him! I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it.I use during morning and evening time.Mine skin looks much healthier and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;I already recommended this product to my friend who noticed an improvement on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> It must be everything they say about it because everyone says I look 20 years younger! I definitely will order it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent as Always, I Have Referred Many of My Clients to Your Site! Its So Important to Reversing the Aging Process.</li>
            <li> Great product; definitely helps with smoothing fine lines around face (via moisture retention). Skin has a healthier overall glow, too.</li>
            <li> Feels good on face.  Need to use it more to see it&#x27;s effects.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love it! Love it!</li>
            <li> Will certainly re-purchase.  Family members commented on my face looking clear and overall &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluronic Acid Serum every night for two weeks, and noticed my skin became  dry, then I noticed red spots on my skin, and some blistering.  The last couple of days of using the product, my eyes became swollen.  Obviously, its not something I should be using on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum a couple of day&#x27;s ago, and my eyes are not as irritated as they were.  I have a feeling&lt;br /&gt;the red spots, etc. will improve as well.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet about this product, I seem to see a bit of improvement, but not much. It may be that I have a lot of sun damage, and it will take longer to see results. I plan to try Vitamin C serum with this product and will update my review later.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t soak in well. Have to mix it with face cream for best results</li>
            <li> It makes the skin so soft and hydrated. I love it!</li>
            <li> Its good, next time will try another brand</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Depend on it daily to keep my skin hydrated, especially since I live in a dry climate. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Jury is still out. I&#x27;ve been using 2 weeks and NO difference. In fact, it seems like I&#x27;m breaking out a bit more. Could be hormones, so we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;ll keep using (I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day) and hopefully I will see some good changes soon!</li>
            <li> I continue to reorder this product.  People tell me how nice my skin looks.  That&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft using this.</li>
            <li> Within just one week of using this product twice a day I&#x27;ve noticed a visible difference in my skin and it feels better as well. I&#x27;m a guy who is prone to acne breakouts on my forehead but wanted to begin moisturizing as I could tell my skin needed it. Not only does this moisturize and NOT break my skin out but I&#x27;ve noticed that it has helped as well. I&#x27;ve teamed it up with this brand&#x27;s Vitamin C + E formula which I use morning and/or night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m really liking the product and find myself using this serum throughout the day as well. Moisturizes and dries fast. I will be buying this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Will buy this again and I rarely say that about a product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for hyluronnic acid serums, this is a good one, however a bit too liquid for a serum, not my favorite but a decent product.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time and was as described.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t done anything for me. I&#x27;m sorry I bought it. I stopped using it because my face broke out really bad. I have not noted any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent love it I see a big improvement</li>
            <li> i love this - the consistency is perfect - it feels like a serum, not just water like. leaves my skin feeling great. love it!</li>
            <li> This product feels good on my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough yet but the clarity of my skin already looks better and the fine lines between my brows look better.</li>
            <li> I love the feel and texture of this serum, it&#x27;s thicker than some others I&#x27;ve tried but absorbs into the skin quickly. I rarely use it alone but add it to most of my creams including retinal, and day/evening moisturizers and sunblock. Since I use it with other products I can&#x27;t say how efficacious it is for reducing wrinkles or dark spots on its own, but I absolutely think that it plumps my skin and leaves it glowing. It&#x27;s scentless. Bonus, I&#x27;ve had a couple of women  at work tell me recently, how smooth and pretty my skin looks. Time to re order!</li>
            <li> Best brand of Hyaluronic acid I have ever used (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot)</li>
            <li> nothing...zero. no change at all</li>
            <li> Very good product, 100% pure hyaluronic Acid serum,by Cosmedica, no fillers like some have. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful experience. I got it right away &amp; it was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the raving reviews but unfortunately it made me break out. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Dunno If I have a hydation cream or astringent that brings out the best restorative results? Not mentioned in the ordering info, and a major oversight!!</li>
            <li> This, along with NOW Hyaluronic Acid supplements, has become a part of my daily skin-care routine. I only use a couple of drops (it absorbs in extremely well) on my face and then apply moisturizer...every morning and every night. It has been especially helpful in our cold, dry Michigan winters...which can reek havoc on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels with this gel, soft, hidrated... this is my 3rd purchase of this product. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> People compliment my skin.</li>
            <li> This product was a life-changer for me! It completely changed the texture and appearance of my skin, making it look and feel youthful again. I also use the Prep and Tone beforehand, or also add the toner to the serum when my skin is looking dull. I use an age-defying moisturizer afterward. It&#x27;s my liquid gold, the one product I can&#x27;t live without!</li>
            <li> No improvement yet... will keep on trying.</li>
            <li> Always loved hyaluronic acid, and this is among the very best that I&#x27;ve tried!! Wonderful product, silky texture and application, and makes for supple dewy skin when applied after fresh cleanse, exfoliation, and before moisturizer! Will purchase again, from this seller! üòä</li>
            <li> This is my 6th bottle. I&#x27;m 53 and have been instructing fitness classes for over 30 years.Appearing and feeling healthy is important. I use a small drop of this hyaluronic acid by Cosmedia am and pm after cleansing my face. Also take a hyaluronic and biotin supplement daily. My skin feels soft and smooth. Individuals have find what works for them.I&#x27;m in the public eye daily and get compliments on how good my hair and skin look.This product will remain a part of my daily regimen.This is my personal story.</li>
            <li> nice feeling on skin,have sencitive skin and redness comes after every product i use but this one didnt make it red.it suited to my skin very well.i m using it just for over a week.skin became lighter and it doesnt blocked my pores.will continue to use it.like it</li>
            <li> Pretty good...not great!</li>
            <li> This product really controls the oil and ensures that my skin stays matte all day. I also feel that my skin gets a bit tighter when&lt;br /&gt;I put it on - in a good moisturized way. Haven&#x27;t noticed any wrinkle reduction just yet, though.</li>
            <li> Bought because of numerous positive reviews.  It&#x27;s hard to tell if most products work, but this one definitely does.  I have had a couple of scaly precancerous areas for years that I was going to have the dermatologist remove, and by putting it directly on those areas, they are gone.  Therefore, if I can see this, then it must be working.  I also use it with the dermaroller.  I honestly believe, by smelling it and its looks, that it is what Arbonne sells for $50 for their face and body serum.  So, score!  I have reordered it a couple of times, and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Please remember this is not really a stand alone item. Usually you mix it with your own good face cream or make your own formula with Vitamin c crystals ( recipe available on skin forums) the whole concept is it helps to seal in moisture. And it does that well, but there has to moisture there to begin with, and something else to go with that. If you just squirt a few drops on your face and that&#x27;s it, the effect will be very short lived. We all know a moist, Dewey face looks great and smooths wrinkles. Keeping that look is the struggle and this will help if used properly. And really, nothing, but nothing, comes close to using tretinoin  ( retina A) prescription stenghth, not the stuff over the counter.</li>
            <li> Works well but not as well as the Oz organics one.</li>
            <li> I gave this Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure (2oz/60ml) Cosmedica Skincare- Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free (Professional Formula) Sold by Cosmedica Skincare only 2 stars because it is not what the name of it implies.  The name implies that the serum is &amp;#34;100% pure Hyaluronic acid&amp;#34; when the serum is actually mostly water.  The ingredients listed on the bottle (in order) are distilled water, hyaluronic acid and benzylacohol (0.5%).  I was curious about the actual amount (percentage) of HA in the serum so I contacted the company and was told that the concentration of HA is 1%.  So, if my math is right, that means this magical serum is 98.5% distilled water.  My research has indicated that a 50% concentration of HA is needed to provide any results.  Hope this bit of information helps others when trying to decide if this is actually what they are looking.  It was NOT what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I really can&#x27;t see a difference!</li>
            <li> Love this product I bot from different company before this product feel more fabulous than anything I try before  Thank you</li>
            <li> Loved the Hyraluronic Serum! It was inexpensive and fast shipper.</li>
            <li> I originally bought and used a \\&quot;Swiss\\&quot; hyaluronic acid serum, 100% pure at twice the cost, so when I used it up quickly, I went hunting for another less expensive product that would have the same results. The results were in writing only by the company and what I mean by that is it was hard to tell, I just went along with believing that my skin was getting what it needed after using my Derma Roller, when my body would absorb the product on my face at a much greater intensity.&lt;br /&gt;With the \\&quot;cosmedica\\&quot; product, I actually feel a tightening when I use it. It is similar to my first purchase in that it is silky and non-greasy. I like this because it is quite viscous when dripping onto your fingers, but when used, spreads like liquid silk.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product not because I hope to receive 50% off my next purchase from them, but because I feel smart in having bought a product so much more inexpensively than another and got what I feel is a better result. I tended to think that the \\&quot;swiss\\&quot; advertisement must mean that it is purer, more subtle in it&#x27;s performance, etc., when in actuality, 100% is 100% of a product. I will continue to buy this product whether I get the discount or not. Why wouldn&#x27;t I?</li>
            <li> This serum does the job ‚Äì its not fancy, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be.</li>
