            <li>$19 is a great price and shipping only cost $5 in total</li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s great, I like to use it when my eyes feel tired.</li>
            <li>my husband and myself real like it.</li>
            <li>Probable I was expecting too much on it.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t do much for your skin</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really feel much steam or relieve on eyes.</li>

            <li>The delivered was also fast.</li>
            <li>thing is it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the bean bag eye masks which you have to microwave, but at the same time it&#x27;s super convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives you about 10-15 minutes of steam action which is about right for taking a mid-day break or relaxing at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will try some other product to see which is better for me.</li>
            <li>They definitely work well for refreshing your eyes, especially when you need it towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommaned for people who use computers a lot and get relax.</li>
            <li>I usually use it before the bedtime, and it does help my eyes look good next day in the workplace.</li>
            <li>They are air activated and only takes about 1-2 minutes to get to the right temperature.</li>
            <li>I have been bought the eye mask with smell,but that flavour is a little bit strong.</li>
            <li>These are warm not too hot and I ordered the ones without a &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; since I&#x27;m pregnant and smells make me sick.</li>
            <li>Feel OK, but not very good.</li>
            <li>But she&#x27;s really sensitive.)</li>
            <li>completely rip of money.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is price, a bit to much</li>
            <li>But sometimes I would feel too hot, because now is summer time, the temperature is higher than few months ago.</li>
            <li>but they are really nice for relaxation, sleep, and to help tired eyes.</li>
            <li>It is not bad, but last only short.</li>
            <li>It really makes my eyes relax after a long night reading.</li>
            <li>Cuz the pack became different than before, I searched these are the new edition.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper especially if used several time a week.</li>
            <li>took one star off because it tries my skin around my eyes if I wear it the whole night.</li>
            <li>My face is large and I am a guy and these are female face sized so it was a little tight to loop around the ears to secure the eye pads.</li>
            <li>Then my skin feels so try and tight the next morning after wearing the mask the whole night.</li>

            <li> these help and no mess from warming up wet wash cloths!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very useful. portable, can even take to work.</li>
            <li> Help to improve sleep, especially during travel</li>
            <li> I REALLY enjoy this product. I find that the masks are great for falling asleep in and helping with migraines and sinus headaches. I like that they are light enough to travel with (vs. the re-heatable bean bag masks- also nice but bulkier for travel) and that if I fall asleep in it is not too bulky or something to worry about preventing me from sleeping easily if it falls off.</li>
            <li> Um mine started catching on fire in the microwave. Total s*** product. Very upset.</li>
            <li> Great masks for relaxing with and don&#x27;t hurt if you fall asleep with them on.</li>
            <li> Comfortable product. I think it&#x27;s some chemical that releases heat when reacting with water or air. The heat is gentle and lasts for about 10 or 15 min. Good time for relaxing.</li>
            <li> Mine was shipped from Japan, it&#x27;s great, I like to use it when my eyes feel tired. Highly recommaned for people who use computers a lot and get relax.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use it and very comfortable and useful~</li>
            <li> my husband and myself real like it. small bag, but real warm. make you easy sleep. and good for your eyes. also, make eyes much bright. i would like use this everyday. very good for the person who use computer everyday.......</li>
            <li> Feel OK, but not very good. Probable I was expecting too much on it. I will try some other product to see which is better for me.</li>
            <li> love it， really good service</li>
            <li> These eye masks are very nice. I put these on right before bed and they instantly heat up. They stay heated for maybe 10 minutes. These don&#x27;t do much for your skin but they are really nice for relaxation, sleep, and to help tired eyes. I recommend this to anyone who is easily stressed and wants to be relaxed.</li>
            <li> temperature not high enough for me</li>
            <li> Love this! It saved my finals!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It really makes my eyes relax after a long night reading. I usually use it before the bedtime, and it does help my eyes look good next day in the workplace.</li>
            <li> Not recommend to buy, better put a hot tower than to spend money on that.</li>
            <li> I usually use it when I sleep at noon， I use it about 20 minutes. And I actually did not find its effects.</li>
            <li> I often need to take a daylight nap and these masks serve to darken the room. The warmth of the mask is soothing for tired eyes. I found napping was easier with the mask.</li>
            <li> what else do i need to say? i fall asleep with 10 mins every time i put this eye mask on.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a good travel solution for a warm pack for eyelids for people with dry eyes. If there is a microwave nearby, there are many face masks that can be warmed up ( I use the Bed Buddy) - but in the absence of a microwave, it can be difficult. This give a nice gentle heat, and the heat lasts for quite a while, enough to get a good sweat going underneath it. If you place a dry washcloth or beanbag over this, it directs the heat to the eyelids and seems to be a very good travel solution. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if the price was lower.</li>
            <li> this product worked as described for the exception of a couple of ones that didn&#x27;t heat up. it heats up for only about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to use hot eye mask! Only 10 minutes everyday to feel so confortable and relaxed !</li>
            <li> these have changed my life</li>
            <li> It is not bad, but last only short. So I feel it is a little expensive. I will keep it because it is cheaper than SPA place but I won&#x27;t daily use because I think heat is important to eyes but moist is also important.</li>
            <li> I tried them and a little disappointed.  don&#x27;t really feel much steam or relieve on eyes.</li>
            <li> It is really good for sleeping.</li>
            <li> I think it helps me fall asleep, since it warms up my eyes. I don&#x27;t think it helps reduce stress that much, but the warm feeling does make me drowsier than normal.</li>
            <li> Nice warm pad for tired eyes. My face is large and I am a guy and these are female face sized so it was a little tight to loop around the ears to secure the eye pads. But I wanted some relief for tired eyes.. Best used with an eye mask or pillow on top to keep it warmer.. When i use it I feel my tired eyes relaxing and fall asleep in no time!</li>
            <li> Great! Same as elsewhere but cheaper!</li>
            <li> So cool. Worked like a charm on the airplane</li>
            <li> I like it. I have bought it for many times. It is convenient and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Subtle heat and very relaxing.  It refreshes your eyes after a long day of looking at a computer screen.&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was an English translation of what is written on the box.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for traveling! Simple to pack and use! They warm up to just the right re putative and stay that way for a good 30 minutes!  By then I&#x27;m asleep!</li>
            <li> It really helps to relax my eyes. It does take a minute to warm up but it does get really warm (although not too much for me but everyone has a different heat limit so I would suggest just opening one up and place it in your hand or arm to see how hot it gets. My mom says when it really gets to going that its too warm for her.  But she&#x27;s really sensitive.) My whole face feels better and I feel more relaxed after using it. I would definitely get it again.</li>
            <li> Feels great! Great product!</li>
            <li> The eye mask produces a lot of heat and helps relaxing my eyes. I wanted to use them to reduce my dark circles, but later I figured that the key solution is to change my sleeping and eating patterns. I can&#x27;t expect too much from an eye mask. But it does help me relax my eyes and improves my sleeping quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because it tries my skin around my eyes if I wear it the whole night. I wear them before sleep and often fall asleep wearing them. Then my skin feels so try and tight the next morning after wearing the mask the whole night.</li>
            <li> I used the mask every time when I need a good rest for my eyes. I always pack one when I travel on the plane. It is warm, soothing and hydrating. It is also great to put me into sleep. The heat can sustain for about a good 20min. I think I will try the scented masks in the future</li>
            <li> These are great for easy or on-the-go eye therapy. You don&#x27;t need a microwave or anything special to use these. They are air activated and only takes about 1-2 minutes to get to the right temperature. It gives you about 10-15 minutes of steam action which is about right for taking a mid-day break or relaxing at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the bean bag eye masks which you have to microwave, but at the same time it&#x27;s super convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these if you have some sort of computer eye syndrome or dry eye. They definitely work well for refreshing your eyes, especially when you need it towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This is so comfortable! I love it!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. Rest my eye when I needed.</li>
            <li> I have decided to use instead those foot and toe warmers with an eye mask.  Much cheaper especially if used several time a week.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome ! Makes my eyes feel very comfortable everytime when I use it and I will continue to use this wonderful products too, the shipping is fast too!</li>
            <li> I bought this some time back - not one single mask in the box worked as it was supposed to, I think I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> It is overall a great product.  I will buy it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: If you like the heat longer like I do, buy eye mask from Dream Essentials (check my review, the only eye mask I buy) and use them together.&lt;br /&gt;And enjooooooy your sweet sweet dreams~~~~ :-))))</li>
            <li> Amazing product! For anyone who is a contact lens wearer suffering from dry eyes, this has helped. It&#x27;s not too hot and my eye doc recommend I use a warm compress to help with my dry eyes. I mean contact would jump out of eyes, and I had to use blink eye drops all day long! I&#x27;m so happy these help and no mess from warming up wet wash cloths! Perfect for long trips, right after nice hot shower, even during a work break! These are warm not too hot and I ordered the ones without a &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; since I&#x27;m pregnant and smells make me sick. This is on my reorder list for sure! Ladies if you ever host a spa night these babies are perfect!</li>
            <li> Moments after putting on you feel circulating massage. Seems like ingredients are bubbling when mask is activated, perhaps, by contact with skin.  I feel a bit guilty that it is disposable rather than reusable.  Great therapy after a day of contact wear and/or computer use.</li>
            <li> I received this one when I&#x27;ve asked it 25 days ago. But it&#x27;s OK, I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time to buy this product. It works as its description says. But I will not buy it again. My eyes feel dry after using it.</li>
            <li> Great. I am happy that I can found it on Amazon - experienced it as gift from a Japanese friend, then I searched to purchase.</li>
            <li> It can let you feel relax, I use it almost every night before I sleep. The eye mask is every light, you wont feel tie. But sometimes I would feel too hot, because now is summer time, the temperature is higher than few months ago. I will get rid of it when I was steating.</li>
            <li> this eye mask relaxes my eyes, feels good especially after staying up the night before. Very relaxing and makes me happy!</li>
            <li> no use at all. completely rip of money.</li>
            <li> If you feel tired, this eye mask is perfect for relaxing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I specially like the Rose one!! it smells very good!!!</li>
            <li> This will heat you up. I did not feel relaxed at all - instead, my body temp. skyrocketed to an uncomfortable level. Was this supposed to help or hurt??</li>

Cuz the pack became different than before, I searched these are the new edition. Great seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really improves my sleep quality cuz I always had a perfect &amp; deep sleeping every time I use it. When I wake up, my whole body felt rebirth in the morning! Sleeping is sooooo important to life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do NOT use it in cold environment, otherwise you can NOT feel the steam and it won&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste money.</li>
