            <li>THE BEST MACHINE EVER .I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that for me I get the best results after soaking my feet while showering (plugging up the tub</li>

            <li>This thing works GREAT!  </li>

            <li>I have tried battery powered callus removers, the ped egg and pumice stones and none of them work as good as this Bario!  </li>
            <li>It was a good price, but didn&#x27;t work the wonders I wanted on my calluses!  </li>
            <li>It is perfect and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a great product.</li>

            <li>She loved the foot cream too.  </li>

            <li>She loved the foot cream too.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product,This thing works GREAT!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered the callous remover and COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPY WITH IT!&lt;br /&gt;All of the shavers I bought (and never could learn to do), files, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>It was amazing.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is nice.</li>
            <li>Something to that affect would have been nice to know</li>
            <li>Buy the foot cream with it because it, too, is effective.</li>
            <li>And I liked that.</li>
            <li>This  is the best Foot file I&#x27;ve ever owned works very well</li>
            <li>v.good&lt;br /&gt;I gave this as a gift to my wife and she was thrilled after just one use--</li>
            <li>I would recommend not getting too enthusiastic when you take this thing out of the box.</li>
            <li>Just takes some practice, but it&#x27;s extremely effective.</li>
            <li>product is worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>I gave this as a gift to my wife and she was thrilled after just one use--said it was very easy to use and her feet were smooth as a baby&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>I found the stronger setting (of two) to be more effective on my heels where the skin is thicker (read:crustier.)</li>
            <li>For the price, I was expecting a much more effective product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Verael callus remover really does an incredible job.</li>
            <li>said it was very easy to use and her feet were smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>It requires a very light touch or the rotary disc will stop.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really amazing - it makes taking care of your feet so easy.  </li>
            <li>I have found that most callus removers require you to soak your feet before using.  </li>
            <li>Follow-up with the foot cream makes for lovely heels,</li>
            <li>LOVE IT ,</li>
            <li>I bought one for my best friend the next day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before.  </li>
            <li>It works great and seems to be made very well.  </li>
            <li>It works better &amp; faster that way.</li>
            <li>Need I say more...</li>
            <li>Way better than a ped egg without all the elbow grease put into it.  </li>
            <li>but if you use this regularly like maybe twice a week your feet look and feel beautiful!!  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I bought this.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m fighting more than flip-flop heals ~ but genetics as well.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I had calluses built up over years on my heels.  </li>
            <li>I tried the hand scrapers, they just seemed to tear up my skin and not make anything better.  </li>
            <li>But this product has literally changed my life for the better.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!!y</li>
            <li>changed my life for the better.  </li>
            <li>So much better than any salon has ever done.  </li>
            <li>I have used the ped egg...and that is an ok product</li>
            <li>and it will be ok.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad i purchased it.</li>
            <li>am sure it would work for you</li>
            <li>The micro plane works 100 times better, stick with what works.  </li>
            <li>Love this callus remover.</li>
            <li>The $9 sofeet callus remover does way, way more.</li>
            <li>so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>So, this works very nicely without much effort.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The VERAEL  is wonderful and really does a great job on dry, cracked feet in winter and summer when my feet are at their nastiest and lowest.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>First of all I want to say that it was a good price for what it does.  </li>
            <li>Bought this fabulous thing over 6 months ago &amp; couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>The Bario is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>After I use a more abrasive remover I use this to smooth my feet.</li>
            <li>know perfectly well now that after I wait a few days, keeping the area moisturized well, and use this device two or three more times you won&#x27;t be able to tell my feet</li>
            <li>Removed the calluses and dry skin beautifully and my feet are now very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and literally within minutes my callouses were fully removed.</li>
            <li>I WAS AMAZED OF HOW EASY ,NO SCRUBING NO CUTS .JUST</li>
            <li>out there &amp; none has been as easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s as easy as pie.  </li>
            <li>The machine spins very quickly and does, after a while, give off a bit of heat.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it - worth every penny!!!  </li>
            <li>Extremely fine dust.  </li>
            <li>This baby makes quick work of even the oldest, most stubborn problem spots.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express fully how wonderful this little machine is.</li>
            <li>My feet were so smooth and the problem callus was about 80% gone.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASY TO CLEAN .EASY</li>
            <li>Continued use will leave your feet in great shape and you will only be using the VERAEL in what I consider maintenance mode once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact &amp; easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li>Three days later, my feet are still in great shape.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to buy something cheap that would break, so decided to go with the Verael.  </li>
            <li>This thing, and a cream I use combined ~ is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>My heels now are perfectly smooth.  </li>
            <li>every 2-3 weeks now to keep them smooth and callus free.  </li>
            <li>every 2-3 weeks now to keep them smooth and callus free.  </li>
            <li>It is effective but also gentle.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I thought it would be, but it works ok.  </li>
            <li>The cream is nice, it really softens your skin after the petticure.</li>
            <li>While you can still see the cracks in your heel after it&#x27;s done, it feels smooth.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>All it does is lightly go over your feet, it doesn&#x27;t remove anything.  </li>
            <li>Visits to several experienced doctors did not result in a solution.</li>
            <li>I have a very rare condition on the bottom of my feet in that they are always calloused and bumpy.  </li>
            <li>The machine does all the work quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Quick and efficient, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was able to work out and run without any pain for the first time in weeks.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>but there was nothing to clean out.</li>
            <li>So fast and efficient!I love it.</li>
            <li>used to go to the salon and get full pedis every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>not so cool when a girl&#x27;s trying to rock Summer footwear.</li>
            <li>I received the Verael today and after one use, sweet relief.  </li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve spent on a new product in years.</li>
            <li>I love how easy this is to use and how quick I get soft skin with this.</li>
            <li>This is quick and easy and doesn&#x27;t get hot from the friction like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Second, a large number of people gave it great reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is powerful (but not dangerous!)</li>
            <li>If you have calluses, this is the best of the serious products for the problem.</li>
            <li>That way i will actually remove my calluses but have nice smooth feet as well.</li>
            <li>It was quick to work after the reccomeded foot soaking.</li>
            <li>The foot cream that is included is amazing and they also gave a bonus of two free facial masks!  </li>
            <li>very easy to operate,very effective, keeping my heels soft and smooth, have actually used it on all my kids and even hubby  !!!</li>
            <li>After just the first use I noticed a huge difference in my feet.  </li>
            <li>The Bario is quick, easy and gentle on my heals.    </li>
            <li>Honestly love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true, as other reviewers have noted, that you must apply very light pressure lest the device stop rotating.  </li>
            <li>This thing is powerful.  </li>
            <li>It kind of felt like I was using a really really low power sander...</li>
            <li>and kind of had the same effect as well (including the flying &#x27;dust&#x27; particles all over the place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I use the slower speed in evening out the more sensitive areas of my feet</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use to watch commercials advertising products that get rid of calluses and would laugh.  </li>
            <li>so far i&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Maybe they can provide a cable that is longer but other than that it is a good gift.</li>
            <li>I had a callus on the ball of my right foot</li>
            <li>True, it doesn&#x27;t have as much torque as say</li>
            <li>When I managed to scratch the top of my coffee table with my bare heel, I knew it was time to dig out this callus remover and get to work.</li>
            <li>I neglect my feet, which is easy to do in this busy world, they crack and just look yucky</li>
            <li>This is better than any pedicure that you get at the local nail shop!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years to keep my feet callus-free and I&#x27;ve finally got something that works!  </li>
            <li>I went the route of the hand held &#x27;as seen on TV&#x27;  battery operated callus remover first.</li>
            <li>There is most definitely a learning curve to using this device.</li>
            <li>Now I go every 6 weeks in winter and every 3-4 weeks in summer and have been saving a lot of money while my feet consistently feel and look good.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I am glad we have such a product that we can purchase.</li>
            <li>When I first plugged it in and it started to go</li>
            <li>the only thing I wish Verael would do better would be to make the cord longer.  </li>
            <li>Most recently before discovering the Verael electric remover, I had been using Dr. Scholl&#x27;s pedi-egg by hand.  </li>
            <li>First, it isn&#x27;t battery operated, it is plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li>The skin underneath is smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda of intimidating at first, though.</li>
            <li>and of course flipping the switch to the higher setting.</li>
            <li>Higher speed &#x3D; faster job.    </li>
            <li>Oh yeah, one more thing -- DO NOT LISTEN TO THE ONE-STAR REVIEWER WHO SOMEHOW RECEIVED THE EUROPEAN VERSION OF THIS ITEM!</li>
            <li>I thought this was a bit pricey at first, but after reading the reviews decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>and then I use the higher speed to work on the calluses...</li>
            <li>I just used my Verael callus remover the first time</li>
            <li>Most recently actually resorted to sand paper blocks (literally from Home Depot).  </li>
            <li>This machine actually does a better job than a salon.</li>
            <li>My feet have never been so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Saw a difference on first use.  </li>
            <li>I finally found this product, I was VERY excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>Smooths  my feet far better than a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li>I have used other ped-egg type of products with success, but the Bario works much better.</li>
            <li>Even the first time it gets all the snags and yucky bits off really well</li>
            <li>I have tried many solutions and sanders in vain but the Verael sander actually makes my feet look pretty normal.  </li>
            <li>I bought Bario to smooth down some pretty tough calluses on my heals and it works great!</li>
            <li>But it took more work than I expected (although it&#x27;s not difficult to use).</li>
            <li>The product works as advertised, I notice that the motor is not as strong as perhaps it should be and stops occasionally.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I tend to develop calluses in certain areas...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not used to rubbing fast-moving metal graters over my skin, so I was pretty timid starting off but then quickly got comfortable pushing more firmly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surely worth every penny as far as I&#x27;m concerned!  </li>
            <li>Is more gentle than the manual callus removers as long as you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I had an infection in my toe after getting a pedicure from a very high end salon.</li>
            <li>Amazing little machine.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little more powerful, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li>Used with some common sense your feet will be smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I could see a huge improvement after only one use!  </li>
            <li>I could see a huge improvement after only one use</li>
            <li>However, I have very legitimate reason to.  </li>
            <li>&quot; - my feet are very misshapen; hammer toes and all.  </li>
            <li>Use gently until you get used to how it works.</li>
            <li>MY FEET DONT MATTER HOW MUCH PEDICURE OR CREAMS</li>
            <li>She highly recommends this item!</li>
            <li>It definitely does smooth your feet.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t very powerful.\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather do it in my enclosed shower though.  </li>
            <li>Hold the device with some pressure but not too much</li>
            <li>They varied in price so much, so I read all the reviews.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really a quality, long-lasting product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product (and the foot cream included) and will look for them as gifts, too!</li>
            <li>This product really does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>This item really works.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>She highly recommends this item!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, absorbs really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not the type who wants to spend time having my feet done.</li>
            <li>I just have to much to do during the day.</li>
            <li>But one trip to the foot salon to take care of that, this should keep your feet maintained very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>be careful very strong keep the file new</li>
            <li>MY FEET ARE  VERY VERY SOFT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I USE BARIO</li>
            <li>You may not get all the cracks and calluses off completely the first time</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve learned to live with the whole plugging-it-in thing</li>
            <li>but they work very well when they&#x27;re new.</li>
            <li>Be careful, as it is easy to over-do your callus removal and injure your feet.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so quick and simple using this product i won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I was very dubious about anything that was battery operated because it seemed that my calluses were more heavy duty than that.  </li>
            <li>As I get older, I like things that make my job easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the hang of it within a few tries and the foot cream is great too.</li>
            <li>Nothing was powerful enough to touch my calluses except my electric wood sander and very course sand paper.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable in the hand and does not generate much loose dust.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Just do a little each time and allow a couple of days in between to make sure you don&#x27;t hurt your feet.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>My initial thought was that it was a bit pricey for a callus file, but I&#x27;ve discovered that it is very much WORTH</li>
            <li>But if you just have normal thick-ish type callus areas that have begun to surface crack and harden, then give this a try.  </li>
            <li>But if you just have normal thick-ish type callus areas that have begun to surface crack and harden, then give this a try.  </li>
            <li>The foot cream smelled good, but seemed too thin for me.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the disc would wear out quickly and become costly to replace frequently, but I read on their website that the disc can last up to 2 years, as well -</li>
            <li>I suggest you apply light pressure as you run this at low speed initially.</li>
            <li>I have had dry, cracked hells ever since I was pregnant with my son over three years ago.  </li>
            <li>Sands your rough skin right off: ziiiiiiiip!</li>
            <li>I easily shaved down too far or sliced myself with that thing.</li>
            <li>It works better than many products, but it&#x27;s tiresome!  </li>
            <li>I instantly noticed a difference after the first foot was done.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve used the Verael callus remover both on dry feet and pre-soaked feet, and have found it works better on dry</li>
            <li>All I can find are descriptions that say it&#x27;s professional level, and such, but nothing that actually tells you that you plug it in, turn it to the appropriate setting, and the disc works as a sort of file/shaver in one, so you are to carefully touch it to the callus as it gently removes it.  </li>
            <li>Quickly removes callus and rough spots on the bottom of your feet.  </li>
            <li>A bit over priced and not as powerful as expected, but it does the job and the creams leave your feet really soft!</li>
            <li>Mostly on the hind part of the heel and a little on the outside side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the little handheld doodad&#x27;s that make you use all of the elbow grease, and paid countless dollars for pedicures that I&#x27;m not always completely satisfied with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally able to get rid of the hard heel and under toe calluses.</li>
            <li>When i saw this product and all the great reviews i was desperately hoping it would work for me as well.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it 2x, and it worked very well</li>
            <li>APART.IF YOU WANT SOFT FEET BUY THIS MACHINE.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries, but I have to sit near and outlet, so it is not fully portable.</li>
            <li>I use this quite frequently.</li>
            <li>but if you hold it in one place too long it will start to feel hot from the friction.</li>
            <li>I can have soft feet within 5 minutes of using this.</li>
            <li>I tried creams, then I just got soft calluses.  </li>
            <li>About 80% of the callus on each foot is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>My feet are nearly presentable</li>
            <li>The cream makes your feet feel baby soft.</li>
            <li>I have very calloused feet and was hoping this would be a big help.  </li>
            <li>I just have to resist the urge to use it too long at any one time to avoid damage to the skin, and to have the patience to first soften the skin on my feet by soaking.</li>
            <li>My wife is a professional musician and dancer.</li>
            <li>After your first use, experiment in increments by upping either speed or pressure or time until you reach a point where the dry skin is removed.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what a visit to the podiatrist did for me a year ago only I&#x27;m not stuck with a $400 medical bill my insurance company slapped me with for that visit.</li>
            <li>I used a hand-held heal sander, but I had to sand so much, it actually got hot and started to burn my heal.</li>
            <li>The foot cream is decent, and my package also included a facial mask.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure, though: I&#x27;ve owned one of those callus shaver tools, you know, with the little razor blade?</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d bought my Bario first because I have spent hundreds trying to find a product that will remove callouses, including doctors&#x27; prescribed salves and ointments.</li>
            <li>One treatment with the Bario and an overnight application of the foot cream, and my feet were literally back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I get the same results by using a large coarse emery board.</li>
            <li>Using it like you would a sander on a piece of wood, I spent about 10 minutes carefully and lightly sanding my heels where the callus had</li>
            <li>It quickly removes the dead skin build up.</li>
            <li>, it works fine, you can&#x27;t press to hard or it bogs out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this half dozen times and all I can say is that it&#x27;s just okay, not really worth the money in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, pressing too hard will cause the wheel to stop, but if you just hold it lightly against the callus, it removes the dead skin fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have thrown away all other tools collected over the years to smooth my rough feet.</li>
            <li>After several minutes of buffing, I took everything apart (as directed) to clean out the dead skin</li>
            <li>Mine came with a regular old US plug.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m old, so it is a constant battle.  </li>
            <li>I cannot stomach &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my own feet with the foot shavers and since they made it illegal to have it done in the spas, this is going to have to do.</li>
            <li>So I was pretty excited about getting this because i get tired of using callus shavers (and they can be kind of dangerous if you&#x27;re not careful).</li>
            <li>Once I received the Bario, I used it right away and it removed SO much dead skin</li>
            <li>I managed to draw a blood (just a little) when I was getting fussy trying to smooth out a \\&quot;corner\\&quot; of a callus and wound up shaving my skin too far down.</li>
            <li>But, be careful when its on high.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful when you&#x27;re operating in high gear.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the little grooves that your supposed to clean after each use... is always empty.  </li>
            <li>This unit works as stated and the disk seems to last much longer than other abrasive drums or disks</li>
            <li>I can say this product makes me want to maintain my feet and not shy away from putting a few minutes into my feet vs. 30mins to an hour that I would spend before.</li>
            <li>In the past, I had used the little hand \\&quot;egg\\&quot; which was okay, but</li>
            <li>The polishing plates (the part that needs to be replaced) have lasted me over a month for each one, which, given the cost, is less than I was paying for the PedEgg replacement blades (and that was a huge headache because sometimes 2 of the 3 blades would be dull brand new out of the package!).&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using, I wash and dry my feet and apply foot cream and soft foot sox.</li>
            <li>I had very deep layers of dead skin which the Bario cut through the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>The only down side of the whole system is having to plug it in to use it.</li>
            <li>Now there&#x27;s no excuse for dreaded yellow soles.</li>
            <li>It removes dry skin and catches it in a container to be disposed of later so there is no mess.</li>
            <li>The whole little thing reminds of me of my husband&#x27;s Dremel tool.</li>
            <li>The rotation device seemed very sensitive to pressure and stopped several times, apparently due to my overzealous buffing pressure.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the callous remover and COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPY WITH IT!&lt;br /&gt;All of the shavers I bought (and never could learn to do), files, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> It was amazing.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is nice.</li>
            <li> Something to that affect would have been nice to know</li>
            <li> Buy the foot cream with it because it, too, is effective.</li>
            <li> And I liked that.</li>
            <li> This  is the best Foot file I&#x27;ve ever owned works very well</li>
            <li> v.good&lt;br /&gt;I gave this as a gift to my wife and she was thrilled after just one use--</li>
            <li> I would recommend not getting too enthusiastic when you take this thing out of the box.</li>
            <li> Just takes some practice, but it&#x27;s extremely effective.</li>
            <li> product is worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my wife and she was thrilled after just one use--said it was very easy to use and her feet were smooth as a baby&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> I found the stronger setting (of two) to be more effective on my heels where the skin is thicker (read:crustier.)</li>
            <li> For the price, I was expecting a much more effective product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Verael callus remover really does an incredible job.</li>
            <li> said it was very easy to use and her feet were smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> It requires a very light touch or the rotary disc will stop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing - it makes taking care of your feet so easy.  </li>
            <li> I have found that most callus removers require you to soak your feet before using.  </li>
            <li> Follow-up with the foot cream makes for lovely heels,</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ,</li>
            <li> I bought one for my best friend the next day.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before.  </li>
            <li> It works great and seems to be made very well.  </li>
            <li> It works better &amp; faster that way.</li>
            <li> Need I say more...</li>
            <li> Way better than a ped egg without all the elbow grease put into it.  </li>
            <li> but if you use this regularly like maybe twice a week your feet look and feel beautiful!!  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I bought this.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m fighting more than flip-flop heals ~ but genetics as well.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I had calluses built up over years on my heels.  </li>
            <li> I tried the hand scrapers, they just seemed to tear up my skin and not make anything better.  </li>
            <li> But this product has literally changed my life for the better.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing!!y</li>
            <li> changed my life for the better.  </li>
            <li> So much better than any salon has ever done.  </li>
            <li> I have used the ped egg...and that is an ok product</li>
            <li> and it will be ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Glad i purchased it.</li>
            <li> am sure it would work for you</li>
            <li> The micro plane works 100 times better, stick with what works.  </li>
            <li> Love this callus remover.</li>
            <li> The $9 sofeet callus remover does way, way more.</li>
            <li> so glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> So, this works very nicely without much effort.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The VERAEL  is wonderful and really does a great job on dry, cracked feet in winter and summer when my feet are at their nastiest and lowest.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> First of all I want to say that it was a good price for what it does.  </li>
            <li> Bought this fabulous thing over 6 months ago &amp; couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> The Bario is very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> After I use a more abrasive remover I use this to smooth my feet.</li>
            <li> know perfectly well now that after I wait a few days, keeping the area moisturized well, and use this device two or three more times you won&#x27;t be able to tell my feet</li>
            <li> Removed the calluses and dry skin beautifully and my feet are now very smooth.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and literally within minutes my callouses were fully removed.</li>
            <li> I WAS AMAZED OF HOW EASY ,NO SCRUBING NO CUTS .JUST</li>
            <li> out there &amp; none has been as easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s as easy as pie.  </li>
            <li> The machine spins very quickly and does, after a while, give off a bit of heat.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it - worth every penny!!!  </li>
            <li> Extremely fine dust.  </li>
            <li> This baby makes quick work of even the oldest, most stubborn problem spots.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express fully how wonderful this little machine is.</li>
            <li> My feet were so smooth and the problem callus was about 80% gone.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH EASY TO CLEAN .EASY</li>
            <li> Continued use will leave your feet in great shape and you will only be using the VERAEL in what I consider maintenance mode once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact &amp; easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li> Three days later, my feet are still in great shape.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy something cheap that would break, so decided to go with the Verael.  </li>
            <li> This thing, and a cream I use combined ~ is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My heels now are perfectly smooth.  </li>
            <li> every 2-3 weeks now to keep them smooth and callus free.  </li>
            <li> every 2-3 weeks now to keep them smooth and callus free.  </li>
            <li> It is effective but also gentle.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be, but it works ok.  </li>
            <li> The cream is nice, it really softens your skin after the petticure.</li>
            <li> While you can still see the cracks in your heel after it&#x27;s done, it feels smooth.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> All it does is lightly go over your feet, it doesn&#x27;t remove anything.  </li>
            <li> Visits to several experienced doctors did not result in a solution.</li>
            <li> I have a very rare condition on the bottom of my feet in that they are always calloused and bumpy.  </li>
            <li> The machine does all the work quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Quick and efficient, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was able to work out and run without any pain for the first time in weeks.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> but there was nothing to clean out.</li>
            <li> So fast and efficient!I love it.</li>
            <li> used to go to the salon and get full pedis every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> not so cool when a girl&#x27;s trying to rock Summer footwear.</li>
            <li> I received the Verael today and after one use, sweet relief.  </li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent on a new product in years.</li>
            <li> I love how easy this is to use and how quick I get soft skin with this.</li>
            <li> This is quick and easy and doesn&#x27;t get hot from the friction like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Second, a large number of people gave it great reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is powerful (but not dangerous!)</li>
            <li> If you have calluses, this is the best of the serious products for the problem.</li>
            <li> That way i will actually remove my calluses but have nice smooth feet as well.</li>
            <li> It was quick to work after the reccomeded foot soaking.</li>
            <li> The foot cream that is included is amazing and they also gave a bonus of two free facial masks!  </li>
            <li> very easy to operate,very effective, keeping my heels soft and smooth, have actually used it on all my kids and even hubby  !!!</li>
            <li> After just the first use I noticed a huge difference in my feet.  </li>
            <li> The Bario is quick, easy and gentle on my heals.    </li>
            <li> Honestly love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true, as other reviewers have noted, that you must apply very light pressure lest the device stop rotating.  </li>
            <li> This thing is powerful.  </li>
            <li> It kind of felt like I was using a really really low power sander...</li>
            <li> and kind of had the same effect as well (including the flying &#x27;dust&#x27; particles all over the place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I use the slower speed in evening out the more sensitive areas of my feet</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use to watch commercials advertising products that get rid of calluses and would laugh.  </li>
            <li> so far i&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Maybe they can provide a cable that is longer but other than that it is a good gift.</li>
            <li> I had a callus on the ball of my right foot</li>
            <li> True, it doesn&#x27;t have as much torque as say</li>
            <li> When I managed to scratch the top of my coffee table with my bare heel, I knew it was time to dig out this callus remover and get to work.</li>
            <li> I neglect my feet, which is easy to do in this busy world, they crack and just look yucky</li>
            <li> This is better than any pedicure that you get at the local nail shop!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years to keep my feet callus-free and I&#x27;ve finally got something that works!  </li>
            <li> I went the route of the hand held &#x27;as seen on TV&#x27;  battery operated callus remover first.</li>
            <li> There is most definitely a learning curve to using this device.</li>
            <li> Now I go every 6 weeks in winter and every 3-4 weeks in summer and have been saving a lot of money while my feet consistently feel and look good.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I am glad we have such a product that we can purchase.</li>
            <li> When I first plugged it in and it started to go</li>
            <li> the only thing I wish Verael would do better would be to make the cord longer.  </li>
            <li> Most recently before discovering the Verael electric remover, I had been using Dr. Scholl&#x27;s pedi-egg by hand.  </li>
            <li> First, it isn&#x27;t battery operated, it is plugged into the wall.</li>
            <li> The skin underneath is smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda of intimidating at first, though.</li>
            <li> and of course flipping the switch to the higher setting.</li>
            <li> Higher speed &#x3D; faster job.    </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, one more thing -- DO NOT LISTEN TO THE ONE-STAR REVIEWER WHO SOMEHOW RECEIVED THE EUROPEAN VERSION OF THIS ITEM!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a bit pricey at first, but after reading the reviews decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> and then I use the higher speed to work on the calluses...</li>
            <li> I just used my Verael callus remover the first time</li>
            <li> Most recently actually resorted to sand paper blocks (literally from Home Depot).  </li>
            <li> This machine actually does a better job than a salon.</li>
            <li> My feet have never been so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Saw a difference on first use.  </li>
            <li> I finally found this product, I was VERY excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> Smooths  my feet far better than a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li> I have used other ped-egg type of products with success, but the Bario works much better.</li>
            <li> Even the first time it gets all the snags and yucky bits off really well</li>
            <li> I have tried many solutions and sanders in vain but the Verael sander actually makes my feet look pretty normal.  </li>
            <li> I bought Bario to smooth down some pretty tough calluses on my heals and it works great!</li>
            <li> But it took more work than I expected (although it&#x27;s not difficult to use).</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised, I notice that the motor is not as strong as perhaps it should be and stops occasionally.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so I tend to develop calluses in certain areas...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to rubbing fast-moving metal graters over my skin, so I was pretty timid starting off but then quickly got comfortable pushing more firmly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surely worth every penny as far as I&#x27;m concerned!  </li>
            <li> Is more gentle than the manual callus removers as long as you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had an infection in my toe after getting a pedicure from a very high end salon.</li>
            <li> Amazing little machine.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little more powerful, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Used with some common sense your feet will be smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I could see a huge improvement after only one use!  </li>
            <li> I could see a huge improvement after only one use</li>
            <li> However, I have very legitimate reason to.  </li>
            <li> &quot; - my feet are very misshapen; hammer toes and all.  </li>
            <li> Use gently until you get used to how it works.</li>
            <li> MY FEET DONT MATTER HOW MUCH PEDICURE OR CREAMS</li>
            <li> She highly recommends this item!</li>
            <li> It definitely does smooth your feet.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t very powerful.\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather do it in my enclosed shower though.  </li>
            <li> Hold the device with some pressure but not too much</li>
            <li> They varied in price so much, so I read all the reviews.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really a quality, long-lasting product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product (and the foot cream included) and will look for them as gifts, too!</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> This item really works.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> She highly recommends this item!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, absorbs really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not the type who wants to spend time having my feet done.</li>
            <li> I just have to much to do during the day.</li>
            <li> But one trip to the foot salon to take care of that, this should keep your feet maintained very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> be careful very strong keep the file new</li>
            <li> MY FEET ARE  VERY VERY SOFT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I USE BARIO</li>
            <li> You may not get all the cracks and calluses off completely the first time</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve learned to live with the whole plugging-it-in thing</li>
            <li> but they work very well when they&#x27;re new.</li>
            <li> Be careful, as it is easy to over-do your callus removal and injure your feet.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so quick and simple using this product i won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I was very dubious about anything that was battery operated because it seemed that my calluses were more heavy duty than that.  </li>
            <li> As I get older, I like things that make my job easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the hang of it within a few tries and the foot cream is great too.</li>
            <li> Nothing was powerful enough to touch my calluses except my electric wood sander and very course sand paper.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable in the hand and does not generate much loose dust.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Just do a little each time and allow a couple of days in between to make sure you don&#x27;t hurt your feet.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> My initial thought was that it was a bit pricey for a callus file, but I&#x27;ve discovered that it is very much WORTH</li>
            <li> But if you just have normal thick-ish type callus areas that have begun to surface crack and harden, then give this a try.  </li>
            <li> But if you just have normal thick-ish type callus areas that have begun to surface crack and harden, then give this a try.  </li>
            <li> The foot cream smelled good, but seemed too thin for me.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the disc would wear out quickly and become costly to replace frequently, but I read on their website that the disc can last up to 2 years, as well -</li>
            <li> I suggest you apply light pressure as you run this at low speed initially.</li>
            <li> I have had dry, cracked hells ever since I was pregnant with my son over three years ago.  </li>
            <li> Sands your rough skin right off: ziiiiiiiip!</li>
            <li> I easily shaved down too far or sliced myself with that thing.</li>
            <li> It works better than many products, but it&#x27;s tiresome!  </li>
            <li> I instantly noticed a difference after the first foot was done.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve used the Verael callus remover both on dry feet and pre-soaked feet, and have found it works better on dry</li>
            <li> All I can find are descriptions that say it&#x27;s professional level, and such, but nothing that actually tells you that you plug it in, turn it to the appropriate setting, and the disc works as a sort of file/shaver in one, so you are to carefully touch it to the callus as it gently removes it.  </li>
            <li> Quickly removes callus and rough spots on the bottom of your feet.  </li>
            <li> A bit over priced and not as powerful as expected, but it does the job and the creams leave your feet really soft!</li>
            <li> Mostly on the hind part of the heel and a little on the outside side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the little handheld doodad&#x27;s that make you use all of the elbow grease, and paid countless dollars for pedicures that I&#x27;m not always completely satisfied with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally able to get rid of the hard heel and under toe calluses.</li>
            <li> When i saw this product and all the great reviews i was desperately hoping it would work for me as well.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it 2x, and it worked very well</li>
            <li> APART.IF YOU WANT SOFT FEET BUY THIS MACHINE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries, but I have to sit near and outlet, so it is not fully portable.</li>
            <li> I use this quite frequently.</li>
            <li> but if you hold it in one place too long it will start to feel hot from the friction.</li>
            <li> I can have soft feet within 5 minutes of using this.</li>
            <li> I tried creams, then I just got soft calluses.  </li>
            <li> About 80% of the callus on each foot is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> My feet are nearly presentable</li>
            <li> The cream makes your feet feel baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have very calloused feet and was hoping this would be a big help.  </li>
            <li> I just have to resist the urge to use it too long at any one time to avoid damage to the skin, and to have the patience to first soften the skin on my feet by soaking.</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional musician and dancer.</li>
            <li> After your first use, experiment in increments by upping either speed or pressure or time until you reach a point where the dry skin is removed.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what a visit to the podiatrist did for me a year ago only I&#x27;m not stuck with a $400 medical bill my insurance company slapped me with for that visit.</li>
            <li> I used a hand-held heal sander, but I had to sand so much, it actually got hot and started to burn my heal.</li>
            <li> The foot cream is decent, and my package also included a facial mask.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure, though: I&#x27;ve owned one of those callus shaver tools, you know, with the little razor blade?</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d bought my Bario first because I have spent hundreds trying to find a product that will remove callouses, including doctors&#x27; prescribed salves and ointments.</li>
            <li> One treatment with the Bario and an overnight application of the foot cream, and my feet were literally back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I get the same results by using a large coarse emery board.</li>
            <li> Using it like you would a sander on a piece of wood, I spent about 10 minutes carefully and lightly sanding my heels where the callus had</li>
            <li> It quickly removes the dead skin build up.</li>
            <li> , it works fine, you can&#x27;t press to hard or it bogs out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this half dozen times and all I can say is that it&#x27;s just okay, not really worth the money in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, pressing too hard will cause the wheel to stop, but if you just hold it lightly against the callus, it removes the dead skin fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have thrown away all other tools collected over the years to smooth my rough feet.</li>
            <li> After several minutes of buffing, I took everything apart (as directed) to clean out the dead skin</li>
            <li> Mine came with a regular old US plug.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m old, so it is a constant battle.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stomach &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my own feet with the foot shavers and since they made it illegal to have it done in the spas, this is going to have to do.</li>
            <li> So I was pretty excited about getting this because i get tired of using callus shavers (and they can be kind of dangerous if you&#x27;re not careful).</li>
            <li> Once I received the Bario, I used it right away and it removed SO much dead skin</li>
            <li> I managed to draw a blood (just a little) when I was getting fussy trying to smooth out a \\&quot;corner\\&quot; of a callus and wound up shaving my skin too far down.</li>
            <li> But, be careful when its on high.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful when you&#x27;re operating in high gear.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the little grooves that your supposed to clean after each use... is always empty.  </li>
            <li> This unit works as stated and the disk seems to last much longer than other abrasive drums or disks</li>
            <li> I can say this product makes me want to maintain my feet and not shy away from putting a few minutes into my feet vs. 30mins to an hour that I would spend before.</li>
            <li> In the past, I had used the little hand \\&quot;egg\\&quot; which was okay, but</li>
            <li> The polishing plates (the part that needs to be replaced) have lasted me over a month for each one, which, given the cost, is less than I was paying for the PedEgg replacement blades (and that was a huge headache because sometimes 2 of the 3 blades would be dull brand new out of the package!).&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using, I wash and dry my feet and apply foot cream and soft foot sox.</li>
            <li> I had very deep layers of dead skin which the Bario cut through the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The only down side of the whole system is having to plug it in to use it.</li>
            <li> Now there&#x27;s no excuse for dreaded yellow soles.</li>
            <li> It removes dry skin and catches it in a container to be disposed of later so there is no mess.</li>
            <li> The whole little thing reminds of me of my husband&#x27;s Dremel tool.</li>
            <li> The rotation device seemed very sensitive to pressure and stopped several times, apparently due to my overzealous buffing pressure.</li>
            <li> I havent had it long enough to see how long each sanding disc will last</li>
            <li> Although its price is somewhat excessive, it&#x27;s worth the money when compared to other products like it.</li>
            <li> Over the course of a few days, I can go from weaponized heels to something akin to normal skin.</li>
            <li> I had expected that I would have to do this every night but it has lasting results and I am thinking I will only have to use it twice a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Well, upon 2nd use and other uses after, this thing basicly does nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been battling tough callouses on my feet for years - they are really hard to keep at bay - normal pumice stones aren&#x27;t strong enough and I have cut myself really badly with callous shavers on more than one occasion.</li>
            <li> I spent 9 months neglecting my feet and getting pedicures only to find my calluses were out of control.  </li>
            <li> I used it several times, it smoothed out the rough areas but did not help the callous buildup.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift to my wife and she has been using it since long time.</li>
            <li> I agree with the previous reviewer in that you can over do it if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a clear description on what this product actually does to remove the callus, and how it all works.  </li>
            <li> This is called a &amp;#34;callous remover&amp;#34; but I am using it as a &amp;#34;rough dry skin remover&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super short, but I wish it was longer.</li>
            <li> But if you hold it in one spot for too long, you will feel a sharp, stinging pain.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews that said to be careful and not stay on one spot too long.</li>
            <li> (yes, you only need a little like the directions state and it does work wonders.)</li>
            <li> Little wisps of what looks like smoke but are actually tiny skin particles started to puff up.</li>
            <li> I have spent allot of money on scrapers and foot soaks</li>
            <li> not really up to the task.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t remove as much as I expected either.</li>
            <li> Move the device to different areas after a few moments.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful, though.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be too rough on areas that weren&#x27;t callused yet still needed</li>
            <li> It works wonders on rough skin and calluses.  </li>
            <li> I have soaked, filed, buffed, had numerous professional pedicures and tried caustic callous removers.  </li>
            <li> I find that the disks don&#x27;t last long (&#x27;cause hooves are HARD)</li>
            <li> The only thing that is inconvenient about it is also the thing that attracted me to it in the first place - it is electric.</li>
            <li> a belt sander but a little goes a long way and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> they work slowly and don&#x27;t always remove the really stubborn callouses (read: the most painful ones!)</li>
            <li> I have one small spot that is just a tiny bit sore because of my overenthusiasm.</li>
            <li> There is nothing you will need to do the job other than this product.</li>
            <li> I have very rough cracked and flaking soles and bottoms of my feet.</li>
            <li> This machine is a few belated bad if it works, also no maul because this it polishes few slowly but it´s good.</li>
            <li> only  complaint is the cord.</li>
            <li> Some are expensive, some not so much.</li>
            <li> Start out slowly as you can get over zealous and you definitely do not want to overuse this device.</li>
            <li> I had barnacles (\\&quot;had\\&quot; is the operative word)on my heels and along the backside of my foot that I used to spend an inordinate amount of my time sanding down.  </li>
            <li> While a tiny bit smoother, no more so than a manual file!</li>
            <li> I typically use a pumice stone in the shower to take off the outer layer and attempt to take down some of the calluses.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the amount of rough skin that came off with this little mini-Dremel!</li>
            <li> If that little pin-prick of a wound is the worst I can do, I consider this tool pretty much idiot-proof.     </li>
            <li> It can be done with a little practice.</li>
            <li> Not a lot, just a little.  </li>
            <li> A little at a time</li>
            <li> I would see perhaps a little improvement but nothing substantial.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is also a safety feature however  I find it stops with little pressure.  </li>
            <li> but I admit that it can hurt/burn if you go to hard on any tender/soft parts of your foot so be careful.  </li>
            <li> If it starts to hurt, pull it away, and the pain will subside after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Remember rough,dry skin is dead skin.</li>
            <li> to use&lt;br /&gt;Not as messy as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t as messy as I figured it would be.  </li>
            <li> A few tips, start with the lower setting until you get the hang of how it works.</li>
            <li> You can return to where you were removing the dead skin</li>
            <li> I also reccomend putting heavy lotion or petroleum jelly on your feet even on the nights that you do not exfoliate them in order too keep the skin softer between treatments.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my profession as a manicurist what a waste of money do not buy.....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for everyone who suffers from calloused feet.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes to do what usually took an hour.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little awkward to use initially until you get the rhythm of the rotation down, but stick with it</li>
            <li> Because of the shape of my feet, ever since I can even remember, I&#x27;ve had a bone at the base of my pinky toe (on both feet), that protrudes a little, but because I also have such narrow feet, this protrusion has just always been callused because it constantly rubs on any shoes that I wear.  </li>
            <li> I work on my feet all day and spend at least fifteen minutes a night trying to get the dead skin off my feet with files, the PedEgg, and pumice stones.</li>
            <li> Even pedicures -- heck, even SPA pedicures -- would leave rough patches behind.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the power adapter is 100v and I am living outside US</li>
            <li> I am constantly barefoot or wearing sandles so needless to say I have calluses.  </li>
            <li> or you can scrape too hard into your softer skin and hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> and eventually I have a hard time walking without it hurting.  </li>
            <li> almost all of the hard thickened skin is gone as well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to be meant to remove hard or thick callouses.  </li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s how it is in my case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fairly thick skin - some cracks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now if you have inch thick bleeding crack calluses, then maybe this product isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> Go slow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now if you have inch thick bleeding crack calluses, then maybe this product isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> Go slow.  </li>
            <li> doing as some suggested in this forum already - slow and circular and keep working the callus...then switch to another callus area</li>
            <li> Unlike the handheld things you can buy at the pharmacy, this removes the callous slowly and evenly.</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> I hated how the back of my heels would look \\&quot;dusty\\&quot; with dry skin.     </li>
            <li> I USED WERE ALWAYS WITH VERY HARD AND THICK</li>
            <li> I admit to being skeptical of the quality of this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> that was painful and even after several spa pedicures, it was still there.</li>
            <li> I just finished the second treatment and all of the painful cracks are gone from my feet and</li>
            <li> Mine were soooo bad I would ruin my socks, leave holes in my fitted sheets, wore out the padding on my shoes long before the soles even showed any wear.</li>
            <li> It can be painful; please be careful.  </li>
            <li> I hate rough skin on my feet</li>
            <li> The device was too expensive for the mediocre quality of performance.</li>
            <li> That was a difficult bump to overcome when making the decision to spend $60 on a callus-removing product.  </li>
            <li> I thought it also might be complicated</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical, but two things made me want to try it:  </li>
            <li> I must admit I was skeptical at first,then I tried this item.</li>
            <li> I wrongly assumed it was battery powered.  </li>
            <li> As for the reviewer who gave a one-star review because he/she received the wrong power adapter, I would suggest, rather than leaving a bad review, try contacting Verael&#x27;s customer service to get a replacement - it was obviously a small detail that was overlooked and doesn&#x27;t necessitate a bad review for the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible, painful callouses on both of my feet for the last 2 years.</li>
            <li> Now THAT was a dangerous piece of equipment in my hands.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Some reviews suggested this was a bad thing because you can&#x27;t be as mobile with it - however, with the state of my feet, I knew that something battery-powered could never do the trick.  </li>
            <li> Feet soooo bad</li>
            <li> and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am returning this product and am disappointed in having to do so.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very dangerous</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people say they hate their feet.  </li>
            <li> I, too, hate my feet.</li>
            <li> I have very bad dry,cracked and callused heels.</li>
            <li> it was shocking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Takes forever to get the job done! The device was too expensive for the mediocre quality of performance. The lotion is nice.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people say they hate their feet.  I, too, hate my feet. However, I have very legitimate reason to.  It&#x27;s not just that they&#x27;re \\&quot;ugly\\&quot; - my feet are very misshapen; hammer toes and all.  Because of the shape of my feet, ever since I can even remember, I&#x27;ve had a bone at the base of my pinky toe (on both feet), that protrudes a little, but because I also have such narrow feet, this protrusion has just always been callused because it constantly rubs on any shoes that I wear.  Always.  I don&#x27;t remember a time in my life (I&#x27;m 30 now), where I haven&#x27;t filed and ground and shaved and pummiced and used callus-removing acid on, just trying to get my feet to a semi-presentable state.  It can be discouraging when people wonder why I&#x27;m wearing close-toed shoes on a 95 degree, 90% humidity summer day in Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally found this product, I was VERY excited to try it.  My initial thought was that it was a bit pricey for a callus file, but I&#x27;ve discovered that it is very much WORTH EVERY PENNY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some key points -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* It is powered by a plug, not batteries.  Some reviews suggested this was a bad thing because you can&#x27;t be as mobile with it - however, with the state of my feet, I knew that something battery-powered could never do the trick.  The power cord v. the battery was a pro in my book.&lt;br /&gt;* I have found that most callus removers require you to soak your feet before using.  However, I&#x27;ve used the Verael callus remover both on dry feet and pre-soaked feet, and have found it works better on dry feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* It can be painful; please be careful.  This thing is powerful.  But if you hold it in one spot for too long, you will feel a sharp, stinging pain.  My guess is that maybe the friction of the file causes the area to heat up.  If it starts to hurt, pull it away, and the pain will subside after a few seconds.  At least that&#x27;s how it is in my case.&lt;br /&gt;* I have had a hard time finding a clear description on what this product actually does to remove the callus, and how it all works.  That was a difficult bump to overcome when making the decision to spend $60 on a callus-removing product.  Maybe that&#x27;s something the suppliers/manufacturers could work on.  All I can find are descriptions that say it&#x27;s professional level, and such, but nothing that actually tells you that you plug it in, turn it to the appropriate setting, and the disc works as a sort of file/shaver in one, so you are to carefully touch it to the callus as it gently removes it.  Something to that affect would have been nice to know (I&#x27;m obviously no writer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary - I am not embarrassed by my feet any longer!  After fighting with callused feet my entire life, this thing is a DREAM!  It&#x27;s surely worth every penny as far as I&#x27;m concerned!  As for the reviewer who gave a one-star review because he/she received the wrong power adapter, I would suggest, rather than leaving a bad review, try contacting Verael&#x27;s customer service to get a replacement - it was obviously a small detail that was overlooked and doesn&#x27;t necessitate a bad review for the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Verael!  Please don&#x27;t EVER stop making this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Be careful, as it is easy to over-do your callus removal and injure your feet. I like that this product is electric, rather than battery operated. I have used other ped-egg type of products with success, but the Bario works much better. The machine does all the work quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the amount of rough skin that came off with this little mini-Dremel! I agree with other reviews that said to be careful and not stay on one spot too long. Follow-up with the foot cream makes for lovely heels, something I never thought I&#x27;d see again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. Works as described. Use gently until you get used to how it works. Is more gentle than the manual callus removers as long as you don&#x27;t apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I had a callus on the ball of my right foot that was painful and even after several spa pedicures, it was still there. Once I received the Bario, I used it right away and it removed SO much dead skin it was shocking. My feet were so smooth and the problem callus was about 80% gone. I waited another day until my next treatment, this time I removed the rest of the callus..I was able to work out and run without any pain for the first time in weeks. This is better than any pedicure that you get at the local nail shop!!!</li>
            <li> No longer can get the replacement disks</li>
            <li> I have spent allot of money on scrapers and foot soaks and then my girlfriend told me about this. It is amazing!!!  So fast and efficient!I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible, painful callouses on both of my feet for the last 2 years. I&#x27;ve tried the over-the-counter callous removing pads a zillion times. they work slowly and don&#x27;t always remove the really stubborn callouses (read: the most painful ones!) When i saw this product and all the great reviews i was desperately hoping it would work for me as well. It did!! It is so easy to use and literally within minutes my callouses were fully removed. This does exactly what a visit to the podiatrist did for me a year ago only I&#x27;m not stuck with a $400 medical bill my insurance company slapped me with for that visit. My feet feel wonderful. My callouses always return so I know I&#x27;ll be using this for a while but it&#x27;s so quick and simple using this product i won&#x27;t complain. I highly recommend this for everyone who suffers from calloused feet.</li>
            <li> I HAD TO PAY FOR TWO PEDICURES A MONTH FOR YEARS. MY FEET DONT MATTER HOW MUCH PEDICURE OR CREAMS I USED WERE ALWAYS WITH VERY HARD AND THICK SKIN.NOTHING I DID WORK UNTIL NOW LADIES HEAR ME MY FEET ARE  VERY VERY SOFT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I USE BARIO I WAS AMAZED OF HOW EASY ,NO SCRUBING NO CUTS .JUST THE BEST MACHINE EVER .I LOVE IT ,SO MUCH EASY TO CLEAN .EASY TO TAKE APART.IF YOU WANT SOFT FEET BUY THIS MACHINE.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my wife and she was thrilled after just one use--said it was very easy to use and her feet were smooth as a baby&#x27;s!  She loved the foot cream too.  She highly recommends this item!</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d bought my Bario first because I have spent hundreds trying to find a product that will remove callouses, including doctors&#x27; prescribed salves and ointments. I had very deep layers of dead skin which the Bario cut through the first time I used it.  Although its price is somewhat excessive, it&#x27;s worth the money when compared to other products like it. Buy the foot cream with it because it, too, is effective.</li>
            <li> I bought Bario to smooth down some pretty tough calluses on my heals and it works great! In the past, I had used the little hand \\&quot;egg\\&quot; which was okay, but not really up to the task. I used a hand-held heal sander, but I had to sand so much, it actually got hot and started to burn my heal. The Bario is quick, easy and gentle on my heals.    The only thing that is inconvenient about it is also the thing that attracted me to it in the first place - it is electric. I don&#x27;t have to replace batteries, but I have to sit near and outlet, so it is not fully portable.</li>
            <li> I spent 9 months neglecting my feet and getting pedicures only to find my calluses were out of control.  One treatment with the Bario and an overnight application of the foot cream, and my feet were literally back to normal.  I bought one for my best friend the next day.  It&#x27;s a little awkward to use initially until you get the rhythm of the rotation down, but stick with it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this product and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it before.  It works great and seems to be made very well.  I have tried so many products over the years to keep my feet callus-free and I&#x27;ve finally got something that works!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I went the route of the hand held &#x27;as seen on TV&#x27;  battery operated callus remover first. I can&#x27;t tell you I over trimmed because the magnetic head lost the plate because the magnet that held it in place went flying. I felt like I was dodging a UFO. Eeek! Back to Kmart it went with my emphatic comments.&lt;br /&gt;The VERAEL  is wonderful and really does a great job on dry, cracked feet in winter and summer when my feet are at their nastiest and lowest.&lt;br /&gt;Here is the deal. Start out slowly as you can get over zealous and you definitely do not want to overuse this device. There is most definitely a learning curve to using this device. I suggest you apply light pressure as you run this at low speed initially. It removes dry skin and catches it in a container to be disposed of later so there is no mess. After your first use, experiment in increments by upping either speed or pressure or time until you reach a point where the dry skin is removed. This will hopefully prevent you from shaving to close and drawing blood. Remember rough,dry skin is dead skin. However, the stuff underneath is alive.&lt;br /&gt;The end results?  Used with some common sense your feet will be smooth and healthy. After using, I wash and dry my feet and apply foot cream and soft foot sox. Continued use will leave your feet in great shape and you will only be using the VERAEL in what I consider maintenance mode once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;I used to go to the salon and get full pedis every 2-3 weeks. Now I go every 6 weeks in winter and every 3-4 weeks in summer and have been saving a lot of money while my feet consistently feel and look good.&lt;br /&gt;My only  complaint is the cord. It&#x27;s not super short, but I wish it was longer. Otherwise this is a great product.</li>
            <li> After I use a more abrasive remover I use this to smooth my feet. I use this quite frequently. I am glad we have such a product that we can purchase.</li>
            <li> I had barnacles (\\&quot;had\\&quot; is the operative word)on my heels and along the backside of my foot that I used to spend an inordinate amount of my time sanding down.  When I applied the Bario I had callus dust filling the room.  It was amazing.  It took a few minutes to do what usually took an hour.  But, be careful when its on high.  I didn&#x27;t realize that I had drawn blood until it showed up on the wheel.  Just be careful when you&#x27;re operating in high gear.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought this fabulous thing over 6 months ago &amp; couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I&#x27;ve used just about every heel smoother, grater, shaver out there &amp; none has been as easy to use. The whole little thing reminds of me of my husband&#x27;s Dremel tool. It&#x27;s basically an easy-to-hold Dremel with the polishing plate attachment. It&#x27;s compact &amp; easy to clean after each use. The only down side of the whole system is having to plug it in to use it. I ended up using an extension cord that plugs into the cord from the Bario that stays connected. After using it I detach the unit from the cords &amp; recoil the cords. So I&#x27;ve learned to live with the whole plugging-it-in thing &amp; I realize that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well if it used batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that for me I get the best results after soaking my feet while showering (plugging up the tub so the water stands). It works better &amp; faster that way. The polishing plates (the part that needs to be replaced) have lasted me over a month for each one, which, given the cost, is less than I was paying for the PedEgg replacement blades (and that was a huge headache because sometimes 2 of the 3 blades would be dull brand new out of the package!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foot cream that comes in the package is just eh. I wasn&#x27;t really impressed. I&#x27;ve used a ton of different things on my feet &amp; some work well at different times. Some are expensive, some not so much. The foot cream smelled good, but seemed too thin for me. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it separately, but it was good to try out anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m totally sold on this thing &amp; recommend it to all of my callus-y friends!</li>
            <li> So I was pretty excited about getting this because i get tired of using callus shavers (and they can be kind of dangerous if you&#x27;re not careful). It definitely does smooth your feet. And I liked that. But it took more work than I expected (although it&#x27;s not difficult to use). And it didn&#x27;t remove as much as I expected either. It kind of felt like I was using a really really low power sander...and kind of had the same effect as well (including the flying &#x27;dust&#x27; particles all over the place. I think i will continue to use this product but in conjunction with a callus shaver. That way i will actually remove my calluses but have nice smooth feet as well. The foot cream isn&#x27;t all that. I prefer Dr. Scholls For Women night foot cream (lavender scented)...it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> This thing works GREAT!  I could see a huge improvement after only one use!  I agree with the previous reviewer in that you can over do it if you&#x27;re not careful.  Just do a little each time and allow a couple of days in between to make sure you don&#x27;t hurt your feet.  I have tried battery powered callus removers, the ped egg and pumice stones and none of them work as good as this Bario!  Try it, you will want to fire your pedicurist.  It&#x27;ll save you a lot of money!</li>
            <li> The set comes with a Bario remover that includes an European, not an US power adaptor. Need I say more...</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works well&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Not as messy as I thought it would be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Wish the cord were longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I admit to being skeptical of the quality of this little gadget.  First of all I want to say that it was a good price for what it does.  I thought it also might be complicated but it&#x27;s as easy as pie.  When I first plugged it in and it started to go I thought \\&quot;You&#x27;ve got to be kidding.  This isn&#x27;t very powerful.\\&quot;.  True, it doesn&#x27;t have as much torque as say a belt sander but a little goes a long way and it does the job.  Way better than a ped egg without all the elbow grease put into it.  My arms don&#x27;t get sore at all!  You may not get all the cracks and calluses off completely the first time but if you use this regularly like maybe twice a week your feet look and feel beautiful!!  Even the first time it gets all the snags and yucky bits off really well and it isn&#x27;t as messy as I figured it would be.  I pictured skin flying everywhere.  YUCK.  But that wasn&#x27;t the case.  It isn&#x27;t very dangerous but I admit that it can hurt/burn if you go to hard on any tender/soft parts of your foot so be careful.  the only thing I wish Verael would do better would be to make the cord longer.  I had to sit on my bathroom counter and do it over the sink (don&#x27;t worry.  My toothbrush and brushes were moved away).  I&#x27;d much rather do it in my enclosed shower though.  Still I can now get into my bed without having that snaggy, scratchy heel feeling.  It&#x27;s glorious!!!  I even got it for my mother in law for Mothers Day.  She loves it too!  Do your feet a favor and buy this.  You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Purchased one for myself and my sister for christmas present!  It works great on the calluses i have on the bottome of each feet !</li>
            <li> I work on my feet all day and spend at least fifteen minutes a night trying to get the dead skin off my feet with files, the PedEgg, and pumice stones. I was looking for something a bit easier to use and I have found it! The Bario is very easy to use and clean. I found the stronger setting (of two) to be more effective on my heels where the skin is thicker (read:crustier.) It was quick to work after the reccomeded foot soaking. I gave myself a treatment and followed with the foot cream (yes, you only need a little like the directions state and it does work wonders.) Three days later, my feet are still in great shape. I had expected that I would have to do this every night but it has lasting results and I am thinking I will only have to use it twice a week. A few tips, start with the lower setting until you get the hang of how it works. Hold the device with some pressure but not too much or you can scrape too hard into your softer skin and hurt yourself. Move the device to different areas after a few moments. You can return to where you were removing the dead skin but if you hold it in one place too long it will start to feel hot from the friction. Follow with the (or any) foot cream and then wear sox to bed. You will have fab feet in the morning. I also reccomend putting heavy lotion or petroleum jelly on your feet even on the nights that you do not exfoliate them in order too keep the skin softer between treatments. I highly reccomend this product. I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this half dozen times and all I can say is that it&#x27;s just okay, not really worth the money in my opinion.  I get the same results by using a large coarse emery board.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product!  I have been battling tough callouses on my feet for years - they are really hard to keep at bay - normal pumice stones aren&#x27;t strong enough and I have cut myself really badly with callous shavers on more than one occasion. Most recently before discovering the Verael electric remover, I had been using Dr. Scholl&#x27;s pedi-egg by hand.  It works better than many products, but it&#x27;s tiresome!  I discovered that there were a lot of electric-powered callous removers and I thought that sounded great.  They varied in price so much, so I read all the reviews.  I didn&#x27;t want to buy something cheap that would break, so decided to go with the Verael.  It&#x27;s really amazing - it makes taking care of your feet so easy.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  It is powerful (but not dangerous!) and has a plug, so you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot on batteries.  I was worried that the disc would wear out quickly and become costly to replace frequently, but I read on their website that the disc can last up to 2 years, as well - so it&#x27;s really a quality, long-lasting product.  The foot cream that is included is amazing and they also gave a bonus of two free facial masks!  I am so glad that I bought this.</li>
            <li> I am returning this product and am disappointed in having to do so. I used it according to the package directions. The rotation device seemed very sensitive to pressure and stopped several times, apparently due to my overzealous buffing pressure. After several minutes of buffing, I took everything apart (as directed) to clean out the dead skin but there was nothing to clean out. For the price, I was expecting a much more effective product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think this could do the trick for me.  I think I&#x27;m fighting more than flip-flop heals ~ but genetics as well.  This thing, and a cream I use combined ~ is fantastic.  Love it.  Will use forever.</li>
            <li> This little gadget works better than I thought it would. It requires a very light touch or the rotary disc will stop. It can be done with a little practice. Removed the calluses and dry skin beautifully and my feet are now very smooth. I would certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This  is the best Foot file I&#x27;ve ever owned works very well fits well in your  hand be careful very strong keep the file new</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t impressed.  It was a good price, but didn&#x27;t work the wonders I wanted on my calluses!  While a tiny bit smoother, no more so than a manual file!</li>
            <li> I love how easy this is to use and how quick I get soft skin with this. I can have soft feet within 5 minutes of using this.</li>
            <li> Ok, I had calluses built up over years on my heels.  Mostly on the hind part of the heel and a little on the outside side.  Fairly thick skin - some cracks.  It was getting to the point where it would even start to hurt when I walked a lot - my heels would be sore.  This condition crept up on me over the course of years.  I tried the hand scrapers, they just seemed to tear up my skin and not make anything better.  I tried creams, then I just got soft calluses.  I&#x27;d given up.  Then I saw this on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews.  I was highly skeptical, but two things made me want to try it:  First, it isn&#x27;t battery operated, it is plugged into the wall. I was very dubious about anything that was battery operated because it seemed that my calluses were more heavy duty than that.  Second, a large number of people gave it great reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived about two hours ago.  I took it out of the box, plugged it in, and started \\&quot;sanding\\&quot; my calluses on my heels.  Little wisps of what looks like smoke but are actually tiny skin particles started to puff up. Not a lot, just a little.  Extremely fine dust.  Using it like you would a sander on a piece of wood, I spent about 10 minutes carefully and lightly sanding my heels where the callus had developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am stunned and amazed.  My heels now are perfectly smooth.  About 80% of the callus on each foot is completely gone.  I can \\&quot;feel\\&quot; my heels again through my skin.  If I step on something with my heel, it registers.  I finished up, put some Lubriderm lotion on each heel to let them recover a bit.  I walked around my house.  It was glorious!  No pain!!!  After ONE use!  My feet are nearly presentable again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know perfectly well now that after I wait a few days, keeping the area moisturized well, and use this device two or three more times you won&#x27;t be able to tell my feet ever had calluses at all.  I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews.  But this product has literally changed my life for the better.  I even came on today to buy the extra blade \\&quot;plates\\&quot; that I know that I will eventually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you have inch thick bleeding crack calluses, then maybe this product isn&#x27;t for you.  You need to bring that condition under control before you try something like this.  But if you just have normal thick-ish type callus areas that have begun to surface crack and harden, then give this a try.  Be patient with it.  Go slow.  I think you will be as happy as I am about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your feet are like mine, buy it.  Buy it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 9 months:  My heels are still great.  I only have to use this once every 2-3 weeks now to keep them smooth and callus free.  I love this thing!!y changed my life for the better.

            <li> A bit over priced and not as powerful as expected, but it does the job and the creams leave your feet really soft!</li>
            <li> I just bought my second one, because my daughter talked me out of mine.  This is quick and easy and doesn&#x27;t get hot from the friction like others I have tried. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing little machine. Sands your rough skin right off: ziiiiiiiip! Gone. The skin underneath is smooth &amp; soft. I walk a lot and kinda pronate so I tend to develop calluses in certain areas... not so cool when a girl&#x27;s trying to rock Summer footwear. Even pedicures -- heck, even SPA pedicures -- would leave rough patches behind. I hated how the back of my heels would look \\&quot;dusty\\&quot; with dry skin.     No more! This baby makes quick work of even the oldest, most stubborn problem spots. It&#x27;s kinda of intimidating at first, though. I&#x27;m not used to rubbing fast-moving metal graters over my skin, so I was pretty timid starting off but then quickly got comfortable pushing more firmly and of course flipping the switch to the higher setting. Never use the lower setting these days, why bother? Higher speed &#x3D; faster job.    You do have to be careful, though. I managed to draw a blood (just a little) when I was getting fussy trying to smooth out a \\&quot;corner\\&quot; of a callus and wound up shaving my skin too far down. D&#x27;oh! Full disclosure, though: I&#x27;ve owned one of those callus shaver tools, you know, with the little razor blade? Now THAT was a dangerous piece of equipment in my hands. I easily shaved down too far or sliced myself with that thing. But this electric shaver? If that little pin-prick of a wound is the worst I can do, I consider this tool pretty much idiot-proof.     Oh yeah, one more thing -- DO NOT LISTEN TO THE ONE-STAR REVIEWER WHO SOMEHOW RECEIVED THE EUROPEAN VERSION OF THIS ITEM! Mine came with a regular old US plug. No problems there. Maybe that reviewer was accidentally ordering on amazon.uk or something...???     Anyway, great product. Now there&#x27;s no excuse for dreaded yellow soles. Your feet will thank you!</li>
            <li> very easy to operate,very effective, keeping my heels soft and smooth, have actually used it on all my kids and even hubby  !!!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  I tried several times but to no avail.  I just simply does not work.</li>
            <li> Forget the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; products. If you have calluses, this is the best of the serious products for the problem.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a bit pricey at first, but after reading the reviews decided to try it.  I just recieved it last night and immediately gave it a try.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it - worth every penny!!!  So much better than any salon has ever done.  Quick and efficient, easy to use.</li>
            <li> For years my feet always look like a snake shedding skin with some deep cracks.  I typically use a pumice stone in the shower to take off the outer layer and attempt to take down some of the calluses.  I have used the ped egg...and that is an ok product but I found it to be too rough on areas that weren&#x27;t callused yet still needed evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device makes it so effortless.  I use the slower speed in evening out the more sensitive areas of my feet and then I use the higher speed to work on the calluses...doing as some suggested in this forum already - slow and circular and keep working the callus...then switch to another callus area so I don&#x27;t overdue it.  As I get older, I like things that make my job easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I neglect my feet, which is easy to do in this busy world, they crack and just look yucky and eventually I have a hard time walking without it hurting.  I can say this product makes me want to maintain my feet and not shy away from putting a few minutes into my feet vs. 30mins to an hour that I would spend before.</li>
            <li> I have a very rare condition on the bottom of my feet in that they are always calloused and bumpy.  I have tried many solutions and sanders in vain but the Verael sander actually makes my feet look pretty normal.  What a great help for summer sandals.  I havent had it long enough to see how long each sanding disc will last but I would compare this to a trip to the foot doctor.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy I listened to the reviews posted here.  It works great and I like the lotion also.</li>
            <li> I just used my Verael callus remover the first time and I absolutely love it!  It is effective but also gentle.  I highly recommend it.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought them all!  Most recently actually resorted to sand paper blocks (literally from Home Depot).  I hate rough skin on my feet and I&#x27;m old, so it is a constant battle.  This is called a &amp;#34;callous remover&amp;#34; but I am using it as a &amp;#34;rough dry skin remover&amp;#34; and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I highly recommend this product (and the foot cream included) and will look for them as gifts, too!</li>
            <li> i like it, it works fine, you can&#x27;t press to hard or it bogs out but it does soften my feet for the day.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I thought it would be, but it works ok.  A little at a time and it will be ok.</li>
            <li> I used to use a foot file, but I have a shoulder injury that was bothered by the filing motion.  So, this works very nicely without much effort.  As others have mentioned, pressing too hard will cause the wheel to stop, but if you just hold it lightly against the callus, it removes the dead skin fairly quickly.  I like the fact that it has a metal wheel instead of an emery disk -- I expect the wheel will last a lot longer.  It is comfortable in the hand and does not generate much loose dust.  The foot cream is decent, and my package also included a facial mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and worth the money.  Used it on my sister&#x27;s feet and she had me order one for her too.</li>
            <li> I love it. It does the job well. So far I have only used it 2x, and it worked very well</li>
            <li> This product really does what it says it will do.  Quickly removes callus and rough spots on the bottom of your feet.  The cream is nice, it really softens your skin after the petticure.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the power adapter is 100v and I am living outside US so Amazon should do something like add a power options between 110v or 240v .</li>
            <li> Product does what it says.  My heel never felt so good.  I am getting a lot of use out of this product.</li>
            <li> This is seriously so awesome! I somehow broke one of the prongs, but it still works perfectly. I cannot stand when my feet &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; my sheets, it drives me nuts. I cannot stomach &amp;#34;shaving&amp;#34; my own feet with the foot shavers and since they made it illegal to have it done in the spas, this is going to have to do.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was skeptical at first,then I tried this item.The best thing that ever could have did.I have very bad dry,cracked and callused heels.This item really works.The cream makes your feet feel baby soft.Must try it to beleive it!</li>
            <li> My man is using this on my feet as I type this review!!! I&#x27;ve had the little handheld doodad&#x27;s that make you use all of the elbow grease, and paid countless dollars for pedicures that I&#x27;m not always completely satisfied with in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth the money!!! He loves it because there isn&#x27;t all the manual labor with sanding my feet with the handheld things. I instantly noticed a difference after the first foot was done. Unlike the handheld things you can buy at the pharmacy, this removes the callous slowly and evenly. The callous that comes out of the device is powdery fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan after just one use!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend this product.  I have had dry, cracked hells ever since I was pregnant with my son over three years ago.  Nothing I have tried has worked.  This product works really well.  While you can still see the cracks in your heel after it&#x27;s done, it feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very rough cracked and flaking soles and bottoms of my feet. this product has made such a difference. I use it and rub on the lotion that came with it and what a difference in such a short time. My wife talked me into getting it and i was sorta reluctant...Glad i purchased it. Would not believe the difference...not embarrassed to wear my sandals now!!</li>
            <li> v.good&lt;br /&gt;I gave this as a gift to my wife and she was thrilled after just one use--said it was very easy to use and her feet were smooth as a baby&#x27;s! She loved the foot cream too. She highly recommends this item!</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x60;t work for me I don&#x60;t think I am using it properly&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it would work for you</li>
            <li> I ordered the callous remover and COULD NOT BE MORE HAPPY WITH IT!&lt;br /&gt;All of the shavers I bought (and never could learn to do), files, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is the bomb!  So easy to use and clean.  The foot cream is wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;, absorbs really well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product 100%&lt;br /&gt;Paula</li>
            <li> Been using the product for a few months now.  I like the fact that batteries are not necessary.  Wish it was a little more powerful, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> This machine is a few belated bad if it works, also no maul because this it polishes few slowly but it´s good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had an infection in my toe after getting a pedicure from a very high end salon. Took one year to get rid of the infection. This product works great. I got the hang of it within a few tries and the foot cream is great too. This machine actually does a better job than a salon.</li>
            <li> I have very calloused feet and was hoping this would be a big help.  I used it several times, it smoothed out the rough areas but did not help the callous buildup.</li>
            <li> I brought this as a gift to my wife and she has been using it since long time. It is perfect and of good quality. Maybe they can provide a cable that is longer but other than that it is a good gift.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all, returned this product. The micro plane works 100 times better, stick with what works.  Reviews saying this works have to be bogus.</li>
            <li> The powered callus remover works well enough.  I wrongly assumed it was battery powered.  I find the power cord is too short and tends to get in the way.</li>
            <li> It quickly removes the dead skin build up. This is a fantastic product,This thing works GREAT! I could see a huge improvement after only one use</li>
            <li> I am constantly barefoot or wearing sandles so needless to say I have calluses.  I use to watch commercials advertising products that get rid of calluses and would laugh.  Because I had already tried them all.  Feet soooo bad you ruin your nylons???? HA!!! Mine were soooo bad I would ruin my socks, leave holes in my fitted sheets, wore out the padding on my shoes long before the soles even showed any wear. Nothing worked.  Nothing was powerful enough to touch my calluses except my electric wood sander and very course sand paper.  This product works!  After just the first use I noticed a huge difference in my feet.  I just finished the second treatment and all of the painful cracks are gone from my feet and almost all of the hard thickened skin is gone as well.  I love this machine!!!!!  Thank you so much!!!!</li>
            <li> For years my heels have ached because of my calluses and the cracks in my calluses. My heel calluses have even kept me awake during the night. The electric callus remover arrived this morning. I immediately took it out of the box plugged it in and gave it a trial run. I can&#x27;t express fully how wonderful this little machine is. I would recommend it to anybody who has this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not the type who wants to spend time having my feet done. I just have to much to do during the day. I like to wear sandals and that&#x27;s why I get these calluses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning, however. The machine spins very quickly and does, after a while, give off a bit of heat. Also, if you miss and hit skin that does not have a callous it couldn&#x27;t hurt. I would recommend not getting too enthusiastic when you take this thing out of the box. I have one small spot that is just a tiny bit sore because of my overenthusiasm.</li>
            <li> works  great,  have  to  take  your  time  .</li>
            <li> Verael callus remover really does an incredible job. Smooths  my feet far better than a professional pedicure.  I have thrown away all other tools collected over the years to smooth my rough feet. There is nothing you will need to do the job other than this product. Best money I&#x27;ve spent on a new product in years.</li>
            <li> This unit works as stated and the disk seems to last much longer than other abrasive drums or disks I&#x27;ve tried.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great product. Finally able to get rid of the hard heel and under toe calluses. I recommend this product to anyone who has tried stones, iron grates, creams with scrapers, etc.</li>
            <li> When I managed to scratch the top of my coffee table with my bare heel, I knew it was time to dig out this callus remover and get to work. I find that the disks don&#x27;t last long (&#x27;cause hooves are HARD) but they work very well when they&#x27;re new. Over the course of a few days, I can go from weaponized heels to something akin to normal skin. I just have to resist the urge to use it too long at any one time to avoid damage to the skin, and to have the patience to first soften the skin on my feet by soaking. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this callus remover. It works as advertised. My feet has never looked so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that it&#x27;s not rechargable. It has to be plugged in to use, so you can&#x27;t use this product in the shower.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  Wish I had purchased it years ago and saved myself the expense of crappy pedicures.  My feet have never been so soft and smooth.  It works wonders on rough skin and calluses.  Honestly love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s true, as other reviewers have noted, that you must apply very light pressure lest the device stop rotating.  Just takes some practice, but it&#x27;s extremely effective.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference on first use.  Smooths feet entirely.  It doesn&#x27;t appear to be meant to remove hard or thick callouses.  But one trip to the foot salon to take care of that, this should keep your feet maintained very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Well, upon 2nd use and other uses after, this thing basicly does nothing. It&#x27;s supposed to be a callus remover... not by any stretch of the imagination.  In fact, the little grooves that your supposed to clean after each use... is always empty.  All it does is lightly go over your feet, it doesn&#x27;t remove anything.  I am returning this product.  The $9 sofeet callus remover does way, way more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my profession as a manicurist what a waste of money do not buy.....It does not work......</li>
            <li> I have had a callous causing quite a bit of soreness when I walk.  I have soaked, filed, buffed, had numerous professional pedicures and tried caustic callous removers.  I would see perhaps a little improvement but nothing substantial.  I received the Verael today and after one use, sweet relief.  This thing is amazing!  I &#x27;m so glad I bought it.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My wife is a professional musician and dancer. For 15 years she has been having problems with her feet. Visits to several experienced doctors did not result in a solution. After discovering this machine the result was incredible. After 3 uses the pain is gone. Just make sure to follow the instructions. Thank you Verael.</li>
            <li> so far i&#x27;m pleased with the product. As soon as it arrived i had put it to the test. it did what it is supposed to do. tonight when im working i get to feel how it worked.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised, I notice that the motor is not as strong as perhaps it should be and stops occasionally.  I believe this is also a safety feature however  I find it stops with little pressure.  Gets the job done.</li>
