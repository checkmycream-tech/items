            <li>Time will tell how well the self-sharpening blades work out, but he likes that the Norelco boasts being &amp;#34;skin-friendly&amp;#34; which is possibly it&#x27;s best perk of all!</li>

            <li>Once it snaps into place, the wheel adjustment is great.</li>
            <li>It works great as a beard trimmer, but as a shaper, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>

            <li>I am keeping mine and hope for a couple good years out of this set.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had nothing but good results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; The Good Stuff &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;</li>
            <li>You do get 1:1 ratio for charge to use, which is surprising for a mechanical device like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is a fair deal at the price point ($50 at time of purchase).&lt;br /&gt;- Voltage.  </li>
            <li>- I&#x27;d characterize it as &#x27;good in the hand&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>5100 Beard Trimmer is a good one.</li>
            <li>good battery life</li>
            <li>Holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm - battery&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>That said I am not the best at reading directions and like things to be clean, so I rinsed the conair off...</li>
            <li>Holds true to the best reviews.  </li>
            <li>I continue to be &#x27;Very Pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li>Works great, love it.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it now for a while and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>thing I liked about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s really a good size for trimming beards.</li>
            <li>The depth settings are really nice and it feels good in my hands.</li>
            <li>love it cuts very smoothly and shapes my beard very good</li>
            <li>The blade protrudes the perfect amount for making shape trims on beards for good straight lines.</li>
            <li>Pretty excellent.  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>) Attractive and more importantly practical design; the trimmer adjustment display is a great idea that takes the guesswork out of trimming your beard</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>The battery life is great and it charges very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Easy cleanup by rinsing under water is great.  </li>
            <li>It is well constructed and nicely designed with an almost infinite choice of beard lengths.  </li>
            <li>I liked the Wahl but it required gobs of fiddly attachments to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it would be nice if it came with a stand</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t care all that much , this is one GREAT BEARD TRIMMER!  </li>
            <li>No frills; trims beard nicely with 1 adjustable head.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer, and multifaceted, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come with its own travel bag.te, hair clippings, deodorant, etc.  </li>
            <li>2) it doesn&#x27;t come with its own travel bag.</li>
            <li>I believe that the Trimmer will work great in the future based on the performance thus far.&lt;br /&gt;A happy customer!</li>
            <li>so having the head rotate into position smoothly and securely, without having to CHANGE heads is great!  </li>
            <li>because of the design it doesn&#x27;t poke, and separates the hairs nicely.  </li>
            <li>no my name is not Jeff Bezos, and I own no stock.  </li>
            <li>I suppose a nose hair trimmer would be nice, but I don&#x27;t need one.  </li>
            <li>Everything feels nice and sturdy with no wobbly pieces or chintzy feeling plastics.</li>
            <li>The fully washable feature is nice</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a nice trimmer after always buying the cheapest ones.</li>
            <li>Nice battery life.</li>
            <li>Nicely made.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also nice to have a rechargable</li>
            <li>couple of nice features include:&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really nice</li>
            <li>I decided i liked the stubble</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it as a clipper to clean up and shape my son&#x27;s neckline when giving him hair cuts and it works just great for that.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard a perfect &#x27;stubble&#x27; length and cuts smoothly and quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to have the full trimmer and the detail trimmer all in one.</li>

            <li>This is absolutely the most perfect beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>beard crumbs dusted over the nice shiny wood and the nice stuff the she has on the dresser top.</li>
            <li>all in all, a great find, worthy of your dollars.</li>
            <li>The adjustable trimming comb installs easily and adjusts perfectly to cut the exact length you want.</li>

            <li>Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used thus far on beard.</li>
            <li>Just a nice unit, better than the Wahl</li>

            <li>You can sculpt very fine lines, manage sideburns and all that jazz.</li>
            <li>Great device, easy to clean, recommend it.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with the product and best of all its clean!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price and being able to rinse it off is very nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple of &amp;#34;get acquainted&amp;#34; issues, I am pretty happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple of &amp;#34;get acquainted&amp;#34; issues, I am pretty happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very accurate.</li>
            <li>It doesnt pull and it seems to not leave razor burn which is very important..</li>
            <li>Very precise.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, powerful trimmer that looks elegant, trims nicely, and has a nice charge capacity.</li>
            <li>This has nice power and is easy to control.</li>
            <li>The unit is a nice shape and is easy to handle and control.</li>
            <li>The shave is extremely comfortable and it does a great, quick job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is very comfortable to adjust very much enjoying the cut styles.</li>
            <li>So far this one seems to be great, good strong battery,charges in 1.5 hours and lasts me over a month of trims.</li>
            <li>This model also has a very comfortable design, is easy to hold, is lightweight, and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Plenty of power to trim the most stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>I had the Conair istubble for two years and it is much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m well pleased.</li>
            <li>I love that the blade just clicks around for the detail trimmer instead of having to switch out heads.</li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer, especially compared to the $20-25 &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Perfect for touching up ears and nose (let&#x27;s hear it for middle age!).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to break when I pull it off, but I do find myself cradling it a bit during removal just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent product by Philips.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Well made but the most challenging to use beard trimmer that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I reviewed many trimmers before I settled on this one.</li>
            <li>no pinch for sure.  </li>
            <li>so check that review out if you want to read about the top of the line beard trimmer and then compare the two.</li>
            <li>Works ok.  </li>
            <li>I also have the $20 Conair iStubble which works better</li>
            <li>so its a lot better value than this one.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve owned about 6 different beard trimmers in my lifetime and -- not even exaggerating -- this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>OK, as this is a Vine product, there will end up being plenty of reviews.</li>
            <li>They all seem to be junk these days, mostly battery probes.</li>
            <li>Overall a very great trimmer.</li>
            <li>But when I went to order it, I noticed that the price more than tripled.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>read so many reviews when looking around that</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>The obvious..a great one pass (maybe two in a couple places),  very even, non pulling shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion---are there better trimmers out there?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok trimmer, but it could could better than it does.</li>
            <li>My husband has been using this trimmer for the last month on his goatee, and we&#x27;re very happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li>I chose this trimmer after reading many reviews of many trimmers.</li>
            <li>This Philips really does a great job for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, not the best trimmer out there, but for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>and glad I was able to grab this from the Vine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become pretty interested in finding the perfect beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>It means that I don&#x27;t have to keep track of my favorite clip on guards- just the one guard.</li>
            <li>: it has as much or more power than the Whal</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Excellent trimmer with decent battery life and quick recharge.</li>
            <li>Simply the best.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to have a much better battery management circuit as the unit will stop charging once the battery is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to have a much better battery management circuit as the unit will stop charging once the battery is fully charged.  </li>
            <li>Being able to adjust the length from 1/64&amp;#34; (0.4 mm) to 13/32&amp;#34; (10mm), with 17 settings in between, speaks well to the level of precision on the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The fact that you do not need to oil it and can just wash it off makes it even more user friendly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m quite happy with this trimmer, and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustment dial and the fact that it stays where you set it.</li>
            <li>Even though the BT is more refined, it doesn&#x27;t always translate to better performance.  </li>
            <li>The Remington has a wider blade, and is more &#x27;multi-purpose&#x27;, but this is better as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a perfect razor for shaping and trimming up beards and facial hair.</li>
            <li>It mostly damages skin.</li>
            <li>Battery hold excellent but had to pass over a few times for a good cut.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>this is much better.</li>
            <li>if/when the battery dies permanently, i assume i&#x27;ll be able to continue using it while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li>so i shopped out the best trimmer at short beard lengths and arrived at this.</li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my Philips Norelco T980 (the vacuum one), and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Plus it has a vacuum to catch all the trimmings which is awesome.</li>
            <li>So, I might spend 3 minutes going different directions to get a very nice, even look, instead of 1 minute….darn!  </li>
            <li>I original owned a conair istubble shaver that I really liked.  </li>
            <li>a plus if you&#x27;re on the go), no holder or case to protect it (at its cost, might be nice to have something to keep it stored upright or a case to cover it), max length is 10mm (OK for me, but something to consider if you&#x27;re going for the full beard</li>
            <li>Good quality, long battery life and great features.  </li>
            <li>I also used it to trim some neck and sideburn hair, and again it does a nice job, makes a clean cut, and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it&#x27;s a truly high quality product, but out of the box and about 2 weeks in, I&#x27;m still as happy as ever.</li>
            <li>Cuts very cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Bought my son one first and after he used it with good results I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li>Seems to do its job pretty good</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>At the risk of not being the most popular (aka “useful”), I get the freedom to provide a niche review.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust &amp; many settings.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good facility to be able to plug this in and operate it straight</li>
            <li>-Clean with running water (this is why I bought it)&lt;br /&gt;-No attachments!</li>
            <li>Works perfect and is much better that other beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li>far I am very pleased this with beard trimmer !</li>
            <li>One end is full width, but rotating the head gives you a half-width blade suitable for precision trimming.  </li>
            <li>It was the fastest and most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>Trims smoothly even the thickest beard in the world (mine is top 10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the motor speed is faster, so it cuts faster and it cuts closer to the skin if you so desire.  </li>
            <li>It seems very well made, and it feels good and fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge forever, trims very accurately, requires almost no maintenance, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>There are so many reviews where people say they would never own a Norelco, Panasonic, Wahl etc again, and many more who said it was the best trimmer they ever owned.  </li>
            <li>very precise and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easily cleaned</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does job as advertised.</li>
            <li>The cutter head easily pops off and can be rotated 180d.  </li>
            <li>(so you can use one blade on wider areas and one as a detail trimmer), and this also can be rinsed under the faucet for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>Easy and accurate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However the wheel does turn easily and indeed makes depth adjustment easy.</li>
            <li>Each of those accessories easily come off and on.</li>
            <li>r easy to view and change the selector</li>
            <li>Simply great as it is very efficient and powerful tool.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with a lot of adjsutments</li>
            <li>Just one sliding guide&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomic, easy to use design&lt;br /&gt;-Relatively sturdy and robust</li>
            <li>Guide adjustment easily set and stays put.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and charge.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this product to any man with a beard.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to maintain a decent beard then this a good one.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this kind of beard trimmer on my scraggly, not-thick beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>While both do the job pretty effectively, I’ve decided to stay with the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use: the angle of the cutter head is just right for my face and it has plenty of power to go through my wiry beard.</li>
            <li>As so many other reviews have indicated, it really is an  excellent product and worth investing in.</li>
            <li>No pulls, no issues cleaning, holds a charge, light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>10mm sounds fine, but I like my goatee just a bit longer during colder seasons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The guard is secure and easily adjustable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Rather than go into a full fledged list of pros and cons, I will just say that the conair was slightly more comfortable on my face and faster at trimming to .4mm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 series beard trimmer for exactly 3 trimmings over as many weeks and am quite pleased with the results and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once it is on the trimmer functions fine.</li>
            <li>Previous models were excellent.  </li>
            <li>This device also holds a strong charge for a while making it very useful.</li>
            <li>This trimmer gets clogged very easily if you don&#x27;t use the comb attachment, and I for one like to keep my scruff pretty short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you pull from the top, it seems like it would either not come off, or it might be too much force, but popping it loose on the side works great!  </li>
            <li>Does not pull hair and its so comfortable to hold it.</li>
            <li>It was great at trimming stubble and really short settings.  </li>
            <li>and where does Philips Norelco fit in?</li>
            <li>Works great and the battery last over a week in my case.</li>
            <li>precise length adjustment...</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer, it feels good in the hand, it&#x27;s fairly quiet and it&#x27;s by far the sharpest trimmer I&#x27;ve used to date.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and maneuver around the face to get what you need done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rotating dial is smooth to operate, with detentes that let you know that you are &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; the setting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s washable--not important for me, but might be for some.&lt;br /&gt;8.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine a simpler one that does such a great job</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is of course an included charger but no base.</li>
            <li>but this trimmer has become and indispensable part of my grooming routine.</li>
            <li>but this trimmer has become and indispensable part of my grooming routine.</li>
            <li>The comb seems cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s been comfortable to use</li>
            <li>I received the product and did not work ; do not turn on the light of battery charge and</li>
            <li>However it does provide a nice trim for my beard, and it does seem reasonably well built.</li>
            <li>However it does provide a nice trim for my beard, and it does seem reasonably well built.</li>
            <li>Precise length control.  </li>
            <li>In terms of power, it&#x27;s one of the more powerful than most, but probably not as powerful than the Li Ion Wahl.</li>
            <li>So where does this fit in?</li>
            <li>Even with the guide removed it smooth across skin and never pulls.  </li>
            <li>The colors are nice, and it has a really sleek, high-tech look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer has rounded blade edges, so it glides smoothly across the skin.</li>
            <li>It snaps into place securely... too securely.</li>
            <li>I owned a couple of the Norelco G370 kits, when they were available.  </li>
            <li>so far so good, hopefully battery will stay charged</li>
            <li>Several months ago, I noticed this beard trimmer was coming out and thought it might make a good replacement and provide even better results.</li>
            <li>First one used replaceable batteries and had great power, but needed new batteries too often.  </li>
            <li>it is agile, follows contours around the mouth well, and trims right up to the edges, reaching everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a use for the mini-trimmer, but I can see that some people may find it very useful depending on the style of beard they have.  </li>
            <li>Amazing how fast a guy can move to do a clean up when his life is passing before his eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it to clean up hubby&#x27;s hairline on the back of his neck and his sideburns and it works great for that too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy, accurate, and no nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives you the perfect messy clean look.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, powerful, easy to clean,</li>
            <li>Change of length is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>This guide allows you to trim your beard or sideburns to any length you desire, quickly and easily without having to worry about making mistakes.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is a lot cheaper than the high end ones, yet it still does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>This thing works great and stays charged a really long time.  </li>
            <li>Original Review:   </li>
            <li>Works great, keeps a charge for a long time</li>
            <li>This one was OK, but I liked the other one better.</li>
            <li>Quiet, effective, love the head flexibility and length options.  </li>
            <li>Dual trimmers allow for more options in grooming and far more precision.</li>
            <li>I can think of a few things I&#x27;d change for me, but I think this design will make the most people happy.  </li>
            <li>Does not, though, give as clean shave as had hoped it is as described.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to fool around with a brush to clean the blades on this trimmer</li>
            <li>For trimming using the attachment, both work great, but I actually find that the curved QT model to be more comfortable and slightly more uniform using the same numerical setting as the BT; the loudness and crudeness of the QT is not a bother.</li>
            <li>not as close as could be (pretty damn good, but my old one feels like a fraction of a mm closer)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish the attachment had a full guard.</li>
            <li>I used this to shave--while I was standing at my wife&#x27;s dresser drawer mirror, which was almost my last act on this good earth.</li>
            <li>It just feels good, durable, time will of course be the ultimate test</li>
            <li>I figured it would only be fair to contribute one myself.  </li>
            <li>battery life is good razor is quiet, but does miss hairs...</li>
            <li>He is starting  on his business career and needs the beard trimmer to make a good impression , by keeping his beard neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li>The true test is when I shave around the ear area.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve liked this trimmer a lot.</li>
            <li>so if the battery runs out, plug it in and use it immediately at full power.</li>
            <li>Unless you are a male model with the perfect beard that grows entirely in one direction neatly, I would say MOST trimmers on MOST beards will take a few passes to get a nice even look.  </li>
            <li>From 0.4mm (good for a very short stubble) up to 10mm (good for a fairly &#x27;longish&#x27; beard, but not quite long enough to trim the hair on your head, unless you like it</li>
            <li>It takes many more passes to get a consistent trim with this than the old groomsman that I had for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had the unit for several months now, and found that the battery lasts for many, many trims.  </li>
            <li>A quick turn</li>
            <li>Cleaning is also quick andeasy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll chew up your beard quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite thing about this style of trimmer, just being able to rinse it instead of using a tiny brush to get hair out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have the wide trimmer on top that gives a really nice performance and the detail trimmer on the bottom.</li>
            <li>plastic comb attachment is the only part that snaps on/off and is very easy to get on/off thanks to two included plastic guide legs that fit into the top portion of the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This unit fits nicely in your hand, and holds a charge like no other.  </li>
            <li>We are a Philips Norelco family at this point and love the high quality of their products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first beard and first trimmer and so far so good.</li>
            <li>The small detailing side is perfect for close spots around your mouth and sideburns, while the large trimming side gets the rest.</li>
            <li>The laser guide allows for more precision and the digital display makes viewing the comb length setting quick and easy.</li>
            <li>However, if you want something with the following that will do the job, this is a pretty good bet;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 Beard Trimmer works really well, is easy to operate and cleaning</li>
            <li>Being that the trimmer is fast, you better not make a mistake or there goes the whole look!</li>
            <li>The top of this unit actually rotates between the main trimmer and an even more precise mini-trimmer.  </li>
            <li>it would be a better overall option, but as-is I can&#x27;t say I strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Great for any stubborn hairs when trimming to a tight stubble.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to spend some more you might get some bonus attachments and maybe a vacuum feature, but otherwise I couldn&#x27;t imagine a blade any better than this one.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, but not as easy as my last Norelco with the titanium blades.  </li>
            <li>A great little shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great little machine.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer has an amazing battery, and it trims longer facial hair to perfection.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this trimmer, it&#x27;s far better than my old Philips flip out trimmer.</li>
            <li>Amazon has them for as low as $7.75 (Wahl) and Hammacher Schlemmer has what looks like an amazing one for $20 if you have barbed wire growing out of your nose.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is very lightweight and it&#x27;s cordless which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>Beard and sideburn trimming are fast and precise.  </li>
            <li>MUCH better than the trimmer I was using - the comb is much more forgiving and adjusts for a wide range.</li>
            <li>He has a small muzzle and the small side works just perfect for that.. and the larger is perfect size for his body.  </li>
            <li>the smaller cutter does a nice job of trimming the hair in my ears.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;So far its more that what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>I liked what they had to say and found the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 as the same trimmer without the laser guide.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I miss about the Norelco G370 is the nice charging dock.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far I&#x27;m a happy customer, and I hope it&#x27;ll hold up over time.  </li>
            <li>Overall a really nice trimmer though.</li>
            <li>oh did I say it was powerful too?  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth  </li>
            <li>The Trimmer itself is great and works as expected but for the price i&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t come with many attachments like the earlier philips top trimmer that i bought.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but the motor seems to struggle frequently.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff so far &amp; soft on the skin</li>
            <li>My old trimmer died, so I was glad for the opportunity to try this model out.</li>
            <li>The Lithium ion batteries are worth the hype in this device.  </li>
            <li>My main problem is that my hair build up in the spacer very quickly, so I basically have to take it off and shake it out after every pass</li>
            <li>All in One, which is by far more than you need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had about 5 over the years, with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>Adjustable trimmer comb is a really nice feature, but it doesn&#x27;t cut very short without the comb</li>
            <li>This by far is one of the better beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>An amazing all-in-one beard trimmer with no oils needed to keep the blade sharp and rust free.</li>
            <li>The number setting are not digital, but are easy to see, and easy to adjust by just dialing where you want the length of cut.  </li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with trimming the entire beard to a certain length as well as the close trim to shape my beard.  </li>
            <li>, they never do a good job of trimming right around the nose area due to the shape and configuration of the attachment.</li>
            <li>just the right weight in the hand---</li>
            <li>This one seems to be right on the mark.</li>
            <li>the box was opened right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for a year now and its still going as strong as new.  </li>
            <li>Perfect graduation gift for young man with small beard.  </li>
            <li>And, unlike my last trimmer, this trimmer&#x27;s settings are very easy to read.</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and precise, and are easy to clean with a quick stroke or two of the brush provided.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and provide a nice, clean cut.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as great, if not better.</li>
            <li>I bought the same / similar model twice because I was comfortable with the design, the way they worked, and I thought they did a good job at keeping my beard trimmed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for catching the trimmings, but never was that great for precise trimming, irritates and snags against the skin if you use the bare blade and horrible for getting the area between the nose and upper-lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for catching the trimmings, but never was that great for precise trimming, irritates and snags against the skin if you use the bare blade and horrible for getting the area between the nose and upper-lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this to use on my Chinese Crested which has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Best of all no fussing around with clip-on length attachments that you will obviously lose yourself, or have someone near and dear to you throw away for no apparent reason.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me about 10 seconds first time using this trimmer to get the right adjustment for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean by simply running the faucet over the tip, but not meant to be fully submerged.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because this unit has a superior lithium-ion battery and my previous unit</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s because this unit has a superior lithium-ion battery and my previous unit</li>
            <li>Comparing the QT with this model in terms of mechanics, this BT model is much quieter, smoother to turn the dial, has a push button on/off as opposed to a sliding on/off, better charging feedback in terms of changing colors to give proper status, and, of course, this model is washable to clean under water as the QT is not.</li>
            <li>I think if it was either A) more powerful, or B) smaller</li>
            <li>I keep a full beard, so I need a trimmer mainly to shorten the length.</li>
            <li>After years of using Norelco lines for trimming I was excited to get a new Norelco trimmer</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason I took away a star is that I saw today that the released a new unit for whole-head grooming that I might like better!</li>
            <li>a huge plus when you&#x27;re shaving in the early morning).</li>
            <li>So far, that seems accurate.  </li>
            <li>So far, that seems accurate.  </li>
            <li>However, it is much harder to get a really nice and even trim all around for this type of trimming.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>A wonderful trimmer has been rendered useless by an inoperative switch.</li>
            <li>Philips is a big company and they should be doing a much better job with the quality control of their products.  </li>
            <li>More packaging here than necessary for this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Doesn’t seem to require as many passes over the same area to produce uniform length.</li>
            <li>the first go around anyway.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a goatee for over 20 years now and have gone through many different beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>If your trimmer requirements are similar to mine, then I think you&#x27;ll be quite satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>There are 17 selections, with many short selections.</li>
            <li>The bonus of course is that you&#x27;re not wasting precious battery life powering a digital display.</li>
            <li>The adjuster takes all the guesswork out of exactly what length you&#x27;re trimming at.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t even try using this for more &#x27;personal&#x27; areas.</li>
            <li>First trimmer I have used (over 20 or so years)</li>
            <li>When I first opened it I thought, &#x27;yikes:</li>
            <li>Love the dial for creating different length settings.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my fiance and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>so you always get the exact length you want.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I run it over the same area, I always end up using scissors to finish my trim</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Those things aside, I really like this trimmer!</li>
            <li>You have to make an effort to turn it on and off, instead of the switch being located where your fingers fall naturally higher on the handle.  </li>
            <li>A slide type switch, located higher on the unit would have been ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>His first impressions of the Norelco 5100 trimmer</li>
            <li>However, if you do happen to decide to purchase this beard trimmer, I am pretty confident that you won&#x27;t be sending it back.</li>
            <li>oh, really?!?  </li>
            <li>the price from Amazon was very competitive thank you!</li>
            <li>It seems to vibrate less and it feels more precise than the [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y QT4022]].  </li>
            <li>Be sure to charge it fully the very first time, and it really doesn&#x27;t take that long to charge when it does need it.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle to skin  and the quiet allows for a more peaceful shave.</li>
            <li>I wanted: A good trimmer with low maintenance that would last awhile, justifying the higher price.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, the cutters are nice and sharp and don&#x27;t inadvertently grab any skin.</li>
            <li>Looks large at first.  </li>
            <li>Feels large at first.  </li>
            <li>With a little practice, i was able to get a nice short cut (I keep my beard about 1/4&amp;#34; long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These slight drawbacks aside, it is still a pretty nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>I wish the guard had one or two more long settings...</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I ever had that was capable of being rinsed off, and I like the</li>
            <li>You can use either trimmer directly on your skin, and the tiny side gets really close, which is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It trims very well and consistently.</li>
            <li>I am a simple guy with minimal needs, this is more than I could have asked for, I think I will have this beard trimmer for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>Phillips Norelco Beard Trimmer works good so far (used only for 2 weeks thus far).  </li>
            <li>Take the length guide off the unit and you can make precise edges on your beard or sideburns - or you can trim your beard down to fine stubble to make it easier to shave.  </li>
            <li>The features are pretty standard for a trimmer this size and weight, which is quite light.</li>
            <li>The length is easily changed through the turning point in the middle of the shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery life seems fine-I typically only use it for a minute or two, and it easily handled 30 trims before it needed a recharge.</li>
            <li>Easy to to just revolve blade from regular use to trim use.</li>
            <li>The narrow blade is actually pretty nice for getting at tighter areas, like around the ears.</li>
            <li>Set to 0.4 it certainly isn&#x27;t 0.4mm nor is it 0.4 inches.</li>
            <li>This allows you to hold it firmly and make your trimming accurate and easy.</li>
            <li>The guard is much stronger than regular guards and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Although it does run and trim while plugged in, it will not charge while in use at the same time, which is fine.</li>
            <li>as the marketers would have you believe, but pretty decent nevertheless.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer is  very high class settings</li>
            <li>There is a very large adjustment range-probably an inch or better to down around 1/8 of an inch.</li>
            <li>Nice little dial to adjust length of beard.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times on a single charge!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it many times on a single charge!  </li>
            <li>Gets pretty much a clean shave and saves so much time compared to using a regular razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The Norelco trimmer is so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>Works very well-</li>
            <li>almost like it wants you to charge it, even after it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li>really like the rotating trimmer head.  </li>
            <li>I have a very course beard and it trims and shapes it very well.</li>
            <li>Bought this to do detail trimming, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>So there isn&#x27;t much difference except the exacting laser setting.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>So I didn&#x27;t want lots of extra attachments , nor cheap plasticky stuff.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li>The dual head is very convenient for shaping.</li>
            <li>My cheaper Phillips is much lower quality, but I miss the mini razor on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trims very close (if I wish).  </li>
            <li>Basically, it seems the bottom line in the world of trimmers is that there are a number of different ones available with various features and you (as the person using it) need to determine what&#x27;s important in terms of what you want it to do.  </li>
            <li>just makes things simpler), smooth and even trim in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care much about that, but</li>
            <li>The blades either don&#x27;t cut the hairs or the hairs get stuck and pulled, which is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>look depending on how fast your beard grows.  </li>
            <li>There is a charge indicator, and the charger charges fast.  </li>
            <li>really well made.&lt;br</li>
            <li>on my doorstep at 10AM the next morning with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li>Really guys, a laser!I&#x27;m a gadget guy, but</li>
            <li>But then I&#x27;d feel like keeping it in my tool box, and who wants to run to the garage every time you need a shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The ability to swivel the cutting head to trim your mustache is excellent.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month, and am reasonably satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re using a much lower profile blade.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s all that really matters.  </li>
            <li>It clips very close where it needs to, and it doesn&#x27;t tug on the hair-</li>
            <li>I really like the attachment comb and dial up option for the blades.</li>
            <li>/narrow end much, but they are nifty to have</li>
            <li>Very well built.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li>I had a much cheaper, battery operated trimmer which was adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave it 4 stars because it is very well built and very refined.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t find much to not like about this trimmer, and if it doesn&#x27;t fit your needs, for some reason, they offer a 45 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>I expected better when it came to the size setting.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any negatives with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Well made product and the dual trimming feature is a real plus.</li>
            <li>very comfy on the face.</li>
            <li>Son really loves this.</li>
            <li>I was very displeased with it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The body of the trimmer is sleek enough to hold completely in one hand, allowing for greater control while shaving.</li>
            <li>By the third trim, I could get a nice even and short</li>
            <li>Buy this one for neat grooming instead of either of the following in the range:&lt;br /&gt;- Norelco 7300, unless you&#x27;re tending a nice big fuzzy hipster-mane.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Although you have to really practice using this to get it right, it does a basic job, if that&#x27;s all you want, and has enough length settings to satisfy most needs.</li>
            <li>Sounds like an odd one, but if you travel a lot having this be suitable for either 110/240V is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were small and loud, but did the job and had several nice attachments, but I didn&#x27;t use most of them.</li>
            <li>However, a team of physicists have been working two weeks to figure out how to refold it so that it fits back in it&#x27;s original space.</li>
            <li>I followed the product and was excited when they finally released it for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had that instant feeling of being significantly upgraded.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the motors run more smoothly, providing less shake and vibration in my hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy who hates to shave, in fact my skin just can&#x27;t take the daily grind of shaving clean with a razor every day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high quality and suited for very close shave detailing.  </li>
            <li>I loved this set of clippers, only one guard, but the guard is adjustable up to just over a half inch</li>
            <li>light, battery lasts a long time, and I can use it while plugged in.</li>
            <li>So I usually keep a nicely trimmed scruff going on all the time.</li>
            <li>Now I have to make sure I&#x27;m 100% down with the comb before taking it out because it&#x27;s a PITA to put it on and take it off again.</li>
            <li>More length settings than my previous shaver, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li>The motor is quieter than my previous trimmers and the bttery fife is much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The larger side to the trimmer blade cuts aggresively and quickly.  </li>
            <li>finally decided on this trimmer based on moderate price, well over 55% 5 star reviews and not too many 1 star</li>
            <li>My older cordless Remington does a better job in much less time.</li>
            <li>Only part I don&#x27;t like is that a different (but not as flexible) version has the built in suction to keep most of the remnants in.</li>
            <li>Decent deal.  </li>
            <li>And, if for some reason you don&#x27;t like it, or you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your particular needs</li>
            <li>trimmer does a better job than the larger Remington in the same price range.</li>
            <li>I never had a decent one before</li>
            <li>The large edge is perfect to do your sideburns, and the small one, when used slowly and carefully will easily trim around your mouth and under your nose.  </li>
            <li>Battery life has been stellar so far, much better than I remember it was on my previous [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] even when it was new.  </li>

            <li>No need for a useless vacuum or a laser guide, this trimmer just trims your beard perfect!</li>
            <li>[QUICK CHARGE]&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges from dead to full in just an</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely high quality, doesn&#x27;t feel toy like at all</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Consequently, I highly recommend giving this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li>I also lose my setting because I have to raise it so high to take it</li>
            <li>The outside wipes clean with a quick stroke of a towel, and it takes up very little room on my counter, especially to the G370 whose many parts were always spilling around the sink.</li>
            <li>new Norelco BT5275 is improved over that previous model in many ways.  </li>
            <li>Bit by paying a little, more on this we are satisfieds.</li>
            <li>I still keep the vacuum trimmer for when I go days without trimming and need the vacuum to keep from shards going everywhere, otherwise this trimmer is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I still keep the vacuum trimmer for when I go days without trimming and need the vacuum to keep from shards going everywhere, otherwise this trimmer is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>As compact as any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used &amp; easy to hold in hand.  </li>
            <li>It has a hard time catching all the hairs on my beard when i trim it.</li>
            <li>My first indication was it comes packaged in what at first sight appears to be the typical bank vault like plastic clam shell that human engineers have devised with the primary goal of extracting as much blood from you as possible while forcing you to use every tool you own to gain entry down to a pair of garden shears.</li>
            <li>This is a really fancy trimmer compared to my old Braun.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it developed this extremely unusual problem where it would not work corded in my bathroom, but would work corded everywhere else</li>
            <li>Quiet and powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li>, and they were pretty much identical, even though they were purchased years apart, they were just different colors.  </li>
            <li>My biggest complaint with this trimmer is it didn&#x27;t come with any kind of case, but not to worry I found one on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to comment on the &amp;#34;self sharpener&amp;#34;, but time will tell.</li>
            <li>You snap that guide in, and then you turn the nicely rubberized grey wheel in the center of the unit to select a length.  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of power and many times takes a few strokes to cut everything evenly.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many trimmers, if you do run it dead, you can plug this one in and finish the job.  </li>
            <li>Unlike my previous Norelco, this one has an indicator light to indicate full charge and low charge.  </li>
            <li>Unlike my previous Norelco, this one has an indicator light to indicate full charge and low charge.  </li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise when I could easily open the clamshell packaging simply and easily without tools and blood</li>
            <li>second indicator was the folded instruction sheet sitting neatly in it&#x27;s provided area, folded out it easily holds basic instructions in two languages.</li>
            <li>used the 9100 five times on a single charge, and it seems to have more uses left.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and will cut for quite a long time without recharging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if it came with a little carrying case for travel (and to hold the cleaning brush), and I would prefer that it used a USB plug so that I do not have to tote an extra transformer.</li>

            <li>I bought a shaver, a wounded body and is supposed to be a new</li>
            <li>and I like the new display.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Along comes this new trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Along comes this new trimmer.</li>
            <li>I knew it was time for a new one</li>
            <li>Would suggest to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before buying a new beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it trims quickly and seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li>The motor is extremely powerful, but does not leave my sensitive skin blotchy and red.</li>
            <li>Clearly I underestimated this particular challenge.  </li>
            <li>When I had to replace a beard trimmer three years ago, I have had trouble finding one that did the same kind of quality trim.  </li>
            <li>Weak and cheap, feels like it won&#x27;t last more than a month.</li>
            <li>When I finished I looked down to see lots of my fine</li>
            <li>It does exactly what he wants it to, loves that he doesn&#x27;t need 10 attachments and that it stays charged for a long time, gets the job done is seconds, literally!</li>
            <li>trimmer is also comparatively quiet, and is powerful and sharp, and makes quick work of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>Used it for once or twice a week for several weeks (7-8 minutes each), and it&#x27;s still on its first charge.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t compare the 5100 to anything other than my old clipper, which was a cheap plasticy junker purchased by an ex girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lazy and being able to multitask and maximize shower time is a plus.  </li>
            <li>It has a swiveling head and on the other end is even a more tiny precision trimmer.</li>
            <li>no problems so far!</li>
            <li>It has 17 length settings, which are in very small increments, so I can easily set it to cut my beard to the exact length I like.</li>
            <li>I have only used one other portable trimmer and this one is far better.  </li>
            <li>Bought this unit new from Amazon and received a used trimmer complete with someone else&#x27;s hair on the head.  </li>
            <li>Like the ease of changing the trim length and battery has held a charge so far, but still very early.</li>
            <li>I finally got my money back, but it a LONG drawn out processed with many steps.  </li>
            <li>Many different settings and long lasting battery.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how long I keep my beard since my last trimmer didn&#x27;t have different settings.  </li>
            <li>That said, it is slightly less bulky than the 9100 and has better grips on the back side.</li>
            <li>Granted, this is more expensive, but the extra cost brings better performance and overall value, particularly in motor power and battery</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first thing I noticed when looking at both pictures and the actual trimmer (still in the box) is the digital readout.</li>
            <li>a well constructed trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Several features which are very impressive are the multiple beard length adjustments, next the double sided stainless steel edging blades work extremely well but be careful how you angle the edging blades as they are also extremely sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t show it in any of the photos here, but there is a hard plastic length guide that snaps into the top of the unit.  </li>
            <li>My husband prides himself on keeping his beard and facial hair trimmed professionally, this trimmer does the job very well</li>
            <li>Replaced my 3 year old Wahl Lithium Ion with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The old one was used weekly and after 5 years it never stopped working.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to think how much battery I have left before I am done trimming.</li>
            <li>Extending the guard fully before removal eases the process considerably.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>For a cordless on my short beard this suits me very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even went so far as to replace it with another when it wore out.</li>
            <li>far these have met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Ah, the old Costco curse--buy it when you see it</li>
            <li>power button is located directly beneath the rotating bit and is a matte-blue plastic button.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my old beard trimmer for probably 2 years and was immediately wowed after switching to this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maintenance and cleaning is a breeze, charging is lightning fast, the motor is quiet (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of trimmers, and this was was sent straight back for a refund.</li>
            <li>When the battery finally does go, it does really whimper out - it just dies.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple that didn&#x27;t wow me, and I still have my resident go-to trimmer the Philips Norelco QT4070.</li>
            <li>This by far the nicest beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>#34;close enough.&amp;#34; I feel like this is just a fraction longer than my old remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old one was no longer in production.  </li>
            <li>Someone with a full thick beard or a person wanting a super close trim may have  different  opinions, but for me this trimmer is definately a 5 star.</li>
            <li>The way it attaches and detaches combined with the cheap feeling plastic retaining clips doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in how long it&#x27;ll last with the frequent detaching and reattaching needed for someone who trims both beard and mustache regularly.  </li>
            <li>Their batteries died quickly, and they didn&#x27;t hold charges for very long, despite following the directions included for optimizing battery life.</li>
            <li>Easy to find your setting by starting out high and working down to where you want, for your personal cut.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this one, but its not up to the task of cutting a consistent length beard.  </li>
            <li>An affordable cordless trimmer that does an excellent and consistent job cutting even thick beards; no hair</li>
            <li>The lowest trim setting of .4mm is, for me, a huge benefit, though only a slight upgrade over my old PN&#x27;s .5mm.</li>
            <li>This razor can be used dry or wet, allowing for greater ease during my daily routine (Shave before or during shower).</li>
            <li>The dial-a-depth trimmer is great in concept but the blades don&#x27;t cut as well as I expected for the brand name and on the lowest setting, I&#x27;ve nicked skin a few times which never happened with previous beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t usually keep your beard too close it&#x27;ll work fine for you.</li>
            <li>, I can just run it under the faucet, and in a few seconds it&#x27;s perfectly clean.</li>
            <li>works ok, not sure if it cuts as close as my last norelco trimmer</li>
            <li>; trimmer head can be rinsed under sink), decent adjustable range (up to 10mm), no attachments (this may turn out to be a con in time if it breaks, but my last Wahl had attachments</li>
            <li>no less start</li>
            <li>Usage time is about 45 mins which is decent enough.</li>
            <li>The head has two sides - one for the regular beard trimmer, and the other side is super small for more detailed, hard to reach areas (e.g. under nose, ears, etc.).</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s sharp angles/straight lines you&#x27;re looking for consider a decent straight blade razor instead of a laser, or a five blade Gillettemonster.  </li>
            <li>My family lineage traces back to Spanish and German roots and as a result I can grow a thick fuzzy beard in about the time it takes to brew a good cup of coffee.</li>
            <li>To remove the comb, I usually pull upward gently on the bottom part where it fits on the side of the trimmer, and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>Probably also important to mention that my beard is about &#x27;average&#x27; thickness, and by no means a dense, thick type (think a solid, Viking bead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Established brand, easy maintenance (self sharpening blades</li>
            <li>The normal side is the same closeness as your barber gets when he/</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure many would find the adjustable length and thick vs thin heads to their liking.</li>
            <li>I do have to say I was a little curious to see what Norelco&#x27;s $200 beard trimmer must be like, but not curious enough to lay out that kind of money.  </li>
            <li>Once going the trimmer made short work of my very full beard and had me back to presentable in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was forever trying to read the small length markings on the TWO  double sided combs on the old one, and they didn&#x27;t snap on and off easily.  </li>
            <li>and I had a new trimmer the next day.</li>
            <li>This is the third Philips beard trimmer I’ve owned and my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>The dial is manual and starts very short and goes pretty long.</li>
            <li>, it has plenty of power to get through at least one trim, I haven&#x27;t tried multiple to see how many it can go.  </li>
            <li>so I can access a narrow blade that gets into harder to reach places (or more stubborn hairs</li>
            <li>I mean like way too thick, lol.</li>
            <li>major annoyance is removing the beard comb.</li>
            <li>Charger is small and travel friendly.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it after a month or so and for the past 6 years have been clean shaven.</li>
            <li>know some people want a travel bag, but as someone who only occasionally travels and tends to just throw all my toiletries into a single larger bag, I consider it a plus that the box wasn&#x27;t full of a bunch of accessories for a landfill.  </li>
            <li>So, I decided to look outside of American manufacturing (the main reason for the Wahl purchase) and came upon the review for an upgraded version of this gem on [...].  </li>
            <li>My latest one has a built in vacuum, which actually doesn&#x27;t vacuum anything and just makes a big mess.</li>
            <li>Generally with something utilitarian in nature like this</li>
            <li>I am still using the clippers on the initial charge-seems to hold charge very well and long runtime</li>
            <li>Thanks to that perky motor, shaving is also much faster than usual.</li>
            <li>After attempting to trim with the norelco this morning was hopeless, I just went back to my old trimmer</li>
            <li>Philips offers a 45 day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>My old one HAD to charge in the stand, so I left it out sitting.  </li>
            <li>It WILL cut you, though, if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>Then again, a bit of brushed metal on the front panel (instead of the cheapo-feeling plastic) would have made a marked difference on the appearance.  </li>
            <li>It barely cuts hair.</li>
            <li>in all, I believe it to be a nice trimmer, but don&#x27;t think I can recommend it with the rounded attachment making it difficult to cut hair or beard in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Definitely not what you might classify as a premium blade, but trims quickly with little fuss.  </li>
            <li>The base of the trimmer head is also nice and smooth, allowing you to lay it flat against your skin rather than raking blade teeth across your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was accustomed to just not being able to trim my entire beard and have to go back with scissors to get hard to reach areas like my upper lip.</li>
            <li>other features don&#x27;t matter as much to me.</li>
            <li>Sharp out of the box and a very well designed product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little big to travel with, which makes the Li-Ion battery not all that useful...</li>
            <li>The problem EVERYONE had with the G370 is the beard trimmer comb was very weak and broke easily, which pretty much made the whole unit useless for it&#x27;s main purpose.  </li>
            <li>While I like the two head (one wide, one narrow for detailed trimming) option, and</li>
            <li>2 blades, wide and narrow for detailed trimming.</li>
            <li>I had nothing to compare to, and thought that making multiple passes through my moderately thick beard and mustache were normal, and that pulling hair, particularly on the mustache was normal.  </li>
            <li>A bit tricky to learn how to set the depth gauge at first, but with a little practice, it is no problem.  </li>
            <li>If you go commando and want to do a close trim though with the bare trimmer then that is where it falls short.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it doesnt get hot when used for a few minutes..</li>
            <li>Instead of a bunch of different size combs scattered all over like other trimmers, you just dial up the length of cut you want and the single comb rises or lowers to exactly the length you want.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I dry trim this trimmer is also fully capable of trimming a damp to wet beard.</li>
            <li>The large blade is still too narrow, making the entire shaving and trimming process take longer.</li>
            <li>Second one was a &amp;#34;first generation&amp;#34; rechargeable and had much too little power.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light-weight and comfortably designed, but it takes a little getting used to the smaller, narrow trimmer.  </li>
            <li>There is no indication of amount of charge left, which is a bit inconvenient since Norelco specifies that it is better to let the unit completely discharge before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Time will tell how well the self-sharpening blades work out, but he likes that the Norelco boasts being &amp;#34;skin-friendly&amp;#34; which is possibly it&#x27;s best perk of all!</li>

            <li> You do get 1:1 ratio for charge to use, which is surprising for a mechanical device like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this is a fair deal at the price point ($50 at time of purchase).&lt;br /&gt;- Voltage.  </li>

            <li> I continue to be &#x27;Very Pleased.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had it now for a while and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> thing I liked about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s really a good size for trimming beards.</li>
            <li> The depth settings are really nice and it feels good in my hands.</li>
            <li> love it cuts very smoothly and shapes my beard very good</li>
            <li> The blade protrudes the perfect amount for making shape trims on beards for good straight lines.</li>
            <li> Pretty excellent.  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> ) Attractive and more importantly practical design; the trimmer adjustment display is a great idea that takes the guesswork out of trimming your beard</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> The battery life is great and it charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy cleanup by rinsing under water is great.  </li>
            <li> It is well constructed and nicely designed with an almost infinite choice of beard lengths.  </li>
            <li> I liked the Wahl but it required gobs of fiddly attachments to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it would be nice if it came with a stand</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t care all that much , this is one GREAT BEARD TRIMMER!  </li>
            <li> No frills; trims beard nicely with 1 adjustable head.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, and multifaceted, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t come with its own travel bag.te, hair clippings, deodorant, etc.  </li>
            <li> 2) it doesn&#x27;t come with its own travel bag.</li>
            <li> I believe that the Trimmer will work great in the future based on the performance thus far.&lt;br /&gt;A happy customer!</li>
            <li> so having the head rotate into position smoothly and securely, without having to CHANGE heads is great!  </li>
            <li> because of the design it doesn&#x27;t poke, and separates the hairs nicely.  </li>
            <li> no my name is not Jeff Bezos, and I own no stock.  </li>
            <li> I suppose a nose hair trimmer would be nice, but I don&#x27;t need one.  </li>
            <li> Everything feels nice and sturdy with no wobbly pieces or chintzy feeling plastics.</li>
            <li> The fully washable feature is nice</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a nice trimmer after always buying the cheapest ones.</li>
            <li> Nice battery life.</li>
            <li> Nicely made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also nice to have a rechargable</li>
            <li> couple of nice features include:&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really nice</li>
            <li> I decided i liked the stubble</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it as a clipper to clean up and shape my son&#x27;s neckline when giving him hair cuts and it works just great for that.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard a perfect &#x27;stubble&#x27; length and cuts smoothly and quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have the full trimmer and the detail trimmer all in one.</li>
            <li> The new one works awesome.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the most perfect beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> beard crumbs dusted over the nice shiny wood and the nice stuff the she has on the dresser top.</li>
            <li> all in all, a great find, worthy of your dollars.</li>
            <li> The adjustable trimming comb installs easily and adjusts perfectly to cut the exact length you want.</li>
            <li> So far best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> By far the best trimmer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> By far the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used thus far on beard.</li>
            <li> Just a nice unit, better than the Wahl</li>
            <li> The 17 Built-in length settings are great bc you don&#x27;t have to fumble around looking for the right guard.</li>
            <li> You can sculpt very fine lines, manage sideburns and all that jazz.</li>
            <li> Great device, easy to clean, recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with the product and best of all its clean!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price and being able to rinse it off is very nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of &amp;#34;get acquainted&amp;#34; issues, I am pretty happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of &amp;#34;get acquainted&amp;#34; issues, I am pretty happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very accurate.</li>
            <li> It doesnt pull and it seems to not leave razor burn which is very important..</li>
            <li> Very precise.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, powerful trimmer that looks elegant, trims nicely, and has a nice charge capacity.</li>
            <li> This has nice power and is easy to control.</li>
            <li> The unit is a nice shape and is easy to handle and control.</li>
            <li> The shave is extremely comfortable and it does a great, quick job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is very comfortable to adjust very much enjoying the cut styles.</li>
            <li> So far this one seems to be great, good strong battery,charges in 1.5 hours and lasts me over a month of trims.</li>
            <li> This model also has a very comfortable design, is easy to hold, is lightweight, and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power to trim the most stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> I had the Conair istubble for two years and it is much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m well pleased.</li>
            <li> I love that the blade just clicks around for the detail trimmer instead of having to switch out heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, especially compared to the $20-25 &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Perfect for touching up ears and nose (let&#x27;s hear it for middle age!).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to break when I pull it off, but I do find myself cradling it a bit during removal just to be safe.  </li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product by Philips.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> Well made but the most challenging to use beard trimmer that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I reviewed many trimmers before I settled on this one.</li>
            <li> no pinch for sure.  </li>
            <li> so check that review out if you want to read about the top of the line beard trimmer and then compare the two.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  </li>
            <li> I also have the $20 Conair iStubble which works better</li>
            <li> so its a lot better value than this one.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve owned about 6 different beard trimmers in my lifetime and -- not even exaggerating -- this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> OK, as this is a Vine product, there will end up being plenty of reviews.</li>
            <li> They all seem to be junk these days, mostly battery probes.</li>
            <li> Overall a very great trimmer.</li>
            <li> But when I went to order it, I noticed that the price more than tripled.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> read so many reviews when looking around that</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> The obvious..a great one pass (maybe two in a couple places),  very even, non pulling shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion---are there better trimmers out there?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok trimmer, but it could could better than it does.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this trimmer for the last month on his goatee, and we&#x27;re very happy with its performance.  </li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer after reading many reviews of many trimmers.</li>
            <li> This Philips really does a great job for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, not the best trimmer out there, but for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> and glad I was able to grab this from the Vine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become pretty interested in finding the perfect beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> It means that I don&#x27;t have to keep track of my favorite clip on guards- just the one guard.</li>
            <li> : it has as much or more power than the Whal</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer with decent battery life and quick recharge.</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to have a much better battery management circuit as the unit will stop charging once the battery is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to have a much better battery management circuit as the unit will stop charging once the battery is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> Being able to adjust the length from 1/64&amp;#34; (0.4 mm) to 13/32&amp;#34; (10mm), with 17 settings in between, speaks well to the level of precision on the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The fact that you do not need to oil it and can just wash it off makes it even more user friendly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m quite happy with this trimmer, and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustment dial and the fact that it stays where you set it.</li>
            <li> Even though the BT is more refined, it doesn&#x27;t always translate to better performance.  </li>
            <li> The Remington has a wider blade, and is more &#x27;multi-purpose&#x27;, but this is better as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect razor for shaping and trimming up beards and facial hair.</li>
            <li> It mostly damages skin.</li>
            <li> Battery hold excellent but had to pass over a few times for a good cut.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> this is much better.</li>
            <li> if/when the battery dies permanently, i assume i&#x27;ll be able to continue using it while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> so i shopped out the best trimmer at short beard lengths and arrived at this.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my Philips Norelco T980 (the vacuum one), and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Plus it has a vacuum to catch all the trimmings which is awesome.</li>
            <li> So, I might spend 3 minutes going different directions to get a very nice, even look, instead of 1 minute….darn!  </li>
            <li> I original owned a conair istubble shaver that I really liked.  </li>
            <li> a plus if you&#x27;re on the go), no holder or case to protect it (at its cost, might be nice to have something to keep it stored upright or a case to cover it), max length is 10mm (OK for me, but something to consider if you&#x27;re going for the full beard</li>
            <li> Good quality, long battery life and great features.  </li>
            <li> I also used it to trim some neck and sideburn hair, and again it does a nice job, makes a clean cut, and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it&#x27;s a truly high quality product, but out of the box and about 2 weeks in, I&#x27;m still as happy as ever.</li>
            <li> Cuts very cleanly.  </li>
            <li> Bought my son one first and after he used it with good results I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Seems to do its job pretty good</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> At the risk of not being the most popular (aka “useful”), I get the freedom to provide a niche review.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust &amp; many settings.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good facility to be able to plug this in and operate it straight</li>
            <li> -Clean with running water (this is why I bought it)&lt;br /&gt;-No attachments!</li>
            <li> Works perfect and is much better that other beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li> far I am very pleased this with beard trimmer !</li>
            <li> One end is full width, but rotating the head gives you a half-width blade suitable for precision trimming.  </li>
            <li> It was the fastest and most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> Trims smoothly even the thickest beard in the world (mine is top 10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the motor speed is faster, so it cuts faster and it cuts closer to the skin if you so desire.  </li>
            <li> It seems very well made, and it feels good and fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge forever, trims very accurately, requires almost no maintenance, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> There are so many reviews where people say they would never own a Norelco, Panasonic, Wahl etc again, and many more who said it was the best trimmer they ever owned.  </li>
            <li> very precise and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easily cleaned</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does job as advertised.</li>
            <li> The cutter head easily pops off and can be rotated 180d.  </li>
            <li> (so you can use one blade on wider areas and one as a detail trimmer), and this also can be rinsed under the faucet for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> Easy and accurate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However the wheel does turn easily and indeed makes depth adjustment easy.</li>
            <li> Each of those accessories easily come off and on.</li>
            <li> r easy to view and change the selector</li>
            <li> Simply great as it is very efficient and powerful tool.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with a lot of adjsutments</li>
            <li> Just one sliding guide&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomic, easy to use design&lt;br /&gt;-Relatively sturdy and robust</li>
            <li> Guide adjustment easily set and stays put.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and charge.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend this product to any man with a beard.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to maintain a decent beard then this a good one.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this kind of beard trimmer on my scraggly, not-thick beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> While both do the job pretty effectively, I’ve decided to stay with the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use: the angle of the cutter head is just right for my face and it has plenty of power to go through my wiry beard.</li>
            <li> As so many other reviews have indicated, it really is an  excellent product and worth investing in.</li>
            <li> No pulls, no issues cleaning, holds a charge, light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> 10mm sounds fine, but I like my goatee just a bit longer during colder seasons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guard is secure and easily adjustable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rather than go into a full fledged list of pros and cons, I will just say that the conair was slightly more comfortable on my face and faster at trimming to .4mm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 series beard trimmer for exactly 3 trimmings over as many weeks and am quite pleased with the results and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once it is on the trimmer functions fine.</li>
            <li> Previous models were excellent.  </li>
            <li> This device also holds a strong charge for a while making it very useful.</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets clogged very easily if you don&#x27;t use the comb attachment, and I for one like to keep my scruff pretty short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you pull from the top, it seems like it would either not come off, or it might be too much force, but popping it loose on the side works great!  </li>
            <li> Does not pull hair and its so comfortable to hold it.</li>
            <li> It was great at trimming stubble and really short settings.  </li>
            <li> and where does Philips Norelco fit in?</li>
            <li> Works great and the battery last over a week in my case.</li>
            <li> precise length adjustment...</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, it feels good in the hand, it&#x27;s fairly quiet and it&#x27;s by far the sharpest trimmer I&#x27;ve used to date.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and maneuver around the face to get what you need done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rotating dial is smooth to operate, with detentes that let you know that you are &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; the setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s washable--not important for me, but might be for some.&lt;br /&gt;8.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t imagine a simpler one that does such a great job</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is of course an included charger but no base.</li>
            <li> but this trimmer has become and indispensable part of my grooming routine.</li>
            <li> but this trimmer has become and indispensable part of my grooming routine.</li>
            <li> The comb seems cheaply constructed.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s been comfortable to use</li>
            <li> I received the product and did not work ; do not turn on the light of battery charge and</li>
            <li> However it does provide a nice trim for my beard, and it does seem reasonably well built.</li>
            <li> However it does provide a nice trim for my beard, and it does seem reasonably well built.</li>
            <li> Precise length control.  </li>
            <li> In terms of power, it&#x27;s one of the more powerful than most, but probably not as powerful than the Li Ion Wahl.</li>
            <li> So where does this fit in?</li>
            <li> Even with the guide removed it smooth across skin and never pulls.  </li>
            <li> The colors are nice, and it has a really sleek, high-tech look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer has rounded blade edges, so it glides smoothly across the skin.</li>
            <li> It snaps into place securely... too securely.</li>
            <li> I owned a couple of the Norelco G370 kits, when they were available.  </li>
            <li> so far so good, hopefully battery will stay charged</li>
            <li> Several months ago, I noticed this beard trimmer was coming out and thought it might make a good replacement and provide even better results.</li>
            <li> First one used replaceable batteries and had great power, but needed new batteries too often.  </li>
            <li> it is agile, follows contours around the mouth well, and trims right up to the edges, reaching everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a use for the mini-trimmer, but I can see that some people may find it very useful depending on the style of beard they have.  </li>
            <li> Amazing how fast a guy can move to do a clean up when his life is passing before his eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it to clean up hubby&#x27;s hairline on the back of his neck and his sideburns and it works great for that too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy, accurate, and no nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives you the perfect messy clean look.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, powerful, easy to clean,</li>
            <li> Change of length is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> This guide allows you to trim your beard or sideburns to any length you desire, quickly and easily without having to worry about making mistakes.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is a lot cheaper than the high end ones, yet it still does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> This thing works great and stays charged a really long time.  </li>
            <li> Original Review:   </li>
            <li> Works great, keeps a charge for a long time</li>
            <li> This one was OK, but I liked the other one better.</li>
            <li> Quiet, effective, love the head flexibility and length options.  </li>
            <li> Dual trimmers allow for more options in grooming and far more precision.</li>
            <li> I can think of a few things I&#x27;d change for me, but I think this design will make the most people happy.  </li>
            <li> Does not, though, give as clean shave as had hoped it is as described.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to fool around with a brush to clean the blades on this trimmer</li>
            <li> For trimming using the attachment, both work great, but I actually find that the curved QT model to be more comfortable and slightly more uniform using the same numerical setting as the BT; the loudness and crudeness of the QT is not a bother.</li>
            <li> not as close as could be (pretty damn good, but my old one feels like a fraction of a mm closer)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish the attachment had a full guard.</li>
            <li> I used this to shave--while I was standing at my wife&#x27;s dresser drawer mirror, which was almost my last act on this good earth.</li>
            <li> It just feels good, durable, time will of course be the ultimate test</li>
            <li> I figured it would only be fair to contribute one myself.  </li>
            <li> battery life is good razor is quiet, but does miss hairs...</li>
            <li> He is starting  on his business career and needs the beard trimmer to make a good impression , by keeping his beard neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> The true test is when I shave around the ear area.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve liked this trimmer a lot.</li>
            <li> so if the battery runs out, plug it in and use it immediately at full power.</li>
            <li> Unless you are a male model with the perfect beard that grows entirely in one direction neatly, I would say MOST trimmers on MOST beards will take a few passes to get a nice even look.  </li>
            <li> From 0.4mm (good for a very short stubble) up to 10mm (good for a fairly &#x27;longish&#x27; beard, but not quite long enough to trim the hair on your head, unless you like it</li>
            <li> It takes many more passes to get a consistent trim with this than the old groomsman that I had for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the unit for several months now, and found that the battery lasts for many, many trims.  </li>
            <li> A quick turn</li>
            <li> Cleaning is also quick andeasy.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll chew up your beard quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite thing about this style of trimmer, just being able to rinse it instead of using a tiny brush to get hair out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have the wide trimmer on top that gives a really nice performance and the detail trimmer on the bottom.</li>
            <li> plastic comb attachment is the only part that snaps on/off and is very easy to get on/off thanks to two included plastic guide legs that fit into the top portion of the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This unit fits nicely in your hand, and holds a charge like no other.  </li>
            <li> We are a Philips Norelco family at this point and love the high quality of their products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first beard and first trimmer and so far so good.</li>
            <li> The small detailing side is perfect for close spots around your mouth and sideburns, while the large trimming side gets the rest.</li>
            <li> The laser guide allows for more precision and the digital display makes viewing the comb length setting quick and easy.</li>
            <li> However, if you want something with the following that will do the job, this is a pretty good bet;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 Beard Trimmer works really well, is easy to operate and cleaning</li>
            <li> Being that the trimmer is fast, you better not make a mistake or there goes the whole look!</li>
            <li> The top of this unit actually rotates between the main trimmer and an even more precise mini-trimmer.  </li>
            <li> it would be a better overall option, but as-is I can&#x27;t say I strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Great for any stubborn hairs when trimming to a tight stubble.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to spend some more you might get some bonus attachments and maybe a vacuum feature, but otherwise I couldn&#x27;t imagine a blade any better than this one.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, but not as easy as my last Norelco with the titanium blades.  </li>
            <li> A great little shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great little machine.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer has an amazing battery, and it trims longer facial hair to perfection.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this trimmer, it&#x27;s far better than my old Philips flip out trimmer.</li>
            <li> Amazon has them for as low as $7.75 (Wahl) and Hammacher Schlemmer has what looks like an amazing one for $20 if you have barbed wire growing out of your nose.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is very lightweight and it&#x27;s cordless which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Beard and sideburn trimming are fast and precise.  </li>
            <li> MUCH better than the trimmer I was using - the comb is much more forgiving and adjusts for a wide range.</li>
            <li> He has a small muzzle and the small side works just perfect for that.. and the larger is perfect size for his body.  </li>
            <li> the smaller cutter does a nice job of trimming the hair in my ears.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;So far its more that what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I liked what they had to say and found the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 as the same trimmer without the laser guide.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I miss about the Norelco G370 is the nice charging dock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far I&#x27;m a happy customer, and I hope it&#x27;ll hold up over time.  </li>
            <li> Overall a really nice trimmer though.</li>
            <li> oh did I say it was powerful too?  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth  </li>
            <li> The Trimmer itself is great and works as expected but for the price i&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t come with many attachments like the earlier philips top trimmer that i bought.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but the motor seems to struggle frequently.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff so far &amp; soft on the skin</li>
            <li> My old trimmer died, so I was glad for the opportunity to try this model out.</li>
            <li> The Lithium ion batteries are worth the hype in this device.  </li>
            <li> My main problem is that my hair build up in the spacer very quickly, so I basically have to take it off and shake it out after every pass</li>
            <li> All in One, which is by far more than you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about 5 over the years, with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> Adjustable trimmer comb is a really nice feature, but it doesn&#x27;t cut very short without the comb</li>
            <li> This by far is one of the better beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> An amazing all-in-one beard trimmer with no oils needed to keep the blade sharp and rust free.</li>
            <li> The number setting are not digital, but are easy to see, and easy to adjust by just dialing where you want the length of cut.  </li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with trimming the entire beard to a certain length as well as the close trim to shape my beard.  </li>
            <li> , they never do a good job of trimming right around the nose area due to the shape and configuration of the attachment.</li>
            <li> just the right weight in the hand---</li>
            <li> This one seems to be right on the mark.</li>
            <li> the box was opened right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for a year now and its still going as strong as new.  </li>
            <li> Perfect graduation gift for young man with small beard.  </li>
            <li> And, unlike my last trimmer, this trimmer&#x27;s settings are very easy to read.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and precise, and are easy to clean with a quick stroke or two of the brush provided.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and provide a nice, clean cut.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as great, if not better.</li>
            <li> I bought the same / similar model twice because I was comfortable with the design, the way they worked, and I thought they did a good job at keeping my beard trimmed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for catching the trimmings, but never was that great for precise trimming, irritates and snags against the skin if you use the bare blade and horrible for getting the area between the nose and upper-lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for catching the trimmings, but never was that great for precise trimming, irritates and snags against the skin if you use the bare blade and horrible for getting the area between the nose and upper-lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my Chinese Crested which has very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Best of all no fussing around with clip-on length attachments that you will obviously lose yourself, or have someone near and dear to you throw away for no apparent reason.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me about 10 seconds first time using this trimmer to get the right adjustment for trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean by simply running the faucet over the tip, but not meant to be fully submerged.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s because this unit has a superior lithium-ion battery and my previous unit</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s because this unit has a superior lithium-ion battery and my previous unit</li>
            <li> Comparing the QT with this model in terms of mechanics, this BT model is much quieter, smoother to turn the dial, has a push button on/off as opposed to a sliding on/off, better charging feedback in terms of changing colors to give proper status, and, of course, this model is washable to clean under water as the QT is not.</li>
            <li> I think if it was either A) more powerful, or B) smaller</li>
            <li> I keep a full beard, so I need a trimmer mainly to shorten the length.</li>
            <li> After years of using Norelco lines for trimming I was excited to get a new Norelco trimmer</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I took away a star is that I saw today that the released a new unit for whole-head grooming that I might like better!</li>
            <li> a huge plus when you&#x27;re shaving in the early morning).</li>
            <li> So far, that seems accurate.  </li>
            <li> So far, that seems accurate.  </li>
            <li> However, it is much harder to get a really nice and even trim all around for this type of trimming.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> A wonderful trimmer has been rendered useless by an inoperative switch.</li>
            <li> Philips is a big company and they should be doing a much better job with the quality control of their products.  </li>
            <li> More packaging here than necessary for this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doesn’t seem to require as many passes over the same area to produce uniform length.</li>
            <li> the first go around anyway.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a goatee for over 20 years now and have gone through many different beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> If your trimmer requirements are similar to mine, then I think you&#x27;ll be quite satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> There are 17 selections, with many short selections.</li>
            <li> The bonus of course is that you&#x27;re not wasting precious battery life powering a digital display.</li>
            <li> The adjuster takes all the guesswork out of exactly what length you&#x27;re trimming at.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t even try using this for more &#x27;personal&#x27; areas.</li>
            <li> First trimmer I have used (over 20 or so years)</li>
            <li> When I first opened it I thought, &#x27;yikes:</li>
            <li> Love the dial for creating different length settings.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my fiance and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> so you always get the exact length you want.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I run it over the same area, I always end up using scissors to finish my trim</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> Those things aside, I really like this trimmer!</li>
            <li> You have to make an effort to turn it on and off, instead of the switch being located where your fingers fall naturally higher on the handle.  </li>
            <li> A slide type switch, located higher on the unit would have been ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> His first impressions of the Norelco 5100 trimmer</li>
            <li> However, if you do happen to decide to purchase this beard trimmer, I am pretty confident that you won&#x27;t be sending it back.</li>
            <li> oh, really?!?  </li>
            <li> the price from Amazon was very competitive thank you!</li>
            <li> It seems to vibrate less and it feels more precise than the [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y QT4022]].  </li>
            <li> Be sure to charge it fully the very first time, and it really doesn&#x27;t take that long to charge when it does need it.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle to skin  and the quiet allows for a more peaceful shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted: A good trimmer with low maintenance that would last awhile, justifying the higher price.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, the cutters are nice and sharp and don&#x27;t inadvertently grab any skin.</li>
            <li> Looks large at first.  </li>
            <li> Feels large at first.  </li>
            <li> With a little practice, i was able to get a nice short cut (I keep my beard about 1/4&amp;#34; long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These slight drawbacks aside, it is still a pretty nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> I wish the guard had one or two more long settings...</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I ever had that was capable of being rinsed off, and I like the</li>
            <li> You can use either trimmer directly on your skin, and the tiny side gets really close, which is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It trims very well and consistently.</li>
            <li> I am a simple guy with minimal needs, this is more than I could have asked for, I think I will have this beard trimmer for many years to come.  </li>
            <li> Phillips Norelco Beard Trimmer works good so far (used only for 2 weeks thus far).  </li>
            <li> Take the length guide off the unit and you can make precise edges on your beard or sideburns - or you can trim your beard down to fine stubble to make it easier to shave.  </li>
            <li> The features are pretty standard for a trimmer this size and weight, which is quite light.</li>
            <li> The length is easily changed through the turning point in the middle of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery life seems fine-I typically only use it for a minute or two, and it easily handled 30 trims before it needed a recharge.</li>
            <li> Easy to to just revolve blade from regular use to trim use.</li>
            <li> The narrow blade is actually pretty nice for getting at tighter areas, like around the ears.</li>
            <li> Set to 0.4 it certainly isn&#x27;t 0.4mm nor is it 0.4 inches.</li>
            <li> This allows you to hold it firmly and make your trimming accurate and easy.</li>
            <li> The guard is much stronger than regular guards and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Although it does run and trim while plugged in, it will not charge while in use at the same time, which is fine.</li>
            <li> as the marketers would have you believe, but pretty decent nevertheless.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer is  very high class settings</li>
            <li> There is a very large adjustment range-probably an inch or better to down around 1/8 of an inch.</li>
            <li> Nice little dial to adjust length of beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times on a single charge!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it many times on a single charge!  </li>
            <li> Gets pretty much a clean shave and saves so much time compared to using a regular razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The Norelco trimmer is so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> Works very well-</li>
            <li> almost like it wants you to charge it, even after it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> really like the rotating trimmer head.  </li>
            <li> I have a very course beard and it trims and shapes it very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this to do detail trimming, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> So there isn&#x27;t much difference except the exacting laser setting.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t want lots of extra attachments , nor cheap plasticky stuff.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li> The dual head is very convenient for shaping.</li>
            <li> My cheaper Phillips is much lower quality, but I miss the mini razor on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trims very close (if I wish).  </li>
            <li> Basically, it seems the bottom line in the world of trimmers is that there are a number of different ones available with various features and you (as the person using it) need to determine what&#x27;s important in terms of what you want it to do.  </li>
            <li> just makes things simpler), smooth and even trim in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care much about that, but</li>
            <li> The blades either don&#x27;t cut the hairs or the hairs get stuck and pulled, which is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> look depending on how fast your beard grows.  </li>
            <li> There is a charge indicator, and the charger charges fast.  </li>
            <li> really well made.&lt;br</li>
            <li> on my doorstep at 10AM the next morning with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;CONS</li>
            <li> Really guys, a laser!I&#x27;m a gadget guy, but</li>
            <li> But then I&#x27;d feel like keeping it in my tool box, and who wants to run to the garage every time you need a shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The ability to swivel the cutting head to trim your mustache is excellent.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month, and am reasonably satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re using a much lower profile blade.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s all that really matters.  </li>
            <li> It clips very close where it needs to, and it doesn&#x27;t tug on the hair-</li>
            <li> I really like the attachment comb and dial up option for the blades.</li>
            <li> /narrow end much, but they are nifty to have</li>
            <li> Very well built.  </li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li> I had a much cheaper, battery operated trimmer which was adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars because it is very well built and very refined.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t find much to not like about this trimmer, and if it doesn&#x27;t fit your needs, for some reason, they offer a 45 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I expected better when it came to the size setting.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any negatives with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Well made product and the dual trimming feature is a real plus.</li>
            <li> very comfy on the face.</li>
            <li> Son really loves this.</li>
            <li> I was very displeased with it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> The body of the trimmer is sleek enough to hold completely in one hand, allowing for greater control while shaving.</li>
            <li> By the third trim, I could get a nice even and short</li>
            <li> Buy this one for neat grooming instead of either of the following in the range:&lt;br /&gt;- Norelco 7300, unless you&#x27;re tending a nice big fuzzy hipster-mane.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Although you have to really practice using this to get it right, it does a basic job, if that&#x27;s all you want, and has enough length settings to satisfy most needs.</li>
            <li> Sounds like an odd one, but if you travel a lot having this be suitable for either 110/240V is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were small and loud, but did the job and had several nice attachments, but I didn&#x27;t use most of them.</li>
            <li> However, a team of physicists have been working two weeks to figure out how to refold it so that it fits back in it&#x27;s original space.</li>
            <li> I followed the product and was excited when they finally released it for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had that instant feeling of being significantly upgraded.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the motors run more smoothly, providing less shake and vibration in my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who hates to shave, in fact my skin just can&#x27;t take the daily grind of shaving clean with a razor every day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high quality and suited for very close shave detailing.  </li>
            <li> I loved this set of clippers, only one guard, but the guard is adjustable up to just over a half inch</li>
            <li> light, battery lasts a long time, and I can use it while plugged in.</li>
            <li> So I usually keep a nicely trimmed scruff going on all the time.</li>
            <li> Now I have to make sure I&#x27;m 100% down with the comb before taking it out because it&#x27;s a PITA to put it on and take it off again.</li>
            <li> More length settings than my previous shaver, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> The motor is quieter than my previous trimmers and the bttery fife is much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The larger side to the trimmer blade cuts aggresively and quickly.  </li>
            <li> finally decided on this trimmer based on moderate price, well over 55% 5 star reviews and not too many 1 star</li>
            <li> My older cordless Remington does a better job in much less time.</li>
            <li> Only part I don&#x27;t like is that a different (but not as flexible) version has the built in suction to keep most of the remnants in.</li>
            <li> Decent deal.  </li>
            <li> And, if for some reason you don&#x27;t like it, or you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your particular needs</li>
            <li> trimmer does a better job than the larger Remington in the same price range.</li>
            <li> I never had a decent one before</li>
            <li> The large edge is perfect to do your sideburns, and the small one, when used slowly and carefully will easily trim around your mouth and under your nose.  </li>
            <li> Battery life has been stellar so far, much better than I remember it was on my previous [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] even when it was new.  </li>
            <li> Battery life has been stellar so far, much better than I remember it was on my previous [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] even when it was new.  </li>
            <li> No need for a useless vacuum or a laser guide, this trimmer just trims your beard perfect!</li>
            <li> [QUICK CHARGE]&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges from dead to full in just an</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Extremely high quality, doesn&#x27;t feel toy like at all</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Consequently, I highly recommend giving this trimmer a try.</li>
            <li> I also lose my setting because I have to raise it so high to take it</li>
            <li> The outside wipes clean with a quick stroke of a towel, and it takes up very little room on my counter, especially to the G370 whose many parts were always spilling around the sink.</li>
            <li> new Norelco BT5275 is improved over that previous model in many ways.  </li>
            <li> Bit by paying a little, more on this we are satisfieds.</li>
            <li> I still keep the vacuum trimmer for when I go days without trimming and need the vacuum to keep from shards going everywhere, otherwise this trimmer is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I still keep the vacuum trimmer for when I go days without trimming and need the vacuum to keep from shards going everywhere, otherwise this trimmer is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> As compact as any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used &amp; easy to hold in hand.  </li>
            <li> It has a hard time catching all the hairs on my beard when i trim it.</li>
            <li> My first indication was it comes packaged in what at first sight appears to be the typical bank vault like plastic clam shell that human engineers have devised with the primary goal of extracting as much blood from you as possible while forcing you to use every tool you own to gain entry down to a pair of garden shears.</li>
            <li> This is a really fancy trimmer compared to my old Braun.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it developed this extremely unusual problem where it would not work corded in my bathroom, but would work corded everywhere else</li>
            <li> Quiet and powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> , and they were pretty much identical, even though they were purchased years apart, they were just different colors.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with this trimmer is it didn&#x27;t come with any kind of case, but not to worry I found one on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to comment on the &amp;#34;self sharpener&amp;#34;, but time will tell.</li>
            <li> You snap that guide in, and then you turn the nicely rubberized grey wheel in the center of the unit to select a length.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of power and many times takes a few strokes to cut everything evenly.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many trimmers, if you do run it dead, you can plug this one in and finish the job.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my previous Norelco, this one has an indicator light to indicate full charge and low charge.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my previous Norelco, this one has an indicator light to indicate full charge and low charge.  </li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise when I could easily open the clamshell packaging simply and easily without tools and blood</li>
            <li> second indicator was the folded instruction sheet sitting neatly in it&#x27;s provided area, folded out it easily holds basic instructions in two languages.</li>
            <li> used the 9100 five times on a single charge, and it seems to have more uses left.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and will cut for quite a long time without recharging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it came with a little carrying case for travel (and to hold the cleaning brush), and I would prefer that it used a USB plug so that I do not have to tote an extra transformer.</li>

            <li> I bought a shaver, a wounded body and is supposed to be a new</li>
            <li> and I like the new display.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Along comes this new trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Along comes this new trimmer.</li>
            <li> I knew it was time for a new one</li>
            <li> Would suggest to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying a new beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it trims quickly and seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li> The motor is extremely powerful, but does not leave my sensitive skin blotchy and red.</li>
            <li> Clearly I underestimated this particular challenge.  </li>
            <li> When I had to replace a beard trimmer three years ago, I have had trouble finding one that did the same kind of quality trim.  </li>
            <li> Weak and cheap, feels like it won&#x27;t last more than a month.</li>
            <li> When I finished I looked down to see lots of my fine</li>
            <li> It does exactly what he wants it to, loves that he doesn&#x27;t need 10 attachments and that it stays charged for a long time, gets the job done is seconds, literally!</li>
            <li> trimmer is also comparatively quiet, and is powerful and sharp, and makes quick work of trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> Used it for once or twice a week for several weeks (7-8 minutes each), and it&#x27;s still on its first charge.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare the 5100 to anything other than my old clipper, which was a cheap plasticy junker purchased by an ex girlfriend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lazy and being able to multitask and maximize shower time is a plus.  </li>
            <li> It has a swiveling head and on the other end is even a more tiny precision trimmer.</li>
            <li> no problems so far!</li>
            <li> It has 17 length settings, which are in very small increments, so I can easily set it to cut my beard to the exact length I like.</li>
            <li> I have only used one other portable trimmer and this one is far better.  </li>
            <li> Bought this unit new from Amazon and received a used trimmer complete with someone else&#x27;s hair on the head.  </li>
            <li> Like the ease of changing the trim length and battery has held a charge so far, but still very early.</li>
            <li> I finally got my money back, but it a LONG drawn out processed with many steps.  </li>
            <li> Many different settings and long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how long I keep my beard since my last trimmer didn&#x27;t have different settings.  </li>
            <li> That said, it is slightly less bulky than the 9100 and has better grips on the back side.</li>
            <li> Granted, this is more expensive, but the extra cost brings better performance and overall value, particularly in motor power and battery</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first thing I noticed when looking at both pictures and the actual trimmer (still in the box) is the digital readout.</li>
            <li> a well constructed trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Several features which are very impressive are the multiple beard length adjustments, next the double sided stainless steel edging blades work extremely well but be careful how you angle the edging blades as they are also extremely sharp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t show it in any of the photos here, but there is a hard plastic length guide that snaps into the top of the unit.  </li>
            <li> My husband prides himself on keeping his beard and facial hair trimmed professionally, this trimmer does the job very well</li>
            <li> Replaced my 3 year old Wahl Lithium Ion with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The old one was used weekly and after 5 years it never stopped working.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to think how much battery I have left before I am done trimming.</li>
            <li> Extending the guard fully before removal eases the process considerably.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> For a cordless on my short beard this suits me very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even went so far as to replace it with another when it wore out.</li>
            <li> far these have met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Ah, the old Costco curse--buy it when you see it</li>
            <li> power button is located directly beneath the rotating bit and is a matte-blue plastic button.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my old beard trimmer for probably 2 years and was immediately wowed after switching to this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maintenance and cleaning is a breeze, charging is lightning fast, the motor is quiet (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of trimmers, and this was was sent straight back for a refund.</li>
            <li> When the battery finally does go, it does really whimper out - it just dies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple that didn&#x27;t wow me, and I still have my resident go-to trimmer the Philips Norelco QT4070.</li>
            <li> This by far the nicest beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> #34;close enough.&amp;#34; I feel like this is just a fraction longer than my old remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old one was no longer in production.  </li>
            <li> Someone with a full thick beard or a person wanting a super close trim may have  different  opinions, but for me this trimmer is definately a 5 star.</li>
            <li> The way it attaches and detaches combined with the cheap feeling plastic retaining clips doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in how long it&#x27;ll last with the frequent detaching and reattaching needed for someone who trims both beard and mustache regularly.  </li>
            <li> Their batteries died quickly, and they didn&#x27;t hold charges for very long, despite following the directions included for optimizing battery life.</li>
            <li> Easy to find your setting by starting out high and working down to where you want, for your personal cut.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this one, but its not up to the task of cutting a consistent length beard.  </li>
            <li> An affordable cordless trimmer that does an excellent and consistent job cutting even thick beards; no hair</li>
            <li> The lowest trim setting of .4mm is, for me, a huge benefit, though only a slight upgrade over my old PN&#x27;s .5mm.</li>
            <li> This razor can be used dry or wet, allowing for greater ease during my daily routine (Shave before or during shower).</li>
            <li> The dial-a-depth trimmer is great in concept but the blades don&#x27;t cut as well as I expected for the brand name and on the lowest setting, I&#x27;ve nicked skin a few times which never happened with previous beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t usually keep your beard too close it&#x27;ll work fine for you.</li>
            <li> , I can just run it under the faucet, and in a few seconds it&#x27;s perfectly clean.</li>
            <li> works ok, not sure if it cuts as close as my last norelco trimmer</li>
            <li> ; trimmer head can be rinsed under sink), decent adjustable range (up to 10mm), no attachments (this may turn out to be a con in time if it breaks, but my last Wahl had attachments</li>
            <li> no less start</li>
            <li> Usage time is about 45 mins which is decent enough.</li>
            <li> The head has two sides - one for the regular beard trimmer, and the other side is super small for more detailed, hard to reach areas (e.g. under nose, ears, etc.).</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s sharp angles/straight lines you&#x27;re looking for consider a decent straight blade razor instead of a laser, or a five blade Gillettemonster.  </li>
            <li> My family lineage traces back to Spanish and German roots and as a result I can grow a thick fuzzy beard in about the time it takes to brew a good cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> To remove the comb, I usually pull upward gently on the bottom part where it fits on the side of the trimmer, and it comes right off.</li>
            <li> Probably also important to mention that my beard is about &#x27;average&#x27; thickness, and by no means a dense, thick type (think a solid, Viking bead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Established brand, easy maintenance (self sharpening blades</li>
            <li> The normal side is the same closeness as your barber gets when he/</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure many would find the adjustable length and thick vs thin heads to their liking.</li>
            <li> I do have to say I was a little curious to see what Norelco&#x27;s $200 beard trimmer must be like, but not curious enough to lay out that kind of money.  </li>
            <li> Once going the trimmer made short work of my very full beard and had me back to presentable in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was forever trying to read the small length markings on the TWO  double sided combs on the old one, and they didn&#x27;t snap on and off easily.  </li>
            <li> and I had a new trimmer the next day.</li>
            <li> This is the third Philips beard trimmer I’ve owned and my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> The dial is manual and starts very short and goes pretty long.</li>
            <li> , it has plenty of power to get through at least one trim, I haven&#x27;t tried multiple to see how many it can go.  </li>
            <li> so I can access a narrow blade that gets into harder to reach places (or more stubborn hairs</li>
            <li> I mean like way too thick, lol.</li>
            <li> major annoyance is removing the beard comb.</li>
            <li> Charger is small and travel friendly.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a month or so and for the past 6 years have been clean shaven.</li>
            <li> know some people want a travel bag, but as someone who only occasionally travels and tends to just throw all my toiletries into a single larger bag, I consider it a plus that the box wasn&#x27;t full of a bunch of accessories for a landfill.  </li>
            <li> So, I decided to look outside of American manufacturing (the main reason for the Wahl purchase) and came upon the review for an upgraded version of this gem on [...].  </li>
            <li> My latest one has a built in vacuum, which actually doesn&#x27;t vacuum anything and just makes a big mess.</li>
            <li> Generally with something utilitarian in nature like this</li>
            <li> I am still using the clippers on the initial charge-seems to hold charge very well and long runtime</li>
            <li> Thanks to that perky motor, shaving is also much faster than usual.</li>
            <li> After attempting to trim with the norelco this morning was hopeless, I just went back to my old trimmer</li>
            <li> Philips offers a 45 day money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> My old one HAD to charge in the stand, so I left it out sitting.  </li>
            <li> It WILL cut you, though, if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Then again, a bit of brushed metal on the front panel (instead of the cheapo-feeling plastic) would have made a marked difference on the appearance.  </li>
            <li> It barely cuts hair.</li>
            <li> in all, I believe it to be a nice trimmer, but don&#x27;t think I can recommend it with the rounded attachment making it difficult to cut hair or beard in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Definitely not what you might classify as a premium blade, but trims quickly with little fuss.  </li>
            <li> The base of the trimmer head is also nice and smooth, allowing you to lay it flat against your skin rather than raking blade teeth across your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was accustomed to just not being able to trim my entire beard and have to go back with scissors to get hard to reach areas like my upper lip.</li>
            <li> other features don&#x27;t matter as much to me.</li>
            <li> Sharp out of the box and a very well designed product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little big to travel with, which makes the Li-Ion battery not all that useful...</li>
            <li> The problem EVERYONE had with the G370 is the beard trimmer comb was very weak and broke easily, which pretty much made the whole unit useless for it&#x27;s main purpose.  </li>
            <li> While I like the two head (one wide, one narrow for detailed trimming) option, and</li>
            <li> 2 blades, wide and narrow for detailed trimming.</li>
            <li> I had nothing to compare to, and thought that making multiple passes through my moderately thick beard and mustache were normal, and that pulling hair, particularly on the mustache was normal.  </li>
            <li> A bit tricky to learn how to set the depth gauge at first, but with a little practice, it is no problem.  </li>
            <li> If you go commando and want to do a close trim though with the bare trimmer then that is where it falls short.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it doesnt get hot when used for a few minutes..</li>
            <li> Instead of a bunch of different size combs scattered all over like other trimmers, you just dial up the length of cut you want and the single comb rises or lowers to exactly the length you want.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I dry trim this trimmer is also fully capable of trimming a damp to wet beard.</li>
            <li> The large blade is still too narrow, making the entire shaving and trimming process take longer.</li>
            <li> Second one was a &amp;#34;first generation&amp;#34; rechargeable and had much too little power.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light-weight and comfortably designed, but it takes a little getting used to the smaller, narrow trimmer.  </li>
            <li> There is no indication of amount of charge left, which is a bit inconvenient since Norelco specifies that it is better to let the unit completely discharge before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is quieter, FAR less irritating to the skin (pretty much zero irritation), and charges seem to last forever!</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old-old Norelco (with the vacuum to suck up my shorn whiskers) and my third Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About the only thing it doesn&#x27;t have is a vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> It is simple (no excess attachments floating around!), yet highly effective - all other trimmers have failed to achieve this yet to date.</li>
            <li> This model does NOT have a vacuum, but for me that is not an issue.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer had sharp teeth that would dig into my skin and draw blood at the slightest snag or angle deviation.</li>
            <li> Just realize that the markings are apparently not using a human system of measurement so a bit of trial and error</li>
            <li> fairly quiet- not whisper quiet but also not a loud buzz.</li>
            <li> Also, without the comb, you can rotate the head from large to small.  </li>
            <li> It worked well, but the battery was starting to show its age - meaning that the battery charges weren&#x27;t lasting very long.  </li>
            <li> I regularly trim my head and goatee, and my wife uses it occasionally for her legs (winter + shaving &#x3D; horribly dry skin).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The cutting blades are configured in a way that makes using just the blade directly on the skin (no attachment) easy and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> but it works, my beard was a little thicker, but I have fine hair and it had a hard time picking up all the hairs at first, I just had to run over everything like 5-6 times, but when I say thick</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last a really long time also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and carries the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It looked too rounded at first, and the combs too thick.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t mean to get long a story here, but try it; the price is right.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s making accurate trimming, but little hard to use where the hair&lt;</li>
            <li> The charge will last a very long time..</li>
            <li> LAST VERY LONG</li>
            <li> It seemed just about impossible to get the comb off the trimmer in order to clean it...until I discovered that it is much easier if you extend the comb to its maximum.</li>
            <li> It takes me half the time to trim my bear compared to the old Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> Simply rinse the trimmer off and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> Simply rinse the trimmer off and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can take several passes to cut all the hair evenly; though, I&#x27;ve never used any trimmer that cut every single hair</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t need the laser guide (and don&#x27;t care about the digital display), the 5100 is the better, and less expensive, choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little on the loud side.</li>
            <li> This one, due to the low cost, doesn&#x27;t have built in vacuum, so if that&#x27;s a must for you, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Long battery life</li>
            <li> It is not cheaply made and flimsy and loud like some reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> battery stays charged for a LONG time, and charges within a couple hours when it does require recharging.</li>
            <li> No tugging, and it keeps its charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The length of stubble was a bit too long for me.</li>
            <li> (I mean, isn&#x27;t that the real test?)&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum ability, it excels in all areas where the previous trimmer fell short.</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum ability, it excels in all areas where the previous trimmer fell short.</li>
            <li> You must select the larger trimmer to put the comb back on the unit -- its not possible to slide it on if you have the small trimmer selected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only owned one other beard trimmer...</li>
            <li> I have bought countless trimmers and every other one</li>
            <li> but I just want something to keep me looking sharp for work (short beard, well groomed, stubble on neckline).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those are properly made tools that are made to last, with a little care.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that the “guide” is fixed and does not flex as it moved over the surface of my face (as with other Philips products of the past).  </li>
            <li> In three shavings there has yet to be a single snag.</li>
            <li> So this gets a little messy if you have a decent length beard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by this alone, but be aware of the poor material</li>
            <li> The angle seems weird at first, but like anything you adapt - after a few days of having a little bit of a funny look.</li>
            <li> I had a trimmer designed to trim horses once that didn&#x27;t ever bog down, but then, it was sort of like starting a chain saw!  </li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised how well the Norelco worked and likes the wide trimmer on one end and a narrow, detail trimmer on the other.  </li>
            <li> The complaints about problems getting the comb off the cutting head are easily solved by setting the adjustment head to the highest setting.</li>
            <li> It costs significantly less than Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 9100 which I recently reviewed.</li>
            <li> The smaller side also cuts well, with less aggressive nature so it doesnt leave scapes and cuts when it is used to trim the edges clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;(+) Wet or dry trimming and also sink-washable</li>
            <li> /&gt;(+) Wet or dry trimming and also sink-washable</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a noticeable upgrade in usability and results over the one I&#x27;ve been using for the last 10 years or any of my previous ones for that matter.</li>
            <li> Until recently, I had been using an previous model [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] which I got in 2011.  </li>
            <li> Since this is a wet/dry trimmer, you can use it bone dry or in the shower or just with a wet face, which I prefer.  </li>
            <li> One plastic comb attachment is included and fits over the metal cutting edge and snaps down into the top of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tried digging in, but I think it&#x27;s near impossible to actually nick yourself with this one.</li>
            <li> (no I don&#x27;t use it for haircut, just a little touch up before the regular haircut)  </li>
            <li> Well, after unboxing the trimmer I was a bit disappointed to learn that the digital readout is really just a clever looking sticker that indicates the beard trimmer settings.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t use it in the shower if you were careful not to be in the spray with it.  </li>
            <li> I like to use it without the guard in lieu of a razor, but I do wish the wide blade side cut as close as the narrower blade side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I WOULD NOT get this completely wet, because mine started sputtering after I did it...</li>
            <li> If you are careful, it will still get you what you want.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been careful with the trimmer; it has never been dropped or subjected to a shock.   </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have any problem going on a two week vacation without the charger (then again, I only trim my beard a few times a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The comb is 38mm (1.5in) wide, and removable.</li>
            <li> The comb attaches firmly into the trimmer, and comes on and off in such a way as to not stress the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> In it&#x27;s place were TWO Norelco electric razors (not capable of beard trimming) and a Wahl multipiece, in case you want to go to work for Supercuts.  </li>
            <li> The middle part of the trimmer (digital display sticker and the rubber-looking grip directly beneath) actually rotates and adjusts the cutting blades.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not worth buying this just for doing minor touch up work.</li>
            <li> My husband was leery to try as he has used the same trimmer for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of different beard trimmers, but I&#x27;ve had few.</li>
            <li> Moreover, washing the blade as opposed to blowing off the few stubbles is not a big deal to</li>
            <li> As a tool to give a rough shape before polishing up with a shaver, this tool will excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My last shaver had a wide blade, was bulky - resulting in an uneven cut, and it couldn&#x27;t trim my beard just below my nose due to</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not strong enough</li>
            <li> Since the entire head (metal cutting part) can rotate and the back-size of the trimmer is a smaller detailed cutting blade trimming my upper lip and other small areas is much</li>
            <li> Save the cardboard and plastic used by using half the amount and go a long way toward recycling.  </li>
            <li> And, once charged, this beard trimmer&#x27;s battery lasts about twice as long as the battery on my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> The rotate around head that goes from wide trim to detail is extremely convenient--especially for travel.</li>
            <li> It cuts thick and thin hard, more than just a beard.  </li>
            <li> It does trim short enough that it does not pull as bad when I use my razor which is what I was really looking for.</li>
            <li> It varies as it’s distance from my face due to the lack of flex in the guide.</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t stab my nose like my other trimmer).</li>
            <li> Note: the numbers on the trimmer indicating the length settings are not digital as they appear in the photo, it&#x27;s merely a printed sticker (but no wasted battery power illuminating a display!).</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying anything else from Philips again due to this experience</li>
            <li> I am now in the process of looking for a replacement and, after 3 failures in a roe of beard trimmers manufactured by Philips, I am looking at other brands due to the lack of durability / longevity in the Philips Beard Trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Comes with the plastic, adjustable, guide that is also improved compared to the other model</li>
            <li> /&gt;Problems that I&#x27;ve found with other trimmers that this one does NOT have:  </li>
            <li> So, it goes in the drawer with all my other toiletries, and if you&#x27;re like me</li>
            <li> [COMFORTABLE]&lt;br /&gt;The body of this trimmer is long and narrow.</li>
            <li> other trimmers, with the attachment on for trimming</li>
            <li> Reviews from Men&#x27;s Health and other sites were also all over the map.  </li>
            <li> A full listing of cutting increments (all in mm): 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. and</li>
            <li> Precision trimmer is also razor sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple of other comments;&lt;br /&gt;- Feel.  </li>
            <li> Other than the power button the trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> (I realize it isn&#x27;t an electric shaver, but other beard trimmers or clippers I&#x27;ve used will trim shorter without a comb/guide).  </li>
            <li> other models need to power up the battery before you can use it.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve only ever had one other beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Just wide up and down for length.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Motor strength and cutting capability is entirely adequate for any and all trimming.  </li>
            <li> It seems that this has all the functional benefits of the Norelco 9100 minus a deathray &amp; 1080p, and costs about 40% less.  </li>
            <li> One side is wide, the other narrow for trimming around nose, ears, etc.  </li>
            <li> only complaints are that the battery only lasts about one hour on a single charge, and it comes with a proprietary charger, which is unfortunate.  </li>
            <li> I will agree with other reviewers that the dial numbers looks kinda of sill (so-called &amp;#34;digital&amp;#34; interface) but certainly not worth taking it down a star.</li>
            <li> One is 32mm wide and the other is a little less than 16mm.</li>
            <li> I do wish the trimmer was a little smaller, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the battery life.  </li>
            <li> LARGER BLADE]&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachment only works with the larger cutting blade.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the plastic comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars for the trimmer, 1 star for the experience, and average of 3 stars.</li>
            <li> No bogging down, no missed hairs and</li>
            <li> Increments are in millimeters and range from 10mm down to 0.4mm.</li>
            <li> Will try to remember to update again down the road.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it drifting from 12mm down to 1 without my cooperation.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time ( I may have to check for some alien form of power source)</li>
            <li> You just put the one ONE comb on and adjust from a half inch or so beard, all the way down to a 1 or 2 day stubble</li>
            <li> I can say that unlike some other reviewers the unit I received was dead and it charged fully in about an hour.  </li>
            <li> Both blades seem to be very high quality and there is absolutely no pulling when cutting.</li>
            <li> Cutting head rotates for access to a detail blade (smaller cutting area) making the entire beard area accessible by this trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li> Cutting head rotates for access to a detail blade (smaller cutting area) making the entire beard area accessible by this trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 4 razers in less then two years.</li>
            <li> Oddly, it does not have a mini-shaver for detailing around the edges of your beard.</li>
            <li> I probably spend half the time shaving as I used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less fussed about the looks.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those guys who has a beard that can grow in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> My previous [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] had none of this.  </li>
            <li> thats one less thing you&#x27;ll have to be concerned</li>
            <li> My previous [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] had none of this.  </li>
            <li> thats one less thing you&#x27;ll have to be concerned</li>
            <li> Mines black.  </li>
            <li> the length adjustment NEVER accidentally slips, if the battery dies mid-shave you can still use it while charging, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to clog or gunk up since a mere 10 seconds of rinsing after each shave will sweep away 99% the hair (to get the remaining 1% you just have to pop off the head once every few weeks and rinse that), and there&#x27;s no gimmicky features like a built in vacuum (</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this is as flimsy as some other reviews, but absolutely not a strong point.  </li>
            <li> As you turn the wheel, you can also see the guide get higher or lower over the cutting blade.  </li>
            <li> The head is also narrow so gets less work done in each pass.</li>
            <li> Looks sharp on my counter, though it&#x27;s usually stored out of sight.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need all those little accessories (nose hair trimmer, foil trimmer, etc.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messier than the T980, but the trim is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that means it gets a little &#x27;grungy&#x27; with toothpaste, hair clippings, deodorant, etc.  </li>
            <li> This little beauty is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could also be a little easier to remove.  </li>
            <li> Little lights guide you through the charge/recharge decisions.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of practice to get an even trim at the shorter settings, because you have to account for the direction of hair growth as you run the comb through your beard.</li>
            <li> Might be a little over priced</li>
            <li> I wish it would trim a little shorter.  </li>
            <li> Bought a little ConGon tear/nose hair trimmer, and this thing to do the rest - head, face, beard, and neck.  </li>
            <li> Big plus with this product is that you can use it while its charging, Nothing worse that the battery dying on you when you are half way trimming, if the battery dies this one will keep going and get the job done once you plug it in.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts for a long time, and can do some serious trimming.</li>
            <li> I plan on using it on the lowest setting as a &amp;#34;stubble trimmer&amp;#34; when I retire in a few months, too.</li>
            <li> Purchased in June, 2014, battery dead and not rechargeable by October, 2014.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t vouch for battery life in any quantifiable way as I haven&#x27;t yet tried to use it until dead.  </li>
            <li> Box was missing brush, comb and oil.</li>
            <li> but if it is dead, you can plug it in and immediately use.</li>
            <li> The beard height selector has firm click stops</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s my opinion after using the device for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem to mind thin, thick, soft, or stiff, it just cuts them all.  </li>
            <li> I typically grow out a beard for the winter months and in the past have relied on a pair of Wahl clippers and plain-old scissors for my beard trimming needs.</li>
            <li> I use it for shaving my face as well as for cutting my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t perform particularly well at either task.</li>
            <li> Questionable aesthetic appeal, but as long as you&#x27;re looking sharp</li>
            <li> I like to let it grow out occasionally, but hate the wild man look.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they both had the same issues.</li>
            <li> I have been (and after evaluating this Norelco, will continue to) using the Conair iStubble for this purpose for the past two years.</li>
            <li> do I say it&#x27;s possibly alien in origin?</li>
            <li> Well maybe if I had multiple weird beard/goatee angles.  </li>
            <li> There is one small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;(4) Small cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slick blue/grey plastic on front panel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought over the past 30+ years.</li>
            <li> Once on the trimmer I don&#x27;t see this being broken by anything other than an unlucky fall or some form of misadventure.  </li>
            <li> It has hardly any power and a small amount of hair clogs it.</li>
            <li> And, it can bog down if you&#x27;re trying to cut very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and, every time I trim, it leaves random long hairs.</li>
            <li> Now the blades are dull again</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them going dull anytime soon.</li>
            <li> My last trimmer was a Wahl, and it lasted me a disappointing year.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t give a travel bag or at least something for travelling.</li>
            <li> In order to switch to using the smaller sized blade you have to remove the trimming attachment and then run the cutting blade 180°.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a Norelco 7500 which they had at least 10 of the day before.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer includes a standard metal cutting edge and plate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it happen once, in the awkward area around my Adam&#x27;s apple, but let&#x27;s just say I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Secondary blade.  </li>
            <li> And I can simply spin the cutting head around to the small/narrow blade to perform detail trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (well least it can be washed under the faucet )&lt;</li>
            <li> It works well on my thick beard</li>
            <li> It does the job I have a thick beard</li>
            <li> Handles my thick beard no problem.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand other reviewers who complain about not having a charging base, it states it comes with a cord only or not getting a close shave, if you want a close shave buy a razor that is not the purpose of this trimmer nor</li>
            <li> adjustable length guard functions well, although as some other reviewers mentioned it can be difficult to remove for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> But a warning: there aint no crumbs catcher in this thing like your usual electric shaver has!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t take that to mean that the trimmer is waterproof though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has been a failure.</li>
            <li> Would rank in the top ten of the worst instructions ever.</li>
            <li> Not necessarily as good at &#x27;precision styling&#x27;</li>
            <li> Somtimes i have to take the size setting off just to trim a few random hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I also have no use for all the other gimicky options like lazers and vacuums and other crap they add onto a trimmer that adds to the cost that doesn&#x27;t work for darn or drains the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Weak.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it hasn&#x27;t pulled 1 hair!</li>
            <li> Even in that tough spot between your nose and upper-lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very confusing.  </li>
            <li> We had bought a $20 one and were not happy.  </li>
            <li> The length guard is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish is that it came with a base for it to sit in and charge.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re trying to make it look like an LCD display when it&#x27;s patently unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to understand the negative reviews here as I found nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> the way it adjusts makes it impossible to slide down</li>
            <li> It suffers from a beard comb that is next to impossible to remove, and always takes the razor attachment with it.</li>
            <li> The titanium trimmer head is hard and cold against your face.</li>
            <li> , I was a little disappointed with the two sided shaper.</li>
            <li> However, it is quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> Weird.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> the setting on it is flawed.</li>
            <li> Terrible product if you want to get down to the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> I am accustomed to pointed attachments that lift and align the hair to allow cutting.</li>
            <li> Just too darn awkward.</li>
            <li> Crazy battery life.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have an especially thick beard or hairs, but this just does not work.</li>
            <li> After about a month the power button is very difficult to activate.</li>
            <li> Seriously Amazon, get your crap together in the warehouse!  </li>
            <li> So bad if you want to get somewhat close.</li>
            <li> This is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> No travel bag or base charger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No travel bag or base charger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is absolutely the most perfect beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No pulling of hairs at all (no ingrown hairs now yay!)&lt;br /&gt;- Great price&lt;br /&gt;- Easily cleaned&lt;br /&gt;- Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;- Extremely high quality, doesn&#x27;t feel toy like at all</li>
            <li> This is the third Philips beard trimmer I’ve owned and my least favorite.  It is well constructed and nicely designed with an almost infinite choice of beard lengths.  The only issue is that the “guide” is fixed and does not flex as it moved over the surface of my face (as with other Philips products of the past).  I really wanted to love this one, but its not up to the task of cutting a consistent length beard.  It varies as it’s distance from my face due to the lack of flex in the guide.</li>
            <li> So far best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.  No pulls, no issues cleaning, holds a charge, light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Easy to use and does job as advertised. Bought my son one first and after he used it with good results I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> I bought a shaver, a wounded body and is supposed to be a new</li>
            <li> works ok, not sure if it cuts as close as my last norelco trimmer but it works.</li>
            <li> MUCH better than the trimmer I was using - the comb is much more forgiving and adjusts for a wide range. I especially like this on my mustache (doesn&#x27;t stab my nose like my other trimmer). I plan on using it on the lowest setting as a &amp;#34;stubble trimmer&amp;#34; when I retire in a few months, too. Both blades seem to be very high quality and there is absolutely no pulling when cutting.</li>
            <li> Plenty of power to trim the most stubborn hair.  Easy to adjust &amp; many settings. Used it for once or twice a week for several weeks (7-8 minutes each), and it&#x27;s still on its first charge.  As compact as any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used &amp; easy to hold in hand.  Never had a snag or pull.  Looks sharp on my counter, though it&#x27;s usually stored out of sight.  Easy to clean by simply running the faucet over the tip, but not meant to be fully submerged.  I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t use it in the shower if you were careful not to be in the spray with it.  The flip around blade mechanism is convenient and works well.  I like to use it without the guard in lieu of a razor, but I do wish the wide blade side cut as close as the narrower blade side. I didn&#x27;t need all those little accessories (nose hair trimmer, foil trimmer, etc.) so this does everything I need.  Note: the numbers on the trimmer indicating the length settings are not digital as they appear in the photo, it&#x27;s merely a printed sticker (but no wasted battery power illuminating a display!).</li>
            <li> A fierce trimmer for a fierce beard.</li>
            <li> Terrible product if you want to get down to the lowest setting.  I had the Conair istubble for two years and it is much better.  After attempting to trim with the norelco this morning was hopeless, I just went back to my old trimmer and it got the job done.  I need to return this.  So bad if you want to get somewhat close.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this trimmer!!  I bought this to use on my Chinese Crested which has very fine hair.  He has a small muzzle and the small side works just perfect for that.. and the larger is perfect size for his body.  My husband also uses the trimmer and he loves it.. It doesnt pull and it seems to not leave razor burn which is very important.. I also noticed that it doesnt get hot when used for a few minutes.. The charge will last a very long time.. This is a great all in one trimmer for both man and grooming your dog!</li>
            <li> so far so good, hopefully battery will stay charged</li>
            <li> Replaced my 3 year old Wahl Lithium Ion with this trimmer.  I liked the Wahl but it required gobs of fiddly attachments to get the job done.  The Norelco trimmer is so much easier to use.  The adjustable trimming comb installs easily and adjusts perfectly to cut the exact length you want. The neatest feature is the dual-sided cutter head.  One side is wide, the other narrow for trimming around nose, ears, etc.  The cutter head easily pops off and can be rotated 180d.  The trimmer has excellent power.  Yes, it would be nice if it came with a stand but it&#x27;s not that big a deal for me.</li>
            <li> Very precise.  Does a very nice job of trimming my beard and with the swivel head the smaller cutter does a nice job of trimming the hair in my ears.</li>
            <li> Purchased in June, 2014, battery dead and not rechargeable by October, 2014. It has been beyond the Amazon return window. I&#x27;m have a $50 paper weight.</li>
            <li> love it cuts very smoothly and shapes my beard very good</li>
            <li> Very nicely designed and it feels like a well made unit</li>
            <li> Perfect for the purpose I needed.  Keeps my beard a perfect &#x27;stubble&#x27; length and cuts smoothly and quickly.  I&#x27;m well pleased.</li>
            <li> Works very well-I am still using the clippers on the initial charge-seems to hold charge very well and long runtime</li>
            <li> The best thing about this trimmer is that it can be cleaned under water. Other than that, it trims quickly and seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer i have bought</li>
            <li> After years of using Norelco lines for trimming I was excited to get a new Norelco trimmer and I could not have been happier with this product.&lt;br /&gt;So far its more that what I hoped for. Quiet and powerful trimmer. Does not pull hair and its so comfortable to hold it. It takes me half the time to trim my bear compared to the old Norelco trimmer. The old one was used weekly and after 5 years it never stopped working. I hope this one will last the same. Big plus with this product is that you can use it while its charging, Nothing worse that the battery dying on you when you are half way trimming, if the battery dies this one will keep going and get the job done once you plug it in. Now I don&#x27;t have to think how much battery I have left before I am done trimming. Great product !</li>
            <li> Pretty excellent.  Good quality, long battery life and great features.  Not the cheapest but it has to be one of the best.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to pointed attachments that lift and align the hair to allow cutting. This model has a sort of rounded attachment that doesn&#x27;t lift and align. I end up going over and over the same area in different directions to get the hair to cut. On the positive side, the cutters are nice and sharp and don&#x27;t inadvertently grab any skin. It charges quickly and will cut for quite a long time without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I believe it to be a nice trimmer, but don&#x27;t think I can recommend it with the rounded attachment making it difficult to cut hair or beard in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> The battery is good but I&#x27;m not strong enough</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my Philips Norelco T980 (the vacuum one), and this is perfect. I love that the blade just clicks around for the detail trimmer instead of having to switch out heads. It&#x27;s a little messier than the T980, but the trim is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I WOULD NOT get this completely wet, because mine started sputtering after I did it... almost like it wants you to charge it, even after it&#x27;s fully charged. Even with that, it still works and does the job wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, especially compared to the $20-25 &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34; I tended to use before.  Granted, this is more expensive, but the extra cost brings better performance and overall value, particularly in motor power and battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the rotating trimmer head.  One end is full width, but rotating the head gives you a half-width blade suitable for precision trimming.  Perfect for touching up ears and nose (let&#x27;s hear it for middle age!). The base of the trimmer head is also nice and smooth, allowing you to lay it flat against your skin rather than raking blade teeth across your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adjustable length guard functions well, although as some other reviewers mentioned it can be difficult to remove for cleaning.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to break when I pull it off, but I do find myself cradling it a bit during removal just to be safe.  Extending the guard fully before removal eases the process considerably.  I wish the guard had one or two more long settings... 10mm sounds fine, but I like my goatee just a bit longer during colder seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motor strength and cutting capability is entirely adequate for any and all trimming.  I regularly trim my head and goatee, and my wife uses it occasionally for her legs (winter + shaving &#x3D; horribly dry skin).  No bogging down, no missed hairs and no pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t vouch for battery life in any quantifiable way as I haven&#x27;t yet tried to use it until dead.  I can say that unlike some other reviewers the unit I received was dead and it charged fully in about an hour.  Ten uses later (head/goatee) I decided to charge it and I&#x27;m still working off that charge after another half-dozen uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> Great quality! Great features, ie: runs with cord or battery.</li>
            <li> This is a really good trimmer.  However, it is quite expensive.  So that is why I tempered my rating.  I had a Wahl trimmer before. It was great at trimming stubble and really short settings.  However, the attachments were a pain and the battery was a joke.  This trimmer has an amazing battery, and it trims longer facial hair to perfection.  Where it falls a bit short is in trimming stubble and really short facial hair. I like to go days without shaving. I&#x27;ll just use the trimmer to &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; the areas of my face that I don&#x27;t grow out.  This trimmer is great in that it NEVER will nick you or anything.  However, it is much harder to get a really nice and even trim all around for this type of trimming.  Also, the attachment is very nice in how it has the dial to adjust the settings.  However, the attachment has a solid line opening at the timmer head that can cause unwanted gaps when trying use the lower settings.  If you are careful, it will still get you what you want.  I just wish the attachment had a full guard.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Conair trimmer but it sucked at holding a charge and suffered from water damage. Once it no longer worked I bought a Philips Norco trimmer (not this one) and it was great. Lowest trim setting of .5mm was great, and it literally seems to never need to be charged. I accidentally left it somewhere so I bought this one and it&#x27;s just as great, if not better. The lowest trim setting of .4mm is, for me, a huge benefit, though only a slight upgrade over my old PN&#x27;s .5mm. Overall, an excellent product by Philips.</li>
            <li> good battery life and power. Doesn&#x27;t rust or get gunky when cleaned with water.</li>
            <li> Love this thing. Use it to keep a permanent stubble. I don&#x27;t use any of the combs.</li>
            <li> Just too darn awkward. Well made but the most challenging to use beard trimmer that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  We had bought a $20 one and were not happy.  Bit by paying a little, more on this we are satisfieds.</li>
            <li> Returned it to Philips, I perfer the Conair iStubble over this any day.  Philips offers a 45 day money back guarantee.  I finally got my money back, but it a LONG drawn out processed with many steps.  I won&#x27;t be buying anything else from Philips again due to this experience</li>
            <li> Trimmer works like a charm and arrived within days of purchase.  What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. I reviewed many trimmers before I settled on this one. My last trimmer was a Panasonic ER224S which lasted 4 years until the battery died. I wanted a trimmer that could be used with or without the cord so that once the battery died I wouldn&#x27;t be left with another paper weight. I also have no use for all the other gimicky options like lazers and vacuums and other crap they add onto a trimmer that adds to the cost that doesn&#x27;t work for darn or drains the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand other reviewers who complain about not having a charging base, it states it comes with a cord only or not getting a close shave, if you want a close shave buy a razor that is not the purpose of this trimmer nor is that stated anywhere, this doesn&#x27;t have a travel case, wah it does not say that it comes with one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this trimmer do? I have a very course beard and it trims and shapes it very well. It does not pull it my beard, I have no issues at all with the guide. It is not cheaply made and flimsy and loud like some reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it hasn&#x27;t pulled 1 hair! The charge seems to last a really long time also.</li>
            <li> I returned this.  I purchased a Norelco Multigroom 5100 (Model QG3364/42) instead.  This one was OK, but I liked the other one better.</li>
            <li> Bought this to do detail trimming, and it works very well.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> It has hardly any power and a small amount of hair clogs it. Do not buy this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> A great little shaver.  Holds true to the best reviews.  Quiet, effective, love the head flexibility and length options.  no pinch for sure.  Only wish it could get a bit closer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my beard well at all!</li>
            <li> We have this trimmer for our son. It costs significantly less than Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 9100 which I recently reviewed. It is very similar so check that review out if you want to read about the top of the line beard trimmer and then compare the two. This one also has 17 settings and two different ends which are used for different purposes (so you can use one blade on wider areas and one as a detail trimmer), and this also can be rinsed under the faucet for easy cleaning. So there isn&#x27;t much difference except the exacting laser setting. If you can spring for that and want to, go for the 9100. If you don&#x27;t care all that much , this is one GREAT BEARD TRIMMER!  We are a Philips Norelco family at this point and love the high quality of their products. I have a lot of sons, and, of course, my husband ... and where does Philips Norelco fit in? It is easy!&lt;br /&gt;Just pick the style you require of shaver or trimmer, and and always choose a Philips Norelco, whether it is the Philips Norelco Beard Trimmer 5100 ot another Philips Norelco, and you will be set!&lt;br /&gt;My son loves this beard trimmer!  Easy and accurate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
            <li> must be the best shaver I have ever owned. I had to give it a 5 star</li>
            <li> Great unit. battery lasts a long time.  Cuts, does not pull, hair.  Lots of length settings.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> While I like the two head (one wide, one narrow for detailed trimming) option, and I like the relative quietness, and I like that it doesn&#x27;t cut me, this is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for a month and, every time I trim, it leaves random long hairs. Even after going back over my beard several times, I can never get them all. Today&#x27;s trim was the last one I will use this product for.</li>
            <li> Works ok.  I also have the $20 Conair iStubble which works better so its a lot better value than this one.</li>
            <li> This thing works great and stays charged a really long time.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> *UPDATE* 7-17-14  The Norelco BT52575/41 5100 Beard Trimmer has been working well, however, the switch to turn the device on and off is no longer functioning. I&#x27;ve always been careful with the trimmer; it has never been dropped or subjected to a shock.   A wonderful trimmer has been rendered useless by an inoperative switch. This is very disappointing. Philips is a big company and they should be doing a much better job with the quality control of their products.  I am now in the process of looking for a replacement and, after 3 failures in a roe of beard trimmers manufactured by Philips, I am looking at other brands due to the lack of durability / longevity in the Philips Beard Trimmers.  Original Review:   I&#x27;ve been using Norelco beard trimmers for years.  The last two models I had were the, [[ASIN:B002C741MM Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer]], and they were pretty much identical, even though they were purchased years apart, they were just different colors.  Unfortunately, they both had the same issues. Their batteries died quickly, and they didn&#x27;t hold charges for very long, despite following the directions included for optimizing battery life. Eventually, they were reduced to being  used as corded trimmers only.  I bought the same / similar model twice because I was comfortable with the design, the way they worked, and I thought they did a good job at keeping my beard trimmed.  This model is a vast improvement over the Philips Norelco QT4021 Stubble Trimmer. The Philips Norelco 5100 charges in a very short time and holds the charge longer. Dual trimmers allow for more options in grooming and far more precision. This model also has a very comfortable design, is easy to hold, is lightweight, and is very easy to use. Comes with the plastic, adjustable, guide that is also improved compared to the other model and I like the new display.  More packaging here than necessary for this product. Save the cardboard and plastic used by using half the amount and go a long way toward recycling.  Overall, I really like this beard trimmer. It works very well.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer functions perfectly.  It cuts thick and thin hard, more than just a beard.  The guard is secure and easily adjustable.  There is a visual indicator which shows you the length the guard is set to, so you dont have to guess if it is set at the same spot as last time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger side to the trimmer blade cuts aggresively and quickly.  Doesnt seem to mind thin, thick, soft, or stiff, it just cuts them all.  The smaller side also cuts well, with less aggressive nature so it doesnt leave scapes and cuts when it is used to trim the edges clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery stays charged for a LONG time, and charges within a couple hours when it does require recharging.</li>
            <li> I original owned a conair istubble shaver that I really liked.  It was the fastest and most comfortable shave I had ever had and turned me on to stubble trimmers.  That said I am not the best at reading directions and like things to be clean, so I rinsed the conair off... this instantly ruined the shaver. And so began my search for a washable, adjustable, stubble trimmer that cut to .4mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than go into a full fledged list of pros and cons, I will just say that the conair was slightly more comfortable on my face and faster at trimming to .4mm. Everything else is relatively the same between the two except the norelco is manual length adjusted and the conair was electronic. (My roommate had the conair longer then I had and his motor stopped moving the comb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither product contained a case but the way the norelco is designed I don&#x27;t have any fear throwing it in a bag for travel (already have done so).  Overall I am very pleased with the product and best of all its clean!</li>
            <li> Works great and the battery last over a week in my case. I use the 0.8 setting</li>
            <li> No frills; trims beard nicely with 1 adjustable head. No extra attachments. A  plus.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve owned about 6 different beard trimmers in my lifetime and -- not even exaggerating -- this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  The feature set is awesome, quality is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- precise length adjustment... 5/5&lt;br /&gt;- precision head for detail work... 5/5&lt;br /&gt;- ease taking apart for cleaning... 5/5&lt;br /&gt;- battery life... 5/5&lt;br /&gt;- quality of the blades... 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems that I&#x27;ve found with other trimmers that this one does NOT have:  the length adjustment NEVER accidentally slips, if the battery dies mid-shave you can still use it while charging, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to clog or gunk up since a mere 10 seconds of rinsing after each shave will sweep away 99% the hair (to get the remaining 1% you just have to pop off the head once every few weeks and rinse that), and there&#x27;s no gimmicky features like a built in vacuum (those things never work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con I can think of is I found it for about 25% cheaper outside of Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this kind of beard trimmer on my scraggly, not-thick beard and mustache. So I didn&#x27;t want lots of extra attachments , nor cheap plasticky stuff. Although you have to really practice using this to get it right, it does a basic job, if that&#x27;s all you want, and has enough length settings to satisfy most needs. But a warning: there aint no crumbs catcher in this thing like your usual electric shaver has!  I used this to shave--while I was standing at my wife&#x27;s dresser drawer mirror, which was almost my last act on this good earth. When I finished I looked down to see lots of my fine (gray!!!) beard crumbs dusted over the nice shiny wood and the nice stuff the she has on the dresser top. I noticed this at about the same time I heard her coming up the stairs. Amazing how fast a guy can move to do a clean up when his life is passing before his eyes. Didn&#x27;t mean to get long a story here, but try it; the price is right. Oh, yeah, the sealed plastic shrink-wrap type box is a pistol to open. Also: Shave over the sink!!!  Hope this helped.</li>
            <li> This has nice power and is easy to control. The features are pretty standard for a trimmer this size and weight, which is quite light. The charge lasts for a long time, and can do some serious trimming. Good quality made product. This should last a while. The blade protrudes the perfect amount for making shape trims on beards for good straight lines.</li>
            <li> The body of the trimmer is sleek enough to hold completely in one hand, allowing for greater control while shaving. It is gentle to skin  and the quiet allows for a more peaceful shave. This razor can be used dry or wet, allowing for greater ease during my daily routine (Shave before or during shower). As so many other reviews have indicated, it really is an  excellent product and worth investing in. The only thing I wish it came with is a travel case so I could take it with me. Strongly recommend this product to any man with a beard.</li>
            <li> OK, as this is a Vine product, there will end up being plenty of reviews. At the risk of not being the most popular (aka “useful”), I get the freedom to provide a niche review. As my title suggests, I am using this trimmer for my head, as opposed to my beard. The goal is the same, though. I want a very short stubble on my head, rather than the shiny shaved look (which I prefer for my face). I have been (and after evaluating this Norelco, will continue to) using the Conair iStubble for this purpose for the past two years. While both do the job pretty effectively, I’ve decided to stay with the Conair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages of the Norelco over the Conair:&lt;br /&gt;Washable&lt;br /&gt;More comfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advantages of the Conair&lt;br /&gt;Digital readout of the length&lt;br /&gt;Follows the contour of my head better&lt;br /&gt;Doesn’t seem to require as many passes over the same area to produce uniform length.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, it feels good in the hand, it&#x27;s fairly quiet and it&#x27;s by far the sharpest trimmer I&#x27;ve used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I say it&#x27;s possibly alien in origin? My first indication was it comes packaged in what at first sight appears to be the typical bank vault like plastic clam shell that human engineers have devised with the primary goal of extracting as much blood from you as possible while forcing you to use every tool you own to gain entry down to a pair of garden shears. Imagine my surprise when I could easily open the clamshell packaging simply and easily without tools and blood loss!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second indicator was the folded instruction sheet sitting neatly in it&#x27;s provided area, folded out it easily holds basic instructions in two languages. However, a team of physicists have been working two weeks to figure out how to refold it so that it fits back in it&#x27;s original space. They tell me they may have an answer in my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third indicator are the markings on the adjustment wheel for depth control. These markings don&#x27;t seem to correlate to any known human system of measurement. Set to 0.4 it certainly isn&#x27;t 0.4mm nor is it 0.4 inches. However the wheel does turn easily and indeed makes depth adjustment easy. Just realize that the markings are apparently not using a human system of measurement so a bit of trial and error is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this trimmer, it&#x27;s far better than my old Philips flip out trimmer. From a short stubble to a fuller look it&#x27;s worked effortlessly and I have confidence that it&#x27;ll not leave me with \\&quot;stripes\\&quot;. It holds a charge for a very long time ( I may have to check for some alien form of power source) it&#x27;s a pleasure to use and leaves you looking good with no pinching or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, and multifaceted, which is what I was looking for. More length settings than my previous shaver, which is also a plus. Excellent blades, cut like butter. It just feels good, durable, time will of course be the ultimate test but something tells me I won&#x27;t have to look for another trimmer for awhile.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I bought this razor, as I do with every purchase of something I expect to last me a while.  My last trimmer was a Wahl, and it lasted me a disappointing year.  The lithium battery bit the dust after 2 nights without power.  So, I decided to look outside of American manufacturing (the main reason for the Wahl purchase) and came upon the review for an upgraded version of this gem on [...].  I liked what they had to say and found the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 as the same trimmer without the laser guide.  I love it!  It holds a charge forever, trims very accurately, requires almost no maintenance, and is easy to clean.  The swivel blade function is also very handy.  I do wish the trimmer was a little smaller, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for the battery life.  I highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 4 razers in less then two years. They all seem to be junk these days, mostly battery probes. So far this one seems to be great, good strong battery,charges in 1.5 hours and lasts me over a month of trims. I hope it lasts</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for a year now and its still going as strong as new.  I continue to be &#x27;Very Pleased.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This depth control of this trimmer is excellent.  Instead of a bunch of different size combs scattered all over like other trimmers, you just dial up the length of cut you want and the single comb rises or lowers to exactly the length you want.  And you have a lot of choice!  From 0.4mm (good for a very short stubble) up to 10mm (good for a fairly &#x27;longish&#x27; beard, but not quite long enough to trim the hair on your head, unless you like it short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can take several passes to cut all the hair evenly; though, I&#x27;ve never used any trimmer that cut every single hair the first go around anyway.  And, it can bog down if you&#x27;re trying to cut very thick hair.  I had a trimmer designed to trim horses once that didn&#x27;t ever bog down, but then, it was sort of like starting a chain saw!  For a cordless on my short beard this suits me very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the unit for several months now, and found that the battery lasts for many, many trims.  I wouldn&#x27;t have any problem going on a two week vacation without the charger (then again, I only trim my beard a few times a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light-weight and comfortably designed, but it takes a little getting used to the smaller, narrow trimmer.  The angle seems weird at first, but like anything you adapt - after a few days of having a little bit of a funny look. The comb is 38mm (1.5in) wide, and removable. Inside are your choice of two trimmers (you swivel the head around to select the one you want). One is 32mm wide and the other is a little less than 16mm. You must select the larger trimmer to put the comb back on the unit -- its not possible to slide it on if you have the small trimmer selected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because:&lt;br /&gt;1) it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand.  So, it goes in the drawer with all my other toiletries, and if you&#x27;re like me (hopefully you&#x27;re not) that means it gets a little &#x27;grungy&#x27; with toothpaste, hair clippings, deodorant, etc.  Plus, the charger and wire sort of hang off the electrical socket and get in the way of everything.&lt;br /&gt;2) it doesn&#x27;t come with its own travel bag.te, hair clippings, deodorant, etc.  Plus, the charger and wire sort of hang off the electrical socket and get in the way of everything. 2) it doesn&#x27;t come with its own travel bag.</li>
            <li> Box was missing brush, comb and oil.</li>
            <li> Phillips Norelco Beard Trimmer works good so far (used only for 2 weeks thus far).  Happy with design, ease of use and Lithium Battery performance.  I believe that the Trimmer will work great in the future based on the performance thus far.&lt;br /&gt;A happy customer!</li>
            <li> Probably the best as it is very precise. 2 mm gap is really great and probably the best to be in control. Just don&#x27;t understand why they don&#x27;t give a travel bag or at least something for travelling. But as a Trimmer this one is probably the best</li>
            <li> Overall a very great trimmer. The dual head is very convenient for shaping. The length is easily changed through the turning point in the middle of the shaver. Very nice to have the blade part be waterproof to rinse off all the whiskers.</li>
            <li> By far the best trimmer I have ever used. Gets pretty much a clean shave and saves so much time compared to using a regular razor with shaving cream. Definitely worth the price and being able to rinse it off is very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, powerful trimmer that looks elegant, trims nicely, and has a nice charge capacity. It suffers from a beard comb that is next to impossible to remove, and always takes the razor attachment with it. Oddly, it does not have a mini-shaver for detailing around the edges of your beard. I have another Phillips trimmer I purchased on Amazon for around $20 and it comes with a beard comb, razor, and mini-shaver attachment. Each of those accessories easily come off and on. My cheaper Phillips is much lower quality, but I miss the mini razor on this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strikes me as a quality trimmer I would expect to see at my barber shop. These slight drawbacks aside, it is still a pretty nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve used the Philips Norelco G370. I even went so far as to replace it with another when it wore out. Now the blades are dull again and so I was looking at replacing it a third time. But when I went to order it, I noticed that the price more than tripled. So I figured it was time to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping with the Norelco brand, I gave the 9100 and 5100 a try. And I&#x27;m glad I did. Not only do they provide a closer shave, but they are self-sharpening so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them going dull anytime soon. Not only that, but the motors run more smoothly, providing less shake and vibration in my hand. The trimmer head can flip around (even while running) so I can access a narrow blade that gets into harder to reach places (or more stubborn hairs the larger blade can&#x27;t cut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 9100 five times on a single charge, and it seems to have more uses left. The laser guide allows for more precision and the digital display makes viewing the comb length setting quick and easy. With the 5100, you don&#x27;t get either of those options, but it matches quality and features with everything else. That said, it is slightly less bulky than the 9100 and has better grips on the back side. So if you don&#x27;t need the laser guide (and don&#x27;t care about the digital display), the 5100 is the better, and less expensive, choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far these have met my expectations. The only thing I miss about the Norelco G370 is the nice charging dock.</li>
            <li> ++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;++ THE PROS ++&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;+ [COMFORTABLE]&lt;br /&gt;The body of this trimmer is long and narrow. It is comfortable to hold and maneuver around the face to get what you need done.&lt;br /&gt;+ [GETS THE NOSE AREA WELL]&lt;br /&gt;On other trimmers, with the attachment on for trimming, they never do a good job of trimming right around the nose area due to the shape and configuration of the attachment. But on this trimmer, the design, configuration and placement of the attachment ensures that whatever setting you&#x27;re using is what you&#x27;ll get...Even in that tough spot between your nose and upper-lip.&lt;br /&gt;+ [MICRO-LENGTH TRIMMING ADJUSTMENTS]&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is about precision trimming and proof of that is the fact that the trimming adjustment can be adjusted between 0.4mm to 10mm, in 0.1mm steps.&lt;br /&gt;+ [BLADE DOESN&#x27;T IRRITATE SKIN]&lt;br /&gt;The cutting blades are configured in a way that makes using just the blade directly on the skin (no attachment) easy and non-irritating.&lt;br /&gt;+ [WASHABLE]&lt;br /&gt;No worries about leaving clumps of trimmed hair on the blades or having to fish out the cleaning brush, just run the trimmer under running water to rinse off and put away clean.&lt;br /&gt;+ [QUICK CHARGE]&lt;br /&gt;The battery charges from dead to full in just an hour.&lt;br /&gt;+ [SAME POWER CORD AS PHILIPS POWERTOUCH ELECTRIC RAZOR (PT724)]&lt;br /&gt;Fring benefit, this trimmer uses the same power cord as the Philips Powertouch Electric Razor (I have model PT724).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;-- THE CONS --&lt;br /&gt;--------------&lt;br /&gt;- [ATTACHMENT ONLY WORKS ON LARGER BLADE]&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer attachment only works with the larger cutting blade. In order to switch to using the smaller sized blade you have to remove the trimming attachment and then run the cutting blade 180°.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************&lt;br /&gt;** FINAL THOUGHTS **&lt;br /&gt;********************&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a goatee for over 20 years now and have gone through many different beard trimmers. The one I finally settled into was a vacuum-trimmer also by Philips. It&#x27;s great for catching the trimmings, but never was that great for precise trimming, irritates and snags against the skin if you use the bare blade and horrible for getting the area between the nose and upper-lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along comes this new trimmer. Although it doesn&#x27;t have the vacuum ability, it excels in all areas where the previous trimmer fell short. I still keep the vacuum trimmer for when I go days without trimming and need the vacuum to keep from shards going everywhere, otherwise this trimmer is my new favorite. Well recommended!into was a vacuum-trimmer also by Philips.

            <li> Best beard trimmer I have ever used.  Trims very close (if I wish).  Adjustments are each to make.  I never (never never) have any irritation with this Norelco Trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a really fancy trimmer compared to my old Braun.  It works well on my thick beard and I don&#x27;t have to keep retracing the same place to get the trim I want.  I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is  very high class settings r easy to view and change the selector is very comfortable to adjust very much enjoying the cut styles.</li>
            <li> Based on my research of trimmers ~ Apr &#x27;14 and given my requirements, this was the best looking product in it&#x27;s price range.  Basically, it seems the bottom line in the world of trimmers is that there are a number of different ones available with various features and you (as the person using it) need to determine what&#x27;s important in terms of what you want it to do.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far I&#x27;m a happy customer, and I hope it&#x27;ll hold up over time.  Here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wanted: A good trimmer with low maintenance that would last awhile, justifying the higher price.  My price range was up to $100.  Probably also important to mention that my beard is about &#x27;average&#x27; thickness, and by no means a dense, thick type (think a solid, Viking bead).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Established brand, easy maintenance (self sharpening blades so no oil; trimmer head can be rinsed under sink), decent adjustable range (up to 10mm), no attachments (this may turn out to be a con in time if it breaks, but my last Wahl had attachments and I like the idea of using a built in wheel for adjustments- just makes things simpler), smooth and even trim in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Lithium battery (because it probably up&#x27;d the cost and I don&#x27;t care much about that, but a plus if you&#x27;re on the go), no holder or case to protect it (at its cost, might be nice to have something to keep it stored upright or a case to cover it), max length is 10mm (OK for me, but something to consider if you&#x27;re going for the full beard look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read so many reviews when looking around that I figured it would only be fair to contribute one myself.  If your trimmer requirements are similar to mine, then I think you&#x27;ll be quite satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hair trimmers for over 10 years to trim and shape my beard. Several months ago, I noticed this beard trimmer was coming out and thought it might make a good replacement and provide even better results. I followed the product and was excited when they finally released it for sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The blades are garbage. I don&#x27;t think I have an especially thick beard or hairs, but this just does not work. The blades either don&#x27;t cut the hairs or the hairs get stuck and pulled, which is very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;2. The length guard is poorly designed. The comb part of the guard is rounded, which doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair. The hair trimmer guards I use are pointed and greatly help lift the hair for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this product after one use. These 2 design flaws are deal breakers.</li>
            <li> As a guy who likes to wear a bit of scruff, I have to say this trimmer works perfect for me. The only thing I wish is that it came with a base for it to sit in and charge. I don&#x27;t like having to dig out the charger when I need to recharge. I like having a stand sitting on the vanity all the time that it can store in. Overall a really nice trimmer though.</li>
            <li> I have only owned one other beard trimmer...a Remington from Costco.  I had nothing to compare to, and thought that making multiple passes through my moderately thick beard and mustache were normal, and that pulling hair, particularly on the mustache was normal.  When the Remington gave up I had no idea the number of choices out there!.....and multiple ones from the same brand.  There are so many reviews where people say they would never own a Norelco, Panasonic, Wahl etc again, and many more who said it was the best trimmer they ever owned.  Reviews from Men&#x27;s Health and other sites were also all over the map.  So  here is a review to help you decide.&lt;br /&gt;I finally decided on this trimmer based on moderate price, well over 55% 5 star reviews and not too many 1 star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M GLAD I took the chance! This little beauty is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1.  The obvious..a great one pass (maybe two in a couple places),  very even, non pulling shave.  (I mean, isn&#x27;t that the real test?)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Simple simple simple!  I really like a narrow detail side for above my lip, over my ears (no I don&#x27;t use it for haircut, just a little touch up before the regular haircut)  so having the head rotate into position smoothly and securely, without having to CHANGE heads is great!  (The two heads are on the same non-removable end--very secure)&lt;br /&gt;3.  Also on the simple side---ONE comb!  I was forever trying to read the small length markings on the TWO  double sided combs on the old one, and they didn&#x27;t snap on and off easily.  You just put the one ONE comb on and adjust from a half inch or so beard, all the way down to a 1 or 2 day stubble look depending on how fast your beard grows.  There are 17 selections, with many short selections.The rotating dial is smooth to operate, with detentes that let you know that you are &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; the setting.  Once there it stays put.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The comb only has to be removed when you rotate the head....not to change lengths.  It looked too rounded at first, and the combs too thick.  Not so.  because of the design it doesn&#x27;t poke, and separates the hairs nicely.  The comb attaches firmly into the trimmer, and comes on and off in such a way as to not stress the plastic.&lt;br /&gt;5.  There is a charge indicator, and the charger charges fast.  The razor CAN be used while it is charging.&lt;br /&gt;6.  Slender, ergonomic design, but not lightweight-  just the right weight in the hand---really well made.&lt;br /&gt;7.  It&#x27;s washable--not important for me, but might be for some.&lt;br /&gt;8.  Blades don&#x27;t need oil&lt;br /&gt;9.  It&#x27;s AMAZON...no my name is not Jeff Bezos, and I own no stock.  I had finally decided to return to Costco and buy whatever they had...It was a Norelco 7500 which they had at least 10 of the day before.  In it&#x27;s place were TWO Norelco electric razors (not capable of beard trimming) and a Wahl multipiece, in case you want to go to work for Supercuts.  Ah, the old Costco curse--buy it when you see it--it may not be there by the time you circle the warehouse!  BUT, I went home, ordered from AMAZON about 8PM and it was (no joke!) on my doorstep at 10AM the next morning with free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1.  No stand---not a con for me---I like an uncluttered counter.  My old one HAD to charge in the stand, so I left it out sitting.  This one I just put in the drawer.&lt;br /&gt;2.  No multiple attachments--again, not a con for me.  I didn&#x27;t want a combination can opener- beard trimmer, or a bag of attachments, or a stand where they always fall off.  I suppose a nose hair trimmer would be nice, but I don&#x27;t need one.  And then, you would lose the simplicity of the rotating permanently attached head.  Just pick up a nose hair trimmer guys. Amazon has them for as low as $7.75 (Wahl) and Hammacher Schlemmer has what looks like an amazing one for $20 if you have barbed wire growing out of your nose.  I was just genetically blessed with no back hair or nose hair--but I can empathize!&lt;br /&gt;3.  No laser.  Really guys, a laser!I&#x27;m a gadget guy, but even I couldn&#x27;t see the use of that!  Well maybe if I had multiple weird beard/goatee angles.  But then I&#x27;d feel like keeping it in my tool box, and who wants to run to the garage every time you need a shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion---are there better trimmers out there?  I don&#x27;t know, maybe, but I can&#x27;t imagine a simpler one that does such a great job---oh did I say it was powerful too?  I do have to say I was a little curious to see what Norelco&#x27;s $200 beard trimmer must be like, but not curious enough to lay out that kind of money.  this one is just perfect.</li>
            <li> My family lineage traces back to Spanish and German roots and as a result I can grow a thick fuzzy beard in about the time it takes to brew a good cup of coffee. I typically grow out a beard for the winter months and in the past have relied on a pair of Wahl clippers and plain-old scissors for my beard trimming needs. I&#x27;ve used the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 series beard trimmer for exactly 3 trimmings over as many weeks and am quite pleased with the results and ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;THE TRIMMER &amp; WHAT&#x27;S IN THE BOX:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing I noticed when looking at both pictures and the actual trimmer (still in the box) is the digital readout. Well, after unboxing the trimmer I was a bit disappointed to learn that the digital readout is really just a clever looking sticker that indicates the beard trimmer settings. The bonus of course is that you&#x27;re not wasting precious battery life powering a digital display. The middle part of the trimmer (digital display sticker and the rubber-looking grip directly beneath) actually rotates and adjusts the cutting blades. Increments are in millimeters and range from 10mm down to 0.4mm. A full listing of cutting increments (all in mm): 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. and 10mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power button is located directly beneath the rotating bit and is a matte-blue plastic button. The trimmer includes a standard metal cutting edge and plate. One plastic comb attachment is included and fits over the metal cutting edge and snaps down into the top of the trimmer. Everything feels nice and sturdy with no wobbly pieces or chintzy feeling plastics. The back of the trimmer has a rubber gill area where the thumb rests for extra grip and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is of course an included charger but no base. The charger just plugs into the bottom of the trimmer meaning that you&#x27;ll likely not store this out on your bathroom countertop in-between uses. There is one small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap what&#x27;s in the box:&lt;br /&gt;(1) Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;(2) AC adapter&lt;br /&gt;(3) Plastic comb attachment&lt;br /&gt;(4) Small cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;USING THE TRIMMER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I liked about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s really a good size for trimming beards. Since I&#x27;d been using a Wahl clipper set I was accustomed to just not being able to trim my entire beard and have to go back with scissors to get hard to reach areas like my upper lip. Not the case at all with this trimmer. Since the entire head (metal cutting part) can rotate and the back-size of the trimmer is a smaller detailed cutting blade trimming my upper lip and other small areas is much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic comb attachment is the only part that snaps on/off and is very easy to get on/off thanks to two included plastic guide legs that fit into the top portion of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 10 seconds first time using this trimmer to get the right adjustment for trimming my beard. Meaning that it&#x27;s really a simple thing. The adjuster takes all the guesswork out of exactly what length you&#x27;re trimming at. Once going the trimmer made short work of my very full beard and had me back to presentable in less than 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco claim that the battery will fully charge in 1 hour and give you the same in cordless trimming time. I haven&#x27;t tested this theory but have shaved on two consecutive weeks without charging in-between with no loss in trimming power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I dry trim this trimmer is also fully capable of trimming a damp to wet beard. Additionally the blades are fully washable. Don&#x27;t take that to mean that the trimmer is waterproof though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;HIGH MARKS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) An affordable cordless trimmer that does an excellent and consistent job cutting even thick beards; no hair pulling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) Attractive and more importantly practical design; the trimmer adjustment display is a great idea that takes the guesswork out of trimming your beard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) Wet or dry trimming and also sink-washable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) Cutting head rotates for access to a detail blade (smaller cutting area) making the entire beard area accessible by this trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) Charges in and hour and nets the same amount of trimming time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) Seems to do an excellent job trimming without the need for a lot of passes with the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;WHAT COULD BE BETTER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(-) No travel bag or base charger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my old beard trimmer for probably 2 years and was immediately wowed after switching to this one. I had that instant feeling of being significantly upgraded. The motor is extremely powerful, but does not leave my sensitive skin blotchy and red. It WILL cut you, though, if you&#x27;re not careful. I&#x27;ve only had it happen once, in the awkward area around my Adam&#x27;s apple, but let&#x27;s just say I learned my lesson. Also, don&#x27;t even try using this for more &#x27;personal&#x27; areas. You&#x27;ll end up a bloody mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance and cleaning is a breeze, charging is lightning fast, the motor is quiet (a huge plus when you&#x27;re shaving in the early morning). Thanks to that perky motor, shaving is also much faster than usual. I probably spend half the time shaving as I used to. You can rinse it under the faucet. It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I think this is a great shaver at a middle-range price point. If you&#x27;re willing to spend some more you might get some bonus attachments and maybe a vacuum feature, but otherwise I couldn&#x27;t imagine a blade any better than this one. Time will tell if it&#x27;s a truly high quality product, but out of the box and about 2 weeks in, I&#x27;m still as happy as ever. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok trimmer, but it could could better than it does.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this trimmer for the last month on his goatee, and we&#x27;re very happy with its performance.  No tugging, and it keeps its charge for a long time.  I&#x27;ve also used it to clean up hubby&#x27;s hairline on the back of his neck and his sideburns and it works great for that too.  This is a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> My husband prides himself on keeping his beard and facial hair trimmed professionally, this trimmer does the job very well and my husband has had nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> The shave level would not adjust</li>
            <li> Simply great as it is very efficient and powerful tool. Precision trimmer is also razor sharp. I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome. I have bought countless trimmers and every other one has been a failure. I have had my norelco for three months and I still haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet. Definitely worth  the buy.</li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer after reading many reviews of many trimmers. I have had terrible luck with 2 remington trimmers. Both had terrible battery life. Both had flimsy attachments that kept coming off the trimmer head. This Philips really does a great job for me. The trimmer is solidly  built. The setting wheel locks in your setting with ease. The ability to swivel the cutting head to trim your mustache is excellent. The complaints about problems getting the comb off the cutting head are easily solved by setting the adjustment head to the highest setting. The comb will then slip off with ease. I hve no problem resetting my personal setting after reattaching the comb. The motor is quieter than my previous trimmers and the bttery fife is much better. Th ability to operate while corded with the charger is a plus. I have a mustache and goatee that I keep short. Someone with a full thick beard or a person wanting a super close trim may have  different  opinions, but for me this trimmer is definately a 5 star.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. It shaves very nicely. I also like the detailer, it&#x27;s very accurate.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loves it!  It does exactly what he wants it to, loves that he doesn&#x27;t need 10 attachments and that it stays charged for a long time, gets the job done is seconds, literally!</li>
            <li> I had trimmers before but they all were 110 Volts hence I could never charge them while abroad but this one is multi voltage.&lt;br /&gt;The control and adjustment settings are perfect as well. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> The best stubble beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. Many different settings and long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> The titanium trimmer head is hard and cold against your face. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of trimmers, and this was was sent straight back for a refund. Also note the &#x27;LCD&#x27; is actually just a sticker that looks like an LCD. The head is also narrow so gets less work done in each pass. I recommend a plastic comb trimmer like the Conair i-Stubble (non LCD version).</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Easy to use with a lot of adjsutments</li>
            <li> The Trimmer itself is great and works as expected but for the price i&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t come with many attachments like the earlier philips top trimmer that i bought.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old-old Norelco (with the vacuum to suck up my shorn whiskers) and my third Norelco trimmer. This one is quieter, FAR less irritating to the skin (pretty much zero irritation), and charges seem to last forever! The rotate around head that goes from wide trim to detail is extremely convenient--especially for travel. The ONLY reason I took away a star is that I saw today that the released a new unit for whole-head grooming that I might like better! Not enough to return this one in order to get it, but certainly enough to leave room open for that 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this one. It cuts without the adjuster on. However, with the height adjuster, it&#x27;s miserable.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my Wahl Lithium Ion trimmer and it&#x27;s Solid. The design and functionality are an upgrade from the Wahl. The 17 Built-in length settings are great bc you don&#x27;t have to fumble around looking for the right guard. The coolest part about these trimmers is the Dual-sided head. The small detailing side is perfect for close spots around your mouth and sideburns, while the large trimming side gets the rest. You just turn the head to which blade you need and you&#x27;re set. The settings do look like an LED screen but it&#x27;s just a simple dial. The guard is much stronger than regular guards and easy to remove. The battery life is great and it charges very quickly. I&#x27;ve charged it once out of the box and it hasn&#x27;t skipped a beat. The fully washable feature is nice but I wouldn&#x27;t take this into the shower. My biggest complaint with this trimmer is it didn&#x27;t come with any kind of case, but not to worry I found one on Amazon. The Eagle Creek X-Small case was a great fit, including the charger and the color matched perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great, keeps a charge for a long time</li>
            <li> -Clean with running water (this is why I bought it)&lt;br /&gt;-No attachments! Just one sliding guide&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomic, easy to use design&lt;br /&gt;-Relatively sturdy and robust&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is excellent for beard / body trimming. It is simple (no excess attachments floating around!), yet highly effective - all other trimmers have failed to achieve this yet to date. I have owned trimmers by Remington, Wahl, and Panasonic, and they all suck compared to this. You will not get a super-close shave, granted, but it does its job otherwise.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but the motor seems to struggle frequently.  The comb seems cheaply constructed.  It takes many more passes to get a consistent trim with this than the old groomsman that I had for about 10 years.  I do like that it has the option to be used while connected to power (in case the batteries run out) and it can be washed with water while running.</li>
            <li> It does the job I have a thick beard and it cuts through it. Little on the loud side.</li>
            <li> First trimmer I have used (over 20 or so years) that just did the job without pain, and without going over the same area multiple times. Even and efficient trimming.</li>
            <li> battery life is good razor is quiet, but does miss hairs...</li>
            <li> the muster head is too tiny .</li>
            <li> I loved this set of clippers, only one guard, but the guard is adjustable up to just over a half inch I think it was 13/25 inch but it works, my beard was a little thicker, but I have fine hair and it had a hard time picking up all the hairs at first, I just had to run over everything like 5-6 times, but when I say thick I mean like way too thick, lol. I am keeping mine and hope for a couple good years out of this set.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it I thought, &#x27;yikes: big&#x27;.  But it&#x27;s been comfortable to use and I&#x27;ve had nothing but good results.  Took it on vacation for 2 weeks and never needed the charger.  The only complaint I have is the plastic comb attachment.  The way it attaches and detaches combined with the cheap feeling plastic retaining clips doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in how long it&#x27;ll last with the frequent detaching and reattaching needed for someone who trims both beard and mustache regularly.  It could also be a little easier to remove.  I&#x27;ve pulled the blades off a couple of times trying to detach the comb.  But it&#x27;s a noticeable upgrade in usability and results over the one I&#x27;ve been using for the last 10 years or any of my previous ones for that matter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this trimmer. I use it for shaving my face as well as for cutting my hair, but it doesn&#x27;t perform particularly well at either task. The large blade is still too narrow, making the entire shaving and trimming process take longer. The narrow blade is actually pretty nice for getting at tighter areas, like around the ears. However, it&#x27;s not worth buying this just for doing minor touch up work. My older cordless Remington does a better job in much less time.</li>
            <li> Works great. Only part I don&#x27;t like is that a different (but not as flexible) version has the built in suction to keep most of the remnants in. So this gets a little messy if you have a decent length beard.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works awesome.  I bought a Wahl trimmer for my beard but the attachments stab your nose when trimming the mustache--that hurts!  Bought this unit new from Amazon and received a used trimmer complete with someone else&#x27;s hair on the head.  Disgusting.  What if the dude who returned it was doing some man-scaping before sending it back to Amazon?  Seriously Amazon, get your crap together in the warehouse!  Customer Service was excellent and I had a new trimmer the next day. Impressive.  The new one works awesome.  5 stars for the trimmer, 1 star for the experience, and average of 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Would not get this again.  The dial-a-depth trimmer is great in concept but the blades don&#x27;t cut as well as I expected for the brand name and on the lowest setting, I&#x27;ve nicked skin a few times which never happened with previous beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> Perfect graduation gift for young man with small beard.  He is starting  on his business career and needs the beard trimmer to make a good impression , by keeping his beard neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> I received the product and did not work ; do not turn on the light of battery charge and no less start</li>
            <li> By far the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Good stuff so far &amp; soft on the skin</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a lot cheaper than the high end ones, yet it still does the job nicely. There&#x27;re 17 settings to match your personal trimming preference. The blade can be washed by running under the faucet. This one, due to the low cost, doesn&#x27;t have built in vacuum, so if that&#x27;s a must for you, look elsewhere. The trimmer itself is very lightweight and it&#x27;s cordless which is a huge plus for me. Charging time is about 1 hour. Usage time is about 45 mins which is decent enough. Overall, not the best trimmer out there, but for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> My husband was leery to try as he has used the same trimmer for a few years now.  I knew it was time for a new one and glad I was able to grab this from the Vine.  He was pleasantly surprised how well the Norelco worked and likes the wide trimmer on one end and a narrow, detail trimmer on the other.  He also likes you can just wash it out and not have to use oil on it.  This is a great thing.</li>
            <li> I let my beard grow on just my chin, and keep it trimmed fairly short. My old trimmer died, so I was glad for the opportunity to try this model out. I have been using it for about a month, and am reasonably satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; The Good Stuff &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The blades are sharp and provide a nice, clean cut. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to be able to comment on the &amp;#34;self sharpener&amp;#34;, but time will tell. With a little practice, i was able to get a nice short cut (I keep my beard about 1/4&amp;#34; long).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The unit is a nice shape and is easy to handle and control. This is the first trimmer I ever had that was capable of being rinsed off, and I like the feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I also used it to trim some neck and sideburn hair, and again it does a nice job, makes a clean cut, and doesn&#x27;t pull or snag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The unit charged quickly-closer to 45 minutes than the hour specified. The battery life seems fine-I typically only use it for a minute or two, and it easily handled 30 trims before it needed a recharge. Little lights guide you through the charge/recharge decisions. There is no indication of amount of charge left, which is a bit inconvenient since Norelco specifies that it is better to let the unit completely discharge before recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; The Not-So-Good Stuff &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The height of the comb above the blade is used to set the trim height. There is a very large adjustment range-probably an inch or better to down around 1/8 of an inch. It takes a little bit of practice to get an even trim at the shorter settings, because you have to account for the direction of hair growth as you run the comb through your beard. By the third trim, I could get a nice even and short trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It seemed just about impossible to get the comb off the trimmer in order to clean it...until I discovered that it is much easier if you extend the comb to its maximum. The problem is that you have to remember your setting for next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Summary &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of &amp;#34;get acquainted&amp;#34; issues, I am pretty happy with this trimmer. It would have been nice if it came with a little carrying case for travel (and to hold the cleaning brush), and I would prefer that it used a USB plug so that I do not have to tote an extra transformer. However it does provide a nice trim for my beard, and it does seem reasonably well built. I hope the self-sharpening blades work as advertised. I can&#x27;t comment on how it works for longer length hair, but for me it is a great trimmer./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; Summary &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of &amp;#34;get acquainted&amp;#34; issues, I am pretty happy with this trimmer.

            <li> Great product. Love the dial for creating different length settings. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used thus far on beard.</li>
            <li> I looked at a bunch of different trimmers from a variety of ranges by a variety of brands.  Clearly I underestimated this particular challenge.  Very confusing.  Lasers, vacuums, LCD screens, cordless charging, NASA-grade batteries, wifi connectivity.....I don&#x27;t know about you but I just want something to keep me looking sharp for work (short beard, well groomed, stubble on neckline).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare the 5100 to anything other than my old clipper, which was a cheap plasticy junker purchased by an ex girlfriend.  However, if you want something with the following that will do the job, this is a pretty good bet;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Battery life.  Crazy battery life.  You do get 1:1 ratio for charge to use, which is surprising for a mechanical device like this.  The Lithium ion batteries are worth the hype in this device.  Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;- Convenient/quick.  Change of length is quick and easy.  Makes going from beard to stubble trimming swift.  Best of all no fussing around with clip-on length attachments that you will obviously lose yourself, or have someone near and dear to you throw away for no apparent reason.&lt;br /&gt;- Precise length control.  No fancy screens needed here.  Just wide up and down for length.  Job done.&lt;br /&gt;- Solid blade construction.  Seems well enough ground.  Definitely not what you might classify as a premium blade, but trims quickly with little fuss.  This is not going to nick you anywhere on your face or neck (but might do elsewhere...ahem).  .&lt;br /&gt;- Secondary blade.  I was a bit suspect about this initially, but have come to use it almost every time I trim.  A quick turn and you&#x27;re using a much lower profile blade.  Great for any stubborn hairs when trimming to a tight stubble.  Not necessarily as good at &#x27;precision styling&#x27; as the marketers would have you believe, but pretty decent nevertheless.  Like it.&lt;br /&gt;- Waterproof.  Great stuff.  I&#x27;m lazy and being able to multitask and maximize shower time is a plus.  Cleaning is also quick andeasy.&lt;br /&gt;- Corded operation.  When the battery finally does go, it does really whimper out - it just dies.  It&#x27;s a good facility to be able to plug this in and operate it straight away.&lt;br /&gt;- Price.  It seems that this has all the functional benefits of the Norelco 9100 minus a deathray &amp; 1080p, and costs about 40% less.  I&#x27;d say this is a fair deal at the price point ($50 at time of purchase).&lt;br /&gt;- Voltage.  Sounds like an odd one, but if you travel a lot having this be suitable for either 110/240V is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of other comments;&lt;br /&gt;- Feel.  Looks large at first.  Feels large at first.  Then again I suppose that was in comparison to the aforementioned ex-gf face mulcher.  Now I&#x27;d say I appreciate the extra size - I&#x27;d characterize it as &#x27;good in the hand&#x27;.  Somewhat textured back panel, rubberized length adjustment wheel.  Slick blue/grey plastic on front panel (aesthetic mistake IMHO).&lt;br /&gt;- Looks.  Generally with something utilitarian in nature like this I&#x27;m less fussed about the looks.  This does not have a fancy shell.  It&#x27;s plastic, but not a fall-apart-in-your-hands plastic, definitely firmer than that.  If you want a bathroom art piece that is going to be on show, consider something else.  If it&#x27;s going to be tucked away in a drawer, like mine, who cares.  Solid blade construction, reliable.  Then again, a bit of brushed metal on the front panel (instead of the cheapo-feeling plastic) would have made a marked difference on the appearance.  That might make you consider leaving it on show.&lt;br /&gt;- No extras.  Unit and power cable, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible negatives;&lt;br /&gt;- Length-adjustable comb.  Hmm...yeah.  I wouldn&#x27;t say this is as flimsy as some other reviews, but absolutely not a strong point.  I don&#x27;t mind having to scroll out to 10mm to get it off, but the material is definitely not as reassuring as the rest of the build.  Once on the trimmer I don&#x27;t see this being broken by anything other than an unlucky fall or some form of misadventure.  When off the trimmer, that&#x27;s a different matter.  Don&#x27;t be put off by this alone, but be aware of the poor material selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Adjustment Dial.  Weird.  They&#x27;re trying to make it look like an LCD display when it&#x27;s patently unnecessary.  Keep it simple fellas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall;&lt;br /&gt;Solid construction.  Decent deal.  Low on the bells and whistles.  Questionable aesthetic appeal, but as long as you&#x27;re looking sharp that&#x27;s all that really matters.  Buy this one for neat grooming instead of either of the following in the range:&lt;br /&gt;- Norelco 7300, unless you&#x27;re tending a nice big fuzzy hipster-mane.&lt;br /&gt;- Norelco Deathstar 9100, unless...well I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d buy that one.  The selling point seems to be precision.  If it&#x27;s sharp angles/straight lines you&#x27;re looking for consider a decent straight blade razor instead of a laser, or a five blade Gillettemonster.  I&#x27;ve got a couple of Dovo&#x27;s from the pre-beard days.  Those are properly made tools that are made to last, with a little care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.  I can think of a few things I&#x27;d change for me, but I think this design will make the most people happy.  Plenty of room for a longer beard.  Easy to clean, but not as easy as my last Norelco with the titanium blades.  In terms of power, it&#x27;s one of the more powerful than most, but probably not as powerful than the Li Ion Wahl.</li>
            <li> Know that this is really no different than the $19.99 trimmers. It is just that the head moves in 0.5 mm increments. The comb and everything else is the same. Save your money and buy the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become pretty interested in finding the perfect beard trimmer. I&#x27;m a guy who hates to shave, in fact my skin just can&#x27;t take the daily grind of shaving clean with a razor every day. I get irritation, I break out, etc. So I usually keep a nicely trimmed scruff going on all the time. That is why the beard trimmer is my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5100 Beard Trimmer is a good one. I&#x27;ve had a couple that didn&#x27;t wow me, and I still have my resident go-to trimmer the Philips Norelco QT4070. So where does this fit in? If you&#x27;re looking to maintain a decent beard then this a good one. It comes with an adjustable comb attachment to choose the length of your trim. If you go commando and want to do a close trim though with the bare trimmer then that is where it falls short. The Philips Norelco QT4070 is the best for that. It&#x27;ll chew up your beard quickly and evenly. Plus it has a vacuum to catch all the trimmings which is awesome. This does not. This trimmer gets clogged very easily if you don&#x27;t use the comb attachment, and I for one like to keep my scruff pretty short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this trimmer does well is precision. You can sculpt very fine lines, manage sideburns and all that jazz. It has a swiveling head and on the other end is even a more tiny precision trimmer. I can imagine if you have a chiseled jaw with a bushy beard then this puppy would be your go to. For me however, I&#x27;ll stick with my Philips Norelco QT4070.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming my dad&#x27;s beard for 25 years now, and through that time have used all sorts of trimmers. This line is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly quiet- not whisper quiet but also not a loud buzz. It clips very close where it needs to, and it doesn&#x27;t tug on the hair- just cuts it. I really like the attachment comb and dial up option for the blades. It means that I don&#x27;t have to keep track of my favorite clip on guards- just the one guard. It can be rinsed out. This is my favorite thing about this style of trimmer, just being able to rinse it instead of using a tiny brush to get hair out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used it as a clipper to clean up and shape my son&#x27;s neckline when giving him hair cuts and it works just great for that.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a nice trimmer after always buying the cheapest ones. My main problem is that my hair build up in the spacer very quickly, so I basically have to take it off and shake it out after every pass</li>
            <li> Excellent device! very precise and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The best beard trimmer on the price range. I have had the Wahl Lithium Ion All in One and Norleco QG3330. Beats both easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POWER: it has as much or more power than the Whal All in One, which is by far more than you need. Trims smoothly even the thickest beard in the world (mine is top 10).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BLADES: Do not hurt your skin like the Wahl does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAINTENANCE: No maintenance required at all. Just water it after use and every 3 months, detach the head and brush it. The Wahl requires regular maintenance which includes oiling it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other features don&#x27;t matter as much to me. Great purchase, strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. I bought it for my fiance and he absolutely loves it! the way it adjusts makes it impossible to slide down so you always get the exact length you want. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The length of stubble was a bit too long for me. If you don&#x27;t usually keep your beard too close it&#x27;ll work fine for you. Nice battery life.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. It is sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great. Might be a little over priced but I like that you can spin it and use it to trim your mustache. Great trimmer</li>
            <li> I am one of those guys who has a beard that can grow in less than a week.  I like to let it grow out occasionally, but hate the wild man look.  This trimmer is great.  I keep my beard very short.  In fact, you can get that shadow look with this trimmer if you are so include.  Great device, easy to clean, recommend it.</li>
            <li> After about a month the power button is very difficult to activate. I have to push it a dozen times to get it to turn on. once it is on the trimmer functions fine. Other than the power button the trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> Great for beard trimming.  No oil required and can rinse under water.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd or 4th Norelco beard/mustache trimmer I&#x27;ve had.  It may well be the last.  Previous models were excellent.  This one does not cut evenly.  No matter how many times I run it over the same area, I always end up using scissors to finish my trim</li>
            <li> Works perfect and is much better that other beard trimmers.  Finally!</li>
            <li> Seems to do its job pretty good</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Does exactly what it says it will do.  Sharp out of the box and a very well designed product.</li>
            <li> I have a short stubble-style beard, and I&#x27;ve owned a dozen trimmers over the years.  My last shaver had a wide blade, was bulky - resulting in an uneven cut, and it couldn&#x27;t trim my beard just below my nose due to it&#x27;s bulky comb design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is the opposite - it is agile, follows contours around the mouth well, and trims right up to the edges, reaching everywhere.  I don&#x27;t intend to use the swiveling head/narrow end much, but they are nifty to have should I need them and it doesn&#x27;t add any bulk.  I like the &#x27;dial&#x27; style design over multiple combs that &#x27;click&#x27; into place, as I tend to only ever use the shortest-trimming comb out of those &amp;#34;7 piece sets&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some people want a travel bag, but as someone who only occasionally travels and tends to just throw all my toiletries into a single larger bag, I consider it a plus that the box wasn&#x27;t full of a bunch of accessories for a landfill.  The box just contains a well-designed trimmer and a charger - just what I want my money going into.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer with decent battery life and quick recharge.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Handles my thick beard no problem. I like that it is cordless but if it is dead, you can plug it in and immediately use.</li>
            <li> An acceptable beard trimmer. Does not, though, give as clean shave as had hoped it is as described.</li>
            <li> Cuts very cleanly.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hair at all.  A bit tricky to learn how to set the depth gauge at first, but with a little practice, it is no problem.  Plenty of power and battery life.  This is my third trimmer.  First one used replaceable batteries and had great power, but needed new batteries too often.  Second one was a &amp;#34;first generation&amp;#34; rechargeable and had much too little power.  This one seems to be right on the mark.</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  Buy a Braun shaver, but not their beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s making accurate trimming, but little hard to use where the hair&lt;br /&gt;is not growing in the same direction.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used.  Solid and sturdy. Very well built.  Guide adjustment easily set and stays put.  Easy cleanup by rinsing under water is great.  Even with the guide removed it smooth across skin and never pulls.  I use it for body grooming and it works just as well as it does on my face.  Battery lasts a very long time.  No Brainer.  It&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Great design, good charge and price efficient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to have the full trimmer and the detail trimmer all in one. Like the ease of changing the trim length and battery has held a charge so far, but still very early. Will try to remember to update again down the road.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims. Nicely made.</li>
            <li> This by far the nicest beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve had about 5 over the years, with varying degrees of success. My latest one has a built in vacuum, which actually doesn&#x27;t vacuum anything and just makes a big mess. So I was eager to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a no frills, no nonsense, very good trimmer. The head has two sides - one for the regular beard trimmer, and the other side is super small for more detailed, hard to reach areas (e.g. under nose, ears, etc.). You can use either trimmer directly on your skin, and the tiny side gets really close, which is nice. The normal side is the same closeness as your barber gets when he/she shapes the back of your neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a plastic attachment for beard trimming. The dial is manual and starts very short and goes pretty long. It&#x27;s not touch screen (thankfully), not digital, just a turn of a dial. It&#x27;s super easy, accurate, and no nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It trims very well and consistently. It produces the best results from a beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaints are that the battery only lasts about one hour on a single charge, and it comes with a proprietary charger, which is unfortunate.  Those things aside, I really like this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Until recently, I had been using an previous model [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] which I got in 2011.  It worked well, but the battery was starting to show its age - meaning that the battery charges weren&#x27;t lasting very long.  In addition, it developed this extremely unusual problem where it would not work corded in my bathroom, but would work corded everywhere else I tried!  That drove me nuts!  That model also had the issue of the mystery battery charge as there was no indication of the status of the battery when using or charging the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Norelco BT5275 is improved over that previous model in many ways.  Most importantly, the motor speed is faster, so it cuts faster and it cuts closer to the skin if you so desire.  It seems to vibrate less and it feels more precise than the [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y QT4022]].  Beard and sideburn trimming are fast and precise.  They don&#x27;t show it in any of the photos here, but there is a hard plastic length guide that snaps into the top of the unit.  You snap that guide in, and then you turn the nicely rubberized grey wheel in the center of the unit to select a length.  The wheel is notched and it has numerical markings on it to indicate the desired trim length.  As you turn the wheel, you can also see the guide get higher or lower over the cutting blade.  This guide allows you to trim your beard or sideburns to any length you desire, quickly and easily without having to worry about making mistakes.  Take the length guide off the unit and you can make precise edges on your beard or sideburns - or you can trim your beard down to fine stubble to make it easier to shave.  The top of this unit actually rotates between the main trimmer and an even more precise mini-trimmer.  I don&#x27;t have a use for the mini-trimmer, but I can see that some people may find it very useful depending on the style of beard they have.  Since this is a wet/dry trimmer, you can use it bone dry or in the shower or just with a wet face, which I prefer.  Simply rinse the trimmer off and let it dry.  Unlike my previous Norelco, this one has an indicator light to indicate full charge and low charge.  It also seems to have a much better battery management circuit as the unit will stop charging once the battery is fully charged.  My previous [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] had none of this.  Battery life has been stellar so far, much better than I remember it was on my previous [[ASIN:B004QWST7Y Norelco QT4022]] even when it was new.  I&#x27;ve used it many times on a single charge!  The manual states 60 minutes of use from a 60 minute charge.  So far, that seems accurate.  Maybe that&#x27;s because this unit has a superior lithium-ion battery and my previous unit used a nickel-metal hydride battery.  Finally, this unit requires no maintenance and no oiling, so thats one less thing you&#x27;ll have to be concerned with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing I don&#x27;t like about it, and that is the placement and type of on/off switch.  The switch itself is a push-button electronic switch.  It feels mushy and imprecise.  I also feel that the switch is located too low on the handle of the unit.  You have to make an effort to turn it on and off, instead of the switch being located where your fingers fall naturally higher on the handle.  A slide type switch, located higher on the unit would have been ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this trimmer.  It works great, it handles well and keeps my beard the way I like it.prefer.  Simply rinse the trimmer off and let it dry.

            <li> His first impressions of the Norelco 5100 trimmer it&#x27;s high quality and suited for very close shave detailing.  Being able to adjust the length from 1/64&amp;#34; (0.4 mm) to 13/32&amp;#34; (10mm), with 17 settings in between, speaks well to the level of precision on the trimmer.  The charge time is only an hour and cordless lasts for about an hour too.  Time will tell how well the self-sharpening blades work out, but he likes that the Norelco boasts being &amp;#34;skin-friendly&amp;#34; which is possibly it&#x27;s best perk of all!</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I wish it would trim a little shorter.  It does trim short enough that it does not pull as bad when I use my razor which is what I was really looking for.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 Beard Trimmer works really well, is easy to operate and cleaning it is simple. This device also holds a strong charge for a while making it very useful. The fact that you do not need to oil it and can just wash it off makes it even more user friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trimmer is dual sided. You have the wide trimmer on top that gives a really nice performance and the detail trimmer on the bottom. This allows you to hold it firmly and make your trimming accurate and easy. There are 17 settings you can choose from when using it. This model does NOT have a vacuum, but for me that is not an issue. Just a note for people who do want a trimmer that does have one, know this model doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the Philips Norelco BT5275/41 5100 Beard Trimmer. It is reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use: the angle of the cutter head is just right for my face and it has plenty of power to go through my wiry beard. The beard height selector has firm click stops so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it drifting from 12mm down to 1 without my cooperation.</li>
            <li> After I figured out how to take the guard off the shaving head, the trimmer worked great.  I have been very satisfied with trimming the entire beard to a certain length as well as the close trim to shape my beard.  Can&#x27;t beat this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of different beard trimmers, but I&#x27;ve had few. This trimmer is definitely the best one I&#x27;ve owned so far. It seems very well made, and it feels good and fits well in my hand. And it&#x27;s a very nice looking trimmer too. The colors are nice, and it has a really sleek, high-tech look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance-wise I have been quite happy with this trimmer. I can charge it for an hour or so, and can use it about 10 times before I need to recharge it. It has 17 length settings, which are in very small increments, so I can easily set it to cut my beard to the exact length I like. And, unlike my last trimmer, this trimmer&#x27;s settings are very easy to read. And I can simply spin the cutting head around to the small/narrow blade to perform detail trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is also comparatively quiet, and is powerful and sharp, and makes quick work of trimming my beard. Cleaning this trimmer is a breeze too. There&#x27;s no need to fool around with a brush to clean the blades on this trimmer, I can just run it under the faucet, and in a few seconds it&#x27;s perfectly clean. This is a big plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a great beard trimmer, and it suits my needs perfectly. It has everything I need, and nothing I don&#x27;t. And, once charged, this beard trimmer&#x27;s battery lasts about twice as long as the battery on my previous trimmer. So, I&#x27;m quite happy with this trimmer, and I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about it. Consequently, I highly recommend giving this trimmer a try. And, if for some reason you don&#x27;t like it, or you find it doesn&#x27;t suit your particular needs, you can just send it back. However, if you do happen to decide to purchase this beard trimmer, I am pretty confident that you won&#x27;t be sending it back. I hope this review was helpful to you.</li>
            <li> I had a much cheaper, battery operated trimmer which was adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco beard trimmer is replacing it permanently. I love the adjustment dial and the fact that it stays where you set it. The shave is extremely comfortable and it does a great, quick job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also nice to have a rechargable unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback would be that there is no stand included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, a great find, worthy of your dollars.</li>
            <li> I am a simple guy with minimal needs, this is more than I could have asked for, I think I will have this beard trimmer for many years to come.  Easy to use, powerful, easy to clean, light, battery lasts a long time, and I can use it while plugged in.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer had sharp teeth that would dig into my skin and draw blood at the slightest snag or angle deviation. This trimmer has rounded blade edges, so it glides smoothly across the skin. I&#x27;ve really tried digging in, but I think it&#x27;s near impossible to actually nick yourself with this one. I don&#x27;t like using razors, so I just use a trimmer without the comb to get &amp;#34;close enough.&amp;#34; I feel like this is just a fraction longer than my old remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major annoyance is removing the beard comb. It snaps into place securely... too securely. So I use the trimmer daily without the comb daily, but once a week I&#x27;ll put it on to trim back the goatee. Once it snaps into place, the wheel adjustment is great. To take the comb off again, you can&#x27;t just pull it out. You need to raise the comb level to almost max so you can pull each side out to unhook it. Now I have to make sure I&#x27;m 100% down with the comb before taking it out because it&#x27;s a PITA to put it on and take it off again. I also lose my setting because I have to raise it so high to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Quiet&lt;br /&gt;-Quick charging&lt;br /&gt;-Impossible to draw blood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Beard comb removal sucks&lt;br /&gt;-Trim not as close as could be (pretty damn good, but my old one feels like a fraction of a mm closer)&lt;br /&gt;-No pouch for travel</li>
            <li> This trimmer is excellent. For people buying from Australia this trimmer works on 240v you just need to buy an adapter from shaver shop for $20.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco QT4014  stubble trimmer and jumped at the chance to try an upgraded model that also shapes the beard. Comparing the QT with this model in terms of mechanics, this BT model is much quieter, smoother to turn the dial, has a push button on/off as opposed to a sliding on/off, better charging feedback in terms of changing colors to give proper status, and, of course, this model is washable to clean under water as the QT is not. Even though the BT is more refined, it doesn&#x27;t always translate to better performance.  For trimming using the attachment, both work great, but I actually find that the curved QT model to be more comfortable and slightly more uniform using the same numerical setting as the BT; the loudness and crudeness of the QT is not a bother. Moreover, washing the blade as opposed to blowing off the few stubbles is not a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was a little disappointed with the two sided shaper. Being that the trimmer is fast, you better not make a mistake or there goes the whole look! I wish it had a speed adjustment. Also, the BT doesn&#x27;t cut close without the attachment. I found it smoother going and closer feeling to use my razer to shape my goatee. Even around my nose and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it is very well built and very refined. It works great as a beard trimmer, but as a shaper, it didn&#x27;t work for me. As a tool to give a rough shape before polishing up with a shaver, this tool will excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my opinion after using the device for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I happy that I bought this product by Philips</li>
            <li> Great Trimmer! I&#x27;ve used a bunch. No need for a useless vacuum or a laser guide, this trimmer just trims your beard perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using various Norelco and Remington trimmers over the years. I keep a full beard, so I need a trimmer mainly to shorten the length. The true test is when I shave around the ear area. Since I shave my head with a razor, I need the ear line to be neat and trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer does a better job than the larger Remington in the same price range. The Remington has a wider blade, and is more &#x27;multi-purpose&#x27;, but this is better as a beard trimmer. It edges well also (neck area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of nice features include:&lt;br /&gt;+ the locking function for the length selector&lt;br /&gt;+ ease of maintenance&lt;br /&gt;+ ability to use an uncharged trimmer by plugging in&lt;br /&gt;+ good battery life&lt;br /&gt;+ washable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the only thing it doesn&#x27;t have is a vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect razor for shaping and trimming up beards and facial hair. Would suggest to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a new razor.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve liked this trimmer a lot. It&#x27;s quiet and carries the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Weak and cheap, feels like it won&#x27;t last more than a month. It barely cuts hair. It mostly damages skin. I&#x27;m returning it!</li>
            <li> This has been with me to 5+ countries and works like a charm. Great for traveling the battery life is on point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first beard and first trimmer and so far so good. Forget about anything approaching instructions. Would rank in the top ten of the worst instructions ever. Nevertheless it does the job as advertised and as the Amazon reviewers described.</li>
            <li> Seems well made. Convenient to use comb. Easy to to just revolve blade from regular use to trim use. Nice little dial to adjust length of beard. Holds a good charge. No oiling needed. Just a nice unit, better than the Wahl I had which a short-lived battery. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Adjustable trimmer comb is a really nice feature, but it doesn&#x27;t cut very short without the comb (I realize it isn&#x27;t an electric shaver, but other beard trimmers or clippers I&#x27;ve used will trim shorter without a comb/guide).  Also, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of power and many times takes a few strokes to cut everything evenly.  It&#x27;s a little big to travel with, which makes the Li-Ion battery not all that useful... I think if it was either A) more powerful, or B) smaller it would be a better overall option, but as-is I can&#x27;t say I strongly recommend it.  Nevertheless, it does what it advertises and I&#x27;m sure many would find the adjustable length and thick vs thin heads to their liking.</li>
            <li> This it the best trimmer I have owned in years!  I owned a couple of the Norelco G370 kits, when they were available.  They were small and loud, but did the job and had several nice attachments, but I didn&#x27;t use most of them. The problem EVERYONE had with the G370 is the beard trimmer comb was very weak and broke easily, which pretty much made the whole unit useless for it&#x27;s main purpose.  This unit fits nicely in your hand, and holds a charge like no other.  I have charged it once in the last 6 weeks, and I trim my goatee and mustache about every 2-3 days.  The trimmer comb fits snugly and there is no fear of it coming off halfway through a &#x27;pass&#x27; in your beard. To remove the comb, I usually pull upward gently on the bottom part where it fits on the side of the trimmer, and it comes right off. If you pull from the top, it seems like it would either not come off, or it might be too much force, but popping it loose on the side works great!  I saw some guys complain that it takes several passes to get an even cut on their beard…..oh, really?!?  Unless you are a male model with the perfect beard that grows entirely in one direction neatly, I would say MOST trimmers on MOST beards will take a few passes to get a nice even look.  So, I might spend 3 minutes going different directions to get a very nice, even look, instead of 1 minute….darn!  Also, without the comb, you can rotate the head from large to small.  The large edge is perfect to do your sideburns, and the small one, when used slowly and carefully will easily trim around your mouth and under your nose.  The blades are sharp and precise, and are easy to clean with a quick stroke or two of the brush provided.  The outside wipes clean with a quick stroke of a towel, and it takes up very little room on my counter, especially to the G370 whose many parts were always spilling around the sink. The number setting are not digital, but are easy to see, and easy to adjust by just dialing where you want the length of cut.  Easy to find your setting by starting out high and working down to where you want, for your personal cut. When the Lithium-Ion battery does need a charge, the unit will blink orange to let you know. Unlike many trimmers, if you do run it dead, you can plug this one in and finish the job.  Although it does run and trim while plugged in, it will not charge while in use at the same time, which is fine. Be sure to charge it fully the very first time, and it really doesn&#x27;t take that long to charge when it does need it.  I really can&#x27;t find much to not like about this trimmer, and if it doesn&#x27;t fit your needs, for some reason, they offer a 45 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  Mines black.  Bought a little ConGon tear/nose hair trimmer, and this thing to do the rest - head, face, beard, and neck.  Works like a charm - battery&#x27;s good, blades cut close, waterproof for cleaning, and can adjust the shaving head from .4 to 1.7 mm just by  using my thumb on the roller/scroller.  Great little machine.  Comes with a bag not a stand.  Every stand I have has been useless...prefer the bag.  9/10 rating. E.O.</li>
            <li> Not the best at this price.  Battery hold excellent but had to pass over a few times for a good cut.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying a new beard trimmer.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how long I keep my beard since my last trimmer didn&#x27;t have different settings.  It turns out I like to trim to 3.5 MM to keep it from looking too shaggy since I work in an office.  The battery it great, it has plenty of power to get through at least one trim, I haven&#x27;t tried multiple to see how many it can go.  The shave guard it really nice, the last trimmer would poke me a lot but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to stab yourself with this one.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. I never had a decent one before so maybe I&#x27;m too easily impressed.</li>
            <li> I have only used one other portable trimmer and this one is far better.  It is difficult to understand the negative reviews here as I found nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> One of the best ones in the market.  I would recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li> 1 month- no problems so far!</li>
            <li> When I had to replace a beard trimmer three years ago, I have had trouble finding one that did the same kind of quality trim.  My old one was no longer in production.  This beard trimmer is on par with that one.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier a Norelco 7300 beard trimmer for several tears that worked well for me but I lost it while traveling so after extensive research  and deciding the pros and cons of this BT5275 I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Once the box was opened right away you could tell this was a well constructed trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Several features which are very impressive are the multiple beard length adjustments, next the double sided stainless steel edging blades work extremely well but be careful how you angle the edging blades as they are also extremely sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the reviewers claimed to be cut by the blades when trimming but it is just a matter of understanding how to properly angle the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer was purchased May 2nd charged just once, I trim my beard 2 to 3 times a week and  it is now July 17  and the trimmer still does not require a charge.&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very pleased this with beard trimmer !&lt;br /&gt;My only recommendation to Norelco would be to include a travel bag for the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Also the price from Amazon was very competitive thank you!</li>
            <li> great product, works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I expected better when it came to the size setting. It has a hard time catching all the hairs on my beard when i trim it. Somtimes i have to take the size setting off just to trim a few random hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Great beard trimmer but the setting on it is flawed.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. It gives you the perfect messy clean look.</li>
            <li> This by far is one of the better beard trimmers. The battery last for quit awhile. This trimmer does not leave your beard with spit ends like others I have owned. I really don&#x27;t see any negatives with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Well made product and the dual trimming feature is a real plus. I will agree with other reviewers that the dial numbers looks kinda of sill (so-called &amp;#34;digital&amp;#34; interface) but certainly not worth taking it down a star.</li>
            <li> BATTERY DON.T LAST VERY LONG</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a bunch of these for stubble trimming. it&#x27;s the best one i&#x27;ve used. very comfy on the face. uses outlet power or battery. so if the battery runs out, plug it in and use it immediately at full power. other models need to power up the battery before you can use it. this is much better. if/when the battery dies permanently, i assume i&#x27;ll be able to continue using it while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> Works great, love it.</li>
            <li> An amazing all-in-one beard trimmer with no oils needed to keep the blade sharp and rust free.</li>
            <li> Weak. Does not shave well.</li>
            <li> Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Nice design&lt;br /&gt;Only grip would be it doesn&#x27;t shave close enough in areas you want close...&lt;br /&gt;Not a big enough grip to not like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works great. The levels click well and stray in place. Charger is small and travel friendly.</li>
            <li> 1.excellent battery life and charge time.&lt;br /&gt;2.Holds charge when stored (shelf-stable)&lt;br /&gt;3. WATER PROOF (well least it can be washed under the faucet )&lt;br /&gt;4. Adjustable length with built in guard. multitude of settings as well.&lt;br /&gt;5. Blade requires no sharpening or oiling&lt;br /&gt;6. 2 blades, wide and narrow for detailed trimming.</li>
            <li> Son really loves this.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  Seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve only ever had one other beard trimmer. I was very displeased with it. It would constantly snag and pull. I stopped using it after a month or so and for the past 6 years have been clean shaven. I decided i liked the stubble look so i shopped out the best trimmer at short beard lengths and arrived at this. In three shavings there has yet to be a single snag. I love how easy it is to use. The depth settings are really nice and it feels good in my hands. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Rugged.  Easy to use and charge.  Holds charge well.  I&#x27;ve had it now for a while and am very pleased with it.  Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve bought over the past 30+ years.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations</li>
    </ol>
