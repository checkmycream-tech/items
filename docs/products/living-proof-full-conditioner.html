            <li>This product is great for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner for smooth, silky hair with volume.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of it, but I still like to get some nice volume.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, shiny and SO bouncy!.</li>
            <li>That seems to be the nature of most hair products though.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>Works even better if you use all 3 products together (the shampoo, conditioner and mousse)</li>
            <li>Just ok...  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten thicker and so healthy after using it for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the Living Proof products.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best lines of hair product I have come across in a long time.  </li>
            <li>smells nice and is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll be shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very, very light in weight, has a strong almost citrusy purfumey aroma, and works pretty good as your standard weightless and shine enhacing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Paired with the Living Proof Full Shampoo it seems to help with my issues.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, very straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great with minimal effort!</li>
            <li>Got it quick and saved money too.  </li>
            <li>I do not plan on buying more mainly because of price and that it wasn&#x27;t a miracle worker like I</li>
            <li>Super volume.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo and condition and love it - leaves my hair very soft and full.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I think I will reserve them to be used only for special occasions when I really need my hair to be gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Really like this product line!!</li>
            <li>and this does a very nice job of conditioning without weighing down and flattening my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but definitely worth it</li>
            <li>But, so worth it.  </li>
            <li>Even tho a lil pricey to me its worth it, I will always spend money on my hair</li>
            <li>It takes a week or two of use to know if it is right for you.</li>
            <li>I was one of the fortunate few to be able to buy this conditioner as part of a trio via a special offer.</li>
            <li>As a product junkie, I have tried many different conditioners and tend to know when I see a difference in my hair because of them.</li>
            <li>Love all Living Proof Products - especially their shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>This seller is quick and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>a bit expensive for my budget but great for special nights out</li>
            <li>I really like the Living Proof line of products.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t changing my life though</li>
            <li>but she really loves it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>and she already said her hair is much thicker.</li>
            <li>never had a better shampoo and conditioner combo in 30 years of life&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its slightly more expensive than what she was using before</li>
            <li>makes me hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>I can actually clean my hair, let it air dry and go out with zero product in it</li>
            <li>I love that it adds body without harsh chemicals - no sodium laurel sulfate in them.  </li>
            <li>This is more expensive than your usual conditioner, but such a great product!  </li>
            <li>Although I would consider this a nice/good conditioner, I certainly didn&#x27;t see a large enough change in my hairs volume to make this purchase based on what its supposed to work for, again.</li>
            <li>My new go-to conditioner.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li>and there are other products that will make your hair feel as good as this product and cost half the price.</li>
            <li>every time I use it, it makes my hair super dry and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I shampoo, condition, towel dry and work a little of the thickening cream through my hair and it looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very fine and thin hair since I was born and have been on a life mission to find a hair cleanser that does not make my hair frizzy straight out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I will look for other Full line products too as I need to replenish.</li>
            <li>much as I like the packaging and the actual product, I will probably not buy again.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>The Full conditioner does not weigh my hair down, it gives it body and shine.</li>
            <li>No more Frizz, easy to comb through ,and</li>
            <li>love this conditioner, it only takes a small amount to cover your head.</li>
            <li>The only reason it does not get 5 stars is that my hair seems to get really greasy by the next day</li>
            <li>If u have thin or fine hair this is for u!</li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair that is starting to thin.</li>
            <li>I can barely run a comb through my hair...</li>
            <li>but becuase I spent so much money on it</li>

            <li> I can barely run a comb through my hair...</li>
            <li> but becuase I spent so much money on it</li>
            <li> not bad... not good...  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and after using the shampoo, conditioner, and styling cream, my hair was flat.  </li>
            <li> It also requires so much less, for my short hair, just a dime or nickel sized amount to thicken and condition my very fine, and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I normally use a little bit of flat iron cream to style my hair with the iron but did not need it with the LP thickening cream.</li>
            <li> Developed by scientists at MIT, this formula is activated by heat and really does make the hair appear full and thick - only use a tiny amount - it&#x27;s expensive but long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is wonderful--and it only takes a little dab, maybe as big as a nickle, to condition all of my hair.  </li>
            <li> no matter how little I used it was still the same result.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling heavy and greasy</li>
            <li> A little product goes a long way and it does not seem to lose effectiveness or to build up over time.</li>
            <li> and I prefer to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being an extreme difference, I would put this at a 4.5.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on this or any other product in this line.</li>
            <li> little expensive but worth it for my Hair.</li>
            <li> Holy cow..</li>
            <li> It does not weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to waste product waahing my hair every day or even every other day.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d the shampoo, conditioner and thickening cream for less than the price of just one of these.</li>
            <li> a little will go along way .A</li>
            <li> A little pricey; but, seems to do what it says.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It felt heavy, greasy, and had no body at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this</li>
            <li> I have thin, gets-greasy-fast, hair.</li>
            <li> Myself, mother and even sis-in-law all have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Recommend for thin hair!</li>
            <li> I will really hate when I run out of these products as I cannot see myself paying 60+ to replace them.</li>
            <li> I tried this co-called &#x27;living proof&#x27; conditioner and absolutely hated it.  </li>

            <li> This product is great for fine hair. Leaves my hair silky soft without weighing it down. Totally recommend the shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever. My hair looks great with minimal effort!</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this product at all. I have fine, straight, shoulder length hair and I don&#x27;t color or perm. This product left my hair feeling heavy and greasy no matter how little I used it was still the same result. I would not recommend this product to anyone with fine hair. It was a waste of money. You would think the people at MIT would come up with a good product, but I found this to be too costly for the result. I&#x27;ll be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the promt service!</li>
            <li> I was one of the fortunate few to be able to buy this conditioner as part of a trio via a special offer. I rec&#x27;d the shampoo, conditioner and thickening cream for less than the price of just one of these. Holy cow.. this is amazing stuff! My hair has never looked this great before! It is smooth, shiny and SO bouncy!. I have fine, very straight hair. I shampoo, condition, towel dry and work a little of the thickening cream through my hair and it looks and feels amazing. I normally use a little bit of flat iron cream to style my hair with the iron but did not need it with the LP thickening cream. I will really hate when I run out of these products as I cannot see myself paying 60+ to replace them. In the meantime, I think I will reserve them to be used only for special occasions when I really need my hair to be gorgeous.</li>

Terax for example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like the packaging and the actual product, I will probably not buy again.</li>
            <li> my wife&#x27;s words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I&#x27;ve never had a better shampoo and conditioner combo in 30 years of life&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its slightly more expensive than what she was using before but she really loves it. I ordered her the 8oz bottles which took her a month to go through so when I re ordered I got the big 32oz bottles. She was very happy!</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and condition and love it - leaves my hair very soft and full. A bit pricey but definitely worth it - I&#x27;ve been very happy with all their products</li>
            <li> living proof are probably the best product to give your hair volume in the market I have try it all and this one is the one that works the best.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sulphate free product and this one is excellent for my hair!  I&#x27;m very happy with the Full shampoo too! I will look for other Full line products too as I need to replenish. It takes a week or two of use to know if it is right for you. That seems to be the nature of most hair products though.</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair.  Leaves it soft and bouncy.  My new go-to conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I use it with the Perfect Day shampoo. I have straight, fine hair that is starting to thin. The Full conditioner does not weigh my hair down, it gives it body and shine. I can go a day without a shampoo! I can also get a comb through it when I get out of the shower. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for smooth, silky hair with volume.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Body without frizz. Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product because my hair is thinning and was shedding.  Paired with the Living Proof Full Shampoo it seems to help with my issues.  I like the way it makes my hair feel.  The only reason it does not get 5 stars is that my hair seems to get really greasy by the next day and I prefer to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Shampoo and the results are just what i was looking forward to,No more Frizz, easy to comb through ,and my Hair does look Fuller.You don&#x27;t need much a little will go along way .A little expensive but worth it for my Hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product and all the Living Proof &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; products!  Can&#x27;t live without them.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best lines of hair product I have come across in a long time.  I love that it adds body without harsh chemicals - no sodium laurel sulfate in them.  I color my hair and this product has only enhanced my color.  It is also the best smelling fragrance....a quiet awakening to soothe your soul.  This seller is quick and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> love it. will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner in hopes to &amp;#34;condition&amp;#34; my hair--but every time I use it, it makes my hair super dry and clumpy. I can barely run a comb through my hair...I dont get it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey.  But, so worth it.  My hair looks so much better!</li>
            <li> I have thin, gets-greasy-fast, hair. I have a lot of it, but I still like to get some nice volume.  I only put this conditioner on my ends. It does not weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive for my budget but great for special nights out</li>
            <li> As a product junkie, I have tried many different conditioners and tend to know when I see a difference in my hair because of them. Although I would consider this a nice/good conditioner, I certainly didn&#x27;t see a large enough change in my hairs volume to make this purchase based on what its supposed to work for, again. On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being an extreme difference, I would put this at a 4.5. This conditioner is very, very light in weight, has a strong almost citrusy purfumey aroma, and works pretty good as your standard weightless and shine enhacing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I tried this co-called &#x27;living proof&#x27; conditioner and absolutely hated it.  I have fine, thin hair and after using the shampoo, conditioner, and styling cream, my hair was flat.  It felt heavy, greasy, and had no body at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on my dog.  I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on this or any other product in this line.</li>
            <li> Developed by scientists at MIT, this formula is activated by heat and really does make the hair appear full and thick - only use a tiny amount - it&#x27;s expensive but long-lasting.</li>
            <li> This is more expensive than your usual conditioner, but such a great product!  It also requires so much less, for my short hair, just a dime or nickel sized amount to thicken and condition my very fine, and thin hair. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has fine/thin hair.  Gives an incredible amount of volume!!!! Works even better if you use all 3 products together (the shampoo, conditioner and mousse)</li>
            <li> Really like this product line!! Even tho a lil pricey to me its worth it, I will always spend money on my hair</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin, wavy hair and this does a very nice job of conditioning without weighing down and flattening my hair.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon as a &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; item at a really great price.  Got it quick and saved money too.  A little product goes a long way and it does not seem to lose effectiveness or to build up over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of this but becuase I spent so much money on it I&#x27;ll use the rest. I do not plan on buying more mainly because of price and that it wasn&#x27;t a miracle worker like I was lead to believe..  Just ok...  not bad... not good...  ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Living Proof Shampoo/Conditioner, and I always reorder before I run out.  I always recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love all Living Proof Products - especially their shampoo and conditioner.  Recommend for thin hair!</li>
            <li> If u have thin or fine hair this is for u! Myself, mother and even sis-in-law all have thin hair. This has been one of the best products for all of us. Super volume.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use the shampoo also. My hair has gotten thicker and so healthy after using it for about 2 weeks. My friend also started using it and she already said her hair is much thicker.</li>
            <li> love it! makes me hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very fine and thin hair since I was born and have been on a life mission to find a hair cleanser that does not make my hair frizzy straight out of the shower. This is the ONLY hair shampoo/conditioner product that does NOT make my hair frizzy. I can actually clean my hair, let it air dry and go out with zero product in it and it&#x27;ll be shiny and frizz free. It also stays cleaner longer so I don&#x27;t have to waste product waahing my hair every day or even every other day. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the Living Proof products.  The conditioner is wonderful--and it only takes a little dab, maybe as big as a nickle, to condition all of my hair.  I will buy Living Proof products from now on--they&#x27;ve creally created a wonderful line.</li>
            <li> love this conditioner, it only takes a small amount to cover your head. smells nice and is totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> A little pricey; but, seems to do what it says.</li>
