            <li>This is an absolutely amazing scar cream!  </li>
            <li>With any complexion or scar reduction product, some have good results and there are some who see not difference or improvement.  </li>

            <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every kind of over-the-counter acne products, prescriptions, etc.</li>
            <li>However, this cream is like a very soothing lotion perfect for my skin.</li>

            <li>If you have any questions or comments please, feel free to leave me a comment!</li>
            <li>Hope this helps :)     </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more before I run out.</li>
            <li>love this product...</li>
            <li>My nose is noticeably better, but my cheeks have shown a 75% difference in 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and i got more breakouts.</li>
            <li>mostly my chin.</li>
            <li>Bedtime daub to scar mark it, and the next day he found blain to imprint desalination many, very good things, and recommended.</li>
            <li>ive been using it for 3 days and have already noticed a significant difference!</li>
            <li>This product has worked to greatly reduce redness and swelling and clear up complexion problems within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>and it has not been easy to handle.</li>
            <li>but I thinks it&#x27;s an easy price to pay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>mederma is available on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle, yet effective treatment for my acne.</li>
            <li>Now I mostly have scars and have been able to reduce the amount of new acne forming.</li>
            <li>my scars have faded significantly</li>
            <li>The scars on my cheeks have been significantly reduced &amp; some are nonexistent.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the more often you use it on your problem areas, the better it helps to fade old acne redness and scars.  </li>
            <li>But I have to report that it most certainly did irritate mine.</li>
            <li>I try a lot of products and most of the time I wind up wasting my money, but Scar Zone really works well.</li>
            <li>Good enough!</li>
            <li>This really works and I am glad I took the plunge to try it out.</li>
            <li>&amp; I think the only thing that did any good using this was massaging my scar a couple times a day.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product soooooo much.</li>
            <li>love this product and will continue to use it, to be completely honest, if you have any minor scarring youd like to get rid of, try this product!!!</li>
            <li>I am able to wear a lot less makeup and it has made me more confident.</li>
            <li>Well, luckily I have to use the reflective parts of my anime DVDs to see myself until mom puts another mirror in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Why will they say it is available and in stock when it really isnt?</li>
            <li>If it works though, I figure it is worth the cost</li>
            <li>Overall, not as fast as I&#x27;d like it to work but still a good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using &amp;#34;OXY Maximum Action Spot Treatment&amp;#34; now and getting better results with acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation, just keep your skin feeling fresh and stress</li>
            <li>We will use it till its completely gone and hopefully see better results at that time.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>I thoroughly love the other Sudden Change products that I have used, and I was anticipating an equally good experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>It reduces the scars and prevents future breakouts, and Keeps your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different acne products.</li>
            <li>if its pretty resistant, dont bother with this.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I am using and it works FAST!</li>
            <li>I remained skeptical abuot this product up until about a week ago, when the scarring on my face has greatly deminished!</li>
            <li>my skin was a bit resistant, but not that much.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helped too much with some pimples that I want to get rid of fast</li>
            <li>expect fast result.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t improve any conditions on my face, plus it has silicone in it and who wants that on there face, that clogs your pores.</li>
            <li>Reduces swelling fast now remember just because it worked for me</li>
            <li>Not bad-just I expected more.</li>
            <li>it does make your skin peel a bit if you dont rub it in properly, depends mostly on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>The Scar Zone treatment has helped to bring back some of my own skin color to my face and it definitely helps to manage my acne.</li>
            <li>and I would strongly suggest you get a single pack and see if it produces results for you; before you invest in a multi-pack.  </li>
            <li>this was an OKAY product, i certainly didn&#x27;t wake up the next morning with 5 star air brushed model skin.</li>
            <li>While the salicylic acid does cause some peeling in the top layers of skin, the formulation is gentle enough to use over larger areas without frying your face.  </li>
            <li>The first time it was shipped by Amazon directly.</li>
            <li>I am completely amazed on how fast this product does the job!</li>
            <li>However, my recent scars seem to be healing quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;ve been using Sudden Change for just about 10 days now</li>
            <li>She has minor acne and has seen significant improvement since using it.</li>
            <li>not mean it will work for you</li>
            <li>normal and normal skin is something I have never had.</li>
            <li>but overall I am very pleased and even surprised that a product such as this can actually work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item helped clean up my acne better than most, but did not really diminish the scars they left behind until about 2 weeks of application.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have had a very difficult time finding this item in my local pharmacies (even the ones listed on the products website/store locator), so I was very pleased to be able to purchase the three-pack here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Most acne solutions work differently for different people , having understood that , this cream is a salicyclic acid treatment and focuses only on ACNE and not on SCAR</li>
            <li>My personal experience with this product has been positive all around.  </li>
            <li>I first found this item when I had a sudden breakout on vacation, and I was amazed at how it not only controlled the breakout, but it really did diminish the redness in my T-zone area.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>It fades spots from old acne and keeps your face clear.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a loud fragrance which is a plus (severe allergies).  </li>
            <li>, my skin is so soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I still have a ways to go in terms of completely clearing my post acne marks</li>
            <li>The majority of spots are vanishing completely, and the darker ones have shrunk in diameter while also</li>
            <li>She has tried many different things none have worked well, or they work for a few weeks then</li>
            <li>Not only have my red acne scars significantly faded, but my entire faces has cleared.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve attempted to use other products with no results before, I&#x27;d say this one is well worth the try.</li>
            <li>Like some others I had high hopes for the product, but it clogged my pores pretty bad and gave me more zits.</li>
            <li>I am generally a fan of Scarzone products, but I don&#x27;t recommend this item at all.</li>
            <li>I have seen a dermatologist and gotten my skin clear, and then it all came back.</li>
            <li>Only thing that works for making my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I have used Mederma before with great results but this is slightly less expensive in my experience.  </li>
            <li>Breakouts were worse and red ares became inflamed and more irritated.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a long time on my old scars.  </li>
            <li>my scars are much less noticeably and it is really seems to be inhibiting zits from developing.</li>

            <li> I tried it for a long time on my old scars.  </li>
            <li> my scars are much less noticeably and it is really seems to be inhibiting zits from developing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any considerable changes, other than some gradual lightening.</li>
            <li> But some times, I feel a little headache after wearing them, I don&#x27;t know whether it is quite normal or not?</li>
            <li> This product can sometimes be found at a local pharmacy store or big box mart in a single pack</li>
            <li> But at least it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
            <li> I have used the product for about 4 months now and even though my acne scars/marks are still visible they are definitely less red and apparent.</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv for a long time, and it just never worked for me.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin that has constantly been plagued by black acne scars for years (especially around the forehead).</li>
            <li> The main downside is the harsh smell; also, the small tubes come only about half full, so it&#x27;s hard to get the product out from the get-go.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little worried I might have a reaction to the cream, but decided it was worth a try at least.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, and although I am not sure my scars are fading, my current acne is much reduced.  </li>
            <li> My teens had used benzoyl proxide and got so dry.  </li>
            <li> and it doesnt dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> B001ET7LRG Sudden Change Scar Zone Topical Scar Diminishing Cream, with Green Tea Added]]</li>
            <li> Overall works reasonably well for acne elimination, and it doesn&#x27;t have the terrible smell that most acne medicine has.</li>
            <li> they are less noticable now, but not a massive improvement.</li>
            <li> I saw dramatic results within the first week of using this.  </li>
            <li> This clears up the active acne and reduces redness and hopefully scarring long term.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very limited to what to use on my face.</li>
            <li> Never really saw any change.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day &amp; still have a few breakouts, but no further scarring.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a cheap product; I would like to see it be a little less expensive, however for producing results</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t get much product at all, so it winds up being expensive in the long run, so I have to learn to budget it.</li>
            <li> I agree that the only downside to this product is the size of the tubes and small amount of product in them.  </li>
            <li> Scar Zone has other ingredients in it to prevent that.</li>
            <li> My scars look like orange peel deep pores &amp; small slits on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Different stuff works for different people and unfortunately this product had the opposite of the intended and hoped for effect on me.</li>
            <li> i noticed after a few weeks the scars were deffinitely less visible and less red, mine weren&#x27;t acne</li>
            <li> i havnt used it for that long, but im going to use it for another month or so MAYBE not sure.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s about average.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that I am using Scar Zone and Proactiv at the same time and the two products seem to be compatible – at least for my skin.</li>
            <li> down side that other people have commented on is that there is not a lot of lotion in the container and it does smell a little funky...</li>
            <li> This product mainly works for scared skin and those of you who are expecting results for clearing your acne bumps are investing in the wrong product, I would suggest you use Pro Active Refining Mask!</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I hated looking at myself with no makeup on, especially seeing my scars staring right at me!</li>
            <li> Treats acne well but does little for reducing scars.</li>
            <li> but did did not respond and have not sent the missing tube.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works for me is Salicylic acid, but it can also make your skin worse by drying it out.</li>
            <li> It actually made my skin worse.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I just wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve written a bad review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to order this for the past few days.</li>
            <li> This is a usual acne treatment , I purchased this as it said it was a scar treatment.</li>
            <li> at all waste of money never helped just dryed out my skin alottttt it sucks also took forever to come</li>
            <li> I may try their scar elimination cream to rid my face of the dark colored scars that acne leaves behind.    </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make difference, at least on my case.</li>
            <li> Initially I purchased this product in hopes of fading the horrible scars from my last breakouts on prescription meds and hadn&#x27;t realized that in addition to helping fade it would also treat acne.  </li>
            <li> It really is THAT bad of a product that I felt compelled to leave a bad review.    </li>
            <li> It worked well on some pimples, seemed like it made others worse.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I had high hopes for this one.</li>
            <li> I would SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT to those of you who are suffering like I have!</li>
            <li> My last prescription from the dermatologist was terrible and after 4 months of waiting for the \\&quot;worse before it gets better\\&quot; to arrive</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy this product!!!!</li>
            <li> My acne started getting bad when I hit my twenties and has progressively gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> I hate the gel type since they get oily and icky.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work and broke me out horribly just within a few days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but still, i went through hell having 2 put make up on them every morning before school :(</li>
            <li> The price is a bargain and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It seems to be working. I still see the scars though.</li>
            <li> My acne started getting bad when I hit my twenties and has progressively gotten worse.  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of over-the-counter acne products, prescriptions, etc. without relief.  My last prescription from the dermatologist was terrible and after 4 months of waiting for the \\&quot;worse before it gets better\\&quot; to arrive I finally stopped using it altogether and began using Sudden Change Scar Zone Acne.      Initially I purchased this product in hopes of fading the horrible scars from my last breakouts on prescription meds and hadn&#x27;t realized that in addition to helping fade it would also treat acne.  I have extremely sensitive skin so I was a little worried I might have a reaction to the cream, but decided it was worth a try at least.  I have been using the cream for 3 weeks now and am completely amazed at how wonderful it has worked.  Not only have my red acne scars significantly faded, but my entire faces has cleared.  When I look in the mirror now without makeup I can actually notice that it is visibly brighter -almost glowing which hasn&#x27;t been the case for quite a while!!      I have not had a problem with overdrying as some reviews mention.  I agree that the only downside to this product is the size of the tubes and small amount of product in them.  If it works though, I figure it is worth the cost and why I still gave 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over a month. It prevents red zits, but clogs your pores in the process. It caused so many blackheads that I had to stop using it.     This is the first time that I&#x27;ve written a bad review. It really is THAT bad of a product that I felt compelled to leave a bad review.    I am generally a fan of Scarzone products, but I don&#x27;t recommend this item at all.</li>
            <li> I first found this item when I had a sudden breakout on vacation, and I was amazed at how it not only controlled the breakout, but it really did diminish the redness in my T-zone area.  While the salicylic acid does cause some peeling in the top layers of skin, the formulation is gentle enough to use over larger areas without frying your face.  In fact, the more often you use it on your problem areas, the better it helps to fade old acne redness and scars.  I have had a very difficult time finding this item in my local pharmacies (even the ones listed on the products website/store locator), so I was very pleased to be able to purchase the three-pack here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I ever saw results</li>
            <li> I love this product it is helping my acne and my skin is soft. This is the second time that I ordered this product. The first time it was shipped by Amazon directly. The second time by another company and I got 2 tubes instead of the advertised 3. I called the company and I also sent them an e-mail but did did not respond and have not sent the missing tube.</li>
            <li> My teens had used benzoyl proxide and got so dry.  This clears up the active acne and reduces redness and hopefully scarring long term.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my scar but made it flaky. I would not reccommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I started getting acne when I was 9 and now I am 43 and still fight it. I try a lot of products and most of the time I wind up wasting my money, but Scar Zone really works well. The only thing that works for me is Salicylic acid, but it can also make your skin worse by drying it out. Scar Zone has other ingredients in it to prevent that. I love how my skin looks in the morning when I use Scar Zone before bed. My skin looks normal and normal skin is something I have never had. The reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 is that it cost $5 dollars a tube and it doesn&#x27;t last very long...you don&#x27;t get much product at all, so it winds up being expensive in the long run, so I have to learn to budget it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different acne products. This one was like all the others - did not help eliminate or reduce the number of breakouts I had and it did not reduce or diminish any of the acne scars I have. I am very disappointed because I had high hopes for this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have ever used for my monthly breakout issue.  It fades spots from old acne and keeps your face clear.  It also just makes my skin look amazing.  I hope Amazon never stops selling this product.  I saw dramatic results within the first week of using this.  I love it!</li>
            <li> this was an OKAY product, i certainly didn&#x27;t wake up the next morning with 5 star air brushed model skin. it does make your skin peel a bit if you dont rub it in properly, depends mostly on how sensitive your skin is. if its pretty resistant, dont bother with this. if its not that resistant, then have a go at it. my skin was a bit resistant, but not that much. i noticed after a few weeks the scars were deffinitely less visible and less red, mine weren&#x27;t acne they were pimple ones. but still, i went through hell having 2 put make up on them every morning before school :( they are less noticable now, but not a massive improvement. i havnt used it for that long, but im going to use it for another month or so MAYBE not sure. going to try this mederma thing. mederma is available on amazon.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product religiously and swears by it. She has minor acne and has seen significant improvement since using it.</li>
            <li> I am completely amazed on how fast this product does the job! I been struggling with acne for YEARS! Then once I hit my 20&#x27;s the acne bumps started to subside, but what never died out was the scars it left on both sides of my cheeks! I hated looking at myself with no makeup on, especially seeing my scars staring right at me! So I decided to try this product out in hopes that it could cure my skin condition and IT DID! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I use it every night before I go to bed and sometimes in the morning before I put on my foundation! I bought a 3 pack on here for like $16.99 and made sure I stocked up! I would SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT to those of you who are suffering like I have! The price is a bargain and you won&#x27;t be disappointed! If you have any questions or comments please, feel free to leave me a comment! Hope this helps :)     P.S. This product mainly works for scared skin and those of you who are expecting results for clearing your acne bumps are investing in the wrong product, I would suggest you use Pro Active Refining Mask! That&#x27;s what I am using and it works FAST! (Buy it on Amazon for $5.55). Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I like this product for healing acne scars, and it works well to treat pimples on a daily basis.  Good enough!</li>
            <li> I suffer from cystic acne triggered by stress.  This cream is a relief.  It controls the flare ups and reduces the healing time of the scarring.  I wish I didn&#x27;t need this product, but I&#x27;ve thankful for it.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work and broke me out horribly just within a few days. Would not repurchase or recommend this.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t really work. I smeared it in my face-craters overnight, and in the morning it just left my peeling, cragged face unearthly, radioactive tones of red. Well, luckily I have to use the reflective parts of my anime DVDs to see myself until mom puts another mirror in the bathroom. (I broke the last one doing Naruto moves)</li>
            <li> This product did not help my scars at all. It actually made my skin worse.  Breakouts were worse and red ares became inflamed and more irritated.</li>
            <li> This is a usual acne treatment , I purchased this as it said it was a scar treatment. Most acne solutions work differently for different people , having understood that , this cream is a salicyclic acid treatment and focuses only on ACNE and not on SCAR</li>
            <li> I bought this item after using Mederma. I think it&#x27;s about average. I haven&#x27;t noticed any considerable changes, other than some gradual lightening. I do like how it doesn&#x27;t apply as a film-like substance and is actually a cream. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s helped too much with some pimples that I want to get rid of fast but it isn&#x27;t terrible. Overall, not as fast as I&#x27;d like it to work but still a good product. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to order this for the past few days. When I put it in the cart, it always say in stock until the final page after I review the payments/etc... Then it says out of stock. Why will they say it is available and in stock when it really isnt?</li>
            <li> This really works and I am glad I took the plunge to try it out. It is a gentle, yet effective treatment for my acne. I have ad acne since I was 14 and it has not been easy to handle. I have seen a dermatologist and gotten my skin clear, and then it all came back. Now I mostly have scars and have been able to reduce the amount of new acne forming. The Scar Zone treatment has helped to bring back some of my own skin color to my face and it definitely helps to manage my acne. I buy this in the packages of 3 or 5 - whichever I can find here on Amazon. It does not have a loud fragrance which is a plus (severe allergies).  Great product!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. I hate the gel type since they get oily and icky. However, this cream is like a very soothing lotion perfect for my skin. All my break outs cleared out and not only that, my skin is so soft and clear. I love this product. The best purchase I made so far. I have very sensitive skin so I&#x27;m very limited to what to use on my face. However, this product is AMAZINGGGGGGG! I&#x27;m ordering more before I run out.</li>
            <li> I supply this product to my friends at work and they are all very happy.  Give it a try and you&#x27;ll be very happy.</li>
            <li> With any complexion or scar reduction product, some have good results and there are some who see not difference or improvement.  My personal experience with this product has been positive all around.  Previously I had been using [[ASIN:B001ET7LRG Sudden Change Scar Zone Topical Scar Diminishing Cream, with Green Tea Added]] but decided to give this product a try for the added benefit of complexion treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a miracle product; however in my case, it has lived up to my expectations and then some.  This product has worked to greatly reduce redness and swelling and clear up complexion problems within a day or two.  Over weeks and months of use this has been great for reducing and removing most scars.  I have used Mederma before with great results but this is slightly less expensive in my experience.  This product can sometimes be found at a local pharmacy store or big box mart in a single pack and I would strongly suggest you get a single pack and see if it produces results for you; before you invest in a multi-pack.  This isn&#x27;t a cheap product; I would like to see it be a little less expensive, however for producing results I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now, and although I am not sure my scars are fading, my current acne is much reduced.  The main downside is the harsh smell; also, the small tubes come only about half full, so it&#x27;s hard to get the product out from the get-go.  I recommend storing cap-down.</li>
            <li> It worked well on some pimples, seemed like it made others worse.  Can&#x27;t tell if the scar reducing part works or not.  I&#x27;m using &amp;#34;OXY Maximum Action Spot Treatment&amp;#34; now and getting better results with acne.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work! at all waste of money never helped just dryed out my skin alottttt it sucks also took forever to come</li>
            <li> This item helped clean up my acne better than most, but did not really diminish the scars they left behind until about 2 weeks of application.  I may try their scar elimination cream to rid my face of the dark colored scars that acne leaves behind.    Overall works reasonably well for acne elimination, and it doesn&#x27;t have the terrible smell that most acne medicine has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very good my scars have faded significantly</li>
            <li> Never really saw any change.</li>
            <li> love this product...ive been using it for 3 days and have already noticed a significant difference! my scars are much less noticeably and it is really seems to be inhibiting zits from developing. and it doesnt dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I remained skeptical abuot this product up until about a week ago, when the scarring on my face has greatly deminished! love this product and will continue to use it, to be completely honest, if you have any minor scarring youd like to get rid of, try this product!!! 5 stars *****</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely amazing scar cream!  I have had rosacea &amp; acne vulgaris since age 10.  I have pitting scars on my nose &amp; cheeks as a result of damage caused by incorrect treatments.  I tried this cream as a last resort based on the reviews &amp; price..it works!  The scars on my cheeks have been significantly reduced &amp; some are nonexistent.  My scars look like orange peel deep pores &amp; small slits on my nose.  My nose is noticeably better, but my cheeks have shown a 75% difference in 3 weeks.  I use it twice a day &amp; still have a few breakouts, but no further scarring.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try &amp; I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make difference, at least on my case.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I&#x27;ve been using for a year to diminish my scars. It reduces the scars and prevents future breakouts, and Keeps your skin very smooth. I like it very much. Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation, just keep your skin feeling fresh and stress free.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect fast result. Apply it 2 daily morning and nights. Of course wash you face before applying.</li>
            <li> No difference in my acne scars, been using this for over a year now. And since I bought a 3 pack...I&#x27;m stuck with this. Since it&#x27;s salicylic acid, i just use it help heal popped blemmishes/pimples.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to do. I feel like I just wasted my money. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. If you want to try ..buy something like Clinique either from Macy&#x27;s or Amazon whatever is cheaper...cos that&#x27;s gonna work on your acne not this!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t improve any conditions on my face, plus it has silicone in it and who wants that on there face, that clogs your pores.</li>
            <li> Reduces swelling fast now remember just because it worked for me dose not mean it will work for you okay</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has problems with acne.  She has tried many different things none have worked well, or they work for a few weeks then stop and acne goes back to the way it was before.  She has been using it for a while now and it still seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> After a month, I think it working. But some times, I feel a little headache after wearing them, I don&#x27;t know whether it is quite normal or not?</li>
            <li> I like this brand, its flavor is very good, also made my skin very moist, I also will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I bought three tubes of it and am regretting the purchase. don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> When my father had a wound they had this at the hospital.  I thought, great!! this must work if a hospital uses it.  I tried it for a long time on my old scars.  I didn&#x27;t see any changes.  If you massage a scar it will help break up scar tissue &amp; I think the only thing that did any good using this was massaging my scar a couple times a day.  I didn&#x27;t see any miracle happening. For the money i want something that does something besides bringing my hopes up for nothing.</li>
            <li> I really love this product soooooo much. I have had post acne marks for years and finally they are fading away. I have used the product for about 4 months now and even though my acne scars/marks are still visible they are definitely less red and apparent. I am able to wear a lot less makeup and it has made me more confident. I still have a ways to go in terms of completely clearing my post acne marks but overall I am very pleased and even surprised that a product such as this can actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side that other people have commented on is that there is not a lot of lotion in the container and it does smell a little funky...but I thinks it&#x27;s an easy price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say that I am using Scar Zone and Proactiv at the same time and the two products seem to be compatible – at least for my skin.</li>
            <li> Treats acne well but does little for reducing scars.</li>
            <li> This product was only as helpful as that found at Wal-mart. Not bad-just I expected more. We will use it till its completely gone and hopefully see better results at that time.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly love the other Sudden Change products that I have used, and I was anticipating an equally good experience with this product.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  Not only did it not work for me, but it irritated my skin, and it took a couple of days for the redness to go away.  Maybe for someone else it might not irritate the skin.  But I have to report that it most certainly did irritate mine.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for both acne and scars! Definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> Like some others I had high hopes for the product, but it clogged my pores pretty bad and gave me more zits. Different stuff works for different people and unfortunately this product had the opposite of the intended and hoped for effect on me.</li>
            <li> It made my skin red and i got more breakouts. i saw no improvement. i definitely would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a minimum once a day for a month. I do notice a reduced redness in my skin were I get acne - mostly my chin. I can&#x27;t say scientifically that it works, but I notice a big difference in the redness, but only after I take it within 12 hours. If I don&#x27;t use it within 24 hours, the redness comes back. However, my recent scars seem to be healing quickly. I would say that it can&#x27;t hurt to give it a try for the great price they offer.</li>
            <li> The effect is very good, more than the imagination, amazing. Bedtime daub to scar mark it, and the next day he found blain to imprint desalination many, very good things, and recommended.</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for making my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin that has constantly been plagued by black acne scars for years (especially around the forehead). I tried Proactiv for a long time, and it just never worked for me. Luckily, I&#x27;ve been using Sudden Change for just about 10 days now and it&#x27;s already living up to its name. The majority of spots are vanishing completely, and the darker ones have shrunk in diameter while also fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve attempted to use other products with no results before, I&#x27;d say this one is well worth the try.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and again this one failed me. I am still hunting so if anyone knows of a good product let me know.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about a week. Haven&#x27;t seen any difference. But at least it&#x27;s not expensive. Like the package too.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all and it further damage my skin complexion.</li>
            <li> Awful doesn&#x27;t work!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy this product!!!! it doesn&#x27;t nothing but greasy up your face!!!!! Fail!!!!</li>
