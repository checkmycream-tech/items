            <li>The product arrived quickly, the seller followed up to be sure I was happy and the product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nicely done, Bee Friendly!</li>
            <li>It smells good, is light and makes my skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li>It is such a perfect product with amazing ingredients it really doesn&#x27;t need an ingredient that rosacea and eczema sufferers can&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li>Bee friendly is such an awesome company!</li>
            <li>Bee Friendly Skincare Face and Eye Serum leaves your skin feeling refreshed, smooth with a nice soothing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the serum, goes on smooth and makes my skin feel like silk.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a three starts because it is all natural which is a great plus to me.</li>
            <li>It makes my face super smooth and bright, I have received several compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels smooth and leaves skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>Love Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE all of the Bee Friendly products.  </li>
            <li>This is a super serum - I just love it.</li>
            <li>The morning after my skin looks so happy with this product, smooth and it has definitely made a difference in my under eyes lines since its so moisterizing!</li>
            <li>I reapplied after my night time shower and my skin still felt smooth with a light scent in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Plus it helps smooth the lines outs too.</li>
            <li>Very, very nice skin care, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It has smoothed out the skin around my eyes and along with the Bee Friendly night cream</li>
            <li>Perhaps Bee Friendly will come out with an all over body moisturizer &amp; body wash...and maybe a hair conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients in this product are recognizable, so I know what I am putting on my face and</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon Bee Friendly doing a search for moisturizers on Amazon and decided to try them out after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my diet, it&#x27;s the Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li>This is the third product I have tried from Bee Friendly and it keeps getting better and better!</li>
            <li>After one week of using the moisturizer and the serum, I have noticed that my skin is much softer and has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I bought these products and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t get any better than this Eye Serum.</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs into the skin so nice a quick &amp; leaves skin feeling soft but not oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love all of the Bee Friendly products so far!</li>
            <li>so you only need a drop or 2 at a time for a nice smooth coverage.</li>
            <li>and it seems to absorb quickly into the skin</li>
            <li>I have been transitioning from using regular beauty products to organic and I am very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t been using the product for long I think it is doing good things for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is organic, all natural and made with honey!</li>
            <li>Helps smooth out some imperfections like large pores on my chin.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny drop and it leaves your skin feeling great &amp; so smooth.</li>
            <li>Have used many different serums (mostly all-natural) and this one really goes the distance.</li>
            <li>I noticed it absorbed in almost immediately and left my skin smooth with a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>and I think it works better than my old primer.</li>
            <li>The texture feels very rich and greasy, as olive oil and honey are the major ingredients.</li>
            <li>Great serum as usual from this company.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t claim it has done much for the fine lines around my eyes as of yet.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will also try the other products in this line.</li>
            <li>Whenever I get an opportunity to try new things from Bee Friendly, I jump at the chance since I&#x27;ve yet to come across a product I haven&#x27;t fallen for.</li>
            <li>I see my skin firming up and looking more vibrant and alive.</li>
            <li>My Skin feels so soft and smooth and looks so refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>Not only do they use ingredients that are safe....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week, but am very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>Natural smell, smooth application</li>
            <li>Thousands of women all over the US are using BeeFriendly&#x27;s potent products to turn back</li>
            <li>This goes away after a day, but just be aware that you really don&#x27;t need to slather this on.</li>
            <li>The scent is so soothing and relaxing, as I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells, this has no bad effects on my sensitivity to smells.  </li>
            <li>But it absorbs very fast, makes my skin soft and hydrated yet never breaks me out, thanks to its organic nature!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t break me out!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to have found a natural and organic product that works so much better than any other expensive product in the market while feeling safe to use it!  </li>
            <li>There is no stinging upon application - it&#x27;s so gentle that I have used it on my 3 y/o/ daughters rosy cheeks</li>
            <li>You really have to shake it really well in order to mix the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to be more careful with it now.</li>
            <li>They are not heavily perfumed and are easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Serum is a modern interpretation of an ancient medicine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for two weeks straight, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I have not seen anything like it before, its not greasy and has a nice smell, definitely something I will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>I am also using the Bee Friendly deep hydrating decollete cream.</li>
            <li>Have tried all three Bee Friendly skin care products -- this, the regular skin cream and the nighttime formulation.</li>
            <li>Bee Friendly products are the first I have tried in a long time that actually live up to their promise.  </li>
            <li>My face is soft and smooth and looks years younger</li>
            <li>It is good for dry skin, but that&#x27;s all, and for the price, not worth it.</li>
            <li>All of their products are high quality</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend..</li>
            <li>Would recommend this product to anyone that wants soft and supple skin.  </li>
            <li>I guess when you use natural products, you can&#x27;t really go wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This serum is made up of a powerful mixture of Organic Oils &amp; beeswax with propolis and pollen, Royal Jelly and Essential oils.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and the serum has given it a soft smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>Skin absorbs it very quickly and a tiny amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft with all of their products!</li>
            <li>It is now part of my morning regiment along with other Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I can save it it has eliminated or reduced any wrinkles, But I love the way that it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I was trying many different products and starting to get concerned that my dry skin could not be helped.</li>
            <li>This serum makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s one of those natural beauty products out there that&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li>Really saw a big change to the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Really like this and will be adding this to my daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s all natural, organic and will leave your skin feeling and looking refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so far soooo please keep the products coming.</li>
            <li>Time will tell if it actually helps repair the ravages of time (and tiny children) but it makes my evening routine feel like a mini spa day and for that it is worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light, non greasy, just a little dab goes a long way as it liquifies with the warmth of your skin.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is very different than other serums; it&#x27;s much more fluid.  </li>
            <li>using it on your face, make sure you use a very small amount, if not, you will have a greasy face.</li>
            <li>very thick texture will not run easily, I like that, use it under my eyes and around the jawline and on my forehead, seem to really like the serum so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and starting to see the fine lines and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>I love the delicate smell of witch hazel, too!</li>
            <li>This serum goes on smooth without a greasy feel and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Bare minimum scent.</li>
            <li>I did not break out and it left my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes to absorb, but to wake up with skin that doesn&#x27;t feel dry is worth that.</li>
            <li>It works excellently, a little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s a very reasonable price.</li>

            <li> It is such a perfect product with amazing ingredients it really doesn&#x27;t need an ingredient that rosacea and eczema sufferers can&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li> Bee friendly is such an awesome company!</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly Skincare Face and Eye Serum leaves your skin feeling refreshed, smooth with a nice soothing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the serum, goes on smooth and makes my skin feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a three starts because it is all natural which is a great plus to me.</li>
            <li> It makes my face super smooth and bright, I have received several compliments on how great my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels smooth and leaves skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> Love Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE all of the Bee Friendly products.  </li>
            <li> This is a super serum - I just love it.</li>
            <li> The morning after my skin looks so happy with this product, smooth and it has definitely made a difference in my under eyes lines since its so moisterizing!</li>
            <li> I reapplied after my night time shower and my skin still felt smooth with a light scent in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Plus it helps smooth the lines outs too.</li>
            <li> Very, very nice skin care, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It has smoothed out the skin around my eyes and along with the Bee Friendly night cream</li>
            <li> Perhaps Bee Friendly will come out with an all over body moisturizer &amp; body wash...and maybe a hair conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients in this product are recognizable, so I know what I am putting on my face and</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon Bee Friendly doing a search for moisturizers on Amazon and decided to try them out after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my diet, it&#x27;s the Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li> This is the third product I have tried from Bee Friendly and it keeps getting better and better!</li>
            <li> After one week of using the moisturizer and the serum, I have noticed that my skin is much softer and has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I bought these products and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get any better than this Eye Serum.</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs into the skin so nice a quick &amp; leaves skin feeling soft but not oily or greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love all of the Bee Friendly products so far!</li>
            <li> so you only need a drop or 2 at a time for a nice smooth coverage.</li>
            <li> and it seems to absorb quickly into the skin</li>
            <li> I have been transitioning from using regular beauty products to organic and I am very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t been using the product for long I think it is doing good things for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is organic, all natural and made with honey!</li>
            <li> Helps smooth out some imperfections like large pores on my chin.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny drop and it leaves your skin feeling great &amp; so smooth.</li>
            <li> Have used many different serums (mostly all-natural) and this one really goes the distance.</li>
            <li> I noticed it absorbed in almost immediately and left my skin smooth with a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> and I think it works better than my old primer.</li>
            <li> The texture feels very rich and greasy, as olive oil and honey are the major ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great serum as usual from this company.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t claim it has done much for the fine lines around my eyes as of yet.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will also try the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get an opportunity to try new things from Bee Friendly, I jump at the chance since I&#x27;ve yet to come across a product I haven&#x27;t fallen for.</li>
            <li> I see my skin firming up and looking more vibrant and alive.</li>
            <li> My Skin feels so soft and smooth and looks so refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> Not only do they use ingredients that are safe....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week, but am very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li> Natural smell, smooth application</li>
            <li> Thousands of women all over the US are using BeeFriendly&#x27;s potent products to turn back</li>
            <li> This goes away after a day, but just be aware that you really don&#x27;t need to slather this on.</li>
            <li> The scent is so soothing and relaxing, as I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells, this has no bad effects on my sensitivity to smells.  </li>
            <li> But it absorbs very fast, makes my skin soft and hydrated yet never breaks me out, thanks to its organic nature!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t break me out!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to have found a natural and organic product that works so much better than any other expensive product in the market while feeling safe to use it!  </li>
            <li> There is no stinging upon application - it&#x27;s so gentle that I have used it on my 3 y/o/ daughters rosy cheeks</li>
            <li> You really have to shake it really well in order to mix the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to be more careful with it now.</li>
            <li> They are not heavily perfumed and are easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Serum is a modern interpretation of an ancient medicine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for two weeks straight, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have not seen anything like it before, its not greasy and has a nice smell, definitely something I will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I am also using the Bee Friendly deep hydrating decollete cream.</li>
            <li> Have tried all three Bee Friendly skin care products -- this, the regular skin cream and the nighttime formulation.</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly products are the first I have tried in a long time that actually live up to their promise.  </li>
            <li> My face is soft and smooth and looks years younger</li>
            <li> It is good for dry skin, but that&#x27;s all, and for the price, not worth it.</li>
            <li> All of their products are high quality</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend..</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone that wants soft and supple skin.  </li>
            <li> I guess when you use natural products, you can&#x27;t really go wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This serum is made up of a powerful mixture of Organic Oils &amp; beeswax with propolis and pollen, Royal Jelly and Essential oils.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and the serum has given it a soft smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> Skin absorbs it very quickly and a tiny amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft with all of their products!</li>
            <li> It is now part of my morning regiment along with other Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can save it it has eliminated or reduced any wrinkles, But I love the way that it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I was trying many different products and starting to get concerned that my dry skin could not be helped.</li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s one of those natural beauty products out there that&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> Really saw a big change to the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Really like this and will be adding this to my daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s all natural, organic and will leave your skin feeling and looking refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so far soooo please keep the products coming.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if it actually helps repair the ravages of time (and tiny children) but it makes my evening routine feel like a mini spa day and for that it is worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light, non greasy, just a little dab goes a long way as it liquifies with the warmth of your skin.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is very different than other serums; it&#x27;s much more fluid.  </li>
            <li> using it on your face, make sure you use a very small amount, if not, you will have a greasy face.</li>
            <li> very thick texture will not run easily, I like that, use it under my eyes and around the jawline and on my forehead, seem to really like the serum so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and starting to see the fine lines and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love the delicate smell of witch hazel, too!</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smooth without a greasy feel and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Bare minimum scent.</li>
            <li> I did not break out and it left my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes to absorb, but to wake up with skin that doesn&#x27;t feel dry is worth that.</li>
            <li> It works excellently, a little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I only use natural skin products, and this one has similar effects than other ones.  </li>
            <li> It is not bad, but not better than other products I use.</li>
            <li> The only thing I want to bring up to be cautious of is that a little goes a long way - I tend to use too much because I overly worry about my dry skin and sometimes the excess will get in my eyes and my eyes will get red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true a little goes a long way, so apply a little &amp; wait for your skin to absorb it &amp; adjust from there.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because the essential oils used aren&#x27;t listed, and some essential oils are phototoxic so you need to be careful.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, though it sometimes takes a few weeks for changes to show</li>
            <li> am in my late 50s and ever searching for a line that is minimally chemical-derived, gentle, deeply hydrating but not greasy, non-perfumed, etc.</li>
            <li> After a week my skin was back to normal with no more rough, dry patches.</li>
            <li> I do advise that only a few drops should be used, otherwise your face will look greasy, especially if you are using the moisturizer</li>
            <li> Serum will not clog your pores, instead a few tiny drops will aid the overall health of your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to stop wearing makeup because the makeup just accentuated my dry skin and highlighted how rough and scaly it looked.</li>
            <li> I started having extreme dry skin issues about 6 months ago and none of the products I was using at the time were helping.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to use it around the eyes) and my eyes got really red and inflamed for a few days.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few skincare items that I&#x27;ve tried that I can&#x27;t get enough of the scent.</li>
            <li> I only used this at night as it&#x27;s too heavy for daytime use.</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly thick for a serum and disappears into my skin making it feel so so soft.</li>
            <li> and does it&#x27;s job with my very dry skin!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so I only used a small amount and let it sink in.</li>
            <li> skin is very dry to begin with and after being exposed to the rough winter we had in the Northeast, it has been drier than usual.</li>
            <li> It truly helps with the puffiness and dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> This line has reversed the drying-out and crepe-y texture of my under-eye skin that my previous product line seemed to create.</li>
            <li> It is a little greasy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
            <li> your skin today with lush bee products and organic ingredients and take advantage of the honey bees secret!</li>
            <li> the smell is not strong.</li>
            <li> Have tried several of them so far and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> But I broke out after a few uses and am not sure why.</li>
            <li> I had a couple of blemished on my face that I was not able to get rid of and after using this product for a week or so, the blemished flaked off without any redness or irritation.  </li>
            <li> Just try it, you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Works well in very small amounts on my lower eyelids.</li>
            <li> My cheeks had rough, red patches that looked and felt awful.</li>
            <li> I also have not experienced any break-outs while using this product.  </li>
            <li> but it is too thin.</li>
            <li> Works has well as expensive serums! AAAAA+++</li>
            <li> I did not also have any bad side effect.</li>
            <li> and I have never been disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My face looks and feels so supple after using this product for a couple of weeks! I just Love it! Even the smell is nice! I purchased a 2nd bottle for my Mom after she complimented me on my skin and she tried it! I am very pleased and will also try the other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Very light, non greasy, just a little dab goes a long way as it liquifies with the warmth of your skin.  Love it!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the serum, goes on smooth and makes my skin feel like silk.  I have not seen anything like it before, its not greasy and has a nice smell, definitely something I will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> Really excellent skin care serum -- gentle and super-hydrating. I love the delicate smell of witch hazel, too!</li>
            <li> The texture feels very rich and greasy, as olive oil and honey are the major ingredients. But it absorbs very fast, makes my skin soft and hydrated yet never breaks me out, thanks to its organic nature! Will continue using it for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  Find it is softening my lines in my face especially around the crows feet area.  The smoothness of the skin is incredible after uising this product for just over one week.  Would recommend this product to anyone that wants soft and supple skin.  AWESOME BEE FRIENDLY can&#x27;t wait for more products to be out so I can try them at the incredible price I received mine at.  Thank you agian.</li>
            <li> I love it! Bee friendly is such an awesome company! All of their products are high quality and I have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It has smoothed out the skin around my eyes and along with the Bee Friendly night cream it rejuvenates my skin over night. My face is soft and smooth and looks years younger (I am 57). Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Love Bee Friendly products. Have tried several of them so far and have not been disappointed. I would highly recommend..</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  Skin absorbs it very quickly and a tiny amount goes a long way.  My skin is dry and the serum has given it a soft smooth texture.  My lines look diminished.  I would definitely recommend this serum.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it; therefore, I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Great Product !!!!Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels smooth and leaves skin very soft.  But I broke out after a few uses and am not sure why.</li>
            <li> I love love this product. I have been transitioning from using regular beauty products to organic and I am very pleased with this serum. This is one of the few ones out there that I can really trust putting on my skin. I am in my 30&#x27;s and doing everything I can to take care of my skin. This serum makes my skin feel so soft. It took time though for me to see the difference, about 2-3 weeks. I am also using the Bee Friendly deep hydrating decollete cream. I think it helps my skin a lot between the two of these. I did not also have any bad side effect. I guess when you use natural products, you can&#x27;t really go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at a discounted price to test and review. I like the product a lot and I think it&#x27;s one of those natural beauty products out there that&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> My Face &amp; Neck have never looked better! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 Stars was because I couldn&#x27;t use it around my eyes - either above my eyelids nor below the eyes - since both products (used separately and then together) caused irritation. But using another Organic Eye Serum and then using the Serum + their Moisturizer. TRULY MARVELOUS!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. My Skin feels so soft and smooth and looks so refreshed after using it. I apply it and let it absorb and follow with the BeeFriendly face and eye cream. My skin love it! I am very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly, the seller followed up to be sure I was happy and the product is exactly what I wanted. It smells good, is light and makes my skin feel fresh. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is a super serum - I just love it. Smells great and ive noticed plumping of my skin already ! I use the serum with the night cream and my skin loves it. This is my favorite product from the line !</li>
            <li> Liquid Gold! This serum absorbs into the skin so nice a quick &amp; leaves skin feeling soft but not oily or greasy.  I put this on in the morning &amp; am able to wear make-up over it without the integrity of my make-up being changed.  I had a couple of blemished on my face that I was not able to get rid of and after using this product for a week or so, the blemished flaked off without any redness or irritation.  ...I also have not experienced any break-outs while using this product.  There is no stinging upon application - it&#x27;s so gentle that I have used it on my 3 y/o/ daughters rosy cheeks &amp; she did not complain.  I LOVE all of the Bee Friendly products.  Not only do they use ingredients that are safe....they actually work.  Perhaps Bee Friendly will come out with an all over body moisturizer &amp; body wash...and maybe a hair conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Really love how this serum goes on and makes my skin feel.  A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Works great, smells good, very light. A little goes a long way. A must have for any man or woman</li>
            <li> I ordered this as well as the face, eye and neck cream.  I use this just around my eyes.  I&#x27;ve only been using it about a week, but am very pleased so far.  It soaks in well, and I use it with or without makeup.  I will have to see after time, if it truly works on my wrinkles.  Love the scent, too.</li>
            <li> Amazing !  I have tried hundreds of products and have never seen such wonderful results as I have with this line.  I am so happy I gave this a try.  My skins clarity improved in just one use !!!  I can&#x27;t wait to continue using this. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this and the cream, but have found that most of the time  the serum is all I need! I have noticed a difference in my skin and find that this is better than any high-end product, and I&#x27;ve tried many. Don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else. Get this.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product/brand!! It&#x27;s amazing to have found a natural and organic product that works so much better than any other expensive product in the market while feeling safe to use it!  I use it at night along with their cream all over my face eyes and neck, my face feels amazing afterwards and the smell is so soothing and lovely! The morning after my skin looks so happy with this product, smooth and it has definitely made a difference in my under eyes lines since its so moisterizing! I have been getting compliments since using these two products on how radiant and glowy my skin looks! I don&#x27;t recommend it during the day since it&#x27;s a bit too shiny, but perfect for night time! My only wish for this product to change is for the company to remove witch hazel from it! It is such a perfect product with amazing ingredients it really doesn&#x27;t need an ingredient that rosacea and eczema sufferers can&#x27;t use! Please please please stop using that ingredient in this product!</li>
            <li> This is an okay product.  You really have to shake it really well in order to mix the ingredients.  The consistency is very different than other serums; it&#x27;s much more fluid.  I gave it a three starts because it is all natural which is a great plus to me. I only use natural skin products, and this one has similar effects than other ones.  It is not bad, but not better than other products I use.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working ok. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week. But I accidentally got some in my eye (how can you not? You&#x27;re supposed to use it around the eyes) and my eyes got really red and inflamed for a few days. I don&#x27;t know if I just had an allergic reaction or what. I&#x27;m trying to be more careful with it now.</li>
            <li> Have tried all three Bee Friendly skin care products -- this, the regular skin cream and the nighttime formulation. I have very sensitive skin, though it sometimes takes a few weeks for changes to show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall am very happy with this line and will continue to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my late 50s and ever searching for a line that is minimally chemical-derived, gentle, deeply hydrating but not greasy, non-perfumed, etc. This line has reversed the drying-out and crepe-y texture of my under-eye skin that my previous product line seemed to create. I can&#x27;t say it &#x27;removes wrinkles&#x27; but has definitely rehydrated my fussy skin. No reactions whatsoever. Bare minimum scent. It does take a few minutes to absorb, but to wake up with skin that doesn&#x27;t feel dry is worth that. I use both the serum and the cream, though often just the cream is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what a relief, to use a skin care line that has zero chemical hideousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicely done, Bee Friendly! Please keep doing what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition.  Although I haven&#x27;t been using the product for long I think it is doing good things for my skin.  I see my skin firming up and looking more vibrant and alive.</li>
            <li> Love all of the Bee Friendly products so far! Natural smell, smooth application and does it&#x27;s job with my very dry skin!</li>
            <li> sofa the best anti aging face and eye serum I ever have.</li>
            <li> Great serum as usual from this company. I have the day and night creams, both awesome and moisturising. This serum does not disappoint. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Really saw a big change to the texture of my skin.  Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> Works well in very small amounts on my lower eyelids. Helps smooth out some imperfections like large pores on my chin. A lot of moisture though, so those with oily skin, take note.</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed at the results of this product. By far,one of the best &amp;#34;bee&amp;#34;&#x27;utey items on the market. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making. ..love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Ordering/shipping all very smooth (seller asked for feedback if packaging was damaged in any way, but it wasn&#x27;t), and great product, to boot. Have used many different serums (mostly all-natural) and this one really goes the distance. Very, very nice skin care, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!! I have very sensitive skin &amp; this doesn&#x27;t break me out!!  My skin look younger when I apply this . My skin is so soft with all of their products!</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly products are the first I have tried in a long time that actually live up to their promise.  They are not heavily perfumed and are easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get an opportunity to try new things from Bee Friendly, I jump at the chance since I&#x27;ve yet to come across a product I haven&#x27;t fallen for. This serum is wonderful and may be my new top product from them. It smells amazing. This is one of the few skincare items that I&#x27;ve tried that I can&#x27;t get enough of the scent. It is surprisingly thick for a serum and disappears into my skin making it feel so so soft. Time will tell if it actually helps repair the ravages of time (and tiny children) but it makes my evening routine feel like a mini spa day and for that it is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> Bee Friendly Skincare Face and Eye Serum leaves your skin feeling refreshed, smooth with a nice soothing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum comes in a 1 fluid ounce bottle with a dropper for dispensing the serum.  The serum is on the thicker side so you only need a drop or 2 at a time for a nice smooth coverage. The serum is tan in color but does not change the color of your skin once applied. The scent is so soothing and relaxing, as I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to smells, this has no bad effects on my sensitivity to smells.  One I applied it I noticed it absorbed in almost immediately and left my skin smooth with a healthy glow.  There were no greasy or waxy feeling like in the chemical based serums I&#x27;ve tried.  Very pleased to have received this at a promo rate to use and give my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects of the serum lasted from morning til evening.  I reapplied after my night time shower and my skin still felt smooth with a light scent in the morning.  Really like this and will be adding this to my daily skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will also be recommending this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients in this product are recognizable, so I know what I am putting on my face and the smell is not strong. I do advise that only a few drops should be used, otherwise your face will look greasy, especially if you are using the moisturizer also.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry to begin with and after being exposed to the rough winter we had in the Northeast, it has been drier than usual. After one week of using the moisturizer and the serum, I have noticed that my skin is much softer and has a healthy glow. I am really glad I bought these products and highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product about a week. I really can&#x27;t claim it has done much for the fine lines around my eyes as of yet. It does have a pleasant smell, and leaves my skin smooth. An added bonus, if you rub some on your cuticles, they absorb the oils and soften them as well.&lt;br /&gt;When using it on your face, make sure you use a very small amount, if not, you will have a greasy face.</li>
            <li> very thick texture will not run easily, I like that, use it under my eyes and around the jawline and on my forehead, seem to really like the serum so far</li>
            <li> All Bee Friendly skin care if great! Have had the pleasure of having numerous products all perform as company states this serum is no exception. I am sure this will be my skin care line as it is with natural based ingredients that  perform well at fair prices TY!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Makes my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> All of Bee Friendly&#x27;s products I&#x27;ve tried have transformed my skin, and I especially love this Face and Eye Serum. I use it under their Face and Eye Moisturizer. I started having extreme dry skin issues about 6 months ago and none of the products I was using at the time were helping. My cheeks had rough, red patches that looked and felt awful. I had to stop wearing makeup because the makeup just accentuated my dry skin and highlighted how rough and scaly it looked. I was trying many different products and starting to get concerned that my dry skin could not be helped. I stumbled upon Bee Friendly doing a search for moisturizers on Amazon and decided to try them out after reading the reviews. I was thrilled with the results. After a week my skin was back to normal with no more rough, dry patches. And my friends have been commenting on how great I look. They&#x27;ll say, &amp;#34;You look so good!! What are you doing differently, did you change your diet?&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not my diet, it&#x27;s the Bee Friendly products. I&#x27;ve been telling them all about it and even bought some for my best friend as a gift. I also love that it&#x27;s made by bee keepers in Hawaii because I grew up there. The only thing I want to bring up to be cautious of is that a little goes a long way - I tend to use too much because I overly worry about my dry skin and sometimes the excess will get in my eyes and my eyes will get red. This goes away after a day, but just be aware that you really don&#x27;t need to slather this on. It works excellently, a little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s a very reasonable price. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Best Anti Aging Face and Eye Serum By Bee Friendly Skincare! Has to be one of the best that I have found. It truly helps with the puffiness and dark circles under the eyes.

Thousands of women all over the US are using BeeFriendly&#x27;s potent products to turn back the clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This is the best serum. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Feels great and hydrates skin very well. I did not break out and it left my skin soft and glowing. It is now part of my morning regiment along with other Bee Friendly products.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this serum! My face feels and looks  radiant! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> THE BEST skin care EVER! No reaction &amp; moisture all day. Thank you for making this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can save it it has eliminated or reduced any wrinkles, But I love the way that it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This Eye Serum is so amazing! You only need a tiny drop and it leaves your skin feeling great &amp; so smooth. This serum is made up of a powerful mixture of Organic Oils &amp; beeswax with propolis and pollen, Royal Jelly and Essential oils. It really doesn&#x27;t get any better than this Eye Serum. I will continue to purchase this one :)</li>
            <li> This is the third product I have tried from Bee Friendly and it keeps getting better and better! This serum goes on smooth without a greasy feel and a little goes a long way! It makes my face super smooth and bright, I have received several compliments on how great my skin looks. I started using it under my makeup and I think it works better than my old primer. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Just started using the serum and it seems to absorb quickly into the skin but it is too thin. I prefer the consistency of the face cream and the ingredients. The second ingredient of the serum is witch hazel which I am not a big fan of.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...... the texture, smell &amp; ease of application not to mention my skin feels amazing.  I&#x27;ve really loved all your products that I&#x27;ve tried so far soooo please keep the products coming.</li>
            <li> I got this at a discounted price through a promotion from the company in exchange for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture and smell of this product. It is a little greasy so I only used a small amount and let it sink in. I only used this at night as it&#x27;s too heavy for daytime use. I was concerned because the essential oils used aren&#x27;t listed, and some essential oils are phototoxic so you need to be careful. I contacted the company about this and found out that they are listed on their website. I also asked what percentage of essential oils make up this serum, and they didn&#x27;t reply to that question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for two weeks straight, I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin at all. I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and starting to see the fine lines and uneven skin tone. This didn&#x27;t help at all with those issues. I also used it in conjunction with their facial moisturizer some nights. It is good for dry skin, but that&#x27;s all, and for the price, not worth it. I&#x27;ll use what I have left and won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> So appreciate this product!!  My face just drinks it in &amp; feels / looks healthier after. Just try it, you&#x27;ll see what I mean. Ps. It&#x27;s true a little goes a long way, so apply a little &amp; wait for your skin to absorb it &amp; adjust from there.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Love that it is organic, all natural and made with honey!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and it has a very nice feel to it, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have use many of these serums and this one seems to work for me.</li>
