            <li>Great Product.  </li>
            <li>It is a great bargain if you are looking for a colgate toothbrush</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a 2-3 year supply depending on how often you change your brushes or if you plan on sharing lol.</li>
            <li>At this price, the brushes are a great solution when guests forget their brushes at home &#x3D;</li>
            <li>These colgate toothbrushes are a great value.</li>
            <li>I think this product is great for the price.  </li>
            <li>They do the job and are great for traveling.  </li>
            <li>A great bargain for a quality brand.</li>
            <li>These are a great buy.</li>
            <li>They are happy to use the tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>I tend to like a firmer toothbrush than my wife, but we&#x27;re both quite happy with these.  </li>
            <li>Great value, but</li>
            <li>For those of you who like medium brushes this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>So I ordered a ton of them from Amazon.com at a great price.</li>
            <li>Price was great and received them promptly.</li>
            <li>great price.  </li>
            <li>Although they are not the best brushes out there they are very good for the price and job they do as to getting you clean.</li>
            <li>Also, they work great and the grip feels good in your hands.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably not as good as an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>- I think Colgate knows how to make a good brush after all these years.</li>
            <li>working good item 100%  </li>
            <li>This would be a really good deal if they had the trademark club end on the brush</li>
            <li>so you can get a good hold on it while in use.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really good.</li>
            <li>they are good toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>and they are good quality</li>
            <li>these are a good toothbrush for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good price for non-bargain-bin toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I bought these because they were a good deal</li>
            <li>about a great deal - never been able to find a deal like this on toothbrushes in the store.  </li>
            <li>agreeing with most of the others, 12 quality brushes for $20.00; very nice.  </li>
            <li>but these Colgate medium toothbrushes clean just like I like -- in and around each tooth, leaving my teeth with that most excellent squeaky-clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are good strong toothbrushes that are good as just as any.</li>
            <li>The grip is great, it fit in the hand quite nicely.</li>
            <li>From Oral B for 5+ years to these inexpensive and refreshing toothbrushes I feel I have made a good choice.</li>
            <li>NIce to have lots of toothbrushes on hand.  </li>
            <li>They did come in handy for cleaning my weapons</li>
            <li>handy to have on hand for traveling.</li>
            <li>As a side note, the package comes in nicely and 3 pack is sealed in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>The price is great and loved having these delivered right to my house.</li>
            <li>So I am glad to have found this amazing deal.</li>
            <li>they clean my teeth good.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing too special about this product, but it is good for the price.</li>
            <li>Having a supply of brushes is very important to me.</li>
            <li>&amp; the slimmer handles are very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li>The store brand pack we had gotten before were better quality for a better price.</li>
            <li>I bought a 4-packer of 4 each and will give away most of them.  </li>
            <li>These have slim handles compared to most toothbrushes I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>This is OK tooth brush from Colgate.</li>
            <li>Okay brushes.</li>
            <li>All in all these are just okay.</li>
            <li>Buy more when stock running up for self and family</li>
            <li>My kids love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using them for a while! :)</li>
            <li>the price is OK  </li>
            <li>and they were much stiffer than I had experienced.</li>
            <li>And OMG, my teeth are so CLEAN!  </li>
            <li>I know the the people who lost all of their belongings will have appreciated these great toothbrushes to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li>fantastic and cheap!</li>
            <li>Good value, and fast shipping, which I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li>Decent toothbrush, not the best, but decent</li>
            <li>Granted, these aren&#x27;t the Colgate 360 ones that I usually love, but compared to almost $2 around here at CVS, Walgreens, or the supermarket, these are great to have on had... especially for guests.</li>
            <li>It is easy to buy online than go to shop.</li>
            <li>The toothbrushes seem fine, just like you would get at Target or Walgreens..</li>
            <li>They work fine and there are a bunch in the box, so I should be set for toothbrushes for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I am really cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still blown away by the price of each toothbrush, $0.70 is CHEAP.</li>
            <li>They are cheaply made, but they work, and the cost can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>It serves the purpose and is cheap.</li>
            <li>the brissles didnt fall out like a cheap brush.  </li>
            <li>Because they are so cheap</li>
            <li>These are great, simple toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>What can I say they are toothbrushes, however getting 12 toothbrushes for $8 is a great price especially for a name brand product!</li>
            <li>I am happy to say these are great toothbrushes and the medium is not irritating or harsh.</li>
            <li>This is not only the most cost effective way to buy toothbrushes, but it also allows us to easily buy &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And for around $7 with amazon prime, it was unbelievably worth it!</li>
            <li>These are good quality for the cheap price and come in many color if you have other family members to keep track of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about having a toothbrush handy when I need a new one or one for my house guest</li>
            <li>i live on my own</li>
            <li>but they get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth are now shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>They are cheap enough that they are probably good for sending with the kids when they go off to camp or something like that</li>
            <li>This multipack is as great value particularly if you&#x27;re a frequent traveler or often host guests.</li>
            <li>Great, basic toothbrush, for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>You get 12 tootbrushes in this pack, which makes the price pretty good as far as toothbrushes go.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value buy, but, for me, the heads of the brushes are a bit on the small side and don&#x27;t provide a particularly satisfying brushing experience.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice tooth brushes at a great price and we&#x27;re loaded up with enough of them to last for a while now.  </li>
            <li>Good Value overall.</li>
            <li>Good quality, and price; these will last for a while.</li>
            <li>no bad breath plus</li>
            <li>/&gt;This 12-pack is priced right, the brushes work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six to eight weeks that I use them...</li>
            <li>It falls right through my toothbrush holders, so I have to store it laying in my medicine cabinet until I find a holder that will fit it</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that the bristsles on these brushes are medium (as opposed to the cheap soft bristles).</li>
            <li>If you just need the cheapest vessel for teethbrushing that will get the job done this will work adequately.</li>
            <li>need i say more, their normal tooth brushes that work.</li>
            <li>Nothing good stays on the market long these days.</li>
            <li>I figure they are good to have on hand as spares if you have an unexpected overnight guest or if you run out of your regular brush and need to use them until you get more.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special but the price is right</li>
            <li>I normally always use soft toothbrushes, but the price on this was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li>Research shows that a new brush is much more effective then one used for several weeks.</li>
            <li>fantastic for the whole</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like these toothbrushes, but they are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li>I like to use fresh toothbrushes</li>
            <li>These are definitely the quality for guests who forgot to pack one of their own.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I have Invisalign braces right now</li>
            <li>Really nothing special here</li>
            <li>These are great for kids...felt somewhat too small for adults.</li>
            <li>and they are cheap quality wise with hard ass bristles.</li>
            <li>I had to reread the listing several times to make sure it was correct.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li>It is not lasting for more than two weeks.</li>
            <li>However, when I&#x27;m done with Invisalign, I&#x27;ll go back to using better brushes.</li>
            <li>bristles are perfect for me as I prefer a more stiff feel without the harshness of a hard bristle</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t believe when i receive these they were actually 12 - wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Most stores sell &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; which is nice during the first few times that you brush your teeth, but these quickly become flat and worn.  </li>
            <li>The lighter slimmer profile really feels great compared to many of those thick handles (sounds a little trivial) but their so much more comfortable to swish around in your mouth (way better than the standard styles &amp; why do you need that thickness, your not trying to pry something open, etc.?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t personally use these brushes but there have been several times guests have asked to take the brush they used home with them so that has to be a good sign,</li>
            <li>I am very anal about personal cleanliness and my teeth are a top priority.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to say that there&#x27;s less plastic used in the handles of these brushes (better for all of us!)</li>
            <li>Thanks, Colgate Extra Clean Full Head, Medium Toothbrush, 4-Count</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes were of good quality and although someone else noted that the handle was small, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that.</li>
            <li>A little smaller for me in terms of size, should of gone with the large, but otherwise it&#x27;s good for 90% of people for a good toothbrush, this particular brand has a pack of three, creating a toothbrush storage, so just be careful about how many you actually want for this price and shipping.</li>
            <li>Not recommended for large men, but good for small males, women and children.</li>
            <li>I prefer a firmer brush, and the firmness on these are nice and firm but not too firm, but more importantly, has had some staying power.  </li>
            <li>and I will never be able to pay $6 for a single toothbrush again.</li>
            <li>They cleaned my teeth really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, comfortable toothbrush that has made me appreciate its simplicity and realize the fancy shapes and rubber bristles, etc.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much about these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks ...</li>
            <li>Very affordable too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to think about whether I really need to replace the brush, I just do.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon Again.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t wear very well, and after a month of brushing</li>
            <li>It really makes it into a chore</li>
            <li>Which is great because I was a bit concerned that one of us would be stuck using all 16 toothbrushes - or even worse if neither of us like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so these work very well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I feel very refreshed after brushing.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are okay, not great, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li>Just because they can make it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good for you or that you should buy it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very small and the handle provides no grip to hold and get a good brush.</li>
            <li>These are pretty good but not great.</li>
            <li>Im only giving this product two stars because I enjoy my tooth brushes a lot more firm.  </li>
            <li>Most &#x27;soft&#x27; style toothbrushes feel like trying to brush with a wet paper towel...</li>
            <li>Not at all like the new toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a problem keeping up with new brushes now</li>
            <li>I live out in the country and it takes a while before I can get into town.</li>
            <li>Have tried switching to soft several times, and found a couple that are OK, but just keep coming back to these Colgate brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have sensitive teeth and am lucky to have no problems with gums or cavities, and really like a toothbrush with bristles that get in and around each tooth with a little scrubbing power.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic value at less then $1 per brush.</li>
            <li>you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Colgate brand, because I have a small mouth and sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Because of the large quantity with this purchase I feel more comfortable to toss a brush once it becomes a little &#x27;weak&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Better if the bristles of every brushes are little softer than actually it is.</li>
            <li>They just feel more comfortable, these ones are hard and rough when the back of the brush hits your teeth.</li>
            <li>With the dentist recommendation to replace your toothbrush often (at least every 3 months) I love having these around.  </li>
            <li>My son and I both like our toothbrushes to have a light-to-medium bristle, even though our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle.</li>
            <li>well i shoulda got soft instead of medium ..</li>
            <li>so I was at least pleased with that.</li>
            <li>Do you really need to spend extra money on having an opulent toothbrush?</li>
            <li>He recommended a soft brush.</li>
            <li>I consider myself having sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>the brushhead is way too soft.  </li>
            <li>and it feels as soft as ive been brushing for a month.</li>
            <li>I know your supose to use soft tooth brushes</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, order these NOW before they disappear off the planet.</li>
            <li>There are certainly other toothbrushes that are better, but they&#x27;re usually much more expensive.</li>
            <li>Soft is not quite strong enough for me, but this set is a little bit too</li>
            <li>I prefer more of a medium, and I feel like these are really tough for what I would consider medium.  </li>
            <li>and the bristles didn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the cheap hard ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how big retailers get away with charging $2-$3 per toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked through these packs much faster than I expected to.</li>
            <li>the product itself, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to buy a toothbrush again for as long as I live.  </li>
            <li>not what I expected head a little too small good price</li>
            <li>I knew I wasn&#x27;t purchasing the real expensive toothbrushes and that these were pretty basic, but for basic, they are good.  </li>
            <li>However, these toothbrushes aren&#x27;t super high quality as the handle is a little thin and the bristles don&#x27;t have any special design features like some more expensive toothbrushes do.  </li>
            <li>The only question left is how I ended up with the pink one out of the first pack?</li>
            <li>They are a little firm for my taste, but they do a good job of cleaning the teeth, and the head is small enough to reach the back teeth without too much effort.</li>
            <li>It may be due to the fact that the toothbrush is a little small with shorter bristles, but I have found it to be a nice surprise because it&#x27;s not overly small and has made for easy maneuverability.  </li>
            <li>I have found buying a value pack makes a lot more economical sense since they don&#x27;t go bad.</li>
            <li>You will get a pink, a light purple, a blue and a green.</li>
            <li>The quality of the toothbrushes is fine for the price point, but the bristles are very hard.</li>

            <li> I tend to like a firmer toothbrush than my wife, but we&#x27;re both quite happy with these.  </li>
            <li> Great value, but</li>
            <li> For those of you who like medium brushes this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> So I ordered a ton of them from Amazon.com at a great price.</li>
            <li> Price was great and received them promptly.</li>
            <li> great price.  </li>
            <li> Although they are not the best brushes out there they are very good for the price and job they do as to getting you clean.</li>
            <li> Also, they work great and the grip feels good in your hands.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re probably not as good as an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> - I think Colgate knows how to make a good brush after all these years.</li>
            <li> working good item 100%  </li>
            <li> This would be a really good deal if they had the trademark club end on the brush</li>
            <li> so you can get a good hold on it while in use.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good.</li>
            <li> they are good toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> and they are good quality</li>
            <li> these are a good toothbrush for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good price for non-bargain-bin toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were a good deal</li>
            <li> about a great deal - never been able to find a deal like this on toothbrushes in the store.  </li>
            <li> agreeing with most of the others, 12 quality brushes for $20.00; very nice.  </li>
            <li> but these Colgate medium toothbrushes clean just like I like -- in and around each tooth, leaving my teeth with that most excellent squeaky-clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are good strong toothbrushes that are good as just as any.</li>
            <li> The grip is great, it fit in the hand quite nicely.</li>
            <li> From Oral B for 5+ years to these inexpensive and refreshing toothbrushes I feel I have made a good choice.</li>
            <li> NIce to have lots of toothbrushes on hand.  </li>
            <li> They did come in handy for cleaning my weapons</li>
            <li> handy to have on hand for traveling.</li>
            <li> As a side note, the package comes in nicely and 3 pack is sealed in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> The price is great and loved having these delivered right to my house.</li>
            <li> So I am glad to have found this amazing deal.</li>
            <li> they clean my teeth good.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing too special about this product, but it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Having a supply of brushes is very important to me.</li>
            <li> &amp; the slimmer handles are very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> The store brand pack we had gotten before were better quality for a better price.</li>
            <li> I bought a 4-packer of 4 each and will give away most of them.  </li>
            <li> These have slim handles compared to most toothbrushes I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> This is OK tooth brush from Colgate.</li>
            <li> Okay brushes.</li>
            <li> All in all these are just okay.</li>
            <li> Buy more when stock running up for self and family</li>
            <li> My kids love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using them for a while! :)</li>
            <li> the price is OK  </li>
            <li> and they were much stiffer than I had experienced.</li>
            <li> And OMG, my teeth are so CLEAN!  </li>
            <li> I know the the people who lost all of their belongings will have appreciated these great toothbrushes to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> fantastic and cheap!</li>
            <li> Good value, and fast shipping, which I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding</li>
            <li> Decent toothbrush, not the best, but decent</li>
            <li> Granted, these aren&#x27;t the Colgate 360 ones that I usually love, but compared to almost $2 around here at CVS, Walgreens, or the supermarket, these are great to have on had... especially for guests.</li>
            <li> It is easy to buy online than go to shop.</li>
            <li> The toothbrushes seem fine, just like you would get at Target or Walgreens..</li>
            <li> They work fine and there are a bunch in the box, so I should be set for toothbrushes for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I am really cheap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still blown away by the price of each toothbrush, $0.70 is CHEAP.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made, but they work, and the cost can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose and is cheap.</li>
            <li> the brissles didnt fall out like a cheap brush.  </li>
            <li> Because they are so cheap</li>
            <li> These are great, simple toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> What can I say they are toothbrushes, however getting 12 toothbrushes for $8 is a great price especially for a name brand product!</li>
            <li> I am happy to say these are great toothbrushes and the medium is not irritating or harsh.</li>
            <li> This is not only the most cost effective way to buy toothbrushes, but it also allows us to easily buy &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for around $7 with amazon prime, it was unbelievably worth it!</li>
            <li> These are good quality for the cheap price and come in many color if you have other family members to keep track of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about having a toothbrush handy when I need a new one or one for my house guest</li>
            <li> i live on my own</li>
            <li> but they get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth are now shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> They are cheap enough that they are probably good for sending with the kids when they go off to camp or something like that</li>
            <li> This multipack is as great value particularly if you&#x27;re a frequent traveler or often host guests.</li>
            <li> Great, basic toothbrush, for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> You get 12 tootbrushes in this pack, which makes the price pretty good as far as toothbrushes go.  </li>
            <li> This is a great value buy, but, for me, the heads of the brushes are a bit on the small side and don&#x27;t provide a particularly satisfying brushing experience.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice tooth brushes at a great price and we&#x27;re loaded up with enough of them to last for a while now.  </li>
            <li> Good Value overall.</li>
            <li> Good quality, and price; these will last for a while.</li>
            <li> no bad breath plus</li>
            <li> /&gt;This 12-pack is priced right, the brushes work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six to eight weeks that I use them...</li>
            <li> It falls right through my toothbrush holders, so I have to store it laying in my medicine cabinet until I find a holder that will fit it</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that the bristsles on these brushes are medium (as opposed to the cheap soft bristles).</li>
            <li> If you just need the cheapest vessel for teethbrushing that will get the job done this will work adequately.</li>
            <li> need i say more, their normal tooth brushes that work.</li>
            <li> Nothing good stays on the market long these days.</li>
            <li> I figure they are good to have on hand as spares if you have an unexpected overnight guest or if you run out of your regular brush and need to use them until you get more.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special but the price is right</li>
            <li> I normally always use soft toothbrushes, but the price on this was too good to pass up.</li>
            <li> Research shows that a new brush is much more effective then one used for several weeks.</li>
            <li> fantastic for the whole</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like these toothbrushes, but they are dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> I like to use fresh toothbrushes</li>
            <li> These are definitely the quality for guests who forgot to pack one of their own.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I have Invisalign braces right now</li>
            <li> Really nothing special here</li>
            <li> These are great for kids...felt somewhat too small for adults.</li>
            <li> and they are cheap quality wise with hard ass bristles.</li>
            <li> I had to reread the listing several times to make sure it was correct.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> It is not lasting for more than two weeks.</li>
            <li> However, when I&#x27;m done with Invisalign, I&#x27;ll go back to using better brushes.</li>
            <li> bristles are perfect for me as I prefer a more stiff feel without the harshness of a hard bristle</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t believe when i receive these they were actually 12 - wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Most stores sell &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; which is nice during the first few times that you brush your teeth, but these quickly become flat and worn.  </li>
            <li> The lighter slimmer profile really feels great compared to many of those thick handles (sounds a little trivial) but their so much more comfortable to swish around in your mouth (way better than the standard styles &amp; why do you need that thickness, your not trying to pry something open, etc.?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t personally use these brushes but there have been several times guests have asked to take the brush they used home with them so that has to be a good sign,</li>
            <li> I am very anal about personal cleanliness and my teeth are a top priority.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to say that there&#x27;s less plastic used in the handles of these brushes (better for all of us!)</li>
            <li> Thanks, Colgate Extra Clean Full Head, Medium Toothbrush, 4-Count</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes were of good quality and although someone else noted that the handle was small, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that.</li>
            <li> A little smaller for me in terms of size, should of gone with the large, but otherwise it&#x27;s good for 90% of people for a good toothbrush, this particular brand has a pack of three, creating a toothbrush storage, so just be careful about how many you actually want for this price and shipping.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for large men, but good for small males, women and children.</li>
            <li> I prefer a firmer brush, and the firmness on these are nice and firm but not too firm, but more importantly, has had some staying power.  </li>
            <li> and I will never be able to pay $6 for a single toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> They cleaned my teeth really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, comfortable toothbrush that has made me appreciate its simplicity and realize the fancy shapes and rubber bristles, etc.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much about these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks ...</li>
            <li> Very affordable too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to think about whether I really need to replace the brush, I just do.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon Again.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t wear very well, and after a month of brushing</li>
            <li> It really makes it into a chore</li>
            <li> Which is great because I was a bit concerned that one of us would be stuck using all 16 toothbrushes - or even worse if neither of us like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so these work very well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I feel very refreshed after brushing.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are okay, not great, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li> Just because they can make it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good for you or that you should buy it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very small and the handle provides no grip to hold and get a good brush.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good but not great.</li>
            <li> Im only giving this product two stars because I enjoy my tooth brushes a lot more firm.  </li>
            <li> Most &#x27;soft&#x27; style toothbrushes feel like trying to brush with a wet paper towel...</li>
            <li> Not at all like the new toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem keeping up with new brushes now</li>
            <li> I live out in the country and it takes a while before I can get into town.</li>
            <li> Have tried switching to soft several times, and found a couple that are OK, but just keep coming back to these Colgate brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have sensitive teeth and am lucky to have no problems with gums or cavities, and really like a toothbrush with bristles that get in and around each tooth with a little scrubbing power.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic value at less then $1 per brush.</li>
            <li> you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the Colgate brand, because I have a small mouth and sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Because of the large quantity with this purchase I feel more comfortable to toss a brush once it becomes a little &#x27;weak&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Better if the bristles of every brushes are little softer than actually it is.</li>
            <li> They just feel more comfortable, these ones are hard and rough when the back of the brush hits your teeth.</li>
            <li> With the dentist recommendation to replace your toothbrush often (at least every 3 months) I love having these around.  </li>
            <li> My son and I both like our toothbrushes to have a light-to-medium bristle, even though our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle.</li>
            <li> well i shoulda got soft instead of medium ..</li>
            <li> so I was at least pleased with that.</li>
            <li> Do you really need to spend extra money on having an opulent toothbrush?</li>
            <li> He recommended a soft brush.</li>
            <li> I consider myself having sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> the brushhead is way too soft.  </li>
            <li> and it feels as soft as ive been brushing for a month.</li>
            <li> I know your supose to use soft tooth brushes</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, order these NOW before they disappear off the planet.</li>
            <li> There are certainly other toothbrushes that are better, but they&#x27;re usually much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Soft is not quite strong enough for me, but this set is a little bit too</li>
            <li> I prefer more of a medium, and I feel like these are really tough for what I would consider medium.  </li>
            <li> and the bristles didn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the cheap hard ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how big retailers get away with charging $2-$3 per toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked through these packs much faster than I expected to.</li>
            <li> the product itself, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to buy a toothbrush again for as long as I live.  </li>
            <li> not what I expected head a little too small good price</li>
            <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t purchasing the real expensive toothbrushes and that these were pretty basic, but for basic, they are good.  </li>
            <li> However, these toothbrushes aren&#x27;t super high quality as the handle is a little thin and the bristles don&#x27;t have any special design features like some more expensive toothbrushes do.  </li>
            <li> The only question left is how I ended up with the pink one out of the first pack?</li>
            <li> They are a little firm for my taste, but they do a good job of cleaning the teeth, and the head is small enough to reach the back teeth without too much effort.</li>
            <li> It may be due to the fact that the toothbrush is a little small with shorter bristles, but I have found it to be a nice surprise because it&#x27;s not overly small and has made for easy maneuverability.  </li>
            <li> I have found buying a value pack makes a lot more economical sense since they don&#x27;t go bad.</li>
            <li> You will get a pink, a light purple, a blue and a green.</li>
            <li> The quality of the toothbrushes is fine for the price point, but the bristles are very hard.</li>
            <li> Colors are neutral but as an adult male, I could care less what colors my toothbrushes are.</li>
            <li> of my toothbrushes past weren&#x27;t really doing anything anyway.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a long time and comes with all different colors!</li>
            <li> No major complaints.</li>
            <li> He said \\&quot;a stiff brush should be use for cleaning grout, not your teeth.\\&quot;  I have since changed brushes and my gums are getting close to normal.  </li>
            <li> Not many little boys will want a pink or light purple toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle is way too small for big old hands.</li>
            <li> This makes them a little more difficult to grip.  </li>
            <li> The end of the brush is sharp so if you have big hands you have to adjust.</li>
            <li> so I actually compared the cost of these to the cost at a few local stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than the expensive ones and allows you to move onto the next one when your looking for that fresh feel again.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t last very long but at less than $3 per pack, the price csnt be beat.</li>
            <li> I prefer the &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; firmness of the bristles since they seem to last longer and the toothbrush head seems to take less ware and tear during each use.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little bigger head.</li>
            <li> The brush is a hard brush, so I do not recommend for sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are not too hard and not too soft.  </li>
            <li> Flimsier than I expected, but at this price I guess I can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> not much else to say...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find medium toothbrushes in my area,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get 16 like some other reviewers -</li>
            <li> Other reviewers sounded like they got 16, I ordered these in March 2012 and the accidental bonus must have been corrected by then.</li>
            <li> (other words to fill in the minimum amount words to write a review)</li>
            <li> Ordered this item expecting 4 tooth-brushes, not reading the description careful, received 12!</li>
            <li> They last about as long as any other brand - not particularly remarkable in any way.</li>
            <li> This brush gave me cavity-like pain about 2 months after use and when I went to dentist he said  my gum line was worn down by the brush.</li>
            <li> So you won&#x27;t go wrong buying these brushes especially since you get 12 brushes total</li>
            <li> I typically use a powered brush, but I like to keep some of these around for &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> After using these for a month and a half I saw my dentist.</li>
            <li> In fact I&#x27;m having less pain since using these.</li>
            <li> Even a two pack of Colgate brushes any brissle type will typically run $3-4 dollars in the store.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s what I should expect from a &amp;#34;VALUE PACK&amp;#34;, but I was a bit disappointed by how quickly these toothbrushes wore down.</li>
            <li> However, I did not read carefully that I was getting sent 16 toothbrushes (pack of 3)!!!</li>
            <li> Cheesy, cheap, toothpick-thin handle is so uncomfortable to use, I threw out all 12 brushes.</li>
            <li> husband prefers &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; or even firm bristles on his toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> which destroy toothbrushes, so these are what I needed.</li>
            <li> , i use them everyday</li>
            <li> The toothbrush handle feels thin and weak but the brush part seems alright so far.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, there&#x27;s not much more to say about it.  </li>
            <li> these are your run-of-the-mill small toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I often has visitors that spend the night at my house and they usually forget to bring a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like the pricepoint of these, but the handle is SOOO SMALL.</li>
            <li> Has lasted a while even though they are not top quality.</li>
            <li> they are a bit small but got the job done.  </li>
            <li> Brush size is medium size, handle and length are small.</li>
            <li> but it feels small in the mouth, like it is made for children.  </li>
            <li> They have a very narrow head - not like what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> Kinda hard..</li>
            <li> If you want hard bristles, these will work for you, but they hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> and it could bleed at times when i brush it too hard.  </li>
            <li> My family likes medium toothbrushes and its hard to find in the stores</li>
            <li> These are very thin and narrow.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re functional, but they&#x27;re very thin and small.</li>
            <li> I like then thicker to hold and a larger tooth cleaning base.  </li>

            <li> Great brushes, great price.</li>
            <li> With the dentist recommendation to replace your toothbrush often (at least every 3 months) I love having these around.  I am really cheap so I actually compared the cost of these to the cost at a few local stores.  This is not only the most cost effective way to buy toothbrushes, but it also allows us to easily buy &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband prefers &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; or even firm bristles on his toothbrushes.  Most stores sell &amp;#34;Soft&amp;#34; which is nice during the first few times that you brush your teeth, but these quickly become flat and worn.  I prefer the &amp;#34;Medium&amp;#34; firmness of the bristles since they seem to last longer and the toothbrush head seems to take less ware and tear during each use.</li>
            <li> I did not get all of my packs of toothbrushes. I only received one pack (4 toothbrushes). I will probably be returning this item. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The handle is way too small for big old hands.</li>
            <li> From Oral B for 5+ years to these inexpensive and refreshing toothbrushes I feel I have made a good choice.</li>
            <li> I will be stocking up on these toothbrushes before they run out or the price goes up. You can never have enough toothbrushes! When I found these, Amazon was out of stock, but I must of been in luck because I bought them anyway and Amazon notified me they were back in stock the next day. I&#x27;m still blown away by the price of each toothbrush, $0.70 is CHEAP. The cheapest toothbrush I can find at Target is probably around $1-$2 and they are cheap quality wise with hard ass bristles. These toothbrushes were of good quality and although someone else noted that the handle was small, I didn&#x27;t have a problem with that. They cleaned my teeth really well and the bristles didn&#x27;t hurt my gums like the cheap hard ones.</li>
            <li> I always use these toothbrushes.  They&#x27;re probably not as good as an electric toothbrush but they get my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> For a total of 12 toothbrushes.  Otherwise, there&#x27;s not much more to say about it.  The toothbrushes seem fine, just like you would get at Target or Walgreens..</li>
            <li> My son and I both like our toothbrushes to have a light-to-medium bristle, even though our family dentist keeps harping on switching to brushes with a soft bristle. Have tried switching to soft several times, and found a couple that are OK, but just keep coming back to these Colgate brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have sensitive teeth and am lucky to have no problems with gums or cavities, and really like a toothbrush with bristles that get in and around each tooth with a little scrubbing power. Most &#x27;soft&#x27; style toothbrushes feel like trying to brush with a wet paper towel... but these Colgate medium toothbrushes clean just like I like -- in and around each tooth, leaving my teeth with that most excellent squeaky-clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months ago we purchased a four-pack of these brushes, and have now returned to get this 12 pack (actually three packs that have four brushes in each). Since I go through a toothbrush about every six weeks, functionality and cost are the two biggest factors in my toothbrush purchase decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 12-pack is priced right, the brushes work well for me, the brush is comfortable in my hand, and the heads don&#x27;t fall apart in the six to eight weeks that I use them... what more could I ask for? Getting them delivered for under one buck per brush is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have similar conditions and are looking for a decent, economical toothbrush for daily use, I recommend these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m a college kid and I try and save money where I can. I was looking for a name brand toothbrush with medium stiffness bristles. However, I did not read carefully that I was getting sent 16 toothbrushes (pack of 3)!!! And for around $7 with amazon prime, it was unbelievably worth it! I am never going to the store again and paying $1.57 for an individual colgate toothbrush. What&#x27;s even better is that the bristsles on these brushes are medium (as opposed to the cheap soft bristles). So I am glad to have found this amazing deal. Keep it up amazon!</li>
            <li> I had to reread the listing several times to make sure it was correct.&lt;br /&gt;Each pack contains 4 toothbrushes. The listing is for 3 packs. 12 toothbrushes in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note on colors. It seems all packs contain the same 4 colors, one of each color in each pack. You will get a pink, a light purple, a blue and a green. So with this order you&#x27;ll end up with 4 of each of those colors. This may or may not matter if your family cares about such things. Not many little boys will want a pink or light purple toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value. Stock up!</li>
            <li> I was expecting the larger toothbrushes these are your run-of-the-mill small toothbrushes. Nothing special but the price is right</li>
            <li> These are much too firm for us and although they are ridged on the opposite side of the head, they aren&#x27;t ridged enough for tongue scraping.  The store brand pack we had gotten before were better quality for a better price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this purchase because I&#x27;ve been used to paying $3-$4 per toothbrush, but it was a deal I couldn&#x27;t pass up, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with these toothbrushes.  I prefer a firmer brush, and the firmness on these are nice and firm but not too firm, but more importantly, has had some staying power.  It may be due to the fact that the toothbrush is a little small with shorter bristles, but I have found it to be a nice surprise because it&#x27;s not overly small and has made for easy maneuverability.  It&#x27;s a simple, comfortable toothbrush that has made me appreciate its simplicity and realize the fancy shapes and rubber bristles, etc. of my toothbrushes past weren&#x27;t really doing anything anyway.</li>
            <li> There is nothing too special about this product, but it is good for the price. We intend to buy it again.</li>
            <li> NIce to have lots of toothbrushes on hand.  Shipped well.</li>
            <li> Great, basic toothbrush, for a very reasonable price. We use these for ourselves, guests, and cleaning (not all the same brush) and they do the job! They do need switched out about every 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> not what I expected head a little too small good price so I gave them away.</li>
            <li> Really nothing special here - I think Colgate knows how to make a good brush after all these years. They last about as long as any other brand - not particularly remarkable in any way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get 16 like some other reviewers - I got 12 (3 pack of a 4 count package). But who&#x27;s complaining? It&#x27;s still an awesome deal and I will never be able to pay $6 for a single toothbrush again. Amazon has spoiled me.</li>
            <li> I knew I wasn&#x27;t purchasing the real expensive toothbrushes and that these were pretty basic, but for basic, they are good.  The brush is a hard brush, so I do not recommend for sensitive gums.  Because of the large quantity with this purchase I feel more comfortable to toss a brush once it becomes a little &#x27;weak&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much about these toothbrushes. They are cheaply made, but they work, and the cost can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how big retailers get away with charging $2-$3 per toothbrushes. Save yourself some money and buy this pack of 3!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good strong toothbrushes that are good as just as any. I have found buying a value pack makes a lot more economical sense since they don&#x27;t go bad. Save yourself some bucks by buying ahead of time until at the last second and get them from Amazon shipped Prime! Colors are neutral but as an adult male, I could care less what colors my toothbrushes are.</li>
            <li> working good item 100%  Thanks ...</li>
            <li> This would be a really good deal if they had the trademark club end on the brush so you can get a good hold on it while in use.These feel flimsy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good. Very affordable too. Kinda hard..well i shoulda got soft instead of medium ..but watevea!!! yay</li>
            <li> It serves the purpose and is cheap. It is a great bargain if you are looking for a colgate toothbrush</li>
            <li> This was almost too good of a deal!  I got a year supply of toothbrushes for like $10! I used it today and It was quality... the brissles didnt fall out like a cheap brush.  plan ahead and save.</li>
            <li> Although they are not the best brushes out there they are very good for the price and job they do as to getting you clean. So you won&#x27;t go wrong buying these brushes especially since you get 12 brushes total that&#x27;s a 2-3 year supply depending on how often you change your brushes or if you plan on sharing lol.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and narrow.  Not at all like the new toothbrushes.  I bought a 4-packer of 4 each and will give away most of them.  I like then thicker to hold and a larger tooth cleaning base.  Pass.</li>
            <li> The price is great and loved having these delivered right to my house.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these toothbrushes.  A charity was holding a fundraiser with amazon and I participated by buying these for the charity.</li>
            <li> I often has visitors that spend the night at my house and they usually forget to bring a toothbrush. I bought this set of toothbrushes to solve that problem. I don&#x27;t personally use these brushes but there have been several times guests have asked to take the brush they used home with them so that has to be a good sign, right? At this price, the brushes are a great solution when guests forget their brushes at home &#x3D; no bad breath plus they won&#x27;t ask to borrow your personal brush.</li>
            <li> These have slim handles compared to most toothbrushes I have purchased.  This makes them a little more difficult to grip.  Would not buy them again because of the thin handle.</li>
            <li> Im only giving this product two stars because I enjoy my tooth brushes a lot more firm.  They did come in handy for cleaning my weapons so I was at least pleased with that.</li>
            <li> Flimsier than I expected, but at this price I guess I can&#x27;t complain.  I can always give them to my kids.  They work fine and there are a bunch in the box, so I should be set for toothbrushes for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Do you really need to spend extra money on having an opulent toothbrush? If you just need the cheapest vessel for teethbrushing that will get the job done this will work adequately.</li>
            <li> This is OK tooth brush from Colgate. It is not lasting for more than two weeks. I am disappointed and will not recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> You get 3 sets of 4 brushes, totaling 12. Other reviewers sounded like they got 16, I ordered these in March 2012 and the accidental bonus must have been corrected by then. These are pretty good but not great. I have Invisalign braces right now which destroy toothbrushes, so these are what I needed. Because they are so cheap I don&#x27;t have to think about whether I really need to replace the brush, I just do. However, when I&#x27;m done with Invisalign, I&#x27;ll go back to using better brushes. They just feel more comfortable, these ones are hard and rough when the back of the brush hits your teeth.</li>
            <li> Like others have said... you ARE getting 12 brushes in total here.  Granted, these aren&#x27;t the Colgate 360 ones that I usually love, but compared to almost $2 around here at CVS, Walgreens, or the supermarket, these are great to have on had... especially for guests.</li>
            <li> Nothing but All-of-Bests. All the way from Kanya-Kuwari to Kashmir, and from Kuttcha to Assam, Sikkim, Nagaland, and Burma.</li>
            <li> These brushes are O.K.  They are a little firm for my taste, but they do a good job of cleaning the teeth, and the head is small enough to reach the back teeth without too much effort.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had, but it&#x27;ll do. Tooth brushes shouldn&#x27;t cost $5! This saved me money and replacements.</li>
            <li> I pick this variety pack because is cheaper than buying individual., Now we all know when is time to swith the brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand and model of toothbrush for over 4 weeks now.  The brushes are not too hard and not too soft.  I would recommend this brand and model of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These colgate toothbrushes are a great value. You get 12 so you always have extra when you need to change them out every 3 months and for guests who forget one. Also, they work great and the grip feels good in your hands.</li>
            <li> they are good toothbrushes.  not much else to say...they clean my teeth good.  handy to have on hand for traveling.</li>
            <li> Decent toothbrush, not the best, but decent, i use them everyday</li>
            <li> Okay brushes. Won&#x27;t last very long but at less than $3 per pack, the price csnt be beat. No major complaints.</li>
            <li> Three packs of four toothbrushes.. I&#x27;ve always had a problem keeping up with new brushes now I shouldn&#x27;t have that problem!</li>
            <li> As described. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great for the price.  I comparison shopped quite a bit and decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I always run out of toothbrushes, Now I can keep toothbrushs on hand. I am very anal about personal cleanliness and my teeth are a top priority. Having a supply of brushes is very important to me.Thanks Amazon Again.</li>
            <li> Cheesy, cheap, toothpick-thin handle is so uncomfortable to use, I threw out all 12 brushes.</li>
            <li> The quality of the toothbrushes is fine for the price point, but the bristles are very hard. Each pack is labelled \\&quot;medium\\&quot; so it wasn&#x27;t a packing error or anything like that. If you want hard bristles, these will work for you, but they hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> Ever since seeing that bathroom germ episode of Dr. Oz Ive been crazy about changing toothbrushes on schedule. These are good quality for the cheap price and come in many color if you have other family members to keep track of. You could end up spending $10+ on something like this in CVS or Wallgreens</li>
            <li> I know the the people who lost all of their belongings will have appreciated these great toothbrushes to clean their teeth.</li>
            <li> I brush twice a day and floss daily. This brush gave me cavity-like pain about 2 months after use and when I went to dentist he said  my gum line was worn down by the brush. He recommended a soft brush.</li>
            <li> 12 toothbrushes!!! This is a great deal!! the toothbrushes are great!! fantastic for the whole family!!&lt;br /&gt;Get it! fantastic and cheap!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like these toothbrushes, but they are dirt cheap. They&#x27;re functional, but they&#x27;re very thin and small. There are certainly other toothbrushes that are better, but they&#x27;re usually much more expensive. All in all these are just okay.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a long time and comes with all different colors!</li>
            <li> Value of money is the feeling when I use this products. Buy more when stock running up for self and family</li>
            <li> For the price, you know what you&#x27;re getting.  They do the job and are great for traveling.  They don&#x27;t wear very well, and after a month of brushing it&#x27;s time to replace them.</li>
            <li> I consider myself having sensitive teeth and it could bleed at times when i brush it too hard.  I do not run into the bleeding problem with the level of the softness for this toothbrush. The grip is great, it fit in the hand quite nicely. As a side note, the package comes in nicely and 3 pack is sealed in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> I like the package comes with different colours. Better if the bristles of every brushes are little softer than actually it is.</li>
            <li> A great bargain for a quality brand.</li>
            <li> These are great, simple toothbrushes. I typically use a powered brush, but I like to keep some of these around for &amp;#34;in-between&amp;#34; brushes.</li>
            <li> need i say more, their normal tooth brushes that work. you also get a total of 12 toothbrushes. (other words to fill in the minimum amount words to write a review)</li>
            <li> I like the pricepoint of these, but the handle is SOOO SMALL. It falls right through my toothbrush holders, so I have to store it laying in my medicine cabinet until I find a holder that will fit it (i bought like 24 of these during a sale).</li>
            <li> CALIDAD COLGATE,LO RECOMIENDO,SON VARIOS CEPILLOS PARA TODO EL GRUPO FAMILIAR,SON EXCELENTE Y SUAVES,SE LOS RECOMIENDO A TODOS Y REEMPLAZRLOS CUANDO YA NO SIRVEN.</li>
            <li> These are a great buy. I like to use fresh toothbrushes so this is what I bought. It&#x27;s cheaper than the expensive ones and allows you to move onto the next one when your looking for that fresh feel again. Has lasted a while even though they are not top quality.</li>
            <li> My kids love them. They are happy to use the tooth brushes. It is easy to buy online than go to shop.</li>
            <li> You get 12 tootbrushes in this pack, which makes the price pretty good as far as toothbrushes go.  However, these toothbrushes aren&#x27;t super high quality as the handle is a little thin and the bristles don&#x27;t have any special design features like some more expensive toothbrushes do.  They do get the job done though if you don&#x27;t need the cadillac toothbrush model.</li>
            <li> The product is softer than I like and not much textured action to be had. It really makes it into a chore and now I&#x27;ve got 12 of them. These are definitely the quality for guests who forgot to pack one of their own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about having a toothbrush handy when I need a new one or one for my house guest BUT these guys are tiny. I was expecting a little bigger head.</li>
            <li> This is a great value buy, but, for me, the heads of the brushes are a bit on the small side and don&#x27;t provide a particularly satisfying brushing experience.</li>
            <li> Good value, and fast shipping, which I&#x27;ve come to expect from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the product itself, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to buy a toothbrush again for as long as I live.  And OMG, my teeth are so CLEAN!  Thanks, Colgate Extra Clean Full Head, Medium Toothbrush, 4-Count (Pack of 3)!</li>
            <li> These should be labeled kids brushes. They&#x27;re very small and the handle provides no grip to hold and get a good brush. I would avoid it.</li>
            <li> These are great for kids...felt somewhat too small for adults.</li>
            <li> I tend to like a firmer toothbrush than my wife, but we&#x27;re both quite happy with these.  Which is great because I was a bit concerned that one of us would be stuck using all 16 toothbrushes - or even worse if neither of us like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk about a great deal - never been able to find a deal like this on toothbrushes in the store.  They&#x27;re nice tooth brushes at a great price and we&#x27;re loaded up with enough of them to last for a while now.  The only question left is how I ended up with the pink one out of the first pack?</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t have to buy toothbrushes for a while. i live on my own and i always hated the thought of buying a tooth brush every three-six months (depending on which doctor you go to)&lt;br /&gt;i bought these to eliminate random expenses.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great for people who want strong/hard bristles! I prefer more of a medium, and I feel like these are really tough for what I would consider medium.  Soft is not quite strong enough for me, but this set is a little bit too rough.&lt;br /&gt;But, I bought 12 - so I&#x27;ll be using them for a while! :)</li>
            <li> My family likes medium toothbrushes and its hard to find in the stores the price is OK  and they are good quality</li>
            <li> HI,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just agreeing with most of the others, 12 quality brushes for $20.00; very nice.  I&#x27;d also like to say that there&#x27;s less plastic used in the handles of these brushes (better for all of us!) &amp; the slimmer handles are very comfortable.  The lighter slimmer profile really feels great compared to many of those thick handles (sounds a little trivial) but their so much more comfortable to swish around in your mouth (way better than the standard styles &amp; why do you need that thickness, your not trying to pry something open, etc.?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------</li>
            <li> Can never beat a deal like that.  i couldn&#x27;t believe when i receive these they were actually 12 - wow!!!! they are a bit small but got the job done.  Cannot beat this price at all..</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s what I should expect from a &amp;#34;VALUE PACK&amp;#34;, but I was a bit disappointed by how quickly these toothbrushes wore down.</li>
            <li> these are a good toothbrush for the price.  I like to change my toothbrush often so these are perfect.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great value, but the brushhead is way too soft.  Used it twice and it feels as soft as ive been brushing for a month.</li>
            <li> I know your supose to use soft tooth brushes but I hate them and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find medium toothbrushes in my area, so I was very happy to find these brushes on line at a great price. For those of you who like medium brushes this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Works like I expect a toothbrush to work.</li>
            <li> After using these for a month and a half I saw my dentist. He asked what I was doing differently that would cause my gums to recede. I told him I was using these brushes and they were much stiffer than I had experienced. He said \\&quot;a stiff brush should be use for cleaning grout, not your teeth.\\&quot;  I have since changed brushes and my gums are getting close to normal.  Just because they can make it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good for you or that you should buy it. Recommendation: Do not buy. Also, I recommend taking your brush to the dentist for evaluation. Get their expert opinion on what you buy, or just get them to recommend what brush you should buy. You pay for their services, you may as well get and use their advice.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re toothbrushes.. No nonsense. Good price for non-bargain-bin toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> What can I say they are toothbrushes, however getting 12 toothbrushes for $8 is a great price especially for a name brand product! I was so happy to find these on Amazon. I love the Colgate brand, because I have a small mouth and sensitive teeth so these work very well. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth. Breathing can sometimes make them hurt! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of toothbrushes and this one did not bother that sensitivity. In fact I&#x27;m having less pain since using these. It was great....until I found out that Colgate is discontinuing them. Figures! Nothing good stays on the market long these days. So I ordered a ton of them from Amazon.com at a great price. Even Walmart couldn&#x27;t match it! If you have sensitive teeth, order these NOW before they disappear off the planet.</li>
            <li> A little smaller for me in terms of size, should of gone with the large, but otherwise it&#x27;s good for 90% of people for a good toothbrush, this particular brand has a pack of three, creating a toothbrush storage, so just be careful about how many you actually want for this price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I normally always use soft toothbrushes, but the price on this was too good to pass up. I am happy to say these are great toothbrushes and the medium is not irritating or harsh. This is a great deal on toothbrushes, get it while you can!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal on good quality toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Used for brushing teeth. My teeth are now shiny and clean. Just like I thought they would do.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushes... Four of them. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Brush size is medium size, handle and length are small. The end of the brush is sharp so if you have big hands you have to adjust. Not recommended for large men, but good for small males, women and children. Good Value overall.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price of this pack of 12 toothebrushes.  Even a two pack of Colgate brushes any brissle type will typically run $3-4 dollars in the store.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are perfect for me as I prefer a more stiff feel without the harshness of a hard bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;You just can&#x27;t beat this product.</li>
            <li> Ordered this item expecting 4 tooth-brushes, not reading the description careful, received 12! Good quality, and price; these will last for a while.</li>
            <li> Bought this to have spares in guest bathroom from when someone needs a toothbrush in a hurry.  Price was great and received them promptly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to confirm that you will get 12 brushes here. This is a fantastic value at less then $1 per brush. They are well built and the low price allows you to replace them regularly. Research shows that a new brush is much more effective then one used for several weeks. So replace them regularly. No reason not to at this price!</li>
            <li> great price.  I like it and use it all the time.  Colgate is a proven product and has been around for years</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are okay, not great, but not terrible.  They have a very narrow head - not like what I&#x27;m used to.  They are cheap enough that they are probably good for sending with the kids when they go off to camp or something like that where you don&#x27;t care if they return home.  I figure they are good to have on hand as spares if you have an unexpected overnight guest or if you run out of your regular brush and need to use them until you get more.  I won&#x27;t buy them again, though.</li>
            <li> toothbrushes....what can i say?</li>
            <li> This multipack is as great value particularly if you&#x27;re a frequent traveler or often host guests. I&#x27;ve worked through these packs much faster than I expected to. The brushes aren&#x27;t Colgate&#x27;s finest, but definitely do the job, travel well, and last 1-2 months.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service.</li>
            <li> I live out in the country and it takes a while before I can get into town. With this I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It does the trick but it feels small in the mouth, like it is made for children.  Can&#x27;t say I feel very refreshed after brushing.  Spring for the more expensive toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were a good deal and they said they were made in the USA, but that&#x27;s not what the packaging says.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush handle feels thin and weak but the brush part seems alright so far.</li>
