            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Glad I ordered 2 bottles!</li>
            <li>but I love the smell diffused!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>First of all, I am very impressed with the prices and quality of Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>Feeling better already!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the fragrance was great, not too strong, and I believe it helped keeping the &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li>Smelled fresh out of the bottle and very good when burning in my diffuser dish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to be able to buy quality, 100% pure EOs from a company with great customer service and excellent prices.</li>
            <li>Even my guest think that my house smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Refreshing &amp; bright scent.  </li>
            <li>Again thank you for this amazing product.</li>
            <li>However, it smells nice regardless.</li>
            <li>Needs more orange to make it taste good.</li>
            <li>Liked the product it was delivered on time</li>
            <li>I want to believe this product has been effective as a preventative for my family.  </li>
            <li>time anyone visits I get complements on how nice the house smells.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it smells nice.</li>
            <li>It has a nice synergy</li>
            <li>I used it in a warm mist humidifier with fragrance oil diffuser, and it lasted 4 days, running 8 hours a day.</li>
            <li>Thanks, and you all have a great day!</li>
            <li>I kind of feel that this has been diluted or something</li>
            <li>I diffuse this alone or with Germ Fighter and it makes the whole house smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>I watch children in addition to caring for my own</li>
            <li>A drop of this in some warm water is one way to use it as a disinfectant on counter tops or to cleanse a wound with.</li>
            <li>Look at that all of the ingredients and each of them have their own purpose.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy makes some wonderful quality oils that I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about!</li>
            <li>superior oils, great prices and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>So far has worked great!</li>
            <li>Product arrived early an in excellent condition no leaking!!!</li>
            <li>Not as strong smelling as some oils!</li>
            <li>it burns nicely and very cleanly.  </li>
            <li>This product was even more effective than products I have purchased that cost more.  </li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic,its powerful but utterly pleasant.</li>
            <li>Love this in my diffuser.</li>
            <li>Seems to make me feel better-</li>
            <li>Better than and $60 bottle of oil</li>
            <li>I love doing business with this company.</li>
            <li>Like many out there</li>
            <li>sure wish the bottles would have a roller as an option\\&quot;.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Sort of earthy in the beginning with the Frankincense,  then the Tea Tree, Rosemary, and Eucalyptus hit with the lovely end of Lemon and Orange linger</li>
            <li>I think this one is more for breathing from a diffuser, or putting in a chest rub.</li>
            <li>Love this blend.  </li>
            <li>I use this most of the time.</li>
            <li>Even my kids love it.</li>
            <li>Ok, would not buy again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love how that smells.</li>
            <li>I love On Guard, by doTERRA.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>Essential oil blend is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several of this brand and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>I love every oil I have used from Plant therapy.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>We like this so much more the Thieves.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased we no have it on hand.</li>
            <li>I love these oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>My favorite oil blend.</li>
            <li>It has helped my skin look better and provides a refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>I give it 5 stars for the fast shipping and great smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase of this essential oil synergy from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely way, appropriately packaged.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>so it came in 2 days packaged safely.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the fragrance and the taste...</li>
            <li>I need to order some more.</li>
            <li>I use it in a diffuser and am extremely pleased with its quality.</li>
            <li>Smells good and keeps our surfaces and skin smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>Love the way this smells.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how wonderful this product is and that it actually works.  </li>
            <li>Everything it promises an more.</li>
            <li>Will surely purchase again...</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>Their protective blend works very well, and the scent is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with Plant Therapy and will be ordering more of their EO blends as well as individual EOs - at a fraction of the price as the home party kind!  </li>
            <li>So that is more important.</li>
            <li>Makes the whole house smell good.</li>
            <li>This was more than fantastic as I needed them very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be a very effective product for the skin afflictions the accompany old age.  </li>
            <li>One gets used to the strong medicinal fragrance after a while.</li>
            <li>However since I&#x27;m still in a strong allergy reaction from another brand oil, I will probably don&#x27;t apply them in any skin touch or massage for now, and just use them in cleaning to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li>Nice clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>However, I know that 2 of the oils in the GF are harsher on skin than any of the oils in this blend, so I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li>Sneaky Fine print.</li>
            <li>This was a fine quality.  </li>
            <li>The  scent was fine.</li>
            <li>and if I have to maybe add another essential oil just to help make the scent more pleasant?</li>
            <li>The reviews from others in addition to the quality of ingredients used were a huge factor that assisted me.  </li>
            <li>My husband puts a drop under his tongue before he goes to sleep every night, hoping it will help him stay free of sinus infections.</li>
            <li>It keeps the air in my home germ free.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy and would definitely order again.  </li>
            <li>Has a light citrus scent that freshens the room.</li>
            <li>The next day she said she felt great, whatever was coming on was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aroma is light and welcoming.</li>
            <li>I used the coconut oil I had in my cupboards as a carrier oil and one of those diffusers that you put a tea light candle in.</li>
            <li>Put them together and you have a great, multipurpose essential oil.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have also added a few drops to the humidifiers in their rooms at night which is very effective as well!  </li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure of it at first</li>
            <li>I originally wanted this product for a friend, and decided I wanted one too.</li>
            <li>Germ Fighter has a pretty strong cinnamon smell, while Immune-Aid is more sweet and mild.</li>
            <li>Most essential oils cost a fortune, so it&#x27;s nice to find something you want (&amp; need) at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>(using a clean cloth)</li>
            <li>Kind of getting in a disappointed state because the oregano oil I ordered was perfect and effective.</li>
            <li>Order immun-aid to add to my already large collection of plant therapy oils, which I love, because my sons classroom had an outbreak of mono and strep.</li>
            <li>Check your Essential oil book; it&#x27;s ingredients are good.  </li>
            <li>Good brand at a low price.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff for helping my lil guy get better when he catches something.</li>
            <li>It helps to open up my sinuses and makes my home smell good too.</li>
            <li>I love this combo and the orange and lemon oils really cut through along with the Eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li>This is a high grade essential oil at a good price!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and item was just as described.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly, well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Great Smell, easy to use.. just put a few drops in a spray bottle with water and spray your house !</li>
            <li>Very Satisfied and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>This is a decent blend of oils; which really do seem effective at boosting immunity and fighting off bacteria.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t provide more than anecdotal evidence as far as the immune boosting properties is concerned.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>I got much better results by using Young Living oil called Thieves.</li>
            <li>Fresh, organic, and well made product for health.</li>
            <li>right now-</li>
            <li>But finding the right combinations with the exact amounts has always caused me problems.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and the blend definitely relaxes and energizes at the same time.</li>
            <li>Essential oils take time to see results but overall, great product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it really gives me energy, but I enjoy the smell so much that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I found this after seeing an ad for a similar product selling for more than triple the price of this one.</li>
            <li>An extra drop of Lemon is refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I felt better by the next day.</li>
            <li>My favorite essential oil!</li>
            <li>Love essential oils.  </li>
            <li>At first I was iffy on the scent....</li>
            <li>I LOVE plant therapy essential oil blend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many EOs in the past, from many different carriers, and I&#x27;d have to say, this is one of the better brands.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy infusing this or using a couple of drops directly on the skin in a carrier oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks plant therapy!</li>
            <li>Clears dripping, constant dripping and moreso since relation to eyes, ears, throat sure seems to help all.</li>
            <li>The bottle was as expected, the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>I really believe in this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is very good, clean smelling, and is lasting a long time (you only need to use one or two drops at a time).  </li>
            <li>I am very familiar with all the oils that are put into this blend, and have been using it daily.  </li>
            <li>I am sure that this approach is good for many people but I am not one of them :-(  </li>
            <li>I use a few drops in my own cleaning solution, and everything smells fresh, and I know it it</li>
            <li>What makes me glad is that the company is responsible enough to send email for purchase feedback, leaving their contacts in case</li>
            <li>I read the testimonials because I really didn&#x27;t know exactly how to use it</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s not as good as the other company</li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.</li>
            <li>I do store all of my essential oils in a wooden box &amp; having the label on the top of these bottles is a plus that I appreciate!</li>
            <li>This one is so reasonably priced that I bought 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The combo of Frankincense, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lemon, Eucalyptus and Orange is really neat.</li>
            <li>but it really has become this comforting smell and reminds me of a connection to my son.</li>
            <li>It is already formulated, so doesn&#x27;t really need anything else.  </li>
            <li>This oil is uplifting and energizing and really works.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this</li>
            <li>but it grew on my fast...</li>
            <li>The scent was very off putting...</li>
            <li>You really do get what you paid for...</li>
            <li>It smells really</li>
            <li>I much prefer the scent of doTERRA&#x27;s On Guard.</li>
            <li>Thanks goes to all the people who took the time to post their reviews.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>By the way this is a real review, not some b.s.</li>
            <li>Had no idea it would do so much, but put on fingertip at entrance to nasal passages, rub around.</li>
            <li>This synergistic blend really works.</li>
            <li>Originally, I was only going to get the Germ Fighter because it was supposed to be like YL&#x27;s Thieves</li>
            <li>They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>and sometimes i mix it with the company&#x27;s energy blend which i highly recommend as well.</li>
            <li>I rather mix my own essential oils, and would probably make it a little stronger than this one.</li>
            <li>I am new to EOs</li>
            <li>Hope my new bottle is here in a hurry.</li>
            <li>and I would also be more careful as to what I am ACTUALLY purchasing and read the &amp;#34;Fine&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it any other way but in the diffuser, but the scent is light and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely heathy!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Now I do have one small problem whereas the oil is more so like a watery type oil.</li>
            <li>First 3 months only with germ fighter</li>
            <li>B00VGL7GN6 Salis Immunity Blend, 100% Pure Grade Essential Oils, 10ml]]</li>
            <li>The Essential Oil Blend arrived fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>All the bottles were packaged very neatly in individually wrapped bubble wrap; there was no breakage or leakage.  </li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t say if it works because I just received it today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my 3month old son and</li>
            <li>Working for us so far.</li>
            <li>It may not ward off the illness completely</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kept me healthy and energetic while everyone else around me is getting sick.</li>
            <li>With the flu and cold season, it&#x27;s nice to have a little help keeping healthy.  </li>
            <li>It was a huge surprise when it actually arrived in a day and a half.  </li>
            <li>Arrived timely but oil is not very concentrated and produces little to no smell even When adding more then recommended amount per amount of water.</li>
            <li>I order both Immune-Aid and Germ Fighter to use as a natural approach to turn against potential flu.</li>
            <li>smells  like Lysol to me, my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, so far I haven&#x27;t noticed a different in out health</li>
            <li>I was first amazed by how quick the products arrived because in the notification it said it would arrive approximately 4 days later from the order date.  </li>
            <li>And makes my sick kids happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an essential oil, so you cannot apply it directly onto your skin as it would burn, all essential oils must be diluted.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking this as an alternative to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>This has a pleasant odor, and I haven&#x27;t been sick since I started using it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great Smell.  </li>
            <li> ImmuneAId combined with Plant Therapy GermAid and a bit of coconut oil is a great home remedy vapor rub for my kiddos when they are congested and stuffed up.  </li>
            <li> Great smell.  </li>
            <li> Aid Synergy is great to fight off colds and allergies.</li>
            <li> Great scent and spider repellant.</li>
            <li> Bought for my brother - he says it&#x27;s very good and effective.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> So much more affordable and works great!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, and we will be trying more by Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Kills germs and has a somewhat pleasant smell...mainly tea tree.</li>
            <li> to see if I see a difference just trying to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> This smells good if nothing else.</li>
            <li> but it does smell good.</li>
            <li> This is a good combination</li>
            <li> so I feel good about doing what I can to prevent colds and viruses.</li>
            <li> It came in good packaging.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of Plant Therapy&#x27;s Immune-Aid Synergy blend.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Better then spraying Lysol everywhere!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Glad I ordered 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> but I love the smell diffused!</li>
            <li> I love this!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> First of all, I am very impressed with the prices and quality of Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Feeling better already!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the fragrance was great, not too strong, and I believe it helped keeping the &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li> Smelled fresh out of the bottle and very good when burning in my diffuser dish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to be able to buy quality, 100% pure EOs from a company with great customer service and excellent prices.</li>
            <li> Even my guest think that my house smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Refreshing &amp; bright scent.  </li>
            <li> Again thank you for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> However, it smells nice regardless.</li>
            <li> Needs more orange to make it taste good.</li>
            <li> Liked the product it was delivered on time</li>
            <li> I want to believe this product has been effective as a preventative for my family.  </li>
            <li> time anyone visits I get complements on how nice the house smells.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> It has a nice synergy</li>
            <li> I used it in a warm mist humidifier with fragrance oil diffuser, and it lasted 4 days, running 8 hours a day.</li>
            <li> Thanks, and you all have a great day!</li>
            <li> I kind of feel that this has been diluted or something</li>
            <li> I diffuse this alone or with Germ Fighter and it makes the whole house smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> I watch children in addition to caring for my own</li>
            <li> A drop of this in some warm water is one way to use it as a disinfectant on counter tops or to cleanse a wound with.</li>
            <li> Look at that all of the ingredients and each of them have their own purpose.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy makes some wonderful quality oils that I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about!</li>
            <li> superior oils, great prices and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> So far has worked great!</li>
            <li> Product arrived early an in excellent condition no leaking!!!</li>
            <li> Not as strong smelling as some oils!</li>
            <li> it burns nicely and very cleanly.  </li>
            <li> This product was even more effective than products I have purchased that cost more.  </li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic,its powerful but utterly pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love this in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Seems to make me feel better-</li>
            <li> Better than and $60 bottle of oil</li>
            <li> I love doing business with this company.</li>
            <li> Like many out there</li>
            <li> sure wish the bottles would have a roller as an option\\&quot;.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Sort of earthy in the beginning with the Frankincense,  then the Tea Tree, Rosemary, and Eucalyptus hit with the lovely end of Lemon and Orange linger</li>
            <li> I think this one is more for breathing from a diffuser, or putting in a chest rub.</li>
            <li> Love this blend.  </li>
            <li> I use this most of the time.</li>
            <li> Even my kids love it.</li>
            <li> Ok, would not buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love how that smells.</li>
            <li> I love On Guard, by doTERRA.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> Essential oil blend is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of this brand and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I love every oil I have used from Plant therapy.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> We like this so much more the Thieves.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased we no have it on hand.</li>
            <li> I love these oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> My favorite oil blend.</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin look better and provides a refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars for the fast shipping and great smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase of this essential oil synergy from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely way, appropriately packaged.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> so it came in 2 days packaged safely.  </li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the fragrance and the taste...</li>
            <li> I need to order some more.</li>
            <li> I use it in a diffuser and am extremely pleased with its quality.</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps our surfaces and skin smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how wonderful this product is and that it actually works.  </li>
            <li> Everything it promises an more.</li>
            <li> Will surely purchase again...</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> Their protective blend works very well, and the scent is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with Plant Therapy and will be ordering more of their EO blends as well as individual EOs - at a fraction of the price as the home party kind!  </li>
            <li> So that is more important.</li>
            <li> Makes the whole house smell good.</li>
            <li> This was more than fantastic as I needed them very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be a very effective product for the skin afflictions the accompany old age.  </li>
            <li> One gets used to the strong medicinal fragrance after a while.</li>
            <li> However since I&#x27;m still in a strong allergy reaction from another brand oil, I will probably don&#x27;t apply them in any skin touch or massage for now, and just use them in cleaning to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li> Nice clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> However, I know that 2 of the oils in the GF are harsher on skin than any of the oils in this blend, so I think it will be fine.</li>
            <li> Sneaky Fine print.</li>
            <li> This was a fine quality.  </li>
            <li> The  scent was fine.</li>
            <li> and if I have to maybe add another essential oil just to help make the scent more pleasant?</li>
            <li> The reviews from others in addition to the quality of ingredients used were a huge factor that assisted me.  </li>
            <li> My husband puts a drop under his tongue before he goes to sleep every night, hoping it will help him stay free of sinus infections.</li>
            <li> It keeps the air in my home germ free.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy and would definitely order again.  </li>
            <li> Has a light citrus scent that freshens the room.</li>
            <li> The next day she said she felt great, whatever was coming on was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aroma is light and welcoming.</li>
            <li> I used the coconut oil I had in my cupboards as a carrier oil and one of those diffusers that you put a tea light candle in.</li>
            <li> Put them together and you have a great, multipurpose essential oil.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have also added a few drops to the humidifiers in their rooms at night which is very effective as well!  </li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure of it at first</li>
            <li> I originally wanted this product for a friend, and decided I wanted one too.</li>
            <li> Germ Fighter has a pretty strong cinnamon smell, while Immune-Aid is more sweet and mild.</li>
            <li> Most essential oils cost a fortune, so it&#x27;s nice to find something you want (&amp; need) at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> (using a clean cloth)</li>
            <li> Kind of getting in a disappointed state because the oregano oil I ordered was perfect and effective.</li>
            <li> Order immun-aid to add to my already large collection of plant therapy oils, which I love, because my sons classroom had an outbreak of mono and strep.</li>
            <li> Check your Essential oil book; it&#x27;s ingredients are good.  </li>
            <li> Good brand at a low price.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for helping my lil guy get better when he catches something.</li>
            <li> It helps to open up my sinuses and makes my home smell good too.</li>
            <li> I love this combo and the orange and lemon oils really cut through along with the Eucalyptus scent.</li>
            <li> This is a high grade essential oil at a good price!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and item was just as described.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Great Smell, easy to use.. just put a few drops in a spray bottle with water and spray your house !</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a decent blend of oils; which really do seem effective at boosting immunity and fighting off bacteria.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t provide more than anecdotal evidence as far as the immune boosting properties is concerned.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> I got much better results by using Young Living oil called Thieves.</li>
            <li> Fresh, organic, and well made product for health.</li>
            <li> right now-</li>
            <li> But finding the right combinations with the exact amounts has always caused me problems.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and the blend definitely relaxes and energizes at the same time.</li>
            <li> Essential oils take time to see results but overall, great product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it really gives me energy, but I enjoy the smell so much that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I found this after seeing an ad for a similar product selling for more than triple the price of this one.</li>
            <li> An extra drop of Lemon is refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I felt better by the next day.</li>
            <li> My favorite essential oil!</li>
            <li> Love essential oils.  </li>
            <li> At first I was iffy on the scent....</li>
            <li> I LOVE plant therapy essential oil blend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many EOs in the past, from many different carriers, and I&#x27;d have to say, this is one of the better brands.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy infusing this or using a couple of drops directly on the skin in a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Thanks plant therapy!</li>
            <li> Clears dripping, constant dripping and moreso since relation to eyes, ears, throat sure seems to help all.</li>
            <li> The bottle was as expected, the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I really believe in this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is very good, clean smelling, and is lasting a long time (you only need to use one or two drops at a time).  </li>
            <li> I am very familiar with all the oils that are put into this blend, and have been using it daily.  </li>
            <li> I am sure that this approach is good for many people but I am not one of them :-(  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops in my own cleaning solution, and everything smells fresh, and I know it it</li>
            <li> What makes me glad is that the company is responsible enough to send email for purchase feedback, leaving their contacts in case</li>
            <li> I read the testimonials because I really didn&#x27;t know exactly how to use it</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s not as good as the other company</li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.</li>
            <li> I do store all of my essential oils in a wooden box &amp; having the label on the top of these bottles is a plus that I appreciate!</li>
            <li> This one is so reasonably priced that I bought 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The combo of Frankincense, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lemon, Eucalyptus and Orange is really neat.</li>
            <li> but it really has become this comforting smell and reminds me of a connection to my son.</li>
            <li> It is already formulated, so doesn&#x27;t really need anything else.  </li>
            <li> This oil is uplifting and energizing and really works.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this</li>
            <li> but it grew on my fast...</li>
            <li> The scent was very off putting...</li>
            <li> You really do get what you paid for...</li>
            <li> It smells really</li>
            <li> I much prefer the scent of doTERRA&#x27;s On Guard.</li>
            <li> Thanks goes to all the people who took the time to post their reviews.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> By the way this is a real review, not some b.s.</li>
            <li> Had no idea it would do so much, but put on fingertip at entrance to nasal passages, rub around.</li>
            <li> This synergistic blend really works.</li>
            <li> Originally, I was only going to get the Germ Fighter because it was supposed to be like YL&#x27;s Thieves</li>
            <li> They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li> and sometimes i mix it with the company&#x27;s energy blend which i highly recommend as well.</li>
            <li> I rather mix my own essential oils, and would probably make it a little stronger than this one.</li>
            <li> I am new to EOs</li>
            <li> Hope my new bottle is here in a hurry.</li>
            <li> and I would also be more careful as to what I am ACTUALLY purchasing and read the &amp;#34;Fine&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it any other way but in the diffuser, but the scent is light and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely heathy!  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Now I do have one small problem whereas the oil is more so like a watery type oil.</li>
            <li> First 3 months only with germ fighter</li>
            <li> B00VGL7GN6 Salis Immunity Blend, 100% Pure Grade Essential Oils, 10ml]]</li>
            <li> The Essential Oil Blend arrived fast and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> All the bottles were packaged very neatly in individually wrapped bubble wrap; there was no breakage or leakage.  </li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t say if it works because I just received it today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my 3month old son and</li>
            <li> Working for us so far.</li>
            <li> It may not ward off the illness completely</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kept me healthy and energetic while everyone else around me is getting sick.</li>
            <li> With the flu and cold season, it&#x27;s nice to have a little help keeping healthy.  </li>
            <li> It was a huge surprise when it actually arrived in a day and a half.  </li>
            <li> Arrived timely but oil is not very concentrated and produces little to no smell even When adding more then recommended amount per amount of water.</li>
            <li> I order both Immune-Aid and Germ Fighter to use as a natural approach to turn against potential flu.</li>
            <li> smells  like Lysol to me, my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, so far I haven&#x27;t noticed a different in out health</li>
            <li> I was first amazed by how quick the products arrived because in the notification it said it would arrive approximately 4 days later from the order date.  </li>
            <li> And makes my sick kids happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an essential oil, so you cannot apply it directly onto your skin as it would burn, all essential oils must be diluted.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this as an alternative to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant odor, and I haven&#x27;t been sick since I started using it.</li>
            <li> so I may have used a little too much because it was quite strong, but not nice non the less.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say for sure that it helps not get sick</li>
            <li> The smell is not quite the same as OnGuard, it&#x27;s much less orangey, but the quality seems to be the same as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Did not last long enough.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I was prepared to return the unopened bottles, so they cancelled the &amp;#34;subscription&amp;#34; that I did not sign up for and agreed to refund $66.74.</li>
            <li> infuse well  and have long lasting scent</li>
            <li> i have not been using long enough to attest to its immune-boosting effects but i can say this is one beautiful-smelling oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it, but I&#x27;ll stick to using it on less sensitive skin, like my feet/toes.</li>
            <li> it kinds tough to get down, the taste is strong and it lingers.</li>
            <li> Right before he goes to bed, I put a few drops of carrier oil on his palm, and then a few drops of the Immune-Aid oil.</li>
            <li> Less then 30 days later, a 2nd bottle, same size was delivered and I was charged $88.84 (</li>
            <li> My husband has trouble sleeping, and also catches every germ that comes near him.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these products and they are much less expensive than others I have seen.  </li>
            <li> Not that thrilled with the aroma, not sure if it is helping during the cold season.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little paranoid as the smell also ends up on his blankets and bed, so not only does he have to like it</li>
            <li> I also added a few drops to my bath when my immune system felt like it needed an extra pick me up.</li>
            <li> When everybody is sick ,i&#x27;m still ok....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added it to hot and cold water as a beverage supplement and applied it topically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will be gentler on my baby&#x27;s skin than the other since the Germ Fighter gave him a rash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil from this maker with no problem, so I think my skin doesn&#x27;t react so well with one of the other ingredients</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only been taking it for 2 weeks,so it&#x27;s hard to tell if the oil is working</li>
            <li> I have been diffusing this almost every day, usually with a little extra lemon or orange.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; online because everyone is different.</li>
            <li> It is not medicine, no side effects, smells good (orange and cinnamon maybe), and he thinks it is hysterical when I rub it on his feet.</li>
            <li> In the past we have used Thieves, and we thought what did we have to loose to try Immune-Aid Synergy.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am definitely a \\&quot;blend\\&quot; person and if I had to suggest an improvement, it would only be \\&quot;I</li>
            <li> (my son had a cold for the first time in months.)</li>
            <li> Sometimes I mix in with lavender as well to assist in my little ones having a restful night.</li>
            <li> I wish it lasts longer (the bottle is a little too</li>
            <li> Sometimes the drops take a little while to come out.  </li>
            <li> This oil has orange smell with a little grassy smell.</li>
            <li> and I have little spray bottles that we take everywhere about 30 drops and distilled water.</li>
            <li> I put a little drop of this under my nose and all of the stuffiness is gone.</li>
            <li> This, in combination with elderberry syrup, and he was one of the few children that didn&#x27;t come down with anything!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as I massage him a few times a week.</li>
            <li> Put a few drops in my Greenair mist therapy before bed</li>
            <li> also use a few drops on a rag when I do the chair rails and baseboards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use in my everyday use of Vick&#x27;s Shower cakes which I use throughout the winter.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on a washcloth and cleaned my kitchen and bathroom counters with it.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in the palm of my hands, rub them together and inhale it during the day, and rub it into my feet at night..  </li>
            <li> The immune-aide was easier to convince my daughter to take a few drops in about 4 oz of water.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve received this product, I&#x27;ve been using it everyday...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know in a few weeks how I feel...</li>
            <li> I also  used a few drops in a  small spray bottle as part of a hand sanitizer that included  Germ Fighter Synergy Essentail Oil Blend.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a cold or problem to check it against so far.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works</li>
            <li> A small amount of the liquid was lost.  </li>
            <li> Usually we take oregano oil</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes hurt by just opening and getting small whiff.  </li>
            <li> Like I said Im not sure</li>
            <li> My sun brought home school germs as is usual for the beginning of the school year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not.</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not very good at \\&quot;from scratch\\&quot; and always wondered if I was doing everything correctly.  </li>
            <li> use essential oil for lots of things, cleaning around the house, in cool misters, sore muscles and when we are getting sick or are sick.</li>
            <li> It has an orange overtone, then a sickly medicinal middle tone and a mixture of other fragrance undertone.</li>
            <li> I use it daily in my diffuser during cold and flu season.  </li>
            <li> Seriously Amazon, sometimes 20 words are not need to give a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried it and have not been sick, just mixed ( 2 drops)  in my morning tea...</li>
            <li> I was feeling a throat problem coming on, several people around me had been sick.</li>
            <li> I use it when my little ones start to get a cold</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems a to smell a little like a polluted forrest or like dirty chai.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> but it kept me from getting worse and, IMO, shortened the time I was not well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also be using it on my 6yr old who seems to have been sick over a month and cold meds aren&#x27;t helping.</li>
            <li> I have purchase two other oils I&#x27;m hoping not to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Once I put this essential oil in my diffuser we stopped getting sick!  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on an handkerchief and inhale this throughout the day, when they are sick people around me coughing and hacking.</li>
            <li> I have not gotten sick (and I usually catch whatever my son has).</li>
            <li> This works as well if not better than the home party EO versions and keeps the germs away and has kept my kiddos from getting sick during this winter cold/flu season.  </li>
            <li> I wish there were directions contained in a little paperwork, that would be helpful, but I also called and spoke to one of your representatives who suggested I rub some on the base of my spine...</li>
            <li> I ran this in a diffuser overnight and in the morning I had a weird taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> and it prevents cold from getting worse!</li>
            <li> but I hate to waste it and the properties it might have with the sick bugs</li>
            <li> Used this in my diffuser as soon as I felt a cold coming on.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for protection as the cold and flu season approaches.</li>
            <li> This oil is helping with my cold symptoms.</li>
            <li> Everyone around me has had a bug,  cold,  </li>
            <li> I like to diffuse this blend when I have a cold or feel stuffy.</li>
            <li> Inhaling this stopped the cold in it&#x27;s tracks for me and lessened the severity of symptoms for my sun.</li>
            <li> I had something unpleasant during usage.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the Germ Fighter one and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like this one either</li>
            <li> Everyone in my office has been sick - except me.  </li>
            <li> When I get sick</li>
            <li> bought for office to diffuse to keep us from getting sick this winter.</li>
            <li> no one got sick</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gotten sick in quite some time.  </li>
            <li> My son was recently sick, and this arrived.</li>
            <li> The day after it arrived my daughter was sick.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get sick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am just blessed, but my daughter has not been sick once, and I have used the diffuser in her room since we brought her home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sick</li>
            <li> hope it helps with ongoing residuals from cold and flu!</li>
            <li> All four kids managed to get by with just a touch of the nasty cold that was wreaking havoc on the others at daycare.</li>
            <li> not that I hate this, I just don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> , I just know I wanted to boost my immune system because I am sick ALL THE TIME!  </li>
            <li> Gave me horrible sinus headaches!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is what keeps me going through the nasty winter and flu season months!</li>
            <li> Awful smell</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this!</li>
            <li> nasty taste, unsure how well it works</li>
            <li> Will help you overcome nasty colds, lung infections, etc.  </li>

            <li> I have tried it and have not been sick, just mixed ( 2 drops)  in my morning tea...vj</li>
            <li> Love this in my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Seems to make me feel better-</li>
            <li> Who needs do terra when you have this? Better than and $60 bottle of oil I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> I found this after seeing an ad for a similar product selling for more than triple the price of this one. It smells medicinal. This one is so reasonably priced that I bought 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> Using this rather than the pricier thieves. So far so good.</li>
            <li> The immune-aid blend and all of Plant Therapy&#x27;s products are great.  They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  I love doing business with this company.</li>
            <li> Just began using... hope it helps with ongoing residuals from cold and flu! So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far has worked great!</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Gave me horrible sinus headaches!  😥</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of Plant Therapy&#x27;s Immune-Aid Synergy blend.  I had started out buying a book on essential oils, then buying the oils, then blending them myself.  I am sure that this approach is good for many people but I am not one of them :-(  Like many out there, I&#x27;m not very good at \\&quot;from scratch\\&quot; and always wondered if I was doing everything correctly.  Needless to say, I am definitely a \\&quot;blend\\&quot; person and if I had to suggest an improvement, it would only be \\&quot;I sure wish the bottles would have a roller as an option\\&quot;.[[ASIN:B005VSXUIA Immune-Aid Synergy Essential Oil Blend. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade. (Blend of: Frankincense, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lemon, Eucalyptus and Orange)]]</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as I massage him a few times a week. I thought an immune aid oil would be perfect for him. I&#x27;m a little paranoid as the smell also ends up on his blankets and bed, so not only does he have to like it, I have to like it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combo of Frankincense, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lemon, Eucalyptus and Orange is really neat. Sort of earthy in the beginning with the Frankincense,  then the Tea Tree, Rosemary, and Eucalyptus hit with the lovely end of Lemon and Orange linger on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure of it at first but it really has become this comforting smell and reminds me of a connection to my son. He agrees he loves it too.</li>
            <li> Not as strong smelling as some oils! I used it in a defusier</li>
            <li> Order immun-aid to add to my already large collection of plant therapy oils, which I love, because my sons classroom had an outbreak of mono and strep. This, in combination with elderberry syrup, and he was one of the few children that didn&#x27;t come down with anything! Great product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t provide more than anecdotal evidence as far as the immune boosting properties is concerned. It did seem to shorten the duration of a recent bug.  However, it smells nice regardless.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this.  The ingredients are for keeping cough and flu away through my essential oil diffuser.  It is already formulated, so doesn&#x27;t really need anything else.  Check your Essential oil book; it&#x27;s ingredients are good.  Frankincense, Tea Tree, Rosemary, Lemon, Eucalyptus and Orange.  An extra drop of Lemon is refreshing.  Peppermint is also known for relieving some same symptoms, so I put drop of that on occasion.  I haven&#x27;t had a cold or problem to check it against so far.  I personally would not take this internally. They do have others listed that may be taken internally.  I think this one is more for breathing from a diffuser, or putting in a chest rub. (diluted with coconut oil, or something similar) Could irritate skin in you used without diluting!!  Essential oils don&#x27;t separate in water, so if you use in bathtub, only one or two drops should be used.  You don&#x27;t want skin and private parts irritated.  (I&#x27;ve used orange essential oil in bath before and didn&#x27;t do well! burned !!)</li>
            <li> Have not yet used this but put it to the test of white paper.  This is a high grade essential oil at a good price!</li>
            <li> I diffuse this into the air. Better then spraying Lysol everywhere! Kills germs and has a somewhat pleasant smell...mainly tea tree.</li>
            <li> Works well in diffuser. Can also be diluted and applied to bottoms of feet or spine with a carrier oil. I use 3 drops in diffuser before and after we leave the house to run errands or go to events during flu/sick season.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my office has been sick - except me.  Thumbs up for a great product</li>
            <li> I take this at night (one drop under my tongue) and found it stops the morning sniffles - for some reason I was always congested in the mornings, and this seems to have stopped the congestion.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these oils</li>
            <li> This stuff is what keeps me going through the nasty winter and flu season months! Put a few drops in my Greenair mist therapy before bed and it&#x27;s kept me healthy and energetic while everyone else around me is getting sick. Plant Therapy makes some wonderful quality oils that I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about! I recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Arrived timely but oil is not very concentrated and produces little to no smell even When adding more then recommended amount per amount of water.</li>
            <li> Used this in my diffuser as soon as I felt a cold coming on. I felt better by the next day. I will continue to use as needed. Only reason for not giving 5 starts was that I didn&#x27;t care for the scent. But it worked. So that is more important.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and I think it works. I cannot prove it, but my son did not cough when we use this blend.</li>
            <li> Love this blend.  I use it when my little ones start to get a cold and it prevents cold from getting worse!</li>
            <li> The Essential Oil Blend arrived fast and was well packaged. My husband puts a drop under his tongue before he goes to sleep every night, hoping it will help him stay free of sinus infections. He&#x27;s only been taking it for 2 weeks,so it&#x27;s hard to tell if the oil is working but I trust it is.</li>
            <li> Needs more orange to make it taste good.</li>
            <li> I use this most of the time. When I get sick I put this in the vaporizer in my bedroom for humidify the air and disperse the oils into the room.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This oil is uplifting and energizing and really works. I&#x27;ve added it to hot and cold water as a beverage supplement and applied it topically. Even my kids love it. All four kids managed to get by with just a touch of the nasty cold that was wreaking havoc on the others at daycare. Love this stuff! Glad I ordered 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works but I love the smell diffused!</li>
            <li> Ok, would not buy again</li>
            <li> I ordered this for protection as the cold and flu season approaches. I was feeling a throat problem coming on, several people around me had been sick. I mixed this with grapeseed oil, and rubbed into my neck and the bottom of my feet.  I&#x27;m completely heathy!  It&#x27;s fantastic stuff!</li>
            <li> So much more affordable and works great!</li>
            <li> My favorite essential oil! Great company too!</li>
            <li> Purchase was for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> love this product. bought for office to diffuse to keep us from getting sick this winter. Must have worked great no one got sick</li>
            <li> Liked the product it was delivered on time</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this and I used it in my essential oil diffuser. I also added a few drops to my bath when my immune system felt like it needed an extra pick me up.</li>
            <li> One gets used to the strong medicinal fragrance after a while. I want to believe this product has been effective as a preventative for my family.  Rather have than not. I dilute with coconut carrier oil. Sometimes I mix in with lavender as well to assist in my little ones having a restful night. They sleep like a rock!!</li>
            <li> I use essential oils constantly.  Good brand at a low price.</li>
            <li> This oil is helping with my cold symptoms. I originally wanted this product for a friend, and decided I wanted one too. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great Smell, easy to use.. just put a few drops in a spray bottle with water and spray your house !</li>
            <li> I use a few drops in my own cleaning solution, and everything smells fresh, and I know it it clean.&lt;br /&gt;Any time anyone visits I get complements on how nice the house smells.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a few drops on a rag when I do the chair rails and baseboards.&lt;br /&gt;It is an essential oil, so you cannot apply it directly onto your skin as it would burn, all essential oils must be diluted.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one because it had great reviews. Originally, I was only going to get the Germ Fighter because it was supposed to be like YL&#x27;s Thieves and I love how that smells. I was disappointed in the Germ Fighter one and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like this one either (I had ordered them at the same time) . I LOVE this one!!! I haven&#x27;t tried it any other way but in the diffuser, but the scent is light and clear. I&#x27;m hoping it will be gentler on my baby&#x27;s skin than the other since the Germ Fighter gave him a rash. However, I know that 2 of the oils in the GF are harsher on skin than any of the oils in this blend, so I think it will be fine. I have to wait until this rash clears up before I find out though.</li>
            <li> Use this in my diffuser...  Not that thrilled with the aroma, not sure if it is helping during the cold season.  I rather mix my own essential oils, and would probably make it a little stronger than this one.</li>
            <li> Great Item. Great Smell.  Very Satisfied and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I put this on the bottoms of my feet, on my chest if I&#x27;m coughing or even a drop or two in a class of water or tea.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for helping my lil guy get better when he catches something. It is not medicine, no side effects, smells good (orange and cinnamon maybe), and he thinks it is hysterical when I rub it on his feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, not knowing that I signed up for a subscription. Sneaky Fine print. I was charged $12.62 ( Can Funds) for the shipment of 1 10 ml bottle. Less then 30 days later, a 2nd bottle, same size was delivered and I was charged $88.84 (Can Funds). I called the company to say that I had not &amp;#34;subscribed&amp;#34; to this product. Long story short, I was prepared to return the unopened bottles, so they cancelled the &amp;#34;subscription&amp;#34; that I did not sign up for and agreed to refund $66.74. - My END Total Cost was then $34.72 (Can Funds) for these 2 10 ml bottles of oil. I would not order this again and I would also be more careful as to what I am ACTUALLY purchasing and read the &amp;#34;Fine&amp;#34; Print. [[ASIN:B00VGL7GN6 Salis Immunity Blend, 100% Pure Grade Essential Oils, 10ml]]</li>
            <li> Love essential oils.  This was a fine quality.  Use in my everyday use of Vick&#x27;s Shower cakes which I use throughout the winter.</li>
            <li> At first I was iffy on the scent....but it grew on my fast...I already have the Germ FIghter and it seems its working. Im psyched to have this now!!! I LOVE plant therapy essential oil blend.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I use it daily in my diffuser during cold and flu season.  It keeps the air in my home germ free.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It smells very pleasant and I must say; so far so good! Everyone around me has had a bug,  cold,  etc. and I haven&#x27;t gotten sick in quite some time.  Give this product a shot, I hope you have good luck with it!</li>
            <li> The scent was very off putting... I have used several protective essential oil blends since getting into oils.  And this one just didn&#x27;t do it for me personally.  I love On Guard, by doTERRA.  Their protective blend works very well, and the scent is amazing!  You really do get what you paid for...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually comparing this to another item I purchased from another company so far it&#x27;s not as good as the other company but the price is no comparison. So I&#x27;m going to give it another month or so to see if I see a difference just trying to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked!  I use it in my oil diffuser, add it to carrier oils, use it on my scalp...I just love it.</li>
            <li> It smells really good!&lt;br /&gt;I diffused it in my living-room! I wish it lasts longer (the bottle is a little too small)&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and great customer service!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and item was just as described.  Very happy to add this oil to my collection</li>
            <li> This seems to be a very effective product for the skin afflictions the accompany old age.  I&#x27;ll order 30ml next time</li>
            <li> This is a decent blend of oils; which really do seem effective at boosting immunity and fighting off bacteria. My son was recently sick, and this arrived. I immediately started using it in diffusers and when cleaning. I have not gotten sick (and I usually catch whatever my son has). However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. It&#x27;s seems a to smell a little like a polluted forrest or like dirty chai. I much prefer the scent of doTERRA&#x27;s On Guard. Although, comparing the two are like comparing apples to oranges. They have different ingredients, but similar germ/bacteria fighting properties. Next time I&#x27;m going with On Guard...</li>
            <li> This bottle smells medicinal. It has an orange overtone, then a sickly medicinal middle tone and a mixture of other fragrance undertone. Wish I could send it back.</li>
            <li> I order both Immune-Aid and Germ Fighter to use as a natural approach to turn against potential flu. Germ Fighter has a pretty strong cinnamon smell, while Immune-Aid is more sweet and mild. What makes me glad is that the company is responsible enough to send email for purchase feedback, leaving their contacts in case I had something unpleasant during usage. However since I&#x27;m still in a strong allergy reaction from another brand oil, I will probably don&#x27;t apply them in any skin touch or massage for now, and just use them in cleaning to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li> Seriously Amazon, sometimes 20 words are not need to give a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This  Essential oil blend is wonderful. It smells great and the blend definitely relaxes and energizes at the same time.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly, well packaged.  Smelled fresh out of the bottle and very good when burning in my diffuser dish.  Since I have been using only for a short time, will review later.  Essential oils take time to see results but overall, great product.  I&#x27;ve purchased several of this brand and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this one. I used it as soon as I got it. I put a few drops on a washcloth and cleaned my kitchen and bathroom counters with it. Nice clean, fresh scent. I am new to EOs so I may have used a little too much because it was quite strong, but not nice non the less. I may send the others I bought back and just stick to this one for now to get used to them.</li>
            <li> We love Plant Therapy EOs!!!  This works as well if not better than the home party EO versions and keeps the germs away and has kept my kiddos from getting sick during this winter cold/flu season.  We apply it to the feet diluted in about 1Tbsp coconut oil.  ImmuneAId combined with Plant Therapy GermAid and a bit of coconut oil is a great home remedy vapor rub for my kiddos when they are congested and stuffed up.  I have also added a few drops to the humidifiers in their rooms at night which is very effective as well!  Very pleased with Plant Therapy and will be ordering more of their EO blends as well as individual EOs - at a fraction of the price as the home party kind!  Thank you Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> not that I hate this, I just don&#x27;t like it.  I got much better results by using Young Living oil called Thieves.</li>
            <li> I work with kids.When everybody is sick ,i&#x27;m still ok....I used to get all the colds and sniffles....Not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I love every oil I have used from Plant therapy.&lt;br /&gt;They infuse well  and have long lasting scent&lt;br /&gt;will definately buy here again</li>
            <li> Great smell.  My daughter enjoys it.  Sometimes the drops take a little while to come out.  That&#x27;s why I will give it 4/5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many EOs in the past, from many different carriers, and I&#x27;d have to say, this is one of the better brands. Immune Aid Synergy is great to fight off colds and allergies. Love it!</li>
            <li> Awful smell but I hate to waste it and the properties it might have with the sick bugs so I&#x27;ll probably diffuse it in the kids rooms when they are not there, lessen the amount I use in the diffuser and if I have to maybe add another essential oil just to help make the scent more pleasant?</li>
            <li> The immune aid bottle was not properly sealed and leaked during transit.  The labels therefore came off.  A small amount of the liquid was lost.  The problem does not reflect on the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> In the past we have used Thieves, and we thought what did we have to loose to try Immune-Aid Synergy.  We like this so much more the Thieves.  This is an awesome product, and we will be trying more by Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this seller&#x27;s product, yet after thorough research I did make a purchase. The reviews from others in addition to the quality of ingredients used were a huge factor that assisted me.  Thanks goes to all the people who took the time to post their reviews.  I was first amazed by how quick the products arrived because in the notification it said it would arrive approximately 4 days later from the order date.  It was a huge surprise when it actually arrived in a day and a half.  This was more than fantastic as I needed them very quickly.  All the bottles were packaged very neatly in individually wrapped bubble wrap; there was no breakage or leakage.  I am extremely happy and would definitely order again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I like to diffuse this blend when I have a cold or feel stuffy. It helps to open up my sinuses and makes my home smell good too.</li>
            <li> This is very good, clean smelling, and is lasting a long time (you only need to use one or two drops at a time).  I don&#x27;t know if it actually boosted my immune system any but it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love this combo and the orange and lemon oils really cut through along with the Eucalyptus scent. It has a nice synergy and I enjoy infusing this or using a couple of drops directly on the skin in a carrier oil. It is one of my Plant Therapy favorites.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in lieu of  ImmunoPower by YLO  for a trip to Asia and it worked well.  I applied the oil  to the soles of my feet. It was not as viscous as  YLO and  was easier  to  use for that reason.  I also  used a few drops in a  small spray bottle as part of a hand sanitizer that included  Germ Fighter Synergy Essentail Oil Blend.  The  scent was fine.</li>
            <li> I personally always use essential oils.  But finding the right combinations with the exact amounts has always caused me problems.  I am very familiar with all the oils that are put into this blend, and have been using it daily.  With the flu and cold season, it&#x27;s nice to have a little help keeping healthy.  I put a few drops in the palm of my hands, rub them together and inhale it during the day, and rub it into my feet at night..  I love it!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this! Ick! Ick! Ick!</li>
            <li> This smells good if nothing else. I can&#x27;t really say for sure that it helps not get sick but it does smell good. I&#x27;ve sven mixed it with some sleepy time blend and it goes well with that. Has a light citrus scent that freshens the room.</li>
            <li> It works! The day after it arrived my daughter was sick. Usually we take oregano oil but wowzers it kinds tough to get down, the taste is strong and it lingers. The immune-aide was easier to convince my daughter to take a few drops in about 4 oz of water. The next day she said she felt great, whatever was coming on was gone.&lt;br /&gt;We use essential oil for lots of things, cleaning around the house, in cool misters, sore muscles and when we are getting sick or are sick. This is a good combination and I&#x27;m pleased we no have it on hand.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant odor, and I haven&#x27;t been sick since I started using it. Will probably purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells amazing! I use it on a daily basis. Even my guest think that my house smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This blend smells like the bottom of the swimming pool.  Wow!  Makes my eyes hurt by just opening and getting small whiff.  Stay away!</li>
            <li> i have not been using long enough to attest to its immune-boosting effects but i can say this is one beautiful-smelling oil.  it burns nicely and very cleanly.  i burn it to start my day or before a workout for an energizing effect and sometimes i mix it with the company&#x27;s energy blend which i highly recommend as well. superior oils, great prices and fast delivery.  you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> nasty taste, unsure how well it works</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I love these oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> My favorite oil blend. Citrus/Tea tree dominant smells.  Refreshing &amp; bright scent.  Used daily in my classroom.  Didn&#x27;t get sick/need to miss days of work once I started using.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my orders</li>
            <li> Not happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> Did not last long enough. I used it in a warm mist humidifier with fragrance oil diffuser, and it lasted 4 days, running 8 hours a day. Otherwise, the fragrance was great, not too strong, and I believe it helped keeping the &amp;#34;bugs&amp;#34; away. By the way this is a real review, not some b.s. one. Thanks, and you all have a great day! This was written on 12/21/12, will check back in tomorrow hopefully.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to use as the essential oils in my coconut oil based facial cleanser.  It has helped my skin look better and provides a refreshing scent.  I will definitely purchase this again for my next batch of DIY cleansers and lotions.</li>
            <li> I give it 5 stars for the fast shipping and great smell. This oil has orange smell with a little grassy smell. I don&#x27;t see how others are complaining. So far I can&#x27;t say if it works because I just received it today. I&#x27;ve used it on my 3month old son and im hoping that it works. I&#x27;ll also be using it on my 6yr old who seems to have been sick over a month and cold meds aren&#x27;t helping. Now I do have one small problem whereas the oil is more so like a watery type oil. It&#x27;s nothing that I am going to complain about. I still hope to get benefits from it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 1/26/15 Changed to 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve not yet seen any results. This oil also seems to be too liquidity. The oil also dries out I&#x27;ve never known oil to do such. Kind of getting in a disappointed state because the oregano oil I ordered was perfect and effective. I have purchase two other oils I&#x27;m hoping not to be disappointed. I kind of feel that this has been diluted or something and that&#x27;s upsetting. Im going to continue to use it and re-update if something changes.</li>
            <li> This is something I burn in the day. Aroma is light and welcoming. Perfect to have in the doorway of your home on diffuse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase of this essential oil synergy from Plant Therapy. I&#x27;m so glad to be able to buy quality, 100% pure EOs from a company with great customer service and excellent prices. I&#x27;ll purchase again!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely way, appropriately packaged. Great product with excellent benefits. Fresh, organic, and well made product for health.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My family had been passing around colds and flus for months.  Once I put this essential oil in my diffuser we stopped getting sick!  Now I use it once a week as a preventative.</li>
            <li> I ran this in a diffuser overnight and in the morning I had a weird taste in my mouth.  I won&#x27;t diffuse this stuff again.  I do like the Germ fighter (Thieves) from this brand, but not this Immune-Aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Jaden</li>
            <li> Use it every night in combination with germen fighter blend. I don&#x27;t know if I am just blessed, but my daughter has not been sick once, and I have used the diffuser in her room since we brought her home. First 3 months only with germ fighter and now I add the immune aid. Like I said Im not sure but, we do also use the roll on germ fighter on the bottom of her feet at night and I have little spray bottles that we take everywhere about 30 drops and distilled water.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this as an alternative to a more expensive brand. The smell is not quite the same as OnGuard, it&#x27;s much less orangey, but the quality seems to be the same as far as I can tell. I have been diffusing this almost every day, usually with a little extra lemon or orange. Sickness has been kept at bay. Thanks plant therapy!</li>
            <li> Great scent and spider repellant.</li>
            <li> smells  like Lysol to me, my daughter doesn&#x27;t mind it at all, so far I haven&#x27;t noticed a different in out health</li>
            <li> I diffuse this alone or with Germ Fighter and it makes the whole house smell wonderful. I have had several compliments on it. I watch children in addition to caring for my own so I feel good about doing what I can to prevent colds and viruses. I used the coconut oil I had in my cupboards as a carrier oil and one of those diffusers that you put a tea light candle in. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Had no idea it would do so much, but put on fingertip at entrance to nasal passages, rub around. Clears dripping, constant dripping and moreso since relation to eyes, ears, throat sure seems to help all. One I will continue to buy on regular basis</li>
            <li> Will help you overcome nasty colds, lung infections, etc.  I put a few drops on an handkerchief and inhale this throughout the day, when they are sick people around me coughing and hacking.</li>
            <li> Tried this Immune-Aid blend on a whim.  It is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; to my senses.  I smell the tea tree oil over everything else but I don&#x27;t mind that smell. It&#x27;s hard to rate a &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; online because everyone is different. I ordered mine using Amazon&#x27;s Prime so it came in 2 days packaged safely.  Will use in a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve received this product, I&#x27;ve been using it everyday...and I absolutely love the fragrance and the taste...yes the TASTE!  I read the testimonials because I really didn&#x27;t know exactly how to use it, I just know I wanted to boost my immune system because I am sick ALL THE TIME!  One of the testimonials said she put 1 or 2 drops in what she drank...I usually only drink distilled water and now I also put a drop or 2 in it and it&#x27;s delicious.  I wish there were directions contained in a little paperwork, that would be helpful, but I also called and spoke to one of your representatives who suggested I rub some on the base of my spine...haven&#x27;t tried this yet, I&#x27;d need a bigger bottle.  Does your Immune-aid Synergy come in a 15ml or larger?  I&#x27;ll let you know in a few weeks how I feel...Again thank you for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> It came in good packaging. The bottle was as expected, the smell is nice. And makes my sick kids happy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these products and they are much less expensive than others I have seen.  I can&#x27;t attest to whether or not it really gives me energy, but I enjoy the smell so much that I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This synergistic blend really works. My sun brought home school germs as is usual for the beginning of the school year.  Inhaling this stopped the cold in it&#x27;s tracks for me and lessened the severity of symptoms for my sun. I need to order some more.</li>
            <li> This product was even more effective than products I have purchased that cost more.  I use it in a diffuser and am extremely pleased with its quality.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am very impressed with the prices and quality of Plant Therapy. Most essential oils cost a fortune, so it&#x27;s nice to find something you want (&amp; need) at an affordable price. I put a little drop of this under my nose and all of the stuffiness is gone. A drop of this in some warm water is one way to use it as a disinfectant on counter tops or to cleanse a wound with. (using a clean cloth) Look at that all of the ingredients and each of them have their own purpose. Put them together and you have a great, multipurpose essential oil. Another \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for me. I do store all of my essential oils in a wooden box &amp; having the label on the top of these bottles is a plus that I appreciate!</li>
            <li> Bought for my brother - he says it&#x27;s very good and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tea tree oil from this maker with no problem, so I think my skin doesn&#x27;t react so well with one of the other ingredients or maybe I&#x27;m not use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use it, but I&#x27;ll stick to using it on less sensitive skin, like my feet/toes.</li>
            <li> My husband has trouble sleeping, and also catches every germ that comes near him. Right before he goes to bed, I put a few drops of carrier oil on his palm, and then a few drops of the Immune-Aid oil. He rubs it on his hands and neck, and the next morning says he slept well. I&#x27;m hoping it will also keep him cold-free this winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works or not. It helps you breath when you dab a bit under each nostril. I tried the &amp;#34;under the tongue&amp;#34; idea; that was a different experience. I am not sure.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using plant therapy oils for about a year- and I ran out of immune aid last week (my son had a cold for the first time in months.) I&#x27;m so sick right now- I really believe in this stuff! Hope my new bottle is here in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Smells good and keeps our surfaces and skin smelling fresh. Working for us so far. 5 4 3 2 1</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells. I use it in the water basin that sits on my wood stove. Makes the whole house smell good.</li>
            <li> I was told by friends (who of course sell doTerra and YoungLiving) to not buy &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34;.  Well the YL version of this has cinnamon and I&#x27;ve recently noticed that I either have an allergy or sensativity to cinnamon.  I get strep-throat was too often (four times last year, and those were just the doctor-confirmed cases!) and I&#x27;m trying anything I think will help.  As soon as my throat began to get sore I put this on my neck and the soles of my feet.  Twice a day, then overnight, and it didn&#x27;t develop into strep!!  HOORAY!!!  I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how wonderful this product is and that it actually works.  It may not ward off the illness completely but it kept me from getting worse and, IMO, shortened the time I was not well.  Plus, no cinnamon means I can use it!!</li>
            <li> This company delivers. Product arrived early an in excellent condition no leaking!!! The scent is fantastic,its powerful but utterly pleasant.Everything it promises an more. Will surely purchase again...</li>
            <li> Feeling better already!</li>
