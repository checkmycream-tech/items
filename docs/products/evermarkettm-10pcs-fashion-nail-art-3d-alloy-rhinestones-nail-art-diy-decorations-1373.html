            <li>Great product &amp; received it fast!</li>
            <li>These things are cute, but way too bulky for nails.  </li>
            <li>I thought they would be more of a stick on, something you can paint over.  </li>
            <li>Then gel polish on top.  </li>
            <li>Cute for bedazzling or something among those lines.</li>
            <li>These are so cute on ur nails.</li>

            <li>Om goodness these so cute</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame they didn&#x27;t really work, because for those two days, I thought it looked great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find another use for them, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I love the sliver color and the diamond in the mickey mouse shape.</li>
            <li>but i will soon I am not to sure about the glue to use.</li>

            <li>Cute item</li>
            <li>These charms are so cute</li>
            <li>Thinking of putting an acrylic red bow on some to make them Minnie Mouse so cute!!!!</li>
            <li>I have clients that love Mickey, so had to purchase these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably be ordering some more soon.</li>
            <li>love these but haven&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>
            <li>Super cute!  </li>
            <li>Then nail glue is good but don&#x27;t last long get Best Glue ever add a good coat too where you want jewel</li>
            <li>Perfect for nails and other decorations</li>
            <li>im very pleased thanks</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how nice these are!  </li>
            <li>Very pretty and sparkles  Should have bought more</li>
            <li>They are huge and bulky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Mickey Mouse fan</li>
            <li>They are huge and I don&#x27;t see how I could ever where them at nail art.</li>
            <li>I  think it will fit well on</li>
            <li>They are very sparkly and nicely made.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>Seal your design with a good gel clear  polish and cure for three minutes remove tacky layer with a bit of alcohol then dap cuticle oil massage on nails and cuticle</li>
            <li>They as re bigger then the picture shown, but they are very nice.</li>
            <li>Took awhile to get here but worth it!</li>
            <li>I love them so much, I will be a return customer!</li>
            <li>These are useful for all kinds of things!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet,but I&#x27;m excited too.</li>
            <li>These are so cute and fit very well on the nail</li>
            <li>very cute, but as others have stated kind of large, especially  for nail art.</li>
            <li>so they just a tad too large for me, but going to give as gifts - they&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li>As well my nail artist tried his very hardest and was able to get them on by using acrylic around them.  </li>
            <li>True to size listed.</li>
            <li>Love how the stones look like jewelry-grade--look like cubic zirconias mounted in silver colored prong settings--with intense sparkle and shine.</li>
            <li>omg i love these so much</li>
            <li>I really should have ordered more then 1 pack.....</li>
            <li>Love the thought of having Mickey Mouse on my fingernails... but the stick out way too much to be productive.  </li>
            <li>These really need to be attached to the nail with super glue or very strong nail glue to keep them in place, unlike most nail gems which can be placed using clear polish.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I did a trial run.  </li>
            <li>As described and a quick ship.  </li>
            <li>If you apply them on top of polish most likely they&#x27;ll come off.</li>
            <li>i love the shine it has to them and they fit well on the nails not to small or to big but perfect</li>
            <li>Very pretty can&#x27;t wait to use them....</li>
            <li>They are VERY cute, but still larger then I was thinking.</li>
            <li>their big, but very cute</li>
            <li>They are very pretty</li>
            <li>These are so pretty and sparkly!</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>My clients love them,  but they are pretty big,  covers most of nail.</li>
            <li>I could have never found anything like this where I live for such a great price.  </li>
            <li>FYI, they are too large to really fit on the ring fingernail or pinky nail.  </li>
            <li>But I think they will make great Disney Bling added to a tiara  for the little girls, or even bling out some flip flops.</li>
            <li>they are cute, and  once i did mine, I had 4 other requests.....:)</li>
            <li>Other than that I loved them.</li>
            <li>very super dooper ooper cute large mickey nail art bits, i will not be using them however because they are way too big for my nails.</li>
            <li>I will most likely use them for a craft or project, not my nails.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>CUTE ITEMS, GIVEN AS A PRESENT.</li>
            <li>its so sparkly ;)</li>
            <li>Just recieved these and can&#x27;t wait to use the they are so pretty.</li>
            <li>They look expensive and beautiful!</li>
            <li>The quality is as good as they look,but because they&#x27;re not light weight</li>
            <li>As a nail tech I&#x27;m always looking for cool new things to create and design for nail art.</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>Easy to glue onto nails since the back is curved.  </li>
            <li>If you have large nail beds and don&#x27;t mind the raising of the Mickey then maybe these gems are for you.  </li>
            <li>and really don&#x27;t sit flush</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see how you could keep them on your nails, they would stick out way too much and get caught on things.</li>
            <li>your old daughter love them -especially</li>
            <li>I received this item relatively quickly for where it came from and the tiny amount I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>But super duper big.</li>
            <li>and they came in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>These little darlings are too cute for words, used them on our Disney Cruise</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE LOOK OF THESE LITTLE DIY ITEMS.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to apply them on a bare nail with nail, or crazy glue.</li>
            <li>but they are a little big and can be snagged of very easily</li>
            <li>They are pretty big.  </li>
            <li>then my wife expected the photo they use is a little misleading in the actual size if they were half the size they would be perfect</li>
            <li>Way too big,  I should have ready the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I love these nail jewelry except some where inflated out on the back, in other words, not flat to place on a nail.</li>
            <li>is my thumb, but I&#x27;m  affaid it will fall off easily because  they are a tiny heavy for nails</li>
            <li>Came a little late but gorgeous.</li>
            <li>it will turn clear and some too back of jewel when both sides are clear</li>
            <li>They are cute, but too thick to actually work as nail art, use them for something else...</li>
            <li>I used superglue directly to my bare nail.  </li>
            <li>One hint guys remember acrylic dont stick well too shiny surfaces use white block too smooth surface then apply a good base coat then a thin even coat of your favorite nail polish or polishes let DRY completely then on the back of the jewel</li>
            <li>but kind of thick and a bit heavy..</li>
            <li>Really like these, they are a little big for my nails</li>

            <li> If you apply them on top of polish most likely they&#x27;ll come off.</li>
            <li> i love the shine it has to them and they fit well on the nails not to small or to big but perfect</li>
            <li> Very pretty can&#x27;t wait to use them....</li>
            <li> They are VERY cute, but still larger then I was thinking.</li>
            <li> their big, but very cute</li>
            <li> They are very pretty</li>
            <li> These are so pretty and sparkly!</li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> My clients love them,  but they are pretty big,  covers most of nail.</li>
            <li> I could have never found anything like this where I live for such a great price.  </li>
            <li> FYI, they are too large to really fit on the ring fingernail or pinky nail.  </li>
            <li> But I think they will make great Disney Bling added to a tiara  for the little girls, or even bling out some flip flops.</li>
            <li> they are cute, and  once i did mine, I had 4 other requests.....:)</li>
            <li> Other than that I loved them.</li>
            <li> very super dooper ooper cute large mickey nail art bits, i will not be using them however because they are way too big for my nails.</li>
            <li> I will most likely use them for a craft or project, not my nails.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> CUTE ITEMS, GIVEN AS A PRESENT.</li>
            <li> its so sparkly ;)</li>
            <li> Just recieved these and can&#x27;t wait to use the they are so pretty.</li>
            <li> They look expensive and beautiful!</li>
            <li> The quality is as good as they look,but because they&#x27;re not light weight</li>
            <li> As a nail tech I&#x27;m always looking for cool new things to create and design for nail art.</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> Easy to glue onto nails since the back is curved.  </li>
            <li> If you have large nail beds and don&#x27;t mind the raising of the Mickey then maybe these gems are for you.  </li>
            <li> and really don&#x27;t sit flush</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see how you could keep them on your nails, they would stick out way too much and get caught on things.</li>
            <li> your old daughter love them -especially</li>
            <li> I received this item relatively quickly for where it came from and the tiny amount I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> But super duper big.</li>
            <li> and they came in a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> These little darlings are too cute for words, used them on our Disney Cruise</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE LOOK OF THESE LITTLE DIY ITEMS.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best to apply them on a bare nail with nail, or crazy glue.</li>
            <li> but they are a little big and can be snagged of very easily</li>
            <li> They are pretty big.  </li>
            <li> then my wife expected the photo they use is a little misleading in the actual size if they were half the size they would be perfect</li>
            <li> Way too big,  I should have ready the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I love these nail jewelry except some where inflated out on the back, in other words, not flat to place on a nail.</li>
            <li> is my thumb, but I&#x27;m  affaid it will fall off easily because  they are a tiny heavy for nails</li>
            <li> Came a little late but gorgeous.</li>
            <li> it will turn clear and some too back of jewel when both sides are clear</li>
            <li> They are cute, but too thick to actually work as nail art, use them for something else...</li>
            <li> I used superglue directly to my bare nail.  </li>
            <li> One hint guys remember acrylic dont stick well too shiny surfaces use white block too smooth surface then apply a good base coat then a thin even coat of your favorite nail polish or polishes let DRY completely then on the back of the jewel</li>
            <li> but kind of thick and a bit heavy..</li>
            <li> Really like these, they are a little big for my nails</li>
            <li> these are super thick too thick for use on natural nails.</li>
            <li> what I do is got a 180 grit file and rough up the back till the shine is gone.</li>
            <li> They are bigger then I expected them to be and with such a flat back and heavy mickey, they seem like they are going to be hard to get on and stay on.</li>
            <li> They are flat backed and slightly curved.</li>
            <li> Not sized for nails, not even long artificial  nails, much too big.</li>
            <li> I received these well before the due date.</li>
            <li> And DONT paint over them with polish, it ruins the shine from their facets.</li>
            <li> They are a little on the heavy side, so I recommend using them for an accent nail, not for all 10.</li>
            <li> These little gems added the crowning touch too and casual but classy nail design.</li>
            <li> Just the one on my thumb was giving me trouble when I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> to  heavy for the nails</li>
            <li> Unless you hate that look, these are still a tremendous buy.</li>
            <li> They arent really small, so nails kinda have to be longer to use them</li>
            <li> so not sure how they hold up.</li>
            <li> very heavy for nail art.</li>
            <li> they are kinda thick for your finger nails, maybe a toe nail would work.  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem with using these on your fingernails is they are thick, so they get caught on everything.  </li>
            <li> I have very small finger nails</li>
            <li> I just added a little crazy glue and it says on!</li>
            <li> They look silly to be put on a nail.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice I&#x27;m using these to make earrings</li>
            <li> These little darlings are too cute for words, used them on our Disney Cruise</li>
            <li> Way too big,  I should have ready the reviews.  These things are cute, but way too bulky for nails.  I thought they would be more of a stick on, something you can paint over.  They are massive.  They look silly to be put on a nail.  I will most likely use them for a craft or project, not my nails.</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> Perfect! Did take time for delivery that I almost forgot about it but what do you expect for the price.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get here but worth it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful will order again</li>
            <li> I bought these for Disney.  Luckily, I did a trial run.  They are huge and bulky.  If you have large nail beds and don&#x27;t mind the raising of the Mickey then maybe these gems are for you.  However, I wish someone had made a review like this so I wouldn&#x27;t have bought them.  As well my nail artist tried his very hardest and was able to get them on by using acrylic around them.  Then gel polish on top.  I would NEVER recommend for nails.  Cute for bedazzling or something among those lines.</li>
            <li> Came a little late but gorgeous.</li>
            <li> These are so pretty and sparkly!</li>
            <li> they are kinda thick for your finger nails, maybe a toe nail would work.  But I think they will make great Disney Bling added to a tiara  for the little girls, or even bling out some flip flops.</li>
            <li> These are so cute on ur nails. They arent really small, so nails kinda have to be longer to use them but they r adorable!</li>
            <li> Very very very cute, I loved them!  I&#x27;m a huge Mickey Mouse fan so these are my bling mickeys!! Pretty!</li>
            <li> These are nice and blingy--just what I wanted.  Easy to glue onto nails since the back is curved.  True to size listed.</li>
            <li> They are very cute however not usable on my nails. They are huge and I don&#x27;t see how I could ever where them at nail art. very heavy for nail art. More suitable for crafts which is what I will have to use them for.</li>
            <li> They are bigger then I expected them to be and with such a flat back and heavy mickey, they seem like they are going to be hard to get on and stay on.</li>
            <li> disney is our favorite place to go ,so when i seen these had to have them and im very pleased thanks</li>
            <li> As described. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> They are incredibly beautiful.  I can&#x27;t wait to put them on.  I didn&#x27;t expect the quality to be so good.  They really impressed me.</li>
            <li> they heavier and bulkier than i thought but they are still also nice and my daughters love them.</li>
            <li> Much larger then my wife expected the photo they use is a little misleading in the actual size if they were half the size they would be perfect</li>
            <li> Likem but they are a little big and can be snagged of very easily</li>
            <li> Just got these in today. Very pretty can&#x27;t wait to use them....</li>
            <li> As described and a quick ship.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love how the stones look like jewelry-grade--look like cubic zirconias mounted in silver colored prong settings--with intense sparkle and shine. These really need to be attached to the nail with super glue or very strong nail glue to keep them in place, unlike most nail gems which can be placed using clear polish. And DONT paint over them with polish, it ruins the shine from their facets. Downside--they look like Mickey Mouse heads and that&#x27;s what people think they are. Tried combining them close together but the shape just screams MM. Unless you hate that look, these are still a tremendous buy. One last note--be patient, they are shipped from China or Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Great and beautiful nail ornaments!  Great value too!  I received this item relatively quickly for where it came from and the tiny amount I paid for it.  I could have never found anything like this where I live for such a great price.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Cutest bling ever!!!!! But super duper big. Prob perfect for cell phone case! I wanted to wear one on my Disney trip.</li>
            <li> As a nail tech I&#x27;m always looking for cool new things to create and design for nail art. These 3D pieces are solo cute an  there are many ways and styles to explore. But the cool thing about these 3D pieces is that they are  not just for nail art, they can be used on cellphones hair pieces etc!!!!</li>
            <li> very super dooper ooper cute large mickey nail art bits, i will not be using them however because they are way too big for my nails. i may give them to my niece to glue to her cell phone case. came nicely packaged though, not the sellers fault... very cute product.</li>
            <li> Nice accent, piece, collecting nail art,  Held the shine under alot of hands in water.</li>
            <li> very cute, but as others have stated kind of large, especially  for nail art. The only nail I  think it will fit well on is my thumb, but I&#x27;m  affaid it will fall off easily because  they are a tiny heavy for nails</li>
            <li> way to big for nails and really don&#x27;t sit flush</li>
            <li> Got it on time it was told it ll be deliver. Looks just like the picture.very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I am such a Disney fan and I was looking for some really cute Disney nail decals to use for an up coming trip and these where perfect! so cute and such a great buy!</li>
            <li> product came as described. A++</li>
            <li> Perfect for nails and other decorations</li>
            <li> They were so beautiful and shiny! I love them so much, I will be a return customer! They are exactly what I ordered, great product!</li>
            <li> They as re bigger then the picture shown, but they are very nice. I will be using them to decorate something else.</li>
            <li> Om goodness these so cute and they came in a decent amount of time. I Ordered 20 and I am glad I did so. They are perfect!</li>
            <li> bought these for a friend, she loved them... told me they have a lot of sparkly and jazz... and arrived very fast, I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Great bling. Not sized for nails, not even long artificial  nails, much too big. They are flat backed and slightly curved.They are very sparkly and nicely made. I made some of mine into post earrings.</li>
            <li> Great touch to my nail art!</li>
            <li> These DIY items are very nice. The quality is as good as they look,but because they&#x27;re not light weight it&#x27;s best to apply them on a bare nail with nail, or crazy glue. If you apply them on top of polish most likely they&#x27;ll come off.</li>
            <li> These are very beautiful, but I wouldn&#x27;t use them for my fingernails.  I bought them for an upcoming trip to Disney, so I applied one to my nail for a test run.  I used superglue directly to my bare nail.  It stayed on for 2 1/2 days before falling off.  My biggest problem with using these on your fingernails is they are thick, so they get caught on everything.  Just the one on my thumb was giving me trouble when I washed my hair.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine having them on the rest.  FYI, they are too large to really fit on the ring fingernail or pinky nail.  It&#x27;s a shame they didn&#x27;t really work, because for those two days, I thought it looked great.  I&#x27;ll find another use for them, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I love the sliver color and the diamond in the mickey mouse shape. I haven&#x27;t used them yet but i will soon I am not to sure about the glue to use.</li>
            <li> I love these nail jewelry except some where inflated out on the back, in other words, not flat to place on a nail. Other than that I loved them.</li>
            <li> These little gems added the crowning touch too and casual but classy nail design. I love love these babies yes you only get ten but I used one per hand too the accent nail design that ties it all together. One hint guys remember acrylic dont stick well too shiny surfaces use white block too smooth surface then apply a good base coat then a thin even coat of your favorite nail polish or polishes let DRY completely then on the back of the jewel it&#x27;s smooth what I do is got a 180 grit file and rough up the back till the shine is gone. Then nail glue is good but don&#x27;t last long get Best Glue ever add a good coat too where you want jewel it will turn clear and some too back of jewel when both sides are clear affix the jewel hold add pressure and it will not move. Seal your design with a good gel clear  polish and cure for three minutes remove tacky layer with a bit of alcohol then dap cuticle oil massage on nails and cuticle and you all set</li>
            <li> They were not the same size as the last Mickey Heads I ordered from the same seller. Too big to put on nails.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and sparkles  Should have bought more</li>
            <li> to  heavy for the nails</li>
            <li> Really like these, they are a little big for my nails but we made them work</li>
            <li> CUTE ITEMS, GIVEN AS A PRESENT. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Larger then I thought</li>
            <li> They look nice..but kind of thick and a bit heavy..haven&#x27;t used them yet so not sure how they hold up.</li>
            <li> Everybody loves these</li>
            <li> Great quality, very cute.  I have very small finger nails so they just a tad too large for me, but going to give as gifts - they&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> adorable, sturdy and sit well on the nail</li>
            <li> omg i love these so much i am going to order more i love the shine it has to them and they fit well on the nails not to small or to big but perfect</li>
            <li> Luv them for my Minnie Mouse theme nails</li>
            <li> I received these well before the due date. They are beautiful and so sparkly lol. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> REALLY CUTE AND SHINY! I LOVE THE LOOK OF THESE LITTLE DIY ITEMS. I CAN NOT WAIT TO USE THEM IN A PROJECT!</li>
            <li> Super cute!  They are a little on the heavy side, so I recommend using them for an accent nail, not for all 10.</li>
            <li> I used this for my nails and i love it. I just added a little crazy glue and it says on! its so sparkly ;)</li>
            <li> To big. It doesn&#x27;t stay on your nail.</li>
            <li> love these, I&#x27;m a mickey mouse fan. good product.</li>
            <li> These are useful for all kinds of things! Including decorating my Magic Wristband!</li>
            <li> These are way to big to realistically used for nails. They were too big for any of my nails except the thumb. I really don&#x27;t see how you could keep them on your nails, they would stick out way too much and get caught on things. I was disappointed. I will probably end up using them as accents for my scrapbooks.</li>
            <li> I really should have ordered more then 1 pack.....they are cute, and  once i did mine, I had 4 other requests.....:)</li>
            <li> Love the thought of having Mickey Mouse on my fingernails... but the stick out way too much to be productive.  Cute item but it&#x27;s just something that I can&#x27;t use on my nails.  The Mickey Mouse heads catch everything when you have them on your nail</li>
            <li> These are fabulous sparkly and cute fit great on the nail wear them got many compliments and are so great .</li>
            <li> My lindos Pedro demasiado jigantes</li>
            <li> These charms are so cute</li>
            <li> These are so cute and fit very well on the nail</li>
            <li> Love them!! Thinking of putting an acrylic red bow on some to make them Minnie Mouse so cute!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved them. :-) I have clients that love Mickey, so had to purchase these. The rocks are Shiney and a good size to place on acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Received these today although it took 3 weeks to get them I&#x27;m none the less happy with them and can&#x27;t wait to show them to my nail tech and watch him do his magic with them!!!!</li>
            <li> Too bulky for nails.  Can not use these</li>
            <li> Great!  My clients love them,  but they are pretty big,  covers most of nail.</li>
            <li> Just recieved these and can&#x27;t wait to use the they are so pretty. Definitely would reorder them and recommend them.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how nice these are!  Very good quality.  They look expensive and beautiful!</li>
            <li> They are pretty big.  They are VERY cute, but still larger then I was thinking.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; received it fast! Will order again!</li>
            <li> their big, but very cute</li>
            <li> Ordered feburary 2nd and recieved them today, very cute and fits description perfectly.</li>
            <li> Somewhat pricey for what I paid and only received 10</li>
            <li> They are cute, but too thick to actually work as nail art, use them for something else...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet,but I&#x27;m excited too.I&#x27;ll send pic when I use them.I&#x27;ll probably be ordering some more soon.</li>
            <li> Much bigger than anticipated. Will not work for my nails. Maybe I can use them in a different craft project.</li>
            <li> love these but haven&#x27;t tried them yet.</li>
            <li> My 13 your old daughter love them -especially with our upcoming Disney trip!</li>
            <li> these are super thick too thick for use on natural nails. They are very pretty</li>
