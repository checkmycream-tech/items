            <li> This really works. I love this stuff I put my makeup at 8 in the morning and just 1 spray of this stuff after I&#x27;m done putting my makeup makes it matte all day for me and I have oily skin and also sweat a lot since I work at a restaurant.</li>
            <li> Came fast and kept my foundation on all Day! will deffinately be ordering more</li>
            <li> Been using this spray for about a week now, I use it with my matte poreless fit me foundation and it works great!</li>
            <li> Definitely helps my makeup last longer!</li>
            <li> Got to my house quick  and I like the product</li>
            <li> its make my mekeup great</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it texture that it produced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many setting sprays and this is by far the best for your money.</li>
            <li> I loved it!! Did what it said it would do. I don&#x27;t know what else to write there making me right more</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I touch my face a lot, and this spray keeps my makeup on my face and not on my paperwork.</li>
            <li> it work good i use it every day!!!!! last all day make up look like i just put it on, after along day!!!! love love love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day.  I&#x27;ll stick with My Model in A Bottle!</li>
            <li> Received mines today a day earlier than it was suppose to come ! Can&#x27;t wait to use it !</li>
            <li> I definitely think that it does absolutely NOTHING for me. Nothing about this spray is MATTE. If If spray it after applying my make up in the morning, I will have a shiny face 2 hours later, even when wearing a primer. When I don&#x27;t apply the spray, I am matte longer.  I was hoping this item would help but I guess you get what you pay for. MACs setting spray works best and it&#x27;s not even supposed to be a MATTE agent. I&#x27;m going to try SKindinavia&#x27;s anti-shine spray.</li>
            <li> This is great.  I was using a more expensive product that didn&#x27;t do what this one does. I love Amazon.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! Really gives matte look</li>
            <li> amazing, its full, the bottle was not messed up, everything in tact &amp; came on time</li>
            <li> Absolutely I love it! My make stays on longer !! Thank u</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and this product doesn&#x27;t last for very long. I&#x27;m oily after 2-3 hours; I was really hopeful when I bought this. It does help set makeup and helps makeup last just a little bit longer compared to when I didn&#x27;t use it. I ended up giving it to my sister who doesn&#x27;t have oily skin.</li>
            <li> product does not maintian oil level. i didn&#x27;t notice a difference after makeup application. I don&#x27;t think i will re-order this one</li>
            <li> Made skin much more oily</li>
            <li> This stuff works! Spray it on after you put your makeup on and it stays on all day!! Even with eyeliner. I was a bit iffy before I tried it because I always had a problem with my eye liner smearing, but when I spray this on, it last ALL DAY!!!!</li>
            <li> I loved this product. My makeup stays put all day. I work in a restaurant so I&#x27;m around heat all day. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my makeup melting.</li>
            <li> This stuff has my makeup lasting FOREVER!! I am beyond glad I found this. Even my cheap makeup can last as long as my expensive brands. Very happy with it. It isn&#x27;t sticky or smelly! Will be buying more and keeping around for my everyday routine this is now a must have.</li>
            <li> Love just as much as the Mac fix +</li>
            <li> not bad for regular use, but after 10 hours kinda cakey</li>
