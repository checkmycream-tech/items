            <li>Great price, love the ease of applying and color, but it is  Estee&lt;br /&gt;Lauder, so</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>The color is a bit light, but good for summer.</li>

            <li>I did pay lot of many for many years at Macy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again!&lt;br /&gt;KH California</li>
            <li>Color is ok but wears off within an hour</li>
            <li>Beautiful, moist and lovely color, all for a very low price.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the lovely packaging, tissue paper and quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>remarkable, many thanks to the seller for fast delivery</li>
            <li>Still, it was cheap.</li>
            <li>It feels like a cheap lip balm.</li>
            <li>It didnt look like it was original product.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how many Estee Lauder items I was able to get on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>it was kind of melted UPS left the package in front of my door on 90 degree heat.</li>
            <li>Live this color but just be aware that this is the size you get in the Lauder free gifts.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it is my favorite lipstick and My local Estée Lauder counter doesn&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li>Love the pure Color crystal lipstick, I would order that again next year.  </li>
            <li>A beautiful soft classy shade of pink.</li>
            <li>Not especially long wearing but easy to apply without a mirror</li>
            <li>Pleasant th soft texture and a slight odor.</li>
            <li>I really prefer these lighter shades.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the real lipstick.</li>
            <li>i guess that my three star rating only has to do with the color because the consistency and the quality is good but the crystal pink was much darker than i had thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Very good!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing as well.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth but not much for color.  </li>
            <li>hope the company provide the new products (the produced date) for us.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am not sure the seller is selling authentic merchandise.  </li>
            <li>I bought this lipstick for my adult daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>The Crystal Pink is a nice color for everyday at working time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but it&#x27;s definitely not a sweet light candy pink as it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li>Pretty,but more subtle than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Pretty demure shade of pink.</li>
            <li>It was old and of low quality.  </li>
