            <li>They&#x27;re very strong and well made, you won&#x27;t have any complaints!</li>
            <li>Most of those brushes I couldn&#x27;t find a good use to them except the blush and the angle brush but the quality is very good</li>
            <li>the bright side</li>
            <li>Good handles.</li>

            <li>They hold the make up well and feel good when used.  </li>
            <li>Good to apply anything on your face.</li>
            <li>Fair price too.</li>
            <li>This is a good group of brushes.</li>
            <li>Brushes are good quality for that aspiring makeup artist.</li>
            <li>so my friend that is an expert with make-up and uses MAC products told me that I made a good investment to start out</li>
            <li>Makeup Brush Set 1206 is a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li>These brushes are a really nice quality for a great price.</li>
            <li>I think really good value.</li>
            <li>and if this is all you need or you&#x27;re not bothered if your makeup brushes don&#x27;t match then this would be a good set for you.</li>
            <li>If your looking for good quality without breaking the bank these are the brushes to get.</li>
            <li>was so good.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>These are very nice brushes, and they come with a handy, nicely-designed pouch to store them in.</li>
            <li>I just use my conditioner to clean out the brushes once a week and its&#x27; perfect.</li>
            <li>The are full and work great!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the brushes overall are a wonderful product at a great price!</li>
            <li>The packaging is very cute and Eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased</li>

            <li>Gonna get more for her now!</li>
            <li>Just bought it for the angle brush, but end up using/ love in the powder which i use for contour and the bag which i use for holding my pencils :p...</li>
            <li>In my opnion, the best feature is that brushes don&#x27;t scratch up the product into large chunks, they pick up smallest particles.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing also you can find these on Wal-Mart</li>
            <li>These Brushes Are Amazing.</li>
            <li>All of the brush are amazing.</li>
            <li>this was an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Well, they are amazing.</li>
            <li>These are amazing quality synthetic make-up brushes made from bamboo and recycled materials.</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best.</li>
            <li>Nice bag to carry the brushes as well</li>
            <li>Theyre nice i guess.</li>
            <li>This whole line of brushes is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>The brushes work nicely as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this brush set.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of a dual deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sixth piece, the bag, is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Makeup sticks well to the brushes when I want it to comes but off nicely when I&#x27;m applying it</li>
            <li>They work really, really well with mineral make-up and feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li>and she liked it</li>
            <li>This way everything blends nicely into skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Would recommend the eye shadow kit as it has a nice variation of bushes for all eye shadow work.</li>
            <li>Also I was impressed with how fast they came.</li>
            <li>and I have always liked them.</li>
            <li>The case they come in is quite handy for traveling, as well.</li>
            <li>These were really nice and did not shed.</li>
            <li>Good quality makes my makeup looks greater than before.</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best brushes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>The quality and softness is nice but they just didn&#x27;t serve their purpose.</li>
            <li>Love eco tools for good affordable brushes that won&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
            <li>Kind of defeats the purpose</li>
            <li>The eyeliner brush is nice</li>
            <li>Comes in a nice lil carrying bag.</li>
            <li>nice quality too.</li>
            <li>It was a great set for a guy like myself who isn&#x27;t that familiar with the makeup world to use.</li>
            <li>Love this - the brushes are soft, good quality, and best of all, eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>I showed my new purchase to my mom, and she was so impressed by them (and the price!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new in Amazon and I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
            <li>The blush brush is absolutely the best blush brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, it&#x27;s the softest and most versatile</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The largest brush is perfect for blush and so soft!  </li>
            <li>I gave these brushes 4 stars because I do own brushes that are better in quality -</li>
            <li>I honestly like these brushes better than the ones that come w/</li>
            <li>They are all really soft, but apply makeup flawlessly.</li>
            <li>These Ecotools are so soft and work GREAT!</li>
            <li>Great price and WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li>Got a Tweezerman folding eyelash comb instead, much more effective.</li>
            <li>This is the best makeup brushes I have used so far.</li>
            <li>love them they&#x27;re amazing</li>
            <li>For those wanting good eco products, these brushes fit the bill.</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you can actually clean it with water and they are still good :)</li>
            <li>The brush in the set that is labeled for eye shadow is just ok, perhaps would be more suitable for cream shadow?</li>
            <li>All the brushes are perfect, they are really soft and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Seriously great product for a super cheap price.</li>

            <li>LOve them.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re supposed to pick up more pigment and all).</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute plastic case and everything.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where you could find better brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>I love the softness of the bristles</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>ah I love ecotools... always have..</li>
            <li>but they do a much better job of applying it also</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Most of all I love my angled brush and my concealer brush.</li>
            <li>i love them.</li>
            <li>so i am so glad that I decided to purchase these.</li>
            <li>and I really love them.</li>
            <li>I started buying this brand about 5 years ago and just love the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li>The brow brush has the softest and most defining bristles that I&#x27;ve ever owned though it&#x27;s nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li>The concealer brush is actually better for eyeshadow but also serves its purpose</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I ordered a set from BH Cosmetics that are cheaper in price and better in quality</li>
            <li>I love ecotool brushes.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t love them.</li>
            <li>i like most here</li>
            <li>but i would use more eventually.i dont use the concealer brush at all.overall</li>
            <li>but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Some of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the powder brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush set</li>
            <li>So glad i purchased this set</li>
            <li>When I get some more money, I&#x27;m planning on getting the 5-piece set with the mineral powder brush</li>
            <li>I love this product :)</li>
            <li>I use it to provide liquid foundation, it works better than I thought.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>the brushes look even better in person.</li>
            <li>I love all Ecotools products.</li>
            <li>so you won&#x27;t hear comments on how I&#x27;m so glad that my makeup brushes don&#x27;t harm the environment</li>
            <li>They also come in a cute zip bag, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s biodegradable like the brushes are.</li>
            <li>Love the softness of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the angled eyeliner brush.  </li>
            <li>I also love the softness of the blush and powder brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I bought this package mostly for the blush brush</li>
            <li>(more splayed out like a fan than like a cone).</li>
            <li>The brush is longer then most which makes them easier to use.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>my grand daughter ended up using it to hold her room card, which she kept loosing.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for women who travel but also like to take makeup.</li>
            <li>and bamboo is such a great and versatile material!</li>
            <li>MOST.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>Better price than in-store.</li>
            <li>The soft bristles are perfectly combined with comfortable bamboo grips.  </li>
            <li>I like these brushes okay.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging, and of course the brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been updating my collection, and am really satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>much better price</li>

            <li>just very essential brushes at a great price!</li>
            <li>I love the brushes and the carrying case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit better after an olive oil treatment, but still.</li>
            <li>Got to love the brow brush though.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon:-) :-)</li>
            <li>Planning to purchase more from Ecotools and will recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>I love all of their products and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes are lovely.</li>
            <li>This was the type of set that got me to start using EcoTools :-)</li>
            <li>That said in my latest foray into self improvement</li>
            <li>and I found I actually enjoyed putting makeup on.</li>
            <li>I love the shape of these and the quality.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Beginners and pros will enjoy the quality!</li>
            <li>It opens from the top, rather from the side as pictured.  </li>
            <li>My sister love this eco tools bamboo.</li>

            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>One con with the Bamboo brushes is that the eyeshadow brush could be a bit more flexible in movement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.</li>
            <li>they feel nice and quality, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>High quality, comes with a cute bag, great for someone who doesn&#x27;t need a lot of brushes or is looking for an on-the-go set.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and great for the price.</li>
            <li>Super soft &amp; is very much loved!!!</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>brush works pretty good</li>
            <li>A makeup artist told me that these were pretty good quality to do a makeup at home.</li>
            <li>It is a complete set to makeup, and good material, nice set.</li>
            <li>The brushes are great quality and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very natural and work great.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and seem to be great quality.  </li>
            <li>Well made and I love the wood handles and fine brushes.</li>
            <li>This is a very good basic brush set.  </li>
            <li>Anyway they work wonderfully and are very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy spending more time</li>
            <li>And it makes me happy that they are all natural.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic. :)</li>
            <li>They are soft and great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soo soft and great quality.</li>
            <li>This brush set was so cheap, I wasn&#x27;t sure what the quality would be like.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product; it&#x27;s fantastic for the price.</li>
            <li>I know elf sells cheap ones, but I needed more sturdy brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get overly detailed in my make-up application, so I don&#x27;t need more than this 6 piece set.  </li>
            <li>good quality , thanks.</li>
            <li>Good product with reasonable price</li>
            <li>The brushes are fantastic and the carrying case is super handy.  </li>
            <li>eyeshadow brush is perfect for your base/lid color or to do an all-over monochromatic look; blush brush is the perfect size for your cheeks (although if you want to do a more contoured look it&#x27;s difficult because it&#x27;s so large).  </li>
            <li>The bristles feel soft and apply makeup very nicely.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s recycled and it&#x27;s environment friendly.</li>
            <li>love the little bag, great for travelling!</li>
            <li>Make-up goes on easily.</li>
            <li>Excellent brushes, although I only find the blush brush useful.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry and use.</li>
            <li>I use for foundation and blush/bronzer and these can easily compete.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal for someone who will be using all the various brushes, who wears more makeup than I do.</li>
            <li>I received them very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, and they come in a nice cloth holder to keep them nice.</li>
            <li>These brushes have lasted me about two years and their still going strong.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for some decent, good quality brushes.</li>
            <li>This is a great broad purpose set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>These came super quickly and I really love them!</li>
            <li>eyeliner brush is defined and angled perfectly for use with gel liner or just a dark eyeshadow to line your eyes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need half of the brushes and tools but it is perfect for carrying things.</li>
            <li>I just wrap them up and then use a hairtye around the bag though, which works just fine.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great, soft and full.</li>
            <li>Very soft and feels good while using them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and they do a good job of distributing product where you want it.</li>
            <li>The blush brush is really good at distributing product evenly and it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft, great construction - haven&#x27;t lost any bristles and have been using them for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t hugely significant, but I was looking forward to easily organizing these brushes and now feel like I just have to throw them all in there.  </li>
            <li>The blush brush is great, too - it doesn&#x27;t apply too heavily so you can layer nicely.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The fact that the product is not harmful to the environment is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Flimsy, cheap feeling, nothing I would have bought if I had seen them in person.  </li>
            <li>cheap ones</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and won&#x27;t break like cheap drugstore ones.  </li>
            <li>Work really well and nice quality.</li>
            <li>She has been very happy with the quality and has thanked me a few times for them.</li>
            <li>But the entire set is a great deal.</li>
            <li>Nice set of make up brushes that have held up very well.</li>
            <li>Make up goes on smoothly with these brushes.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a great buy especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I bought a concealer brush and foundation brush to go along with this set.  </li>
            <li>They are absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>its fantastic.</li>
            <li>(Yes I know they were free, but they were still from a \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; makeup company and should have been comparable to something I can get at Kmart.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone who needs a set of cheap but well-made make up brushes.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much I bought the eye brush set too.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that such a reasonably-priced set works so well for makeup application.</li>
            <li>These brushes are affordable, easy to clean, and held up well over time.</li>
            <li>The handles fit comfortably.</li>
            <li>They feel like cheap plastic, not bamboo.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and it shows in all</li>
            <li>It would be a great Christmas present for any girl.</li>
            <li>I have MAC brushes that shed and wasn&#x27;t thrilled about spending so much money for brush that sheds.</li>
            <li>I also really needed a nice angle brush for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and feel good.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice and soft, I love the feel of them.</li>
            <li>They are good quality, soft, and versatile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed them multiple times with gentle soaps (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and a Trader Joe&#x27;s bar soap), and they&#x27;ve done wonderfully.</li>
            <li>No shedding so far, really good quality.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and the handles are of good quality.</li>
            <li>Priced right and clean easily!  </li>
            <li>The set comes with pretty much all the basics you might need, and it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li>Very nice package bought at a reasonable price and particularly like because  the brushes are eco friendly.</li>
            <li>enjoying the brushes very much..</li>
            <li>and they still look new, I love them even more.</li>
            <li>It is significantly cheaper than buying them in a store.</li>
            <li>oh, &amp; eco friendly</li>
            <li>My friend has used them long time ago and she always told me how great they were</li>
            <li>I am very happy now I can buy brushes that do not shed or cost a small fortune.</li>
            <li>then the bare minerals brushes, and i think they feel just as good.</li>
            <li>I bought these based on a youtube recommendation and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I am excited about my brushes.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li>I need to see if they clean well, though.  </li>
            <li>I wish the fabric part was easier to clean</li>
            <li>Brushes are holding up nicely and are soft!  </li>
            <li>I like the little bag they come in, and the size of each is ideal.</li>
            <li>They are soft and Clean up nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really understanding the reviews on this brush set, because it is great</li>
            <li>So soft and the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>I use these brushes daily and they hold up great and work very well!</li>
            <li>Nice quality and soft.</li>
            <li>The bag is a cool design.</li>
            <li>This set was an overall good value.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good price, ecofriendly, probably would recommend this if you are starting up with makeup.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely not Sigma quality, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
            <li>Good deal for the pack, although you will probably end up using only 1 or 2 of the brushes.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and hold mineral makeup nicely.  </li>
            <li>The brushes well made and the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It might just be the one I bought though, but I was kind of surprised.</li>
            <li>Check out my full review at: emeraldsugar dot com and click on ecotools</li>
            <li>Nice soft brushes, convenient carry case.  </li>
            <li>Very soft bristles, very easy to get an even application of pigment/powders with these brushes.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles, no shed, great quality! &amp; a cute little pouch!</li>
            <li>Other than that the product is great, hence the 5 stars.</li>
            <li>My other blush brush used to shed all the time, so I was happy that this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is great too, and has a linen pocket on the other side.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to fix it with some super glue</li>
            <li>Lovely package with an extra pocket to store more products.</li>
            <li>I have an older set as well, and they hold up after cleaning and many uses.</li>
            <li>particular set, however, doesn&#x27;t have my favorite eco tools eye shadow brush shapes.</li>
            <li>Still super soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE the Ecotools Kabuki brush and their foundation brush is decent but I would pass on this set.</li>
            <li>I actually washed the foundation brush as well as the smaller fat brush today with antibacterial dish soap and they wash great too!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great brushes for starting out and they&#x27;re very versatile.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not impossible to do so.</li>
            <li>High end brushes shed more than these ever will.</li>
            <li>Mine have lasted up to 2 years and all you need to do to clean them is to clean them with hot water in a mild soap.  </li>
            <li>These are no different, come in a cute little pouch that&#x27;s perfect for throwing in your bag for on the go use.</li>
            <li>I got the 6 piece make up set the other day, and they&#x27;re really very nice.</li>
            <li>Very pleased and plan to buy  a second to store at my gym locker.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good for makeup application and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>, she says the brushes are very soft and is satisfied with them.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not a fan of is the case, I wish they had come in something more durable that they didn&#x27;t fall out of!</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I actually use the brush blush in place of my Bare Minerals flawless face brush because this one is much softer.</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft but sturdy and the bag makes me feel much better than the plastic souvenir ones</li>
            <li>They are super soft :)</li>
            <li>but these brushes are very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles on these brushes are unbelievably soft and the handles are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so easy to use and clean and extremely soft too!</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft also the tiny cute bag that come with comes handy to carry them around in my purse.</li>
            <li>Makes this a great little pack for travel.</li>
            <li>Had great reviews, I was happy about the Eco friendly aspect, but honestly was a little disappointed, they work ok, but probably will replace them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now and they are really great quality.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a cheap, high quality set!</li>
            <li>Worth buying them.</li>
            <li>These are the brushes give you your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>For the money these make-up brushes are worth it.  </li>
            <li>love  them they&#x27;re so soft</li>
            <li>I love these soft bristled brushes.</li>
            <li>It helps that they came in a case that is also useful.  </li>
            <li>Honest, I would have paid the amount of the entire set for just the blush brush, itself.</li>
            <li>but I actually don&#x27;t mind because I like a light look and rather go In again if needed more</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft and the tote bag is cute.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they hold up very well.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Soft as silk and easy to maintain and clean</li>
            <li>Each and every one of them was useful and durable.</li>
            <li>Definetly worth the money</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this because I decided maybe people would treat me as more of a professional if I wore makeup (Freakily it worked</li>
            <li>Pretty cool.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Nice bamboo handles.. Definitely deserve a 5 star.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>but I had so much fun with these brushes.</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes alongside the eye set, and I gotta say they worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and a cheaper and better alternative from MAC and other top brush brands.</li>
            <li>and it came super fast!</li>
            <li>I LOVE that their function is marked on the handle (i.e. concealer, large eye, blush...)!</li>
            <li>These are just as good, last just as long, and you get so much more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend EcoTools to everyone who is looking for a good quality low cost Brush set.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t get a professional-quality brush set for this price, right?  </li>
            <li>that she asked me right away to order another set for her, which I just did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag that comes with the brushes is also just the right size for a traveling makeup bag.</li>
            <li>These brushes were just the right addition.</li>
            <li>Not the best quality.. kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li>I like their brushes in general though, soft and good for skin.</li>
            <li>Well I purchased these brushes and they are very soft, easy to clean, and very durable.</li>
            <li>Im kind of sensitive to make up particularly brushes but this one, you wont even hesitate to use it the first time you put your hand on it.</li>
            <li>Eco-friendly, cruelty free, super soft.</li>
            <li>I would go over and apply blush 5 or more times just to have it barely visible on my skin.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good for padding on color, but I&#x27;m having difficulty blending with them given their slight stiffness.</li>
            <li>They are soft, easy to handle, and hold the make-up well.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash and still remained the soft texture.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, no need to buy the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The copper is the NEW style for 2013!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great set of brushes for the price, but you may still have to buy a powder/blush brush as the one that comes with is very stiff.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonable in the price, still using them to this day.</li>
            <li>While I will always love that other company and be devoted to their products, these are a fabulous stand-</li>
            <li>The clean fast and keep on working very well.  </li>
            <li>Just disappointed because they really are beautiful, and I liked the idea of them being eco friendly.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looing for</li>
            <li>Came on time, was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>The brushes are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed, but they don&#x27;t apply makeup on very well!</li>
            <li>This is my first ecotools set</li>
            <li>,i use it to remove excess mascara.the liner brush is ok sturdy but seems too big to me</li>
            <li>I like this set because I don&#x27;t like to have any more brushes than necessary.</li>
            <li>I love the canvas pouch it comes in - there&#x27;s a separate pocket in the back that can hold makeup</li>
            <li>Got this as a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; set for my teen and ended up buying more for me.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and comfortable to your skin.</li>
            <li>also there is more description how to use brushes on back of packaging.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>To clarify, I didn&#x27;t exactly buy these because they were Eco-friendly</li>
            <li>Before giving it, I made sure to open it up and check the brushes.</li>
            <li>(: ps: I&#x27;ve seen these brushes for a lot more, so you&#x27;re definitely getting a steal here!</li>
            <li>I bought this pack when I first saw it at the store.  </li>
            <li>this set are pretty sub-par and I don&#x27;t reach for them at all.  </li>
            <li>I love the different choices of the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I wish the concealer brush was a bit smaller and more flexible, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This set is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed for eye makeup.</li>
            <li>$5.00 off your first purchase (No Minimum)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>/&gt;  $10.00 off your first purchase when you spend $40.00 or more&lt;</li>
            <li>First set was for me, this set was for my mum.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really pretty.</li>
            <li>I really recommend trying them!</li>
            <li>More than enough to apply all your makeup.</li>
            <li>I have since bought 3 more sets that have different uses.</li>
            <li>has the brush I need first.</li>
            <li>which was amazing quality esp for the price, but I recently but a new set and the quality is severely diminished.</li>
            <li>I am brand-spankin new to the world of makeup and in love the bamboo handles and how soft they are.</li>
            <li>These brushes are fantastic and the set is sold at a super low price.</li>
            <li>, they apply makeup well, hey clean well, and they dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>The case is very convenient and they pick up just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>Very nice set of brushes with quality synthetic Teklon bristles (most other brushes are made with the hair of dead goats, badgers, squirrels, etc.).  </li>
            <li>Also, really like the fact that these brushes are made from natural materials, recycled materials and are stated as &#x27;cruelty free&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set - I&#x27;ve only used the blush brush and one of the eye shadow brushes so far.  </li>
            <li>I use to own a few high retail brushes that were gifted of course, but since they are now about 5 years old, they started shedding on my face every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very pretty brushes and are very soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and full, and it doesn&#x27;t come off/shred when you use it.</li>
            <li>the eye brushes arent too small its a good size.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought eco-tools in the past, with good experiences.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the extreme softness of these brushes and they hold just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>Great quality, very soft, and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>They are also super soft.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all super soft.</li>
            <li>so its a lot less effective, also for the biggest one the shape has changed</li>
            <li>The brushes are very high quailty.</li>
            <li>this is a nice little brush set.  </li>
            <li>nice little pouch to store them in.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I mainly wash them because I&#x27;m washing my Bare Minerals brushes at the same time.</li>
            <li>If you get this set for your make-up, it will fit one eyeliner, 1 mascara, 1 blush and one or two eyeshadows just fine, with a space left over for earrings or tweezers or something equally tiny.  </li>
            <li>Ive had them for a few months now and they are still in great shape even after constant use.</li>
            <li>The cloth bag that they come with is great: has elastic loops to firmly hold all the brushes in, and a zippered compartment in case you want to carry extra makeup etc.</li>
            <li>Pro is that the brushes don&#x27;t shed, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>con is that the brushes don&#x27;t hold shadow or blush very well.</li>
            <li>They apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li>I am just bummed that the slanted brush isn&#x27;t straight with the set i got.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much since the</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very affordable make up brush set.</li>
            <li>They blend very well.</li>
            <li>too soft?as in it doesn&#x27;t pick up much product</li>
            <li>The blush brush is very static-ky when you apply powder.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li>I was searching for a great brush that wouldn&#x27;t put me in the poor house.</li>
            <li>Very eco-friendly, which feeds my vanity.</li>
            <li>I tried one of those, and gave the whole set to a friend who didn&#x27;t have any brushes.  </li>
            <li>The angled eyeliner brush is thin which is great for putting on gel eyeliner,</li>
            <li>In all honesty I would chose real techniques brushes over these.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>For my every day look I use these for contouring powders I need to use a light hand with, and the crease of my eye shadow because they do not hold enough for an all over application.</li>
            <li>but i do recommend trying them before you buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li>and I use the foundation brush very often.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed them 2-3 times since I purchased them and they are holding up really well too.</li>
            <li>It picks up product very well.</li>
            <li>However I was really bummed that the make up bag is not what was shone in the pictures.</li>
            <li>EcoTools products are very well made &amp; resonably priced.  </li>
            <li>cause my whole makeup bag was stolen from my luggage on a trip.</li>
            <li>This brush set is very durable and affordable.</li>
            <li>He said he now knew why girls did make up every day, it was really to do a face massage every morning.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast as well.</li>
            <li>Although my only complaint about the powder brush I also reviewed was that it was too soft for a powder brush, these brushes are perfect for what they are meant to do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are rated really well on amazon and youtube and they can be found at Target and the Christmas tree shop if you would like to them in person.</li>
            <li>Hairs don&#x27;t come out so far and my younger brother is pleased.</li>
            <li>So, I am not a huge make-up wearer but these brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes were kind of stiff, and didn&#x27;t really pick up much product.</li>
            <li>Love Eco Tools brushes, they last super long</li>
            <li>, I have another ecotools brush that is more rounded and fluffy as opposed to flat, which feels nicer on my eyes and is much better for blending.</li>
            <li>Very well made - and the bristles do not fall out like in so many other brands.</li>
            <li>nice, came in a nice little zipper pouch, although this will be a gift, so not sure on the specifics of how they feel and work..</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and very soft feel.</li>
            <li>they are my first set of makeup brushes, and they are so so soft!</li>
            <li>(Always goes back to it&#x27;s original texture)</li>
            <li>The 6pc Makeup Brush Set comes with a small bag to store the brushes in and its absolutely adorable!</li>
            <li>Brushes do not fall apart, just as many other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li>The bamboo handles feel sturdy and light weight, and the brush heads seem secure and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>I use the eye shading in this set versus the other set, it packs the color on a lot better.</li>
            <li>The Bare Minerals ones I have kind of drag across my face even after washing,</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I am not a girly girl, so I am probably not the most knowledgable reviewer here because I&#x27;ve never owned a set of brushes before, just a few sponges.</li>
            <li>I would probably spend all day smooshing my face with it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that that&#x27;s not a socially acceptable way of conducting oneself in public!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience in using makeup brushes but they feel very high quality and may even be better than the more expensive options.</li>
            <li>Of course your going to want the more expensive brushes that are absolutely flawless (we all do), but its always nice to have a good quality backup set for times when you don&#x27;t get around to cleaning your more expensive brushes or wan to give your expensive brushes a break.</li>
            <li>The much larger blush brush dries more quickly than my smaller Bare Minerals foundation brush.</li>
            <li>All the bristles are pretty soft.</li>
            <li>It also has a zippered portion on it to keep some small pots of makeup, which is nice because I was needing something like that.</li>
            <li>they are bamboo and the bristles are so soft and apply very well!</li>
            <li>It even has concealor &amp; blush which don&#x27;t usually use but comes in handy.</li>
            <li>They also seem to dry pretty quickly, too.</li>
            <li>I needed a new brush set, and a set that wasn&#x27;t made from animal products, both because the bristles shed too much, and I don&#x27;t want to contribute to that type of business.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now had the brushes for three months, and they&#x27;ve held up very well and still feel new.</li>
            <li>its slightly flatter and more feathered out.</li>
            <li>it comes in as my main makeup travel bag.</li>
            <li>makes for a decent 12 piece set (thats 10 brushes and 2 cases for the brushes).</li>
            <li>Maybe I was spoiled by the older edition(bought</li>
            <li>/&gt;One thing I noticed about this listing though: the main picture shows brushes with copper metal and the others show silver.</li>
            <li>i particularly like the eyelash/eyebrow groomer.</li>
            <li>I seriously love it and would definitely recommend it to everyone especially to beginners.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are a good size and even the powder brush was large enough so it didn&#x27;t leave streaks like small brushes can.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and make makeup application much faster and easier.</li>
            <li>Very soft and they do not shed!</li>
            <li>They are very soft and for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>Very soft!</li>
            <li>highly reccomended you get them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Saw these in Ride Aide the the price was way to high so decided to check Amazon site...</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this brand.  </li>
            <li>My brother borrowed one for a stage play he did in high school.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I supplemented the set with a liquid foundation brush ([[ASIN:B00A44H6MC Bamboo Ecotools Soft Makeup Cosmetic Foundation Powder Blush Brush Beauty Tool]]), a powder brush ([[ASIN:B001KYVLSU EcoTools Large Powder Brush]]), and a retractable powder brush that I used as a mineral foundation</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brush is nice but in all honesty, it&#x27;s a bit large and either picks up too little or too much at different times.</li>
            <li>brushes are SO soft, I can&#x27;t  stop rubbing them on my face!!</li>
            <li>I wish they would hold the product a little better.</li>
            <li>It comes in a cute little pack.</li>
            <li>Brushes have withstood many washings, by hand with a little soapy water and air dries.  </li>
            <li>They are ego friendly of course, which to me isn&#x27;t a big deal, I mean sure go green, save energy, but I don&#x27;t really stress about it, if its something I don&#x27;t plan on throwing away for many years, if ever.</li>
            <li>This set is very well made, soft, and applies product well.</li>
            <li>The foundation brush is so soft and really blends liquid or cream foundation</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find out how reasonable they were.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and do the job VERY well.</li>
            <li>It picks up such a delicate amount of product that you can build up your blush or keep it light :)</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the added benefit is always worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>the eye brush set will fit in that pocket along with small make up as well (also good to have that small mirror).the bag has velcro which will hold the bag over the brushes to protect them too.</li>
            <li>far this set has been very useful, I&#x27;ve used only the blush brush and the eyebrow/eyelash brush so far.</li>
            <li>However, i use all of the other brushes and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>So many makeup brushes cost a lot of money then don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>They are soft and don&#x27;t shed, and do a decent job (I like the blush brush better than the eye shadow one - wish it was a little softer.  </li>
            <li>brushes are super soft against your skin, especially the blush brush.</li>
            <li>I wash them every 6 months with shampoo and water and they are like new again.</li>
            <li>and they still work like new.</li>
            <li>Looks like they are brand new after being washed...</li>
            <li>Along with my new and improved makeup, I wanted some nicer brushes.</li>
            <li>I had to buy new ones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a conservative girl, you don&#x27;t buy something new if you already have something that can do the job.</li>
            <li>and you won&#x27;t need new ones ANYTIME soon</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft, and all are performing very well so far.</li>
            <li>I actually have an e.l.f. angled liner brush that came for free with one of my orders that feels softer and works the same.</li>
            <li>I love the little carrying pouch that these brushes came in!</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and work well.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all very soft and well made.</li>
            <li>very soft.</li>
            <li>These, however, are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are also very soft and well made.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and do not irritate.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft and have been holding up well</li>
            <li>They are very soft and I have not had one break yet.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft on your face.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes and hair does not fall out even after washing them every 2 weeks to maintain care.</li>
            <li>Very Soft brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bridges are soft!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and they pick up makeup like nobody&#x27;s business!</li>
            <li>but them i read the packaging and say that it said that it did not, a small mistake on my part.</li>
            <li>but I find myself only using three of them, consistently.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>As soon as I received I naturally diva&#x27;ed out in the mirror and wowser!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to go out and buy $50 professional makeup brushes believe me!</li>
            <li>These brushes are soooo soft!</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented, but these brushes barely picked anything up.</li>
            <li>Quality brushes...very soft!</li>
            <li>The silver is the old!</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and they dont shed!</li>
            <li>;) I just recently used the brushes...</li>
            <li>they are tremendously soft and my makeup goes on more smooth than the other brushes that I had in the past.</li>
            <li>I ordered this set because one of my friends had the same exact one.</li>
            <li>Most of the \\&quot;makeup brush kits\\&quot; don&#x27;t have the ones you usually use</li>
            <li>really recommend these brushes, and ecotools in general, to anyone who loves makeup.</li>
            <li>I used the big brush first to apply mineral powder.</li>
            <li>I bought the brush set that is for applying  makeup after seeing a professional makeup artist, apply liquid foundation with a brush!</li>
            <li>These are really soft brushes!</li>
            <li>The first set held up for 5 years of almost daily use.</li>
            <li>I mean, not much to say about that, all of the good quality ones are pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes, praying that the blush brush would be soft &amp; not hard on my skin.</li>
            <li>They are very well made with no loose bristles.</li>
            <li>I wanted natural brushes to go with my new organic makeup.</li>
            <li>also i like that i can fit it into my small purses for on the go and wont take up too much room in my makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of brushes in the past but these are supremely comfortable and very efficient at doing their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Disappointed bristles are so soft it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li>Very soft and so far no shedding.</li>
            <li>While it is probably all the positive reinforcement, who knows, my body might actually prefer the none chemical loaded brushes.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are soft, natural and have what each brush is to be used for printed on them!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m hoping the quality has increased the slight amount I need for the foundation brush (the style seems to have changed), but I likely won&#x27;t be able to tell you for another five years.</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t open more than a half inch before the zipper tab broke off.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for the slanted eyeliner brush, but that particular brush is kind of weird.</li>
            <li>The reason its 4 stars is because of the brow brush seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li>and they felt very oil-like, kind of weird on the fingers.</li>
            <li>the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>And they are so so soft.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t comment on whether it&#x27;s \\&quot;professional quality\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, or the fact that they are synthetic (I myself prefer natural bristles, as any makeup aficionado does).  </li>
            <li>The bristles are SO soft and they pick up a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>The blush brush is too soft, does not apply blush like I wanted it too.</li>
            <li>This set is also much cheaper than buying the brushes individually at Wal-Mart!</li>
            <li>Soft as well.</li>
            <li>the brushes are well made, soft, and professional.</li>
            <li>In To Look Natural</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised when I used them.  </li>
            <li>I only really use the blush brush, concealer, and eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really soft...</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and I washed them and they didn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles that do not shed.</li>
            <li>Bristles do not fall out and stay soft.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still perfectly soft, and I haven&#x27;t lost any bristles during cleaning.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is so soft for the face  ..</li>
            <li>So far none of the brushes have shed.  </li>
            <li>Each was sturdy with soft bristles.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and they changed up the blush brush a bit.</li>
            <li>These are really soft.</li>
            <li>These brushes are sooooo soft.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft, I&#x27;m really surprised that they aren&#x27;t animal?</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft, though.</li>
            <li>The case has a front and back pocket, very convenient.</li>
            <li>I also like the case they come in because the pouch in the back fits my mineral eyeshadow, which comes in a rectangular box, really well.</li>
            <li>Made applying eye makeup much easier, especially when compared to using my fingers to smear the stuff everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even remember if it was soft or not.</li>
            <li>Soft, washable, and not streaky.</li>
            <li>They are soooo soft.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t quiet see that it matters too much.</li>
            <li>All so soft</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to come as early as it did.</li>
            <li>I like these brushes, they&#x27;re soft.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li>Compared to some of the expensive brushes I have seen people use these work just as good.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li>The lip brush is useless and the eyeliner brush is my favorite, it has the right amount of stiffness to apply liner.</li>
            <li>I can also fit my eyelash curler, but the bag barely closes on the little velcro square.</li>
            <li>also, they are environmentally friendly for anyone wanting to go green.</li>
            <li>no streaks, blends well, with no mess.</li>
            <li>The EcoTools are so soft that no other brush can compare.  </li>
            <li>Not being covered in pink, glitter, flowers, flowers and glitter, pink unicorns was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wash them out in the morning and by the evening they&#x27;re dry and ready for use again.</li>
            <li>The second draw back is that they don&#x27;t hold powder very well.</li>
            <li>It has a pocket for putting makeup in, but does not hold much (e.g. a smaller Naked 2 palette + mascara).</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t cost much but work better than some of the expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much nicer than my Bare Minerals brushes that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>For me they have three major draw backs.</li>
            <li>First they are very rough.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a back up for when my other brushes are dirty and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with how well they have  held up especially the powder brush.</li>
            <li>I was really only looking for an eye shadow brush but was pleasantly surprised with the rest of the brushes that came within this package.</li>
            <li>so naturally I did the same with makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes is far above the price of them.</li>
            <li>so I can stop using my Bare Minerals brushes altogether.</li>
            <li>The blush is natural, yet the eyeshadow brush holds almost enough to do both eyes</li>
            <li>the bristles on the brushes are really soft, so they dont have that gross scratchy feel to them.</li>
            <li>I am not a &amp;#34;brush snob&amp;#34; by any  means - I use a Bare Minerals blush brush but an e.l.f. shadow brush...</li>
            <li>I used to buy the Bare Minerals makeup brushes, which are somewhere around $25/$30 (for the foundation brush).</li>
            <li>Replaced Bare Mineral brushes.  </li>
            <li>I re-ordered my second set because my old was destroyed (along with my one luggage)</li>
            <li>Well I really had to limit to the bare essentials only because the make-up bag part is only half, not the whole thing that you see</li>
            <li>Someone else sees that as a downside, but I see it as an upside - I&#x27;m a brown-skinned black American girl and a lot of the foofy soft brushes I have don&#x27;t pick up enough to show up on my skin; with these I don&#x27;t have to swipe and swipe and swipe to get the right amount of product on my face.  </li>
            <li>you can just swirl it in a little harder and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>I just put a little shampoo in a cup with some water to clean them once in a while and let them air dry.</li>
            <li>Hard to clean but meh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one big clear pocket in front and one fabric pocket in back with a snap closure.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and only pick up enough makeup to put on.  </li>
            <li>my normal makeup brushes are long handled and big..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft enough to not irritate but still fulfill their each individual purposes well.</li>
            <li>the do the job, I purchased these new ones to replace the same old brushes I had that broke due to age .</li>
            <li>Very soft and last for long.</li>
            <li>Overall i don&#x27;t use them much, unless my other brushes are dirty and i&#x27;m using several eyeshadows,i don&#x27;t really like the blush brush very much though it is soft and all, they pick up too much of the product..</li>
            <li>However, all of the other brushes have served me very well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>- instead I tried to make do with them as replacements for my Bare Escentuals brushes and they simply will not do the job for me.</li>
            <li>I bought a few separately then decided I needed to buy a whole set!</li>
            <li>The concealer brush included is pretty harsh and pricks the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had brushes that would have a hard bristle or hard spot and would be uncomfortable to use, this set not only is super soft, but it also has several different brushes and at a really good price!</li>
            <li>When I first felt the bristles, they felt too stiff for me</li>
            <li>I used them at least 5 times and although some of them worked OKAY, they just were not worth the money IMO.</li>
            <li>They stay soft and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have a travel set from this company and those brushes have lasted a long time, so I expect no less from this set.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for only a few days and they&#x27;re holding up pretty well except</li>
            <li>in if you, like me, simply cannot justify the high cost of those other brushes.</li>
            <li>When I originally opened these, I was disappointed as they seemed so cheap</li>
            <li>I had to push harder and stroke it over the blush/shadow more than usual, and it still fell from the brush in a way my other brushes don&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> the bright side</li>
            <li> Good handles.</li>
            <li> and so I needed a good brush set.  </li>
            <li> These are good.</li>
            <li> They hold the make up well and feel good when used.  </li>

            <li> This is a good group of brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are good quality for that aspiring makeup artist.</li>
            <li> so my friend that is an expert with make-up and uses MAC products told me that I made a good investment to start out</li>
            <li> Makeup Brush Set 1206 is a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a really nice quality for a great price.</li>
            <li> I think really good value.</li>
            <li> and if this is all you need or you&#x27;re not bothered if your makeup brushes don&#x27;t match then this would be a good set for you.</li>
            <li> If your looking for good quality without breaking the bank these are the brushes to get.</li>
            <li> was so good.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes, and they come with a handy, nicely-designed pouch to store them in.</li>
            <li> I just use my conditioner to clean out the brushes once a week and its&#x27; perfect.</li>
            <li> The are full and work great!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the brushes overall are a wonderful product at a great price!</li>
            <li> The packaging is very cute and Eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased</li>

            <li> I love these brushes!</li>
            <li> It became her favorite brushes!</li>
            <li> Gonna get more for her now!</li>
            <li> Just bought it for the angle brush, but end up using/ love in the powder which i use for contour and the bag which i use for holding my pencils :p...</li>
            <li> In my opnion, the best feature is that brushes don&#x27;t scratch up the product into large chunks, they pick up smallest particles.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re amazing also you can find these on Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> These Brushes Are Amazing.</li>
            <li> All of the brush are amazing.</li>
            <li> this was an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Well, they are amazing.</li>
            <li> These are amazing quality synthetic make-up brushes made from bamboo and recycled materials.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best.</li>
            <li> Nice bag to carry the brushes as well</li>
            <li> Theyre nice i guess.</li>
            <li> This whole line of brushes is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> The brushes work nicely as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this brush set.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kind of a dual deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sixth piece, the bag, is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Makeup sticks well to the brushes when I want it to comes but off nicely when I&#x27;m applying it</li>
            <li> They work really, really well with mineral make-up and feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li> and she liked it</li>
            <li> This way everything blends nicely into skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Would recommend the eye shadow kit as it has a nice variation of bushes for all eye shadow work.</li>
            <li> Also I was impressed with how fast they came.</li>
            <li> and I have always liked them.</li>
            <li> The case they come in is quite handy for traveling, as well.</li>
            <li> These were really nice and did not shed.</li>
            <li> Good quality makes my makeup looks greater than before.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best brushes I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> The quality and softness is nice but they just didn&#x27;t serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> Love eco tools for good affordable brushes that won&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
            <li> Kind of defeats the purpose</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush is nice</li>
            <li> Comes in a nice lil carrying bag.</li>
            <li> nice quality too.</li>
            <li> It was a great set for a guy like myself who isn&#x27;t that familiar with the makeup world to use.</li>
            <li> Love this - the brushes are soft, good quality, and best of all, eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> I showed my new purchase to my mom, and she was so impressed by them (and the price!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new in Amazon and I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
            <li> The blush brush is absolutely the best blush brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, it&#x27;s the softest and most versatile</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The largest brush is perfect for blush and so soft!  </li>
            <li> I gave these brushes 4 stars because I do own brushes that are better in quality -</li>
            <li> I honestly like these brushes better than the ones that come w/</li>
            <li> They are all really soft, but apply makeup flawlessly.</li>
            <li> These Ecotools are so soft and work GREAT!</li>
            <li> Great price and WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
            <li> Got a Tweezerman folding eyelash comb instead, much more effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup brushes I have used so far.</li>
            <li> love them they&#x27;re amazing</li>
            <li> For those wanting good eco products, these brushes fit the bill.</li>
            <li> They are my new favorite and the price is great!</li>
            <li> love love love!</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes!</li>
            <li> ecotools in general are the best makeup brushes out there on the market, affordable, soft on the skin, JUST PERFECT</li>
            <li> Came in good condition and are fun to use!</li>
            <li> The handles are smooth, and the carry pouch is very convenient and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I have been able to achieve a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look very easily with these.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you can actually clean it with water and they are still good :)</li>
            <li> The brush in the set that is labeled for eye shadow is just ok, perhaps would be more suitable for cream shadow?</li>
            <li> All the brushes are perfect, they are really soft and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Seriously great product for a super cheap price.</li>
            <li> These brushes have a nice feel to them - very soft and work great.</li>
            <li> They are very good quality and the brushes are lovely and soft.</li>
            <li> I need the bristles to be more dense.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Quality is just OK.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> Love eco tools, I like the bag.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my mom because I love the eyeshadow set I have.</li>
            <li> LOve them.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re supposed to pick up more pigment and all).</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute plastic case and everything.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where you could find better brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the softness of the bristles</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> ah I love ecotools... always have..</li>
            <li> but they do a much better job of applying it also</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Most of all I love my angled brush and my concealer brush.</li>
            <li> i love them.</li>
            <li> so i am so glad that I decided to purchase these.</li>
            <li> and I really love them.</li>
            <li> I started buying this brand about 5 years ago and just love the quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> The brow brush has the softest and most defining bristles that I&#x27;ve ever owned though it&#x27;s nothing to rave about.</li>
            <li> The concealer brush is actually better for eyeshadow but also serves its purpose</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set from BH Cosmetics that are cheaper in price and better in quality</li>
            <li> I love ecotool brushes.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t love them.</li>
            <li> i like most here</li>
            <li> but i would use more eventually.i dont use the concealer brush at all.overall</li>
            <li> but I still love it.</li>
            <li> Some of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> My favorite is the powder brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set</li>
            <li> So glad i purchased this set</li>
            <li> When I get some more money, I&#x27;m planning on getting the 5-piece set with the mineral powder brush</li>
            <li> I love this product :)</li>
            <li> I use it to provide liquid foundation, it works better than I thought.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> the brushes look even better in person.</li>
            <li> I love all Ecotools products.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t hear comments on how I&#x27;m so glad that my makeup brushes don&#x27;t harm the environment</li>
            <li> They also come in a cute zip bag, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s biodegradable like the brushes are.</li>
            <li> Love the softness of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the angled eyeliner brush.  </li>
            <li> I also love the softness of the blush and powder brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I bought this package mostly for the blush brush</li>
            <li> (more splayed out like a fan than like a cone).</li>
            <li> The brush is longer then most which makes them easier to use.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> my grand daughter ended up using it to hold her room card, which she kept loosing.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for women who travel but also like to take makeup.</li>
            <li> and bamboo is such a great and versatile material!</li>
            <li> MOST.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>
            <li> Better price than in-store.</li>
            <li> The soft bristles are perfectly combined with comfortable bamboo grips.  </li>
            <li> I like these brushes okay.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, and of course the brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been updating my collection, and am really satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> much better price</li>

            <li> just very essential brushes at a great price!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes and the carrying case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit better after an olive oil treatment, but still.</li>
            <li> Got to love the brow brush though.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon:-) :-)</li>
            <li> Planning to purchase more from Ecotools and will recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I love all of their products and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are lovely.</li>
            <li> This was the type of set that got me to start using EcoTools :-)</li>
            <li> That said in my latest foray into self improvement</li>
            <li> and I found I actually enjoyed putting makeup on.</li>
            <li> I love the shape of these and the quality.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Beginners and pros will enjoy the quality!</li>
            <li> It opens from the top, rather from the side as pictured.  </li>

            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> One con with the Bamboo brushes is that the eyeshadow brush could be a bit more flexible in movement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> they feel nice and quality, definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> High quality, comes with a cute bag, great for someone who doesn&#x27;t need a lot of brushes or is looking for an on-the-go set.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and great for the price.</li>
            <li> Super soft &amp; is very much loved!!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> brush works pretty good</li>
            <li> A makeup artist told me that these were pretty good quality to do a makeup at home.</li>
            <li> It is a complete set to makeup, and good material, nice set.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great quality and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very natural and work great.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and seem to be great quality.  </li>
            <li> Well made and I love the wood handles and fine brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a very good basic brush set.  </li>
            <li> Anyway they work wonderfully and are very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t enjoy spending more time</li>
            <li> And it makes me happy that they are all natural.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic. :)</li>
            <li> They are soft and great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soo soft and great quality.</li>
            <li> This brush set was so cheap, I wasn&#x27;t sure what the quality would be like.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product; it&#x27;s fantastic for the price.</li>
            <li> I know elf sells cheap ones, but I needed more sturdy brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get overly detailed in my make-up application, so I don&#x27;t need more than this 6 piece set.  </li>
            <li> good quality , thanks.</li>
            <li> Good product with reasonable price</li>
            <li> The brushes are fantastic and the carrying case is super handy.  </li>
            <li> eyeshadow brush is perfect for your base/lid color or to do an all-over monochromatic look; blush brush is the perfect size for your cheeks (although if you want to do a more contoured look it&#x27;s difficult because it&#x27;s so large).  </li>
            <li> The bristles feel soft and apply makeup very nicely.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s recycled and it&#x27;s environment friendly.</li>
            <li> love the little bag, great for travelling!</li>
            <li> Make-up goes on easily.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes, although I only find the blush brush useful.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and use.</li>
            <li> I use for foundation and blush/bronzer and these can easily compete.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal for someone who will be using all the various brushes, who wears more makeup than I do.</li>
            <li> I received them very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, and they come in a nice cloth holder to keep them nice.</li>
            <li> These brushes have lasted me about two years and their still going strong.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for some decent, good quality brushes.</li>
            <li> This is a great broad purpose set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> These came super quickly and I really love them!</li>
            <li> eyeliner brush is defined and angled perfectly for use with gel liner or just a dark eyeshadow to line your eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need half of the brushes and tools but it is perfect for carrying things.</li>
            <li> I just wrap them up and then use a hairtye around the bag though, which works just fine.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, soft and full.</li>
            <li> Very soft and feels good while using them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and they do a good job of distributing product where you want it.</li>
            <li> The blush brush is really good at distributing product evenly and it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft, great construction - haven&#x27;t lost any bristles and have been using them for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t hugely significant, but I was looking forward to easily organizing these brushes and now feel like I just have to throw them all in there.  </li>
            <li> The blush brush is great, too - it doesn&#x27;t apply too heavily so you can layer nicely.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The fact that the product is not harmful to the environment is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, cheap feeling, nothing I would have bought if I had seen them in person.  </li>
            <li> cheap ones</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and won&#x27;t break like cheap drugstore ones.  </li>
            <li> Work really well and nice quality.</li>
            <li> She has been very happy with the quality and has thanked me a few times for them.</li>
            <li> But the entire set is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Nice set of make up brushes that have held up very well.</li>
            <li> Make up goes on smoothly with these brushes.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a great buy especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much that I bought a concealer brush and foundation brush to go along with this set.  </li>
            <li> They are absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> its fantastic.</li>
            <li> (Yes I know they were free, but they were still from a \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; makeup company and should have been comparable to something I can get at Kmart.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anyone who needs a set of cheap but well-made make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much I bought the eye brush set too.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that such a reasonably-priced set works so well for makeup application.</li>
            <li> These brushes are affordable, easy to clean, and held up well over time.</li>
            <li> The handles fit comfortably.</li>
            <li> They feel like cheap plastic, not bamboo.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and it shows in all</li>
            <li> It would be a great Christmas present for any girl.</li>
            <li> I have MAC brushes that shed and wasn&#x27;t thrilled about spending so much money for brush that sheds.</li>
            <li> I also really needed a nice angle brush for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and feel good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re nice and soft, I love the feel of them.</li>
            <li> They are good quality, soft, and versatile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed them multiple times with gentle soaps (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and a Trader Joe&#x27;s bar soap), and they&#x27;ve done wonderfully.</li>
            <li> No shedding so far, really good quality.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the handles are of good quality.</li>
            <li> Priced right and clean easily!  </li>
            <li> The set comes with pretty much all the basics you might need, and it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Very nice package bought at a reasonable price and particularly like because  the brushes are eco friendly.</li>
            <li> enjoying the brushes very much..</li>
            <li> and they still look new, I love them even more.</li>
            <li> It is significantly cheaper than buying them in a store.</li>
            <li> oh, &amp; eco friendly</li>
            <li> My friend has used them long time ago and she always told me how great they were</li>
            <li> I am very happy now I can buy brushes that do not shed or cost a small fortune.</li>
            <li> then the bare minerals brushes, and i think they feel just as good.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on a youtube recommendation and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am excited about my brushes.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t clean it.</li>
            <li> I need to see if they clean well, though.  </li>
            <li> I wish the fabric part was easier to clean</li>
            <li> Brushes are holding up nicely and are soft!  </li>
            <li> I like the little bag they come in, and the size of each is ideal.</li>
            <li> They are soft and Clean up nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really understanding the reviews on this brush set, because it is great</li>
            <li> So soft and the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes daily and they hold up great and work very well!</li>
            <li> Nice quality and soft.</li>
            <li> The bag is a cool design.</li>
            <li> This set was an overall good value.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good price, ecofriendly, probably would recommend this if you are starting up with makeup.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely not Sigma quality, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the pack, although you will probably end up using only 1 or 2 of the brushes.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and hold mineral makeup nicely.  </li>
            <li> The brushes well made and the bristles are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It might just be the one I bought though, but I was kind of surprised.</li>
            <li> Check out my full review at: emeraldsugar dot com and click on ecotools</li>
            <li> Nice soft brushes, convenient carry case.  </li>
            <li> Very soft bristles, very easy to get an even application of pigment/powders with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles, no shed, great quality! &amp; a cute little pouch!</li>
            <li> Other than that the product is great, hence the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My other blush brush used to shed all the time, so I was happy that this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is great too, and has a linen pocket on the other side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to fix it with some super glue</li>
            <li> Lovely package with an extra pocket to store more products.</li>
            <li> I have an older set as well, and they hold up after cleaning and many uses.</li>
            <li> particular set, however, doesn&#x27;t have my favorite eco tools eye shadow brush shapes.</li>
            <li> Still super soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOVE the Ecotools Kabuki brush and their foundation brush is decent but I would pass on this set.</li>
            <li> I actually washed the foundation brush as well as the smaller fat brush today with antibacterial dish soap and they wash great too!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great brushes for starting out and they&#x27;re very versatile.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not impossible to do so.</li>
            <li> High end brushes shed more than these ever will.</li>
            <li> Mine have lasted up to 2 years and all you need to do to clean them is to clean them with hot water in a mild soap.  </li>
            <li> These are no different, come in a cute little pouch that&#x27;s perfect for throwing in your bag for on the go use.</li>
            <li> I got the 6 piece make up set the other day, and they&#x27;re really very nice.</li>
            <li> Very pleased and plan to buy  a second to store at my gym locker.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for makeup application and it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> , she says the brushes are very soft and is satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not a fan of is the case, I wish they had come in something more durable that they didn&#x27;t fall out of!</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I actually use the brush blush in place of my Bare Minerals flawless face brush because this one is much softer.</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft but sturdy and the bag makes me feel much better than the plastic souvenir ones</li>
            <li> They are super soft :)</li>
            <li> but these brushes are very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brushes are unbelievably soft and the handles are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so easy to use and clean and extremely soft too!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft also the tiny cute bag that come with comes handy to carry them around in my purse.</li>
            <li> Makes this a great little pack for travel.</li>
            <li> Had great reviews, I was happy about the Eco friendly aspect, but honestly was a little disappointed, they work ok, but probably will replace them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now and they are really great quality.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a cheap, high quality set!</li>
            <li> Worth buying them.</li>
            <li> These are the brushes give you your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> For the money these make-up brushes are worth it.  </li>
            <li> love  them they&#x27;re so soft</li>
            <li> I love these soft bristled brushes.</li>
            <li> It helps that they came in a case that is also useful.  </li>
            <li> Honest, I would have paid the amount of the entire set for just the blush brush, itself.</li>
            <li> but I actually don&#x27;t mind because I like a light look and rather go In again if needed more</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft and the tote bag is cute.</li>
            <li> The bristles are nice and soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they hold up very well.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Soft as silk and easy to maintain and clean</li>
            <li> Each and every one of them was useful and durable.</li>
            <li> Definetly worth the money</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this because I decided maybe people would treat me as more of a professional if I wore makeup (Freakily it worked</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Nice bamboo handles.. Definitely deserve a 5 star.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li> but I had so much fun with these brushes.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes alongside the eye set, and I gotta say they worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and a cheaper and better alternative from MAC and other top brush brands.</li>
            <li> and it came super fast!</li>
            <li> I LOVE that their function is marked on the handle (i.e. concealer, large eye, blush...)!</li>
            <li> These are just as good, last just as long, and you get so much more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend EcoTools to everyone who is looking for a good quality low cost Brush set.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t get a professional-quality brush set for this price, right?  </li>
            <li> that she asked me right away to order another set for her, which I just did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bag that comes with the brushes is also just the right size for a traveling makeup bag.</li>
            <li> These brushes were just the right addition.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality.. kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like their brushes in general though, soft and good for skin.</li>
            <li> Well I purchased these brushes and they are very soft, easy to clean, and very durable.</li>
            <li> Im kind of sensitive to make up particularly brushes but this one, you wont even hesitate to use it the first time you put your hand on it.</li>
            <li> Eco-friendly, cruelty free, super soft.</li>
            <li> I would go over and apply blush 5 or more times just to have it barely visible on my skin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for padding on color, but I&#x27;m having difficulty blending with them given their slight stiffness.</li>
            <li> They are soft, easy to handle, and hold the make-up well.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and still remained the soft texture.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, no need to buy the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The copper is the NEW style for 2013!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes for the price, but you may still have to buy a powder/blush brush as the one that comes with is very stiff.  </li>
            <li> Very reasonable in the price, still using them to this day.</li>
            <li> While I will always love that other company and be devoted to their products, these are a fabulous stand-</li>
            <li> The clean fast and keep on working very well.  </li>
            <li> Just disappointed because they really are beautiful, and I liked the idea of them being eco friendly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looing for</li>
            <li> Came on time, was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The brushes are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed, but they don&#x27;t apply makeup on very well!</li>
            <li> This is my first ecotools set</li>
            <li> ,i use it to remove excess mascara.the liner brush is ok sturdy but seems too big to me</li>
            <li> I like this set because I don&#x27;t like to have any more brushes than necessary.</li>
            <li> I love the canvas pouch it comes in - there&#x27;s a separate pocket in the back that can hold makeup</li>
            <li> Got this as a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; set for my teen and ended up buying more for me.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and comfortable to your skin.</li>
            <li> also there is more description how to use brushes on back of packaging.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> To clarify, I didn&#x27;t exactly buy these because they were Eco-friendly</li>
            <li> Before giving it, I made sure to open it up and check the brushes.</li>
            <li> (: ps: I&#x27;ve seen these brushes for a lot more, so you&#x27;re definitely getting a steal here!</li>
            <li> I bought this pack when I first saw it at the store.  </li>
            <li> this set are pretty sub-par and I don&#x27;t reach for them at all.  </li>
            <li> I love the different choices of the eyeshadow brushes.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I wish the concealer brush was a bit smaller and more flexible, but it works.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This set is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed for eye makeup.</li>
            <li> $5.00 off your first purchase (No Minimum)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> /&gt;  $10.00 off your first purchase when you spend $40.00 or more&lt;</li>
            <li> First set was for me, this set was for my mum.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really pretty.</li>
            <li> I really recommend trying them!</li>
            <li> More than enough to apply all your makeup.</li>
            <li> I have since bought 3 more sets that have different uses.</li>
            <li> has the brush I need first.</li>
            <li> which was amazing quality esp for the price, but I recently but a new set and the quality is severely diminished.</li>
            <li> I am brand-spankin new to the world of makeup and in love the bamboo handles and how soft they are.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic and the set is sold at a super low price.</li>
            <li> , they apply makeup well, hey clean well, and they dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> The case is very convenient and they pick up just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes with quality synthetic Teklon bristles (most other brushes are made with the hair of dead goats, badgers, squirrels, etc.).  </li>
            <li> Also, really like the fact that these brushes are made from natural materials, recycled materials and are stated as &#x27;cruelty free&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set - I&#x27;ve only used the blush brush and one of the eye shadow brushes so far.  </li>
            <li> I use to own a few high retail brushes that were gifted of course, but since they are now about 5 years old, they started shedding on my face every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very pretty brushes and are very soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and full, and it doesn&#x27;t come off/shred when you use it.</li>
            <li> the eye brushes arent too small its a good size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought eco-tools in the past, with good experiences.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the extreme softness of these brushes and they hold just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> Great quality, very soft, and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are also super soft.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all super soft.</li>
            <li> so its a lot less effective, also for the biggest one the shape has changed</li>
            <li> The brushes are very high quailty.</li>
            <li> this is a nice little brush set.  </li>
            <li> nice little pouch to store them in.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I mainly wash them because I&#x27;m washing my Bare Minerals brushes at the same time.</li>
            <li> If you get this set for your make-up, it will fit one eyeliner, 1 mascara, 1 blush and one or two eyeshadows just fine, with a space left over for earrings or tweezers or something equally tiny.  </li>
            <li> Ive had them for a few months now and they are still in great shape even after constant use.</li>
            <li> The cloth bag that they come with is great: has elastic loops to firmly hold all the brushes in, and a zippered compartment in case you want to carry extra makeup etc.</li>
            <li> Pro is that the brushes don&#x27;t shed, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> con is that the brushes don&#x27;t hold shadow or blush very well.</li>
            <li> They apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I am just bummed that the slanted brush isn&#x27;t straight with the set i got.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much since the</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very affordable make up brush set.</li>
            <li> They blend very well.</li>
            <li> too soft?as in it doesn&#x27;t pick up much product</li>
            <li> The blush brush is very static-ky when you apply powder.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li> I was searching for a great brush that wouldn&#x27;t put me in the poor house.</li>
            <li> Very eco-friendly, which feeds my vanity.</li>
            <li> I tried one of those, and gave the whole set to a friend who didn&#x27;t have any brushes.  </li>
            <li> The angled eyeliner brush is thin which is great for putting on gel eyeliner,</li>
            <li> In all honesty I would chose real techniques brushes over these.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li> For my every day look I use these for contouring powders I need to use a light hand with, and the crease of my eye shadow because they do not hold enough for an all over application.</li>
            <li> but i do recommend trying them before you buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li> and I use the foundation brush very often.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed them 2-3 times since I purchased them and they are holding up really well too.</li>
            <li> It picks up product very well.</li>
            <li> However I was really bummed that the make up bag is not what was shone in the pictures.</li>
            <li> EcoTools products are very well made &amp; resonably priced.  </li>
            <li> cause my whole makeup bag was stolen from my luggage on a trip.</li>
            <li> This brush set is very durable and affordable.</li>
            <li> He said he now knew why girls did make up every day, it was really to do a face massage every morning.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast as well.</li>
            <li> Although my only complaint about the powder brush I also reviewed was that it was too soft for a powder brush, these brushes are perfect for what they are meant to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are rated really well on amazon and youtube and they can be found at Target and the Christmas tree shop if you would like to them in person.</li>
            <li> Hairs don&#x27;t come out so far and my younger brother is pleased.</li>
            <li> So, I am not a huge make-up wearer but these brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes were kind of stiff, and didn&#x27;t really pick up much product.</li>
            <li> Love Eco Tools brushes, they last super long</li>
            <li> , I have another ecotools brush that is more rounded and fluffy as opposed to flat, which feels nicer on my eyes and is much better for blending.</li>
            <li> Very well made - and the bristles do not fall out like in so many other brands.</li>
            <li> nice, came in a nice little zipper pouch, although this will be a gift, so not sure on the specifics of how they feel and work..</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and very soft feel.</li>
            <li> they are my first set of makeup brushes, and they are so so soft!</li>
            <li> (Always goes back to it&#x27;s original texture)</li>
            <li> The 6pc Makeup Brush Set comes with a small bag to store the brushes in and its absolutely adorable!</li>
            <li> Brushes do not fall apart, just as many other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> The bamboo handles feel sturdy and light weight, and the brush heads seem secure and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I use the eye shading in this set versus the other set, it packs the color on a lot better.</li>
            <li> The Bare Minerals ones I have kind of drag across my face even after washing,</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I am not a girly girl, so I am probably not the most knowledgable reviewer here because I&#x27;ve never owned a set of brushes before, just a few sponges.</li>
            <li> I would probably spend all day smooshing my face with it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that that&#x27;s not a socially acceptable way of conducting oneself in public!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience in using makeup brushes but they feel very high quality and may even be better than the more expensive options.</li>
            <li> Of course your going to want the more expensive brushes that are absolutely flawless (we all do), but its always nice to have a good quality backup set for times when you don&#x27;t get around to cleaning your more expensive brushes or wan to give your expensive brushes a break.</li>
            <li> The much larger blush brush dries more quickly than my smaller Bare Minerals foundation brush.</li>
            <li> All the bristles are pretty soft.</li>
            <li> It also has a zippered portion on it to keep some small pots of makeup, which is nice because I was needing something like that.</li>
            <li> they are bamboo and the bristles are so soft and apply very well!</li>
            <li> It even has concealor &amp; blush which don&#x27;t usually use but comes in handy.</li>
            <li> They also seem to dry pretty quickly, too.</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush set, and a set that wasn&#x27;t made from animal products, both because the bristles shed too much, and I don&#x27;t want to contribute to that type of business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had the brushes for three months, and they&#x27;ve held up very well and still feel new.</li>
            <li> its slightly flatter and more feathered out.</li>
            <li> it comes in as my main makeup travel bag.</li>
            <li> makes for a decent 12 piece set (thats 10 brushes and 2 cases for the brushes).</li>
            <li> Maybe I was spoiled by the older edition(bought</li>
            <li> /&gt;One thing I noticed about this listing though: the main picture shows brushes with copper metal and the others show silver.</li>
            <li> i particularly like the eyelash/eyebrow groomer.</li>
            <li> I seriously love it and would definitely recommend it to everyone especially to beginners.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are a good size and even the powder brush was large enough so it didn&#x27;t leave streaks like small brushes can.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and make makeup application much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Very soft and they do not shed!</li>
            <li> They are very soft and for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Very soft!</li>
            <li> highly reccomended you get them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Saw these in Ride Aide the the price was way to high so decided to check Amazon site...</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this brand.  </li>
            <li> My brother borrowed one for a stage play he did in high school.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I supplemented the set with a liquid foundation brush ([[ASIN:B00A44H6MC Bamboo Ecotools Soft Makeup Cosmetic Foundation Powder Blush Brush Beauty Tool]]), a powder brush ([[ASIN:B001KYVLSU EcoTools Large Powder Brush]]), and a retractable powder brush that I used as a mineral foundation</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brush is nice but in all honesty, it&#x27;s a bit large and either picks up too little or too much at different times.</li>
            <li> brushes are SO soft, I can&#x27;t  stop rubbing them on my face!!</li>
            <li> I wish they would hold the product a little better.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute little pack.</li>
            <li> Brushes have withstood many washings, by hand with a little soapy water and air dries.  </li>
            <li> They are ego friendly of course, which to me isn&#x27;t a big deal, I mean sure go green, save energy, but I don&#x27;t really stress about it, if its something I don&#x27;t plan on throwing away for many years, if ever.</li>
            <li> This set is very well made, soft, and applies product well.</li>
            <li> The foundation brush is so soft and really blends liquid or cream foundation</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out how reasonable they were.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and do the job VERY well.</li>
            <li> It picks up such a delicate amount of product that you can build up your blush or keep it light :)</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think the added benefit is always worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> the eye brush set will fit in that pocket along with small make up as well (also good to have that small mirror).the bag has velcro which will hold the bag over the brushes to protect them too.</li>
            <li> far this set has been very useful, I&#x27;ve used only the blush brush and the eyebrow/eyelash brush so far.</li>
            <li> However, i use all of the other brushes and they work just fine.</li>
            <li> So many makeup brushes cost a lot of money then don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> They are soft and don&#x27;t shed, and do a decent job (I like the blush brush better than the eye shadow one - wish it was a little softer.  </li>
            <li> brushes are super soft against your skin, especially the blush brush.</li>
            <li> I wash them every 6 months with shampoo and water and they are like new again.</li>
            <li> and they still work like new.</li>
            <li> Looks like they are brand new after being washed...</li>
            <li> Along with my new and improved makeup, I wanted some nicer brushes.</li>
            <li> I had to buy new ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a conservative girl, you don&#x27;t buy something new if you already have something that can do the job.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t need new ones ANYTIME soon</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft, and all are performing very well so far.</li>
            <li> I actually have an e.l.f. angled liner brush that came for free with one of my orders that feels softer and works the same.</li>
            <li> I love the little carrying pouch that these brushes came in!</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and work well.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all very soft and well made.</li>
            <li> very soft.</li>
            <li> These, however, are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are also very soft and well made.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and do not irritate.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft and have been holding up well</li>
            <li> They are very soft and I have not had one break yet.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft on your face.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes and hair does not fall out even after washing them every 2 weeks to maintain care.</li>
            <li> Very Soft brushes.  </li>
            <li> The bridges are soft!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and they pick up makeup like nobody&#x27;s business!</li>
            <li> but them i read the packaging and say that it said that it did not, a small mistake on my part.</li>
            <li> but I find myself only using three of them, consistently.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> As soon as I received I naturally diva&#x27;ed out in the mirror and wowser!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to go out and buy $50 professional makeup brushes believe me!</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft!</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented, but these brushes barely picked anything up.</li>
            <li> Quality brushes...very soft!</li>
            <li> The silver is the old!</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and they dont shed!</li>
            <li> ;) I just recently used the brushes...</li>
            <li> they are tremendously soft and my makeup goes on more smooth than the other brushes that I had in the past.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because one of my friends had the same exact one.</li>
            <li> Most of the \\&quot;makeup brush kits\\&quot; don&#x27;t have the ones you usually use</li>
            <li> really recommend these brushes, and ecotools in general, to anyone who loves makeup.</li>
            <li> I used the big brush first to apply mineral powder.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush set that is for applying  makeup after seeing a professional makeup artist, apply liquid foundation with a brush!</li>
            <li> These are really soft brushes!</li>
            <li> The first set held up for 5 years of almost daily use.</li>
            <li> I mean, not much to say about that, all of the good quality ones are pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes, praying that the blush brush would be soft &amp; not hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> They are very well made with no loose bristles.</li>
            <li> I wanted natural brushes to go with my new organic makeup.</li>
            <li> also i like that i can fit it into my small purses for on the go and wont take up too much room in my makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of brushes in the past but these are supremely comfortable and very efficient at doing their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointed bristles are so soft it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> Very soft and so far no shedding.</li>
            <li> While it is probably all the positive reinforcement, who knows, my body might actually prefer the none chemical loaded brushes.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are soft, natural and have what each brush is to be used for printed on them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping the quality has increased the slight amount I need for the foundation brush (the style seems to have changed), but I likely won&#x27;t be able to tell you for another five years.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t open more than a half inch before the zipper tab broke off.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the slanted eyeliner brush, but that particular brush is kind of weird.</li>
            <li> The reason its 4 stars is because of the brow brush seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li> and they felt very oil-like, kind of weird on the fingers.</li>
            <li> the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> And they are so so soft.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t comment on whether it&#x27;s \\&quot;professional quality\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, or the fact that they are synthetic (I myself prefer natural bristles, as any makeup aficionado does).  </li>
            <li> The bristles are SO soft and they pick up a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> The blush brush is too soft, does not apply blush like I wanted it too.</li>
            <li> This set is also much cheaper than buying the brushes individually at Wal-Mart!</li>
            <li> Soft as well.</li>
            <li> the brushes are well made, soft, and professional.</li>
            <li> In To Look Natural</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when I used them.  </li>
            <li> I only really use the blush brush, concealer, and eye shadow brushes.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really soft...</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and I washed them and they didn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles that do not shed.</li>
            <li> Bristles do not fall out and stay soft.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re still perfectly soft, and I haven&#x27;t lost any bristles during cleaning.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is so soft for the face  ..</li>
            <li> So far none of the brushes have shed.  </li>
            <li> Each was sturdy with soft bristles.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and they changed up the blush brush a bit.</li>
            <li> These are really soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooooo soft.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft, I&#x27;m really surprised that they aren&#x27;t animal?</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft, though.</li>
            <li> The case has a front and back pocket, very convenient.</li>
            <li> I also like the case they come in because the pouch in the back fits my mineral eyeshadow, which comes in a rectangular box, really well.</li>
            <li> Made applying eye makeup much easier, especially when compared to using my fingers to smear the stuff everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember if it was soft or not.</li>
            <li> Soft, washable, and not streaky.</li>
            <li> They are soooo soft.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t quiet see that it matters too much.</li>
            <li> All so soft</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to come as early as it did.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes, they&#x27;re soft.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li> Compared to some of the expensive brushes I have seen people use these work just as good.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The lip brush is useless and the eyeliner brush is my favorite, it has the right amount of stiffness to apply liner.</li>
            <li> I can also fit my eyelash curler, but the bag barely closes on the little velcro square.</li>
            <li> also, they are environmentally friendly for anyone wanting to go green.</li>
            <li> no streaks, blends well, with no mess.</li>
            <li> The EcoTools are so soft that no other brush can compare.  </li>
            <li> Not being covered in pink, glitter, flowers, flowers and glitter, pink unicorns was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wash them out in the morning and by the evening they&#x27;re dry and ready for use again.</li>
            <li> The second draw back is that they don&#x27;t hold powder very well.</li>
            <li> It has a pocket for putting makeup in, but does not hold much (e.g. a smaller Naked 2 palette + mascara).</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t cost much but work better than some of the expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much nicer than my Bare Minerals brushes that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> For me they have three major draw backs.</li>
            <li> First they are very rough.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a back up for when my other brushes are dirty and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with how well they have  held up especially the powder brush.</li>
            <li> I was really only looking for an eye shadow brush but was pleasantly surprised with the rest of the brushes that came within this package.</li>
            <li> so naturally I did the same with makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes is far above the price of them.</li>
            <li> so I can stop using my Bare Minerals brushes altogether.</li>
            <li> The blush is natural, yet the eyeshadow brush holds almost enough to do both eyes</li>
            <li> the bristles on the brushes are really soft, so they dont have that gross scratchy feel to them.</li>
            <li> I am not a &amp;#34;brush snob&amp;#34; by any  means - I use a Bare Minerals blush brush but an e.l.f. shadow brush...</li>
            <li> I used to buy the Bare Minerals makeup brushes, which are somewhere around $25/$30 (for the foundation brush).</li>
            <li> Replaced Bare Mineral brushes.  </li>
            <li> I re-ordered my second set because my old was destroyed (along with my one luggage)</li>
            <li> Well I really had to limit to the bare essentials only because the make-up bag part is only half, not the whole thing that you see</li>
            <li> Someone else sees that as a downside, but I see it as an upside - I&#x27;m a brown-skinned black American girl and a lot of the foofy soft brushes I have don&#x27;t pick up enough to show up on my skin; with these I don&#x27;t have to swipe and swipe and swipe to get the right amount of product on my face.  </li>
            <li> you can just swirl it in a little harder and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I just put a little shampoo in a cup with some water to clean them once in a while and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean but meh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one big clear pocket in front and one fabric pocket in back with a snap closure.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and only pick up enough makeup to put on.  </li>
            <li> my normal makeup brushes are long handled and big..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft enough to not irritate but still fulfill their each individual purposes well.</li>
            <li> the do the job, I purchased these new ones to replace the same old brushes I had that broke due to age .</li>
            <li> Very soft and last for long.</li>
            <li> Overall i don&#x27;t use them much, unless my other brushes are dirty and i&#x27;m using several eyeshadows,i don&#x27;t really like the blush brush very much though it is soft and all, they pick up too much of the product..</li>
            <li> However, all of the other brushes have served me very well, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> - instead I tried to make do with them as replacements for my Bare Escentuals brushes and they simply will not do the job for me.</li>
            <li> I bought a few separately then decided I needed to buy a whole set!</li>
            <li> The concealer brush included is pretty harsh and pricks the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had brushes that would have a hard bristle or hard spot and would be uncomfortable to use, this set not only is super soft, but it also has several different brushes and at a really good price!</li>
            <li> When I first felt the bristles, they felt too stiff for me</li>
            <li> I used them at least 5 times and although some of them worked OKAY, they just were not worth the money IMO.</li>
            <li> They stay soft and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have a travel set from this company and those brushes have lasted a long time, so I expect no less from this set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for only a few days and they&#x27;re holding up pretty well except</li>
            <li> in if you, like me, simply cannot justify the high cost of those other brushes.</li>
            <li> When I originally opened these, I was disappointed as they seemed so cheap</li>
            <li> I had to push harder and stroke it over the blush/shadow more than usual, and it still fell from the brush in a way my other brushes don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not only are are they conveniently priced on Amazon, but these things are LONG LASTING AND DURABLE.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the lash and brow groomer is pretty rubbish and a disappointment since that&#x27;s what I originally bought the set for, but the other brushes make up for it.</li>
            <li> I have to dig into the makeup pretty hard to get it to stick to the brush.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner brush is a little too thick for detailed lines, but that may be just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> High-quality ones that are well-taken care of will last a long time;</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a couple of hairs come loose, and only on the eyebrow brush.  </li>
            <li> And after years of rough use (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m doing it wrong and some of that wear should be transferred to the concealer brush)</li>
            <li> suggestion: buy one of the single brushes from your local Wal-Mart where they sell this brand and if you like it then return it and purchase the kit from this</li>
            <li> The front is the same but the back is simply another open section without little &#x27;loops&#x27; to hold the brushes in place.  </li>
            <li> This has happened numerous times and even after I washed the brushes thinking that would get all of the loose ends out it still occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I compared them with other eco tool brushes and they definitely look different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really getting seriously into creating different looks with makeup</li>
            <li> to big to pack in the minimal amount of luggage I was taking.  </li>
            <li> I bought some Sonia Kashuk brushes not too long ago and they couldn&#x27;t hold a flame to these.</li>
            <li> These ARE soft brushes, not at all stiff.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews before purchasing this products and I got a lot of positive feedback but a few negatives one.</li>
            <li> so I used the other softer brushes that came with my various palettes.</li>
            <li> and you WON&#x27;T want to go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but I wash them every second or third time I use them.</li>
            <li> I lost a few of my brushes recently and knew I would purchase the same brand.</li>
            <li> Some are stiffer than I expected, and the big one is a little smaller than I thought, but they have all been great.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I have bought expensive brushes in the past, and these are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt other brushes before and generally never bought them because they were synthetics</li>
            <li> The case gets dirty really easily though...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the zipper broke the first time she tried to open the bag.</li>
            <li> So they aren&#x27;t labeled with whatever super expensive brand of makeup that you use</li>
            <li> My sister had these brushes and I used them thinking they were super expensive.</li>
            <li> I have costly brushes that shed those bristles and go flat &amp; tangled after only a few uses!</li>
            <li> So for less than the price of one of my other brushes, I got an entire set.  </li>
            <li> So I would think that being all Eco it would be a natural fiber for for that reason it loses a star</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had them for several months and use the big brush at least four times a week).</li>
            <li> I have never been big into using brushes until I watched a few tutorials on makeup application.  </li>
            <li> Have not really used concealer brush yet.</li>
            <li> I had bought another brand on Amazon which was pricier, but they were rough.</li>
            <li> I still would have a use for them if they were just rough and didnt hold powder well, but what makes me not use them is that bristles fall out.</li>
            <li> I will be trying to work powder into my concealer while its still wet</li>
            <li> I have a few smashbox brushed</li>
            <li> However the makeup doesn&#x27;t stick that well to them and makes it harder to apply.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected</li>
            <li> Softer than the other brushes I was used to but only took a little bit to get used to the softness</li>
            <li> I bought the 6 piece starter set and they&#x27;re all so stiff and scratchy especially the blush brush.</li>
            <li> Why pay for super expensive obviously plastic crap when you can buy these brushes at target right next to those crappy overpriced ones.</li>
            <li> These brushes are of high quality for an unbelievable price!!</li>
            <li> - don&#x27;t believe me, search for other Ecotools products on Amazon.com and read THOSE reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands (MAC, Lancome, Sephora, etc).</li>
            <li> All other brushes have virtually no change.  </li>
            <li> They are just like my other ecotools brushes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they&#x27;re original ones or fake</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t trust any other brand.</li>
            <li> For instance, other brushes come with a plastic cap or wrap to protect them, these don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> But that said, I&#x27;ve used other peoples brushes on them when I did their makeup for plays.</li>
            <li> I use the other tool to separate my eyelashes after mascara</li>
            <li> I use my brushes often and they not falling apart like other brands I have purchsed.</li>
            <li> the other for my stage make up.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> but I use a brush from the other set to line the bottom of my eyes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok,again i only use it if my other brushes are dirty, &amp; i really like the lash&amp;brow groomer,probably the brush</li>
            <li> Average quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> Use with any dark powder.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this set is that if you roll the bag up around the brushes, the velcro that holds it shut has nowhere to stick.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very comparable to the high-end brushes you would buy from the mall or expensive makeup stores.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the case does not match the one pictured.  </li>
            <li> The brow brush was too thick for my brows, I prefer a simple spoolie.</li>
            <li> I also bought a few of the other brushes .</li>
            <li> These last forever and don&#x27;t have that awful chemical smell that most &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; brushes tend to have.</li>
            <li> The brushes are less dense (less brush hairs)</li>
            <li> I found the three products that I ordered to be too stiff, smell bad, and not at all comfortable for the hand.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leave little hairs all over your face.  </li>
            <li> so it helps to try and keep my make-up carrier a little cleaner</li>
            <li> This was just a little stocking suffer for the wife.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a little sample of their mango butter...</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this item for the brushes and partly because of that little travel bag they come in.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bristles of the eye shadow brush are a little too hard and hurt my eye.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy really expensive brushes (you know for the high quality</li>
            <li> Just a few swipes</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the eyeliner brush yet because I have a few already.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> These are not spiky or harsh, even on my super-sensitive skin, and they have held up well to repeated washing.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday</li>
            <li> I bought the set after trying a few of their brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an everyday make up wearer, so investing in an extravagant brush set was not in order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the brushes the theatre provides on myself when I acted years ago, so while I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday I am not a stranger to it.</li>
            <li> I bought the a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I have two sets, one for everyday make up,</li>
            <li> That was half the reason I bought it!</li>
            <li> I researched the brushed that the negative reviews suggested but those were not good</li>
            <li> Only one point of disappointment, the travel bag it came in is in pretty bad shape after not much use at all.</li>
            <li> The bristles are almost irritating to the skin because they are stiff and rough.</li>
            <li> I was wary of purchasing something that I could buy at Rite Aid, and the price is so low -</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t waste makeup!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I ended up just throwing them all in the bin!</li>
            <li> maybe because i have small eye</li>
            <li> I would recommend these for any everyday look!</li>
            <li> I might be an amateur</li>
            <li> I usually get from Macys with the purchase of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small set of brushes for my cruise...</li>
            <li> These are really no different in terms of quality and they&#x27;re not as expensive.</li>
            <li> the eye shadow and concealer brushes are way to thick and don&#x27;t apply well the products they are meant for.</li>
            <li> Disappointed but for $10 I can live with them.</li>
            <li> but the other brushes were useless from my experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my husband&#x27;s account, and was a little disappointed only because of the case.  </li>
            <li> Since receiving this item, I&#x27;ve only use the blush brush and not the others &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t understand, to me they are so scratchy and horrible, I&#x27;d much rather use my hands.</li>
            <li> One thing I hate about a blush brush or any brush for that matter is for the bristles to be left on my face or to just come out at all.  </li>
            <li> Soft--leaves no brush hairs behind.  </li>
            <li> I use the set approximately 1 or 2 times a week before I go out on weekends.  </li>
            <li> Their bristles don&#x27;t fall off like really terrible quality brushes would normally.</li>
            <li> The concealer brush is practically useless and the mascara/brow brush is so flimsy and breakable.</li>
            <li> so I saw no reason to go buy an expensive set.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that they could be so expensive, and then I came across this brand.  </li>
            <li> I have some really expensive brushes, and they are in their case underneath my bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> you just can&#x27;t go wrong here</li>
            <li> Sorry I&#x27;m not a make-up guru</li>
            <li> I could careless if they&#x27;re eco-friendly, but I guess that&#x27;s a bonus too.</li>
            <li> These arrived but they looked fake as soon as I opened them.</li>
            <li> The Sonia Kashuk ones are terrible quality for the same price as these.</li>
            <li> A bit prickly and some are just weird shaped.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s silly to want them all to match</li>
            <li> is ridiculous!!)</li>
            <li> EcoTools makes quality products, but the handles on these brushes are disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to buy expensive makeup, but I decided to upgrade!</li>
            <li> Although the eye shading brush isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed a bit</li>
            <li> when travelling :-(</li>
            <li> I was severely disappointed by this, but since I needed to use the brushes, I couldn&#x27;t return</li>
            <li> If however, you&#x27;re into mineral makeup and are looking for matching brushes from this company, you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet.</li>
            <li> It is so annoying.  </li>
            <li> anyways I should&#x27;ve known, but I&#x27;m still disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the worst I had.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s awful and does not apply blush how it should.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like how feels this brush!</li>
            <li> the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best. ZERO shedding! And they are so so soft. High end brushes shed more than these ever will. Wash after wash and use after use these are absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I use these brushes on a daily basis and they last forever (like years).  I wash them every 6 months with shampoo and water and they are like new again.</li>
            <li> Pro is that the brushes don&#x27;t shed, and the price was reasonable. con is that the brushes don&#x27;t hold shadow or blush very well. I have to dig into the makeup pretty hard to get it to stick to the brush. I won&#x27;t purchase this brand again for that reason.</li>
            <li> Very soft and they do not shed! I will definitely continue to buy EcoTools products. Nice bag to carry the brushes as well</li>
            <li> Average quality brushes.  Flimsy, cheap feeling, nothing I would have bought if I had seen them in person.  Disappointed but for $10 I can live with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had brushes that would have a hard bristle or hard spot and would be uncomfortable to use, this set not only is super soft, but it also has several different brushes and at a really good price!</li>
            <li> Super soft &amp; is very much loved!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice package bought at a reasonable price and particularly like because  the brushes are eco friendly.</li>
            <li> It is a complete set to makeup, and good material, nice set.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. The bristles are really soft, and all are performing very well so far. Good handles.</li>
            <li> I needed a new brush set, and a set that wasn&#x27;t made from animal products, both because the bristles shed too much, and I don&#x27;t want to contribute to that type of business. This set is very well made, soft, and applies product well. I may buy additional eyeshadow brushes, since this only comes with one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really understanding the reviews on this brush set, because it is great - don&#x27;t believe me, search for other Ecotools products on Amazon.com and read THOSE reviews.  I hate cheap (not inexpensive - but CHEAP) makeup brushes - I&#x27;m really getting seriously into creating different looks with makeup and so I needed a good brush set.  I was wary of purchasing something that I could buy at Rite Aid, and the price is so low - you can&#x27;t get a professional-quality brush set for this price, right?  Makeup brushes are an investment, IMO.  High-quality ones that are well-taken care of will last a long time; cheap ones break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can&#x27;t comment on whether it&#x27;s \\&quot;professional quality\\&quot; but these brushes are SO great. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, or the fact that they are synthetic (I myself prefer natural bristles, as any makeup aficionado does).  The bristles are SO soft and they pick up a lot of product.  Someone else sees that as a downside, but I see it as an upside - I&#x27;m a brown-skinned black American girl and a lot of the foofy soft brushes I have don&#x27;t pick up enough to show up on my skin; with these I don&#x27;t have to swipe and swipe and swipe to get the right amount of product on my face.  Just a few swipes and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeshadow brush is perfect for your base/lid color or to do an all-over monochromatic look; blush brush is the perfect size for your cheeks (although if you want to do a more contoured look it&#x27;s difficult because it&#x27;s so large).  The foundation brush is so soft and really blends liquid or cream foundation well.  The brow brush/lash comb...I mean, not much to say about that, all of the good quality ones are pretty much the same.  It&#x27;s sturdy and won&#x27;t break like cheap drugstore ones.  I haven&#x27;t tried the eyeliner brush yet because I have a few already.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean but meh. Theyre nice i guess.</li>
            <li> The blush brush is too soft, does not apply blush like I wanted it too. I would go over and apply blush 5 or more times just to have it barely visible on my skin. Waste of time. I don&#x27;t enjoy spending more time then I have to on my makeup. I need the bristles to be more dense. The only plus side is they don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.  I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for a week and I love them.  Nice quality and soft.</li>
            <li> I already owned one eco-tool makeup brush prior to purchasing two of these sets. It is the best makeup brush I&#x27;ve owned.  The brushes are great quality and the bristles are very soft. This set is also much cheaper than buying the brushes individually at Wal-Mart!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re amazing also you can find these on Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> These are good. No issues yet. Soft as well.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my daughter, I&#x27;m sure she will love it.</li>
            <li> I have a $60 set of make-up brushes from Sephora and these are just as good, making them a great value. I have a travel set from this company and those brushes have lasted a long time, so I expect no less from this set. The bristles are soft and feel good. Make-up goes on easily. The bag is a cool design. It is one piece with the holding slots for the brushes and the flip side of the bag has a zippered compartment where you can store your make-up. The zipper part flips over to cover the brushes. Makes this a great little pack for travel. Very pleased and plan to buy  a second to store at my gym locker.</li>
            <li> not one to write a review but i was more than happy with what i got! the brushes are well made, soft, and professional. id recomend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes on a whim and I&#x27;m so glad I did. They&#x27;re nice and soft, I love the feel of them. They apply makeup very well. The only thing I&#x27;m not a fan of is the case, I wish they had come in something more durable that they didn&#x27;t fall out of!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looing for</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Great quality, very soft, and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34;... I thought I believed that?... anyways I should&#x27;ve known, but I&#x27;m still disappointed! Lol. Quality is just OK.</li>
            <li> The bridges are soft!  I love it!  I&#x27;ll probably stick with this brand for all my makeup brush needs.  GREAT product!!!</li>
            <li> This whole line of brushes is absolutely wonderful. I bought a few separately then decided I needed to buy a whole set! I absolutely love them. They&#x27;re soft and they pick up makeup like nobody&#x27;s business! Love them!</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the slanted eyeliner brush, but that particular brush is kind of weird. I think it is just a manufacture fault with that one brush. However, i use all of the other brushes and they work just fine. I am just bummed that the slanted brush isn&#x27;t straight with the set i got.</li>
            <li> Love eco tools, I like the bag.</li>
            <li> I was really only looking for an eye shadow brush but was pleasantly surprised with the rest of the brushes that came within this package. I&#x27;ve had it for only a few days and they&#x27;re holding up pretty well except the eyebrow brush head broke off. I&#x27;ll have to fix it with some super glue</li>
            <li> good quality , thanks.</li>
            <li> Very soft and feels good while using them. Worth buying them.</li>
            <li> I got these brushes for my mom because I love the eyeshadow set I have. Ecotools makes good quality brushes for a great price. They are very soft and make makeup application much faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Love Eco Tools brushes, they last super long</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes!  They are so soft and only pick up enough makeup to put on.  So I don&#x27;t waste makeup!  The bamboo bag is very handy too.</li>
            <li> Came on time, was exactly what I ordered. The brushes work nicely as well. Their bristles don&#x27;t fall off like really terrible quality brushes would normally.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and work well. Got as a gift for my sister and she loves them!</li>
            <li> The shipping on these brushes was excelent.I would recomend them for a beginer someone whose just starting out doing makeup it comes with everything you need.Compared to some of the expensive brushes I have seen people use these work just as good.They are also super soft.LOve them.</li>
            <li> Usually I buy really expensive brushes (you know for the high quality and they&#x27;re supposed to pick up more pigment and all). But these brushes... THESE BRUSHES... These are the brushes give you your money&#x27;s worth. Not only are are they conveniently priced on Amazon, but these things are LONG LASTING AND DURABLE. The fibers don&#x27;t fall out all (even when you wash it) and the wood is sturdy. This stuff is good for makeup application and it lasts a really long time. You get every tool you need for your face without having to have a truckload of STUFF. It comes in a cute plastic case and everything. It&#x27;s great for use. IT IS A MUST HAVE for ladies on the go.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where you could find better brushes for the price. They are so soft, and they come in a nice cloth holder to keep them nice. I have had the same set for over a year now and they still work like new. I LOVE THIS SET!!!! BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> These are not spiky or harsh, even on my super-sensitive skin, and they have held up well to repeated washing.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner in makeup so I never knew that make up brushes were actually needed until my friend informed me about it. Well I purchased these brushes and they are very soft, easy to clean, and very durable. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with shredding at all!</li>
            <li> All the brushes are perfect, they are really soft and really easy to use. Lovely package with an extra pocket to store more products.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price! I love the softness of the bristles (doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like others have) and use the concealer brush every day to evenly apply concealer around my nose. The blush brush is great, too - it doesn&#x27;t apply too heavily so you can layer nicely. And I can&#x27;t forget to mention that the canvas bag the set comes in is WONDERFUL. Not only does it hold the brushes, but it has a zipper bag attached so you can put makeup/other accessories with your brushes (mine holds 3 eyeshadows, a blush compact, and concealer tube with plenty of room left over). I gave these brushes 4 stars because I do own brushes that are better in quality - however, they are MUCH more expensive than these ($50 for a makeup brush is ridiculous!!) and I don&#x27;t think the added benefit is always worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I have gotten these make-up brush sets before and I absolutely love them.  The packaging was great and they came as described.  For the money these make-up brushes are worth it.  Mine have lasted up to 2 years and all you need to do to clean them is to clean them with hot water in a mild soap.  The clean fast and keep on working very well.  They don&#x27;t leave little hairs all over your face.  These make-up brushes are well made.</li>
            <li> i received these as a bridesmaid gift, amazing! they are my first set of makeup brushes, and they are so so soft! they feel nice and quality, definitely worth it! my set came with a blush brush, concealer brush, eyeshadow brush, eyeliner brush, and lip brush. love them all! it&#x27;s a great beginner or travel set! love love love!</li>
            <li> As described. Great product. Received on time.</li>
            <li> these brushes are great and i have actually taken to using the travel case it comes in as my main makeup travel bag.</li>
            <li> ah I love ecotools... always have..</li>
            <li> Great quality!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are SO soft, I can&#x27;t  stop rubbing them on my face!!</li>
            <li> So I would think that being all Eco it would be a natural fiber for for that reason it loses a star but for the price it does the trick. Why pay for super expensive obviously plastic crap when you can buy these brushes at target right next to those crappy overpriced ones. So they aren&#x27;t labeled with whatever super expensive brand of makeup that you use but they do a much better job of applying it also the cloth holder is machine washable so it helps to try and keep my make-up carrier a little cleaner</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes, although I only find the blush brush useful. Since receiving this item, I&#x27;ve only use the blush brush and not the others &#x3D;( If I knew I would only be using that brush I could&#x27;ve just bought it by itself.</li>
            <li> This set was an overall good value. The blush brush, eyelash/eyebrow comb, concealer brush, and angled eye liner brush were just what I was looking for. Although the eye shading brush isn&#x27;t bad and I do use it, I have another ecotools brush that is more rounded and fluffy as opposed to flat, which feels nicer on my eyes and is much better for blending. The angled liner brush also has the same sort of scratchy feeling, but works well. I actually have an e.l.f. angled liner brush that came for free with one of my orders that feels softer and works the same. The brushes don&#x27;t shed on my face, or when I wash them (and I wash them a couple times a week). This sent isn&#x27;t perfect, but for the price it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> These came super quickly and I really love them! They&#x27;re great quality and a great variety!</li>
            <li> Came in good condition and are fun to use!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Work really well and nice quality.</li>
            <li> love  them they&#x27;re so soft</li>
            <li> I love these soft bristled brushes. Most of all I love my angled brush and my concealer brush. They work fabulous-ly (just made up a word lol). i love them. The only thing is I thought that there was a foundation brush but them i read the packaging and say that it said that it did not, a small mistake on my part. The eco friendly bag is great and awesome for on the go overnight trips along with my makeup case. I read a few reviews before purchasing this products and I got a lot of positive feedback but a few negatives one. I researched the brushed that the negative reviews suggested but those were not good so i am so glad that I decided to purchase these. I use them everyday and I really love them. These are also cheaper online than they are at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> Well made and I love the wood handles and fine brushes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need half of the brushes and tools but it is perfect for carrying things. I like their brushes in general though, soft and good for skin.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much since the it&#x27;s a very affordable make up brush set. I love the fact that it&#x27;s recycled and it&#x27;s environment friendly. To my surprise these brushes are superb! The bristles are soft and full, and it doesn&#x27;t come off/shred when you use it. I will definitely recommend this to my friends and family. Oh! Best part is I got a BONUS detailer brush! Yay! I&#x27;m a fan now.</li>
            <li> They were really soft brushes, but they didn&#x27;t seem to hold the product as well as I expected. I wish they would hold the product a little better.</li>
            <li> Not of great quality, but does the job for what it cost.</li>
            <li> I started buying this brand about 5 years ago and just love the quality of the brushes. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the number of brushes you get. I just put a little shampoo in a cup with some water to clean them once in a while and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> These Brushes Are Amazing. They Blend Everything In To Look Natural&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For A Bonus I Got A Foam Application Brush .!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a repurchase for me. I&#x27;ve always liked this brush set. They are good quality, soft, and versatile.</li>
            <li> I see everyone raving about Eco Tools brushes but I just don&#x27;t understand, to me they are so scratchy and horrible, I&#x27;d much rather use my hands. I bought the 6 piece starter set and they&#x27;re all so stiff and scratchy especially the blush brush. The concealer brush is practically useless and the mascara/brow brush is so flimsy and breakable. The brow brush was too thick for my brows, I prefer a simple spoolie. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I ended up just throwing them all in the bin!</li>
            <li> This was just a little stocking suffer for the wife. She has been very happy with the quality and has thanked me a few times for them.</li>
            <li> When I originally opened these, I was disappointed as they seemed so cheap but since I was using these as a travel set I washed them and took them with me.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I used them.  They hold the make up well and feel good when used.  Would buy again for travel use.  It helps that they came in a case that is also useful.  All in all a very good value that works for my intended use.</li>
            <li> There are only five brushes in the set but I find myself only using three of them, consistently. The blush brush, the concealer brush, and the eyeliner brush. The brow brush has the softest and most defining bristles that I&#x27;ve ever owned though it&#x27;s nothing to rave about. The eyeshadow brush is nice but in all honesty, it&#x27;s a bit large and either picks up too little or too much at different times. The concealer brush is actually better for eyeshadow but also serves its purpose so it&#x27;s kind of a dual deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner brush is defined and angled perfectly for use with gel liner or just a dark eyeshadow to line your eyes. The blush brush is absolutely the best blush brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, it&#x27;s the softest and most versatile and I use it for both blush and bronzer. Honest, I would have paid the amount of the entire set for just the blush brush, itself. But the entire set is a great deal. The sixth piece, the bag, is a nice touch. I don&#x27;t like that the makeup will rub off on it but since it&#x27;s washable, there&#x27;s no issues with it. I say, definitely get this if you&#x27;re starting off but if you&#x27;re only going to do eye makeup, there is a separate eyebrush set for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Best Brushes in the world.  I have a set and had to get some for my sister.  They last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They blend very well. I only really use the blush brush, concealer, and eye shadow brushes. They are very soft and for the price, you just can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> The brushes are sturdy and don&#x27;t shed, but they don&#x27;t apply makeup on very well! I ordered a set from BH Cosmetics that are cheaper in price and better in quality</li>
            <li> I honestly like these brushes better than the ones that come w/ my bareescentuals make up, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cute little pack. All the bristles are pretty soft. It is significantly cheaper than buying them in a store.</li>
            <li> This is my first ecotools set and I like it so far. Pretty good for the price I would definitely buy it again. The brushes are really soft... too soft?as in it doesn&#x27;t pick up much product but I actually don&#x27;t mind because I like a light look and rather go In again if needed more you can just swirl it in a little harder and you&#x27;ll be fine.The reason its 4 stars is because of the brow brush seems a little cheap. It&#x27;s not the worst I had.</li>
            <li> I love ecotool brushes. I had a set and just wanted another one I could alternate with. They were exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I bought the set after trying a few of their brushes. The blush brush is very static-ky when you apply powder. The eyebrow/eyelash comb brush is secure to the stick and does a poor job. The blending eyeshadow brushes are also okay, not the best but get the job done. The lip brush is useless and the eyeliner brush is my favorite, it has the right amount of stiffness to apply liner.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes but i don&#x27;t love them.Overall i don&#x27;t use them much, unless my other brushes are dirty and i&#x27;m using several eyeshadows,i don&#x27;t really like the blush brush very much though it is soft and all, they pick up too much of the product..i even don&#x27;t like it for foundation.i like the eyeshadow brush it&#x27;s ok,again i only use it if my other brushes are dirty, &amp; i really like the lash&amp;brow groomer,probably the brush i like most here,i use it to remove excess mascara.the liner brush is ok sturdy but seems too big to me maybe because i have small eye but i would use more eventually.i dont use the concealer brush at all.overall it&#x27;s a good price, ecofriendly, probably would recommend this if you are starting up with makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just starting off in make-up so I saw no reason to go buy an expensive set. So I don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to but I still love it. The brushes are really soft and the tote bag is cute. It also comes with a little sample of their mango butter...OMG. I&#x27;m looking for it now so I can purchase some!</li>
            <li> Nice set of make up brushes that have held up very well. Make up goes on smoothly with these brushes. Have washed them with no issues.</li>
            <li> Good product with reasonable price</li>
            <li> Awesome deal, I love these.  I have an older set as well, and they hold up after cleaning and many uses.</li>
            <li> Some of my favorite brushes. My favorite is the powder brush. They&#x27;re all super soft. The case gets dirty really easily though...and I can&#x27;t clean it. lol.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are all really soft, but apply makeup flawlessly. I would recommend these for any everyday look!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes because I had my eye on the Aveda flax sticks, and I realized that these were made of the same material (brush heads, not handle). The others were seriously more expensive, so I decided to get these. All I can say is WOW! The bristles are nice and soft, they don&#x27;t shed, and they hold up very well. While I will always love that other company and be devoted to their products, these are a fabulous stand-in if you, like me, simply cannot justify the high cost of those other brushes. Nice item!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are just like the ones you would buy from walmart or hannaford. The are full and work great!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and I washed them and they didn&#x27;t fall apart.</li>
            <li> Very soft and last for long.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a great brush that wouldn&#x27;t put me in the poor house. I&#x27;m not an everyday make up wearer, so investing in an extravagant brush set was not in order. I use to own a few high retail brushes that were gifted of course, but since they are now about 5 years old, they started shedding on my face every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reviewing another brand, I came across a recommendation for this brand, so I ordered. As soon as I received I naturally diva&#x27;ed out in the mirror and wowser! These are great. They even survived several washes since. (Always goes back to it&#x27;s original texture) I might be an amateur but I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> I dont wear a lot of makeup so I didn&#x27;t feel like I could justify buying a 18- 30 piece makeup brush set. This was the perfect amount of utensils. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set and it&#x27;s a great buy especially for the price. It includes all the essential brushes - blush brush, eyeshadow brush, concealer brush, eyeliner brush, and lash &amp; brow brush. I like this set because I don&#x27;t like to have any more brushes than necessary. The packaging is very cute and Eco-friendly. I love the canvas pouch it comes in - there&#x27;s a separate pocket in the back that can hold makeup so it&#x27;s great to take on-the-go. I don&#x27;t have much experience in using makeup brushes but they feel very high quality and may even be better than the more expensive options. The bristles feel soft and apply makeup very nicely.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes. Soft bristles that do not shed. Love them!</li>
            <li> Beautiful brushes and a great quality for the price.  Had one set of these for years and just had to replace because my luggage got lost, very happy!</li>
            <li> Got this as a &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; set for my teen and ended up buying more for me.  Brushes have withstood many washings, by hand with a little soapy water and air dries.  Bristles do not fall out and stay soft.  Like the fabric storage it came with.</li>
            <li> I have never been big into using brushes until I watched a few tutorials on makeup application.  Everyone uses a variety of brushes.  I research everything before I buy it, so naturally I did the same with makeup brushes.  I had no idea that they could be so expensive, and then I came across this brand.  One thing I hate about a blush brush or any brush for that matter is for the bristles to be left on my face or to just come out at all.  It is so annoying.  That hasn&#x27;t happened with these.  I am really impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using these for a few months now and they are really great quality.  I liked them so much that I bought a concealer brush and foundation brush to go along with this set.  I love them!</li>
            <li> These Ecotools are so soft and work GREAT! So glad i purchased this set</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. What a difference in  makeup application theses make. A must have to have in your makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I got the 6 piece make up set the other day, and they&#x27;re really very nice. They&#x27;re all very soft and well made. The handles are smooth, and the carry pouch is very convenient and perfect for travel. It also has a zippered portion on it to keep some small pots of makeup, which is nice because I was needing something like that. The quality of these brushes is far above the price of them. They&#x27;re much nicer than my Bare Minerals brushes that are much more expensive. The Bare Minerals ones I have kind of drag across my face even after washing, but these brushes are very smooth and soft. I showed my new purchase to my mom, and she was so impressed by them (and the price!) that she asked me right away to order another set for her, which I just did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I forgot I already reviewed these but thought I&#x27;d still give an update. I&#x27;ve now had the brushes for three months, and they&#x27;ve held up very well and still feel new. I&#x27;ve washed them multiple times with gentle soaps (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and a Trader Joe&#x27;s bar soap), and they&#x27;ve done wonderfully. They&#x27;re still perfectly soft, and I haven&#x27;t lost any bristles during cleaning. I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday, but I wash them every second or third time I use them. To be honest, I mainly wash them because I&#x27;m washing my Bare Minerals brushes at the same time. I could probably go a lot longer without washing them (but I won&#x27;t for hygiene&#x27;s sake, of course!). They also seem to dry pretty quickly, too. The much larger blush brush dries more quickly than my smaller Bare Minerals foundation brush. Makeup sticks well to the brushes when I want it to comes but off nicely when I&#x27;m applying it and when I shake off the excess makeup after applying (possibly why they stay cleaner longer?). When I get some more money, I&#x27;m planning on getting the 5-piece set with the mineral powder brush so I can stop using my Bare Minerals brushes altogether.</li>
            <li> I love this product :)&lt;br /&gt;it is so soft for the face  ..&lt;br /&gt;you can actually clean it with water and they are still good :)&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE FACE ..</li>
            <li> This is a very good basic brush set.  So far none of the brushes have shed.  There&#x27;s a size and style for any of my makeup needs in this one set.</li>
            <li> Ecotools brush set is great. Very natural and work great.</li>
            <li> They are soft and comfortable to your skin. Good to apply anything on your face. I use it to provide liquid foundation, it works better than I thought. Fair price too.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I had marykay for brush and this brand blow them away. I throw away my marykays.</li>
            <li> I have some really expensive brushes, and they are in their case underneath my bathroom sink.  Since getting these brushes, I have used nothing else!  They work really, really well with mineral make-up and feel wonderful.  So for less than the price of one of my other brushes, I got an entire set.  I am sold on this brand!</li>
            <li> got the eye brush set and the six piece brush set. i recommend to buy these two sets together. makes for a decent 12 piece set (thats 10 brushes and 2 cases for the brushes). also the 6 piece set has an extra pocket attached (cosmetic bag) which zips up. the eye brush set will fit in that pocket along with small make up as well (also good to have that small mirror).the bag has velcro which will hold the bag over the brushes to protect them too. the brushes look even better in person. very soft. the eye brushes arent too small its a good size. also i like that i can fit it into my small purses for on the go and wont take up too much room in my makeup bag.love that the brushes are labeled to tell me what to do. also there is more description how to use brushes on back of packaging. great beginners brushes! so awesome cant wait to play. ;)</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I love all Ecotools products.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and she liked it......that is all I need to know!</li>
            <li> Eco Tools are my brushes of choice. I&#x27;ve tried other brands (MAC, Lancome, Sephora, etc). These brushes are the softest among everything I tried. In my opnion, the best feature is that brushes don&#x27;t scratch up the product into large chunks, they pick up smallest particles. This way everything blends nicely into skin.&lt;br /&gt;This particular set, however, doesn&#x27;t have my favorite eco tools eye shadow brush shapes. The brush in the set that is labeled for eye shadow is just ok, perhaps would be more suitable for cream shadow? The reason for 5 stars: blush brush and angled eyeliner brush are excellent, and at that point it&#x27;s already a bargain.</li>
            <li> To clarify, I didn&#x27;t exactly buy these because they were Eco-friendly so you won&#x27;t hear comments on how I&#x27;m so glad that my makeup brushes don&#x27;t harm the environment BUT I do have thoughts on the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These took a while to break in, in my case. When I first felt the bristles, they felt too stiff for me so I used the other softer brushes that came with my various palettes. They&#x27;re good for padding on color, but I&#x27;m having difficulty blending with them given their slight stiffness. They&#x27;re definitely not Sigma quality, but for the price, it&#x27;s a good bargain. I like that they&#x27;re labeled according to what they&#x27;re meant to do - blush, concealer, eyeshadow, ect. The eyeliner brush is a little too thick for detailed lines, but that may be just my personal preference. They also come in a cute zip bag, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s biodegradable like the brushes are.</li>
            <li> The largest brush is perfect for blush and so soft!  These brushes are well-made and look nice standing in a glass on my vanity!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend&#x27;s birthday. Before giving it, I made sure to open it up and check the brushes. Each was sturdy with soft bristles. It felt well made. Bonus is that the wood is made of bamboo. Very eco-friendly, which feeds my vanity.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just perfect! Soft bristles, no shed, great quality! &amp; a cute little pouch! oh, &amp; eco friendly you just can&#x27;t go wrong here(: ps: I&#x27;ve seen these brushes for a lot more, so you&#x27;re definitely getting a steal here!</li>
            <li> These brushes have a nice feel to them - very soft and work great. Would recommend the eye shadow kit as it has a nice variation of bushes for all eye shadow work.</li>
            <li> Love the softness of the brushes. Eyeshadow and eyeliner brush work WONDERFULLY. Have not really used concealer brush yet. Only one point of disappointment, the travel bag it came in is in pretty bad shape after not much use at all. Started unraveling in the seams, but I&#x27;m not too concerned.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item. They are great. A great price and great service .&lt;br /&gt;I bought then for my self and I was very pleased</li>
            <li> Great brush set and an awesome price!  Includes everything you need for make-up application, and a zipper bag is included.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with these makeup brushes. They are absolutely fantastic. You don&#x27;t need to go out and buy $50 professional makeup brushes believe me! Great price and WORTH EVERY PENNY. highly reccomended you get them. Also I was impressed with how fast they came. I clicked standard shipping and Amazon had shipped it to my doorstep the very next day.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. I am enjoying the set!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and they changed up the blush brush a bit. its slightly flatter and more feathered out. its fantastic.</li>
            <li> This brush set is my life saver. Very good quality and they have lasted me a while. Deff recommend. great</li>
            <li> I bought this pack when I first saw it at the store.  Since they started in 2008, I think it was about then.  I supplemented the set with a liquid foundation brush ([[ASIN:B00A44H6MC Bamboo Ecotools Soft Makeup Cosmetic Foundation Powder Blush Brush Beauty Tool]]), a powder brush ([[ASIN:B001KYVLSU EcoTools Large Powder Brush]]), and a retractable powder brush that I used as a mineral foundation applier (similar to [[ASIN:B001MX89Y8 EcoTools Retractable Kabuki]]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyebrow brush/comb did lose teeth and come off the handle after a couple years.  Those types of brushes never hold up forever for me.  I replaced it with a mascara wand type brush.  And after years of rough use (I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m doing it wrong and some of that wear should be transferred to the concealer brush), the foundation brush has finally started to shed and needs replacing.  All other brushes have virtually no change.  Still super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying these brushes, I received a pack of Estee Lauder brushes as a gift with a perfume purchase.  I tried one of those, and gave the whole set to a friend who didn&#x27;t have any brushes.  The EcoTools are so soft that no other brush can compare.  (Yes I know they were free, but they were still from a \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; makeup company and should have been comparable to something I can get at Kmart.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EcoTools bristles hold just enough product.  The blush is natural, yet the eyeshadow brush holds almost enough to do both eyes (this depends on the quality of the eyeshadow).  I love the angled eyeliner brush.  Use with any dark powder. I also love the softness of the blush and powder brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping the quality has increased the slight amount I need for the foundation brush (the style seems to have changed), but I likely won&#x27;t be able to tell you for another five years.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!! Great quality , can wash them without bristles falling out!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried! My friend has used them long time ago and she always told me how great they were and finally I decide to take the chance. OMG! They are incredible! Perfect and suuuuuper gentle with your skin!</li>
            <li> Love these. They are soft, easy to handle, and hold the make-up well. Great gift.</li>
            <li> As I have said before, I have used the Eco Tools before and I have always liked them. Great Brushes!</li>
            <li> No shedding so far, really good quality. Its a very good buy been using eco-tools for a while and i have no complaints. Wish they had a set with all the brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! These last forever and don&#x27;t have that awful chemical smell that most &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; brushes tend to have. The pouch is adorable too! I used to waste so much money on &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; brushes.. never again. These are just as good, last just as long, and you get so much more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This product is great quality and the price was the cheapest I&#x27;ve found. I was very satisfied. Like the variety of brushes for the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so overrated. I bought this package mostly for the blush brush, it&#x27;s awful and does not apply blush how it should.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was spoiled by the older edition(bought in 2010 or 2011?) which was amazing quality esp for the price, but I recently but a new set and the quality is severely diminished. The brushes are less dense (less brush hairs) so its a lot less effective, also for the biggest one the shape has changed (more splayed out like a fan than like a cone). Sorry I&#x27;m not a make-up guru so I don&#x27;t know the technical terms.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the pack, although you will probably end up using only 1 or 2 of the brushes. Face it, you knew this from the start!</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes for the price, but you may still have to buy a powder/blush brush as the one that comes with is very stiff.  After months of use I&#x27;ve only had a couple of hairs come loose, and only on the eyebrow brush.  The case they come in is quite handy for traveling, as well.</li>
            <li> These were really nice and did not shed.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry and use. Good quality makes my makeup looks greater than before. This is the second time I bought this item.</li>
            <li> The brushes are fantastic and the carrying case is super handy.  I will definitely order from Ecotools again.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable in the price, still using them to this day. I can even hand wash the brushes and no strings came out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soooo soft! And the concealer and eye shadow brush are perfect c: must have!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!  I LOVE that their function is marked on the handle (i.e. concealer, large eye, blush...)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these brushes for a few months now and I love them! The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that the eyebrow brush broke. However, all of the other brushes have served me very well, especially for the price. I would recommend them to anyone who needs a set of cheap but well-made make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. The brushes are super soft but sturdy and the bag makes me feel much better than the plastic souvenir ones I usually get from Macys with the purchase of cosmetics. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet but I will one of these days and I think it&#x27;ll hold up. I&#x27;ll never buy drugstore makeup brushes again.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality of these brushes. The brush is longer then most which makes them easier to use.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic and the set is sold at a super low price. They&#x27;re on the same level as my MAC brushes, which I know if MAC sold them the set would be above $50 or even $100. I liked them so much I bought the eye brush set too. I could careless if they&#x27;re eco-friendly, but I guess that&#x27;s a bonus too.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this set from Amazon.com- i got it from Walgreens, but let me tell you- this set is AMAZING! the bristles on the brushes are really soft, so they dont have that gross scratchy feel to them. also, they are environmentally friendly for anyone wanting to go green. LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> These are really soft. I had bought another brand on Amazon which was pricier, but they were rough. I didn&#x27;t like how they felt on my eyelids. These, however, are very soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome set has everything you need for your morning routine.  Soft as silk and easy to maintain and clean...can&#x27;t beat the price either.  I have bought expensive brushes in the past, and these are just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> So soft and the quality is amazing. They are just like my other ecotools brushes. Not fakes. The angled eyeliner brush is thin which is great for putting on gel eyeliner,</li>
            <li> I bought this as a back up for when my other brushes are dirty and I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with how well they have  held up especially the powder brush. The eye brushes in  this set are pretty sub-par and I don&#x27;t reach for them at all.  In all honesty I would chose real techniques brushes over these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooooo soft.  I love them.  And it makes me happy that they are all natural.  I need to see if they clean well, though.  I haven&#x27;t done that yet.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> Love this - the brushes are soft, good quality, and best of all, eco-friendly. The only thing is that the lash and brow groomer is pretty rubbish and a disappointment since that&#x27;s what I originally bought the set for, but the other brushes make up for it. Got a Tweezerman folding eyelash comb instead, much more effective.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these brushes. I bought a set for my sister for Christmas and a set for myself as well. These are very pretty brushes and are very soft. I like the little bag they come in, and the size of each is ideal. HOWEVER, these did not pick up my make-up well. I use Nars blush, MAC and Urban Decay shadows, etc. They are very pigmented, but these brushes barely picked anything up. I had to push harder and stroke it over the blush/shadow more than usual, and it still fell from the brush in a way my other brushes don&#x27;t. I am not a &amp;#34;brush snob&amp;#34; by any  means - I use a Bare Minerals blush brush but an e.l.f. shadow brush...whatever works works despite the price. I won&#x27;t purchase these again and would advise against them. Just disappointed because they really are beautiful, and I liked the idea of them being eco friendly.</li>
            <li> I wanted a small set of brushes for my cruise...my normal makeup brushes are long handled and big..to big to pack in the minimal amount of luggage I was taking.  The eyeshadow brushes are a good size and even the powder brush was large enough so it didn&#x27;t leave streaks like small brushes can.  The brushes are soft and hold mineral makeup nicely.  I think I&#x27;ll look for a larger set next time I need makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;This set is great for travel and the pouch it comes in very handy..my grand daughter ended up using it to hold her room card, which she kept loosing.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for women who travel but also like to take makeup.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and they are made from bamboo which is eco-friendly! Win-Win! They are also very soft and well made.</li>
            <li> I love the little carrying pouch that these brushes came in! The brushes are very high quailty. I love the different choices of the eyeshadow brushes. and bamboo is such a great and versatile material! Do reccomend.</li>
            <li> So many makeup brushes cost a lot of money then don&#x27;t last very long. These don&#x27;t cost much but work better than some of the expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> THE. MOST. SOFTEST. BRUSHES. EVER. What more can I say? Easy to wash and still remained the soft texture. I like the mini comb thingy too. I should use these often. :p</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup brushes I have used so far. Very easy to use. each brush is labeled according to which they should be used for. The pouch it came in is sturdy. The brushes hold up well. Easy to clean. Makeup stays on the brush when appling to your face.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes with quality synthetic Teklon bristles (most other brushes are made with the hair of dead goats, badgers, squirrels, etc.).  They are very well made with no loose bristles. I&#x27;m so happy that such a reasonably-priced set works so well for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Using these brushes for a week now and they&#x27;re great! The bristles are so soft, I&#x27;m really surprised that they aren&#x27;t animal? Anyway they work wonderfully and are very gentle on my sensitive skin. Better price than in-store.</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best brushes I have ever used.  The soft bristles are perfectly combined with comfortable bamboo grips.  The blush brush is especially wonderful.  I would probably spend all day smooshing my face with it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that that&#x27;s not a socially acceptable way of conducting oneself in public!  The bag that comes with the brushes is also just the right size for a traveling makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping. Ordered on Friday, recieved on Sunday. Bought these because I heard they were great for beginners. Can confirm. I am brand-spankin new to the world of makeup and in love the bamboo handles and how soft they are.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, everything you need and has a carrying case too, very nice</li>
            <li> I like these brushes okay. For me they have three major draw backs. First they are very rough. The bristles are almost irritating to the skin because they are stiff and rough. The second draw back is that they don&#x27;t hold powder very well. For my every day look I use these for contouring powders I need to use a light hand with, and the crease of my eye shadow because they do not hold enough for an all over application. Third and the biggest drawback for me is that bristles fall out constantly. I could chalk the roughness up to being &amp;#34;environmentally conscious&amp;#34; and the fact that the brushes dont hold powder could be blamed on their roughness. I still would have a use for them if they were just rough and didnt hold powder well, but what makes me not use them is that bristles fall out. I will be trying to work powder into my concealer while its still wet and I will end up with a bristle stuck to my face. I am not vigorously pushing the brush against my face either. This has happened numerous times and even after I washed the brushes thinking that would get all of the loose ends out it still occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion: buy one of the single brushes from your local Wal-Mart where they sell this brand and if you like it then return it and purchase the kit from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with the shipping or the company itself. I think this type of brush is just not what i&#x27;m used to using, If you like this type of brush then I would have no problem recommending the distributor but i do recommend trying them before you buy the whole kit.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve boughten a lot of eco tool brushes before from stores like Ulta and Sephora. These arrived but they looked fake as soon as I opened them. The bristles are too shiny and the bamboo stick part it s bit too yellow in color. I compared them with other eco tool brushes and they definitely look different. Not sure if they&#x27;re original ones or fake but I won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again</li>
            <li> I LOVE this 6 piece brush set! they are bamboo and the bristles are so soft and apply very well! Totally suggest buying these!</li>
            <li> Best brushes for the price! My sister had these brushes and I used them thinking they were super expensive. I was surprised to find out how reasonable they were.</li>
            <li> nice, came in a nice little zipper pouch, although this will be a gift, so not sure on the specifics of how they feel and work..</li>
            <li> I am very happy now I can buy brushes that do not shed or cost a small fortune.</li>
            <li> These brushes feel and look great but they don&#x27;t pick up the products well at all. I&#x27;m disappointed a bit</li>
            <li> All of the brush are amazing. The brushes are very soft also the tiny cute bag that come with comes handy to carry them around in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes !!  A great buy !!! Very well made - and the bristles do not fall out like in so many other brands.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging, and of course the brushes. I&#x27;ve been updating my collection, and am really satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are affordable, easy to clean, and held up well over time.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, no need to buy the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Great price, and washable!</li>
            <li> The brushes do not &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; and that is great.  This is a good group of brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft--leaves no brush hairs behind.  Eye shadow and blush goes where I want it, no streaks, blends well, with no mess.</li>
            <li> I love Bamboo! When I saw this Makeup Brush Set I had to get it!  Its pretty great! They&#x27;re very strong and well made, you won&#x27;t have any complaints! The 6pc Makeup Brush Set comes with a small bag to store the brushes in and its absolutely adorable! If you buy this product you wont be sorry!</li>
            <li> For the price these brushes are perfect. They are soft and Clean up nicely. I have bought a lot of these.</li>
            <li> Love these! They are soft, natural and have what each brush is to be used for printed on them! I would buy this again for a gift!</li>
            <li> much better price then the bare minerals brushes, and i think they feel just as good. plus they look great</li>
            <li> Quality brushes...very soft! Just as good as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality.. kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are very soft and do not irritate.  I like the variety in the pack and they seem to be well made.</li>
            <li> I had mixed feelings about these makeup brushes for the month that I owned them. I used them at least 5 times and although some of them worked OKAY, they just were not worth the money IMO. The blush brush seemed to pick up makeup well but the other brushes were useless from my experience. Makeup just doesn&#x27;t stick to them at all. The quality and softness is nice but they just didn&#x27;t serve their purpose. As much as I wanted and tried to like them, I had to return them in order to avoid feeling like I totally wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the Ecotools Kabuki brush and their foundation brush is decent but I would pass on this set.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the Bare Minerals makeup brushes, which are somewhere around $25/$30 (for the foundation brush). These are really no different in terms of quality and they&#x27;re not as expensive. They are very soft and have been holding up well (I&#x27;ve had them for several months and use the big brush at least four times a week). Would def recommend. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year follow up: These brushes have held up wonderfully and I use the foundation brush very often. I actually washed the foundation brush as well as the smaller fat brush today with antibacterial dish soap and they wash great too! Looks like they are brand new after being washed...You won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I like the eco bamboo! It&#x27;s sustainable and the brushes were a good price with a nice zippered pouch.  These ARE soft brushes, not at all stiff.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  After reading tons of reviews I ordered these for my girlfriend and she loves them.  Replaced Bare Mineral brushes.  They dont fall apart and shed every where.</li>
            <li> Love this brush set! I haven&#x27;t used the eye liner brush or the eye shadow brush, but I love the others! They are very soft and I have not had one break yet. I wish the concealer brush was a bit smaller and more flexible, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed about this listing though: the main picture shows brushes with copper metal and the others show silver. The copper is the NEW style for 2013!!! The silver is the old! I ordered this back in September of 2012 and I got the brushes with the silver metal. I don&#x27;t know if you would get copper or silver if you ordered now.</li>
            <li> this is a nice little brush set.  it has all the basic pieces that a girl would want or need.  nice little pouch to store them in.</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes! Each and every one of them was useful and durable. Definetly worth the money and they last a long time</li>
            <li> These brushes are very soft. They don&#x27;t pick up like I thought they would, but I still like them.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> Fantastic set! Great quality, beautiful bag, just very essential brushes at a great price! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love the brushes and the carrying case. This set is exactly what I needed. The brushes well made and the bristles are nice and soft. The handles fit comfortably. I would recommend this set to anyone who wears makeup.</li>
            <li> Brushes are good quality for that aspiring makeup artist. Not being covered in pink, glitter, flowers, flowers and glitter, pink unicorns was a huge plus for me. Hairs don&#x27;t come out so far and my younger brother is pleased.</li>
            <li> EcoTools makes quality products, but the handles on these brushes are disappointing. They feel like cheap plastic, not bamboo. Bristles are soft, though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought eco-tools in the past, with good experiences. The concealer brush included is pretty harsh and pricks the skin. It might just be the one I bought though, but I was kind of surprised. It&#x27;s a bit better after an olive oil treatment, but still. Got to love the brow brush though. Fantastic. :)</li>
            <li> They are very nice.  Some are stiffer than I expected, and the big one is a little smaller than I thought, but they have all been great.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have been using them for several months and have washed them and rewashed them and they still look new, I love them even more.</li>
            <li> Very nice set! Bristles are soft and they dont shed! Softer than the other brushes I was used to but only took a little bit to get used to the softness and now I like it better! Wouldn&#x27;t trust any other brand.</li>
            <li> Great starter brushes. Very soft! I bought these based on a youtube recommendation and I am not disappointed. They are soft and great quality for the price. I have a few smashbox brushed I use for foundation and blush/bronzer and these can easily compete. The case is very convenient and they pick up just the right amount of product. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> ecotools in general are the best makeup brushes out there on the market, affordable, soft on the skin, JUST PERFECT</li>
            <li> These brushes are soo soft and great quality. They are my new favorite and the price is great! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> this was an amazing product. Ive had them for a few months now and they are still in great shape even after constant use. i would definitely recommend buying them. The brushes are very soft on your face. I think the best part is that they are made out of recycled material.</li>
            <li> I have been using this set for 7 months now and all the brushes are still in great condition. They are not losing bristles. This kit is a great one for the price!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes on time like around 1pm. It took only 2 days and I did not have to pay extra ;) I just recently used the brushes... they are tremendously soft and my makeup goes on more smooth than the other brushes that I had in the past. I am happy that I received a concealer brush as well. This is the best order ever!!!!! I love Amazon:-) :-)</li>
            <li> Eco Tools make great affordable brushes. These are no different, come in a cute little pouch that&#x27;s perfect for throwing in your bag for on the go use.</li>
            <li> This brush set was so cheap, I wasn&#x27;t sure what the quality would be like. Well, they are amazing. Super soft, great construction - haven&#x27;t lost any bristles and have been using them for 2 weeks. The cloth bag that they come with is great: has elastic loops to firmly hold all the brushes in, and a zippered compartment in case you want to carry extra makeup etc. My only complaint with this set is that if you roll the bag up around the brushes, the velcro that holds it shut has nowhere to stick. I just wrap them up and then use a hairtye around the bag though, which works just fine. Seriously great product for a super cheap price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very comparable to the high-end brushes you would buy from the mall or expensive makeup stores. The difference is they&#x27;re affordable and eco-friendly. Very soft brushes and hair does not fall out even after washing them every 2 weeks to maintain care. Great quality for price paid!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and a cheaper and better alternative from MAC and other top brush brands. The brushes are softer than a baby&#x27;s butt , they absorb make-up well and do not shed. Planning to purchase more from Ecotools and will recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> I love them! They are super soft :)</li>
            <li> The case has a front and back pocket, very convenient. Eco-friendly, cruelty free, super soft. I love all of their products and will continue to buy more. Check out my full review at: emeraldsugar dot com and click on ecotools</li>
            <li> still using these like 2 years later... only one that didn&#x27;t hold up is the eyebrow/lash comb.</li>
            <li> I had a set of these brushes for years and they lasted beautifully. I lost a few of my brushes recently and knew I would purchase the same brand. The quality is still very good and they do the job. The bristles are soft and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because one of my friends had the same exact one. All of the brushes are lovely. They&#x27;re soft enough to not irritate but still fulfill their each individual purposes well. The fact that the product is not harmful to the environment is a huge plus. My only problem is that the brushes don&#x27;t have any protection besides the case. For instance, other brushes come with a plastic cap or wrap to protect them, these don&#x27;t. Also the Velcro on the carrying case that comes with the brushes isn&#x27;t secured as well as it could be. My friend&#x27;s has already fallen off. Other than that the product is great, hence the 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for almost 2 years now, and they are still holding up.  I use the set approximately 1 or 2 times a week before I go out on weekends.  It was a great set for a guy like myself who isn&#x27;t that familiar with the makeup world to use.</li>
            <li> I am excited about my brushes.  I am a beginner with applying make-up so my friend that is an expert with make-up and uses MAC products told me that I made a good investment to start out and she was really impressed with the concealer brush.  As I progress, so will my brushes by Eco</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and the handles are of good quality. This was the type of set that got me to start using EcoTools :-) I re-ordered my second set because my old was destroyed (along with my one luggage) when travelling :-(</li>
            <li> These brushes have lasted me about two years and their still going strong. I bought some Sonia Kashuk brushes not too long ago and they couldn&#x27;t hold a flame to these. The Sonia Kashuk ones are terrible quality for the same price as these. The bristles on these brushes are unbelievably soft and the handles are very comfortable. They even look beautiful because of their bamboo handles. 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> My daughter will not let here mom use them. She said they are perfect. Brushes do not fall apart, just as many other reviewers suggested.</li>
            <li> So, I am not a huge make-up wearer but these brushes are nice. They&#x27;re very soft and they do a good job of distributing product where you want it. I have been able to achieve a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look very easily with these.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this item for the brushes and partly because of that little travel bag they come in. Unfortunately, the zipper broke the first time she tried to open the bag. It wouldn&#x27;t open more than a half inch before the zipper tab broke off. She had to cut open the bag with a pair of scissors to get the brushes out. The bag is now useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, she says the brushes are very soft and is satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product; it&#x27;s fantastic for the price. I&#x27;ve used a lot of brushes in the past but these are supremely comfortable and very efficient at doing their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I received my Amazon envelope, the packaging was torn and the pouch seemed to have been opened before. I was severely disappointed by this, but since I needed to use the brushes, I couldn&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t leave selling feedback (since this is an add-on item) which is why I am writing it here, in the hopes that someone in charge can see it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set - I&#x27;ve only used the blush brush and one of the eye shadow brushes so far.  They are soft and don&#x27;t shed, and do a decent job (I like the blush brush better than the eye shadow one - wish it was a little softer.  My other blush brush used to shed all the time, so I was happy that this one doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s a great deal for someone who will be using all the various brushes, who wears more makeup than I do.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ! Love these tools !</li>
            <li> I COULD BUY THEM AGAIN</li>
            <li> EcoTools BAMBOO 6-pc Makeup Brush Set 1206 is a good product for a good price.It comes with a bag in which you can keep your brushes.</li>
            <li> Brushes are holding up nicely and are soft!  Priced right and clean easily!  I&#x27;ll wash them out in the morning and by the evening they&#x27;re dry and ready for use again.</li>
            <li> These brushes are a really nice quality for a great price. And they are the copper edition, which are the newer version so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> Love eco tools for good affordable brushes that won&#x27;t fall apart on you.</li>
            <li> Good quality brushes for a good price! They&#x27;re great brushes for starting out and they&#x27;re very versatile.</li>
            <li> Disappointed bristles are so soft it&#x27;s awesome but then the handles fell off!!</li>
            <li> I love the bag this comes in, making it a great set of brushes to use for travel or keep in your purse. It has a pocket for putting makeup in, but does not hold much (e.g. a smaller Naked 2 palette + mascara).</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I am not a girly girl, so I am probably not the most knowledgable reviewer here because I&#x27;ve never owned a set of brushes before, just a few sponges. But that said, I&#x27;ve used other peoples brushes on them when I did their makeup for plays. I&#x27;ve also used the brushes the theatre provides on myself when I acted years ago, so while I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday I am not a stranger to it. That said in my latest foray into self improvement I decided to buy this because I decided maybe people would treat me as more of a professional if I wore makeup (Freakily it worked and I found I actually enjoyed putting makeup on. While it is probably all the positive reinforcement, who knows, my body might actually prefer the none chemical loaded brushes.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here goes: I love the shape of these and the quality. I&#x27;ve felt other brushes before and generally never bought them because they were synthetics and they felt very oil-like, kind of weird on the fingers. I don&#x27;t know, they just creeped me out. I also like the case they come in because the pouch in the back fits my mineral eyeshadow, which comes in a rectangular box, really well. I wish the fabric part was easier to clean but it&#x27;s not impossible to do so.</li>
            <li> the do the job, I purchased these new ones to replace the same old brushes I had that broke due to age .</li>
            <li> Perfect for every woman.</li>
            <li> I think really good value. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed for eye makeup. Most of the \\&quot;makeup brush kits\\&quot; don&#x27;t have the ones you usually use and I have to buy separate. But this one has eye shadow brush, blender brush &amp; eyeliner brush. It even has concealor &amp; blush which don&#x27;t usually use but comes in handy.</li>
            <li> I luv luv luv these brushes !!!!!!!, they are now my go-to brushes. iherb has them for $5.40 when you use the coupon code below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  $5.00 off your first purchase (No Minimum)&lt;br /&gt;  OR&lt;br /&gt;  $10.00 off your first purchase when you spend $40.00 or more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  USE CODE: JFD670</li>
            <li> High quality, comes with a cute bag, great for someone who doesn&#x27;t need a lot of brushes or is looking for an on-the-go set.</li>
            <li> best for me doing bjd face up work. no shedding.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!  They&#x27;re so easy to use and clean and extremely soft too! I&#x27;m the kind of person that does NOT use makeup all the time, so these brushes were perfect for me to buy.  Good brushes for a good price!</li>
            <li> This is a the second pack I&#x27;ve bought from ecotools. First set was for me, this set was for my mum. These are excellent value for money. They are very good quality and the brushes are lovely and soft. I&#x27;ve had mine for years. They are lasting and lasting and don&#x27;t seem to be degrading in any way. Also, really like the fact that these brushes are made from natural materials, recycled materials and are stated as &#x27;cruelty free&#x27;. Pretty cool. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this set about 2 years ago and never wrote a review. But 2 years later I am still using them! The bristles are soft and easy to clean. I have never had a problem with the bristles falling out. They work as well as the day I got them. I highly recommend EcoTools to everyone who is looking for a good quality low cost Brush set.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend these brushes.  They are very soft and seem to be great quality.  I received them very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really pretty. However the makeup doesn&#x27;t stick that well to them and makes it harder to apply. Kind of defeats the purpose</li>
            <li> The wife writing here...&lt;br /&gt;Each brush works pretty good and if this is all you need or you&#x27;re not bothered if your makeup brushes don&#x27;t match then this would be a good set for you. If however, you&#x27;re into mineral makeup and are looking for matching brushes from this company, you may be disappointed. I tried the powder brushes from this line and they are not really all that soft. A bit prickly and some are just weird shaped. I know it&#x27;s silly to want them all to match but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> Very Soft brushes.  I&#x27;ve washed them 2-3 times since I purchased them and they are holding up really well too.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. If your looking for good quality without breaking the bank these are the brushes to get. Its especially good for beginners who are just getting into makeup and getting a feeling of what brushes are good and what ones are not. Of course your going to want the more expensive brushes that are absolutely flawless (we all do), but its always nice to have a good quality backup set for times when you don&#x27;t get around to cleaning your more expensive brushes or wan to give your expensive brushes a break.</li>
            <li> These are high-quality brushes and great for a beginner - they&#x27;re labeled on the bottom of each brush for what they&#x27;re for. The bag they come in is very nice too!</li>
            <li> These are very nice brushes, and they come with a handy, nicely-designed pouch to store them in. I was buying these to replace an earlier version of the same set. The set comes with pretty much all the basics you might need, and it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> These are great.  Nice soft brushes, convenient carry case.  Made applying eye makeup much easier, especially when compared to using my fingers to smear the stuff everywhere.  Great starter brush kit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner in the makeup world and I was looking for some decent, good quality brushes. I know elf sells cheap ones, but I needed more sturdy brushes. THESE WERE PERFECT.&lt;br /&gt;I owned the bronzing brush before I bought this 6 piece set and the way it held up through washing and daily application was so good. I&#x27;ve had no shedding whatsoever (in a span of 3-4 months, multiple washings), and the bristles are still soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this set has been very useful, I&#x27;ve used only the blush brush and the eyebrow/eyelash brush so far. The blush brush is really good at distributing product evenly and it&#x27;s very soft. It picks up product very well. I use the other tool to separate my eyelashes after mascara and it&#x27;s perfect for that as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend these brushes, and ecotools in general, to anyone who loves makeup. Beginners and pros will enjoy the quality!</li>
            <li> Had great reviews, I was happy about the Eco friendly aspect, but honestly was a little disappointed, they work ok, but probably will replace them.</li>
            <li> I find the same quality as expensive brushes but with the added benefit of being eco and cruelty free! I really recommend trying them!</li>
            <li> I used the big brush first to apply mineral powder. it came out blotchy. Did not work for blending the powder at all. I can&#x27;t even remember if it was soft or not. I just saw it would not work for my mineral powder. Will return product. It might work for others. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They stay soft and last for a long time. I use these brushes daily and they hold up great and work very well!</li>
            <li> I bought this on my husband&#x27;s account, and was a little disappointed only because of the case.  The brushes are great, I have used EcoTools for years and love that they work well, are durable, and cruelty-free!  My only complaint is that the case does not match the one pictured.  The front is the same but the back is simply another open section without little &#x27;loops&#x27; to hold the brushes in place.  It opens from the top, rather from the side as pictured.  This isn&#x27;t hugely significant, but I was looking forward to easily organizing these brushes and now feel like I just have to throw them all in there.  Otherwise, the brushes overall are a wonderful product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Fits great in my purse.  sturdy and great deal</li>
            <li> I wanted natural brushes to go with my new organic makeup. These brushes were just the right addition. More than enough to apply all your makeup.</li>
            <li> Great make up brushes for a good price. Saw these in Ride Aide the the price was way to high so decided to check Amazon site...I use my brushes often and they not falling apart like other brands I have purchsed. GREAT BUY</li>
            <li> love them they&#x27;re amazing</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, soft and full. However I was really bummed that the make up bag is not what was shone in the pictures. It does not open and have individual slots for the brushes. That was half the reason I bought it! It&#x27;s one big clear pocket in front and one fabric pocket in back with a snap closure.</li>
            <li> My sister love this eco tools bamboo.</li>
            <li> I bought the brush set that is for applying  makeup after seeing a professional makeup artist, apply liquid foundation with a brush! BEAUTIFUL! Your makeup looks &amp;#34;airbrushed &amp;#34;.  I have since bought 3 more sets that have different uses. These brushes are of high quality for an unbelievable price!! I WANT THEM ALL!!</li>
            <li> A makeup artist told me that these were pretty good quality to do a makeup at home. These are really soft brushes! I&#x27;m happy with them :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to buy expensive makeup, but I decided to upgrade! Along with my new and improved makeup, I wanted some nicer brushes. I&#x27;, vegan, and these were a great price with great reviews! I use each on almost every day  and they&#x27;re great brushes! Soft, washable, and not streaky. i particularly like the eyelash/eyebrow groomer. Great product and it came super fast!</li>
            <li> For those wanting good eco products, these brushes fit the bill. And they work wonderfully! No bristles falling out all over your face like some do. Cannot beat the price &amp; quality. I have costly brushes that shed those bristles and go flat &amp; tangled after only a few uses!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom and she loves it! It became her favorite brushes! Gonna get more for her now!</li>
            <li> This is a great broad purpose set of brushes.  I don&#x27;t get overly detailed in my make-up application, so I don&#x27;t need more than this 6 piece set.  The bamboo handles feel sturdy and light weight, and the brush heads seem secure and long lasting.  The brush case is a nice bonus too!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and very soft feel. Great for a starter like myself.</li>
            <li> EcoTools products are very well made &amp; resonably priced.  I wish all of their products were sold in my local stores. I always keep extras around&amp; purchased their train case to keep stocked with my bathroom products for traveling with.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes my favorite ones are the eye brow one and the brush one .</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes! I had to buy new ones cause my whole makeup bag was stolen from my luggage on a trip. My bff recomended these and I would recommend them to anyone aswell. Very soft and so far no shedding. I also got the kabuki set too!</li>
            <li> They were perfect.....enjoying the brushes very much..they arrived &amp; are of great quality. I would highly suggest this brand.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I like EcoTools, so I got this, thinking it would be perfect to carry my essentials as well.  Well I really had to limit to the bare essentials only because the make-up bag part is only half, not the whole thing that you see doubled up.  If you get this set for your make-up, it will fit one eyeliner, 1 mascara, 1 blush and one or two eyeshadows just fine, with a space left over for earrings or tweezers or something equally tiny.  I can also fit my eyelash curler, but the bag barely closes on the little velcro square.</li>
            <li> I seriously love it and would definitely recommend it to everyone especially to beginners. Im kind of sensitive to make up particularly brushes but this one, you wont even hesitate to use it the first time you put your hand on it. Nice bamboo handles.. Definitely deserve a 5 star.</li>
            <li> This brush set is very durable and affordable. I would definitely be staying with this brand in future and I would recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are soooo soft. I am by no means a make-up artist, but these work for what I do. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a cheap, high quality set!</li>
            <li> Just bought it for the angle brush, but end up using/ love in the powder which i use for contour and the bag which i use for holding my pencils :p... Everything else is just bleh, the eye shadow and concealer brushes are way to thick and don&#x27;t apply well the products they are meant for.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! They are so soft and do the job VERY well. I bought the a few years ago. They are GREAT! I have two sets, one for everyday make up, the other for my stage make up. It&#x27;s really worth it. I also bought a few of the other brushes . If I need a make up brush, I check to see of EcoTools has the brush I need first. I haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. They are ego friendly of course, which to me isn&#x27;t a big deal, I mean sure go green, save energy, but I don&#x27;t really stress about it, if its something I don&#x27;t plan on throwing away for many years, if ever. So I don&#x27;t quiet see that it matters too much. Still, its great that it is. Now, the brushes are the softest I&#x27;ve ever seen. My brother borrowed one for a stage play he did in high school. He said he now knew why girls did make up every day, it was really to do a face massage every morning. They are easy to clean. I&#x27;m a conservative girl, you don&#x27;t buy something new if you already have something that can do the job. I just use my conditioner to clean out the brushes once a week and its&#x27; perfect. They haven&#x27;t shredded AT ALL in three years. They are perfect! Use them as they were made for, though I don&#x27;t use blush, just contouring. HIGHLY recommend. Get this and you won&#x27;t need new ones ANYTIME soon and you WON&#x27;T want to go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected</li>
            <li> The brushes are wonderful! All so soft and it&#x27;s a beautiful set. It shipped really fast as well. I didn&#x27;t expect it to come as early as it did.</li>
            <li> I found the three products that I ordered to be too stiff, smell bad, and not at all comfortable for the hand. They are cheap and it shows in all ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have sent them all back to Amazon - instead I tried to make do with them as replacements for my Bare Escentuals brushes and they simply will not do the job for me.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes were kind of stiff, and didn&#x27;t really pick up much product. But the blush brush is awesome. It picks up such a delicate amount of product that you can build up your blush or keep it light :)</li>
            <li> Although my only complaint about the powder brush I also reviewed was that it was too soft for a powder brush, these brushes are perfect for what they are meant to do.  I LOVE the extreme softness of these brushes and they hold just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> Most of those brushes I couldn&#x27;t find a good use to them except the blush and the angle brush but the quality is very good</li>
            <li> I just wish I had the opportunity to use these brushes more.</li>
            <li> I love em they are great awesome prise then at stores</li>
            <li> These are amazing quality synthetic make-up brushes made from bamboo and recycled materials. The packaging is great too, and has a linen pocket on the other side. It would be a great Christmas present for any girl.</li>
            <li> I am happy I got my brushes they are extremely awesome and I am pleased for making such and excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes, they&#x27;re soft. I have had no issues with any of these brushes, they apply makeup well, hey clean well, and they dry very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new in Amazon and I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They&#x27;re so soft and does not shed. I will be buying more. I have MAC brushes that shed and wasn&#x27;t thrilled about spending so much money for brush that sheds. One con with the Bamboo brushes is that the eyeshadow brush could be a bit more flexible in movement. Other than that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Im not a big make up wearer but I had so much fun with these brushes. They are high quality and great for the price. They are the softest brush I have ever put to my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes alongside the eye set, and I gotta say they worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are super soft against your skin, especially the blush brush. I actually use the brush blush in place of my Bare Minerals flawless face brush because this one is much softer. I use the eye shading in this set versus the other set, it packs the color on a lot better. The eyeliner brush is nice but I use a brush from the other set to line the bottom of my eyes. I gave the concealer brush to my mother but it works well as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are rated really well on amazon and youtube and they can be found at Target and the Christmas tree shop if you would like to them in person.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes, praying that the blush brush would be soft &amp; not hard on my skin. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This is probably the nicest, highest quality brush I&#x27;ve ever used. I am so pleased. All of the brushes are nice! I also really needed a nice angle brush for my eyebrows. Comes in a nice lil carrying bag. Great for the price too! Don&#x27;t let the price fool you, these are very nice &amp; made well. Def a good purchase!</li>
            <li> love the little bag, great for travelling! nice quality too. My only complaint is that the bristles of the eye shadow brush are a little too hard and hurt my eye.</li>
            <li> The first set held up for 5 years of almost daily use. Very soft bristles, very easy to get an even application of pigment/powders with these brushes.</li>
