            <li>now they are offering a FREE 1lb bag with every 1lb bag purchased...</li>

            <li>well packaged, I have learned that the American (Californian) grown kernels are the most potent and this is where these come from</li>

            <li>Bought this because it contain large amount B 17</li>
            <li>/&gt;They taste very fresh, easy to chew and leave a little aftertaste in your mouth but not overbearing.</li>

            <li> so bitter though...</li>
            <li> I am a returning customer and buy these bitter apricot kernels when I travel to America.</li>
            <li> just ate one and as advertised are bitter however</li>
            <li> My conclusion - they were not fit for regular sale.</li>
            <li> But...I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the taste because they are quite bitter.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the most disgusting things I&#x27;ve ever tasted.</li>
            <li> I am Not sure this is the only way to cure cancer because I used baking soda and food grade hydrogen peroxide in my dads food in water</li>
            <li> I need to find a way to get around the bitter taste!</li>
            <li> I just could not eat them because they were very bitter</li>
            <li> Expected fully dried kernels but they were still slightly moist inside.</li>
            <li> However , I was disappointed with the 1/2 bag free.</li>
            <li> Tasty little kernels.</li>
            <li> And that is a deadly misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> I am left with a poor taste</li>
            <li> but unfortunately could not use in their current state.</li>
            <li> and so I crack the pits for the kernels but the tree is small and I don&#x27;t get a year supply yet.</li>
            <li> doctor if on medication before using not good with all chemo</li>
            <li> They taste like crap</li>
            <li> I dont know how in the world anyone eats this crap.</li>
            <li> I hate to think what this was.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> so bitter though... oh yeah!!</li>
            <li> They taste like crap but they work wonders! I will take these for the rest of my life. Grind them up and put them in juice and you cant even taste them.</li>
            <li> I am a returning customer and buy these bitter apricot kernels when I travel to America. I found these folks many months ago and have been buying from them ever since.  Friendly staff at the end of the phone, prompt, trouble free shipping, well packaged, I have learned that the American (Californian) grown kernels are the most potent and this is where these come from, how could it get any better I thought...? now they are offering a FREE 1lb bag with every 1lb bag purchased... OK, they wont see me back for some time now as I have stocked up and their advice about keeping the kernels in the fridge just helps me save even more money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU Buy Apricot Seeds !</li>
            <li> The apricot seeds I purchased from this company were the freshest I have found.  They were delivered swiftly; and  no one offered the value price this company offers.  I highly recommend this company for your apricot seeds.  I encourage everyone to read Ernst Krebs studies on B-17.  Also research the Hunza people in the Himalayas.  God Bless You.</li>
            <li> Package came a day early from their scheduled early ship date range. Was pleased with that.&lt;br /&gt;I just ate one and as advertised are bitter however edible.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions state to take one per hour, however if side affects occur you may be taking too many at first and to let your body gradually adjust to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They taste very fresh, easy to chew and leave a little aftertaste in your mouth but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the most disgusting things I&#x27;ve ever tasted. YUCK!! I dont know how in the world anyone eats this crap. Barf!!</li>
            <li> Great source of vitamin. Tasty little kernels.</li>
            <li> Expected fully dried kernels but they were still slightly moist inside. I wanted kernels that would crush to powder which was not possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kernels would have been fine otherwise but unfortunately could not use in their current state.</li>
            <li> Good product, good service, friendly lady.  If that was all there was to the story, I would give 4 or 5 stars.  The problem is that this company also sells a product that is promoted as being 500mg of Amygdalin, when in fact, it is only &#x27;refined apricot seed powder&#x27;.  And that is a deadly misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> I personaly did not like the flavor no matter how I eat them. the price was right and delivery quick. I just could not eat them because they were very bitter</li>
            <li> Bought this because it contain large amount B 17&lt;br /&gt;This was to help with cancer&lt;br /&gt;Receiving Chemo thought extra help want hurt&lt;br /&gt;I take no more than 12  seeds every day to much isnot good&lt;br /&gt;See doctor if on medication before using not good with all chemo</li>
            <li> great product.  great quality.  the reason for four stars instead of five is that it took over a week for them to arrive.</li>
            <li> The seeds of themselves are good and this was my third purchase. However , I was disappointed with the 1/2 bag free. The two 1/2 bags I got were apparently bitten by something. I hate to think what this was. I deduce then that this was the reason for the 1/2 bags free. My conclusion - they were not fit for regular sale. I would have bought the seeds without the inducement of the additional amounts as I have done before. I expect that the \\&quot;gift\\&quot; would be of equal quality and should not be given if it was not of that standard, packaging and otherwise. I am left with a poor taste</li>
            <li> But...I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the taste because they are quite bitter. Bought them in tablets instead. Process went fine thanks !</li>
            <li> Two year ago I was diagnosed with stage3 breast cancer.  the oncologist said I have to take chemo.  I took one and had to be hospitalized because I could not stop vomiting.  I said \\&quot;no more!\\&quot;  I read about apricot pits on line and decided it made sense to me.  A poison  strong enough to kill cancer cells but not strong enough to kill healthy cells. AI have been using them ever since and feel great!! Amazon had the best price.</li>
            <li> this stuff is exactly what it is supposed to be if you take too much you will get a buzz and get light headed but it does work my daddy is cancer I am Not sure this is the only way to cure cancer because I used baking soda and food grade hydrogen peroxide in my dads food in water so... I do suggest this highly</li>
            <li> I have been eating for years, helps keep PSA down - use only as a food supplement.</li>
            <li> Apricot Kernels (Seeds) 1lb Bag&lt;br /&gt; Much controversy surrounds laetrile - B-17 within&lt;br /&gt;apricot seeds/kernals.  I purchased these for an&lt;br /&gt;additional weapon against the lymp node cancer I was&lt;br /&gt;diagnosed with along with ph therapy and 35% food grade&lt;br /&gt;hydrogen peroxide therapy as opposed to radiation and chemotherapy&lt;br /&gt;which has well known side effects as opposed to PH and H2O2 therapies.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be of good quality.  Tastes as it should.  The bitterness takes an acquired taste, but after a while, it tastes really good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend starting with 5 kernels at once but I&#x27;ve gotten to where I take that once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have cancer as far as I know and so this is sort of a preventative but since I started taking c60 I don&#x27;t suppose I really need any other preventative. I do grow apricots and so I crack the pits for the kernels but the tree is small and I don&#x27;t get a year supply yet.</li>
            <li> I need to find a way to get around the bitter taste! It&#x27;s too early to know the benefits of taking them.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of ordering from another vendor trying to pass off freeze-dried seeds as \\&quot;raw\\&quot;.  Ahhh, these are the real deal.  Bitter and potent - make me gag like a good apricot seed should.  Fast shipping and decent price too.&lt;br /&gt;I think if the origin is listed as Uzbekistan, you should be cautious.  It may be that they need to dry those seeds to preserve them for wide distribution.  These are from California, and they are fresh and raw.</li>
            <li> These were a good quality product. They are definitely the bitter ones but I put them in peanut butter and it was good. Great cure for cancer as far as my research can tell!</li>
