            <li>Great product...only one that ever worked for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the hair oil.</li>
            <li>Just put it on your hands and spread througout your hair and it works great on  curly and frizzy hair leaving it frizz-free and shiny.</li>
            <li>Great traits considering I&#x27;m up over 7,300 feet in the driest mountain atmosphere I have ever lived in.  </li>
            <li>That called for drastic measures to keep my thinning hair looking good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not Moroccan Oil brand and lacks that intoxicating scent, but this is a good cost effective substitute.</li>
            <li>also the oil smells really nice.</li>
            <li>; for social occassions, and a goodly stock of black hair color, but for every day &amp;#34;grocery shopping&amp;#34; my hair is now looking the best it ever has with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It works and smells light and nice.</li>
            <li>It controls most of the frizz I have.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>:) Hope this helps</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this oil.</li>
            <li>Such a very great product.  </li>
            <li>I love how it smells.</li>
            <li>Sure I have some &amp;#34;add-ins&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clip-ons&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Back to the product I really love the smell I think this is a really great product for Nexxus.</li>
            <li>This oil is ok but nothing special</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Nice to get it for such a great low price.</li>
            <li>so this is the best other solution so far.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brand, so far it is the best one.</li>
            <li>This has worked better than any product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>so I find myself purchasing more frequently.</li>
            <li>Great for normal or dry hair.</li>
            <li>When dry, my hair is the most silky, thick, manageable, luxurious feeling, glossy and best conditioned it has ever been.</li>
            <li>course, and curly hair soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Perfect for African American hair which has a tendency to be dry.  </li>
            <li>Product works better if you use it after you blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li>They certainly missed the mark on this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product that does not leave my hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really see a difference I have curly frizzy hair</li>
            <li>But lets be real, you are charging $2.99 per bottle</li>
            <li>(Gently, of course).</li>
            <li>it smells good and makes my thick,</li>
            <li>and I have so happy that it was less than half what I paid for in CVS.</li>
            <li>Smooths out my fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>This product is a must have, especially when the weather is really hot.  </li>
            <li>I first use Nexus Straightning Lotion on wet hair, then dry, then smooth some of this on.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair feeling oily at all, just soft.</li>
            <li>This was too gummy and sticky and I did not like the results for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>while this product did work ok, there are other products on the market for a larger size and 1/2 the price that work as well such as Garnier....</li>
            <li>My hair is color-treated and relaxed and really dry but this oil helps so much.</li>
            <li>The bottle can last pretty long if you have short hair.</li>
            <li>and when I use this product it&#x27;s pretty much the same after not sure if the product I received was counterfeit and</li>
            <li>No matter what I do, I cannot get complete control of the frizz unless it is flat ironed (by my hair dresser).</li>
            <li>Other people might not have to use as much</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed for my little one.</li>
            <li>It was delivered fast and the price is right, especially compared to the more expensive brand, which is also very hard to find in my area.</li>

            <li> When I blow dry my hair myself with this styling oil it is truly less frizzy and my hair is quite soft.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half african american and of course my hair is veryyy curly.</li>
            <li> I cannot seem to find it but every other product in the line is present</li>
            <li> Never looks like there&#x27;s product in my hair after I dry it.</li>
            <li> but my hair is incredibly dry and this product does wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I hate coconuts to eat but for topical products it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen night-and-day results, but when I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry that I use this every single day.</li>
            <li> My formerliy dry, brittle hair is no longer breaking when I brush it!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend frizz defy to anyone who has trouble with frizz in the humidity</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t saying much as most of the range is very ordinary.</li>
            <li> Product definitely meets the expectations, and you just have to use very little of it which will save you money.</li>
            <li> I have every other product from this line</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and without it my hair is dry and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> it does keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> This oil facilitates the comb of the slightly curled hair.</li>
            <li> The oil does feel light in my hair which i typically hate with other oils</li>
            <li> I still saved a few dollars then purchasing from a retail store.</li>
            <li> I had to order because it&#x27;s not available.</li>
            <li> So, I DON&#x27;T comb or brush it after massaging it in to my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> Usually with other products my hair feels crunchy or hard but not with this</li>
            <li> This serum is a little sticky, slippery and gooey and makes my hair feel somewhat stiff and hard to comb after putting it on.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it is being discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been frustrated with my wavy, frizzy hair for a long time and have tried other oils and products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in the brick and mortar stores and online, so I am grateful for Amazon!</li>
            <li> maybe ill see a difference</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive but remeber \\&quot;you are geeting what you are paying for\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been frustrated with my wavy, frizzy hair for a long time and have tried other oils and products. I first use Nexus Straightning Lotion on wet hair, then dry, then smooth some of this on. This has worked better than any product I&#x27;ve used so far. It does not leave my hair feeling oily at all, just soft. No matter what I do, I cannot get complete control of the frizz unless it is flat ironed (by my hair dresser). I&#x27;m too uncoordinated to use the flat iron so this is the best other solution so far. I also use Nexus Frizz Defy Conditioner after shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smooths out my fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect and I thank you for very good srvice I recieved from you .</li>
            <li> Great product.. Not sure why it is being discontinued.  This product is the best for any type of hair.  Wonderful</li>
            <li> Great for normal or dry hair. Never leaves hair oily. Never looks like there&#x27;s product in my hair after I dry it.</li>
            <li> It works and smells light and nice. The bottle can last pretty long if you have short hair. It controls most of the frizz I have. I have tried other brand, so far it is the best one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really see a difference I have curly frizzy hair and when I use this product it&#x27;s pretty much the same after not sure if the product I received was counterfeit and maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work I might try buying it in stores maybe ill see a difference</li>
            <li> I love the product. I still saved a few dollars then purchasing from a retail store. But lets be real, you are charging $2.99 per bottle and I got 4. The total was $11.96. The SHIPPING AND HANDLING WAS $19.96. What a scam. Why don&#x27;t you just charge $7 per bottle and then add the shipping and handling? This is the last time I order from these scam artist.</li>
            <li> This was too gummy and sticky and I did not like the results for my natural hair.  Will not be purchasing this anymore. They certainly missed the mark on this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have, especially when the weather is really hot.  I just put a dime size amount in my hair and it is just enough.  It may seem expensive but remeber \\&quot;you are geeting what you are paying for\\&quot;! :) Hope this helps, I will be getting this again!</li>
            <li> Of all the Nexus products I&#x27;ve tried, this is one of the best. Unfortunately, this isn&#x27;t saying much as most of the range is very ordinary. This oil is ok but nothing special and I won&#x27;t bother buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...it smells good and makes my thick, course, and curly hair soft and frizz free. It&#x27;s too bad that [I think] they are discontinuing it. It&#x27;s very hard to find in the brick and mortar stores and online, so I am grateful for Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product is the best.  I use it everyday and without it my hair is dry and unmanageable.  I would suggest this product to anyone.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil. It makes my hair so smooth and silky. I will continue to use this product on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This oil facilitates the comb of the slightly curled hair. It is exactly what I needed for my little one.</li>
            <li> Such a very great product.  Have used it for a long time.  Nice to get it for such a great low price.</li>
            <li> Great product...only one that ever worked for me. I would definitely recommend frizz defy to anyone who has trouble with frizz in the humidity</li>
            <li> The oil does feel light in my hair which i typically hate with other oils also the oil smells really nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not Moroccan Oil brand and lacks that intoxicating scent, but this is a good cost effective substitute. I&#x27;m happy with the hair oil. It was delivered fast and the price is right, especially compared to the more expensive brand, which is also very hard to find in my area.</li>
            <li> Product definitely meets the expectations, and you just have to use very little of it which will save you money. Just put it on your hands and spread througout your hair and it works great on  curly and frizzy hair leaving it frizz-free and shiny. Product works better if you use it after you blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for African American hair which has a tendency to be dry.  I had to order because it&#x27;s not available.</li>
            <li> while this product did work ok, there are other products on the market for a larger size and 1/2 the price that work as well such as Garnier....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half african american and of course my hair is veryyy curly. I&#x27;ve always had issues with my hair being frizzy but using this with some leave-in conditioner after the shower has been my saving grace for my hair!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product about two years ago and continue to religiously use it as a daily frizz control product. However, my daughter has discovered how awesome this product is so I find myself purchasing more frequently. Overall, a great product that does not leave my hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I have every other product from this line and I bought them in a CVS and one time I saw the oil and I bought it but now everytime I go to any drugstore I cannot seem to find it but every other product in the line is present so I went to Amazon to see if they had it and I found it and I have so happy that it was less than half what I paid for in CVS. I had to buy five of them at once because I had to have this and I don&#x27;t know when I can physically buy this again because I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere except online and I wanted to get it at that price just in case prices went up. Back to the product I really love the smell I think this is a really great product for Nexxus. My hair is color-treated and relaxed and really dry but this oil helps so much. My hair is so dry that I use this every single day. Other people might not have to use as much but my hair is incredibly dry and this product does wonders for me. When I blow dry my hair myself with this styling oil it is truly less frizzy and my hair is quite soft. Usually with other products my hair feels crunchy or hard but not with this so I keep this in my haircare regimen and when I go to salons I ask them to use this as well. I love how it smells. I hate coconuts to eat but for topical products it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I was worried that this product would leave my hair oily, but it doesn&#x27;t. I use it after washing my hair, and brush or comb it in after applying. I haven&#x27;t seen night-and-day results, but when I let my hair air dry it does keep the frizz down. If I&#x27;m going for a wavy look, I&#x27;ll use both this product and something else that will help the waves hold as the hair dries.</li>
            <li> This serum is a little sticky, slippery and gooey and makes my hair feel somewhat stiff and hard to comb after putting it on. So, I DON&#x27;T comb or brush it after massaging it in to my towel dried hair. I just clip my hair up until it dries. When dry, my hair is the most silky, thick, manageable, luxurious feeling, glossy and best conditioned it has ever been. Great traits considering I&#x27;m up over 7,300 feet in the driest mountain atmosphere I have ever lived in.  The best news??? My formerliy dry, brittle hair is no longer breaking when I brush it! (Gently, of course). I am over 50, (-ish) with longer than shoulder length hair, and I refuse to go to that short, frizzy  &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; hair. That called for drastic measures to keep my thinning hair looking good. Sure I have some &amp;#34;add-ins&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clip-ons&amp;#34; for social occassions, and a goodly stock of black hair color, but for every day &amp;#34;grocery shopping&amp;#34; my hair is now looking the best it ever has with this wonderful product.</li>
