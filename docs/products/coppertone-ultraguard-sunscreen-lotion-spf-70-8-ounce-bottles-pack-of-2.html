            <li>and it does an excellent job of protecting your skin.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, and good protection.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re good about putting this stuff on every 2 hours</li>
            <li>He said it is very important to always use a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>everything was ok, quality and price good.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very fair and gets over heated and sun burnt fast.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably have better luck without any sunscreen than relying on this</li>
            <li>We love this product becuase</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT, this is better.  </li>
            <li>More quantity than the supposedly \\&quot;100+\\&quot;..</li>
            <li>However, since 2 years ago, I am using this, that will give me more protection.</li>
            <li>and she not only had a great time she did not complain about having to put more sun block on.    </li>
            <li>and this got me through a sunburn free vacation to Kauai.</li>
            <li>Excellent for white and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Light lotion, easy to apply and spread, not greasy , absorbs very fast without the sticky sensation.</li>
            <li>it is non greasy and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>So as long as u liberally apply lots of sunscreen with reasonable SPF u are good...     </li>
            <li>Pretty well priced.</li>
            <li>I bought this sunscreen after carefully reviewing many sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li>Product only available in USA, in EU Coppertone don&#x27;t sell lotions over 50+.</li>
            <li>Not a thin greasy/slick layer that feels like it comes off as soon as you hit</li>
            <li>After ignoring the advice to use SunBlock for many years and suffering scaly skin after 2-3 long bike rides in sunny California, I finally caved in after trying this Sunblock from a fellow cyclist.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all, fast absorption and strong long lasting protection:</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice, thick, coated (protected!)</li>
            <li>Burns my eyes just a tad, but not nearly as bad as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I believe this sunscreen is old and expired as it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>-&lt;br /&gt;- Will likely stain most clothing (it left un-removable yellow stains on my white rash</li>
            <li>Well this stuff is like super water proof, and last a long time.     </li>
            <li>waterproof seem to last a little longer, application was easy and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pale, and burn easily.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter how many times I applied this, or how thickly, I got burnt within 15-30 minutes of being outside with this stuff on.  </li>
            <li>I chose this one for it&#x27;s SPF and broad spectrum coverage.</li>
            <li>This was brought home to me in no certain way when the deep tan lines I had on my arms and legs more or less disappeared within weeks.</li>

            <li> All my previous objections to various brands of Sunblock seem to have been addressed with this.</li>
            <li> I usually use an SPF 30 that allows a little sun but not enough to burn when used regularly.  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on her entire body before she gets dressed, then I reapply as needed after swimming or a lot of sweating.  </li>

            <li> I played tennis after applying this and the sweat burns the eye a little bit....</li>

            <li> I bought this sunscreen after carefully reviewing many sunscreens on the market. I chose this one for it&#x27;s SPF and broad spectrum coverage. I believe this sunscreen is old and expired as it didn&#x27;t work at all. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought Coppertone Ultraguard Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 70+, 8-Ounce Bottle from a local store. I was in a hurry since we were heading out for a day with the kids.  My daughter is very fair and gets over heated and sun burnt fast.     In the past I have used the Copper tone Water babies on her, but this blows that out of the water. I applied this to her prior to going in the sun. I usually put it on her entire body before she gets dressed, then I reapply as needed after swimming or a lot of sweating.  Well this stuff is like super water proof, and last a long time.     We were at the amusement park (in the water rides and wave pools) all day and she not only had a great time she did not complain about having to put more sun block on.    My entire family used it so I have bought it from Amazon.com in the 2 pack for our trip to Florida. I expect it to work just as well. Will update when we return.</li>
            <li> We love this product becuase it is non greasy and great for everyday use. Very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product after removing a growth from my nose that was pre-cancerous.  He said it is very important to always use a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I ordered several bottles before a pre-wedding trip to San Carlos, Mexico.  I&#x27;m very pale, and burn easily.  My fiancee&#x27;s biggest worry is that I&#x27;d end up looking like a tomato for our wedding pictures after being burned in the brutal Mexican sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use coppertone sport because the waterproofness of it is decent.  I usually use an SPF 30 that allows a little sun but not enough to burn when used regularly.  If used correctly, coppertone Sport does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, this is better.  waterproof seem to last a little longer, application was easy and not greasy.  It protected me for a week in the sun and trust the quality and performance of this product.</li>
            <li> Product only available in USA, in EU Coppertone don&#x27;t sell lotions over 50+. Not greasy at all, fast absorption and strong long lasting protection: no red skin!</li>
            <li> Not greasy, and good protection.  Come form Aus so I know my sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Pretty well priced. More quantity than the supposedly \\&quot;100+\\&quot;.. THe ratings are marketing lingo... So as long as u liberally apply lots of sunscreen with reasonable SPF u are good...     One con - not sure if its the same with other sunscreens... I played tennis after applying this and the sweat burns the eye a little bit....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Irish descent living in San Diego, and I will have a sunburn after only 30 minutes unprotected in the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros -&lt;br /&gt;- IT WORKS!!!  Only if you specifically FOLLOW DIRECTIONS on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;- It leaves a nice, thick, coated (protected!) feeling on your skin.  Not a thin greasy/slick layer that feels like it comes off as soon as you hit the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons -&lt;br /&gt;- Will likely stain most clothing (it left un-removable yellow stains on my white rash guard)&lt;br /&gt;- Burns my eyes just a tad, but not nearly as bad as other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> everything was ok, quality and price good.</li>
            <li> Spent a month in Key West and came home almost as pale as when I left, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re good about putting this stuff on every 2 hours or so you will be fine.&lt;br /&gt;I am as white as they come and this got me through a sunburn free vacation to Kauai.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, along with the same product in SPF 50 and it destroyed my white fabric turning it brown.  Three completely different fabrics.  I will never use this product again.  Cost me $500 in ruined clothing.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended me some years ago to use every day, when I am exposed to the sun, a sunscreen lotion for my face and parts of may body that will be exposed to thw sun. I decided to use a Coppertone product that was not greasy, that had a protection of 45. However, since 2 years ago, I am using this, that will give me more protection.</li>
            <li> Light lotion, easy to apply and spread, not greasy , absorbs very fast without the sticky sensation. Excellent for white and sensitive skin.</li>
