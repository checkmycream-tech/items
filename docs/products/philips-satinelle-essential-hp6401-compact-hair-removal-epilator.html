            <li>This is a great feature.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now, and I am still happy with it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with those results as well.</li>
            <li>Works great on face.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I am really happy with the Satinelle and I am buying another one to have as a backup.</li>
            <li>This product works great</li>
            <li>Philips is a great brand.</li>
            <li>it is great product</li>
            <li>wax.&lt;br /&gt;I find it works great.  </li>
            <li>She says it works great</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>GREAT customer service on that part.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that washing with a cleanser with Salicylic acid and a loofa greatly reduces this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I still use it when I feel brave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product, use it monthly for underarm, arms, and legs.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way this one worked just because it took forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits just great in my hand.</li>
            <li>This epilator is just great.</li>
            <li>no where in the packing its mentioned as rechargeable, seeing the plug and wire we thought its a rechargeable one, nevertheless seems my wife is happy..</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>for the results, I am happy.  </li>
            <li>However, everywhere else has been great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Purchased this epilator because of the great reviews.</li>

            <li>#1:  OMG, lol, I felt as if I&#x27;d been electrocuted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>

            <li>I read the tips posted in all of these great reviews.  </li>
            <li>happy with the purchase and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>but yet it does a great job removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>My sister bought an epilator that worked great; it made me want to buy one of my own.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators for over 10 years and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>Its great for touch ups between waxes.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>on to the Epilator....I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
            <li>This is fabulous !!!</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very effective.  </li>
            <li>but when i do it is very nice</li>
            <li>I found it very effective with even shorter hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective.  </li>
            <li>The Philips &amp;#34;Satinelle&amp;#34; epilator, (model HP6401) is very deserving of praise.</li>
            <li>: It is very effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both speeds successfully.  </li>
            <li>This is the awesome product that i had purchase and this product is better than shaver...</li>
            <li>Wonderful I love it..</li>
            <li>I would rather prefer something witout cord or rechargable and maybe not that noisy :-p</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; was not horrific :D  </li>
            <li>:) I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>I love it, and it works perfect for me.</li>
            <li>All in all, my warm recommendation!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s not the best at removing hair like the Braun SE 5180 Silk Epil</li>
            <li>I have been using it since 1 or more years ago and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>:P</li>
            <li>She was thrilled when it arrived!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and would greatly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very happy. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m LOVING IT!</li>
            <li>I love it, best buy yet!</li>
            <li>Yes, is still nice product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, good price for a great value!&lt;br /&gt;Phillips is the best!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work, does NOT feel pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and happy with the results of the product.</li>
            <li>It is very good, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>than that great product for sure!</li>
            <li>Great thing :)  use it after taking a bath!</li>
            <li>a good buy</li>
            <li>I should probably buy a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li>Loved it until it died.  </li>
            <li>product would have been more ideal if it came with some instructions or tips which guide you through what to do before and after epilation.</li>
            <li>And she loved it.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be good as per the price..</li>
            <li>it is good but it is noisy.</li>
            <li>I have been plucking them for years, and loved the idea of something automatic to save me time.  </li>
            <li>Good one ...</li>
            <li>I wanted a starter epilator and this was a good choice.</li>
            <li>But although it is cheaper, the quality is really good.</li>
            <li>It was good  </li>
            <li>Follow the direction and it will do a good job for you.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>This could have done her a world of good.  </li>
            <li>Good price do what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li>For the redness like bumps on the skin after epilation, use some good creams and the redness will go away.</li>
            <li>think this device is really good for the money.</li>
            <li>I read some good reviews about it,so i bought.</li>
            <li>I cannot get a good finish.</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job, but maybe epilators are not for me.</li>
            <li>still, i do like to have it if I can get over the pain it does a good job.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but it still hurts like hell.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly they accepted it even though it was used..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning which is a good length, but experiment from time to time.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m not feeling that it&#x27;s a good substitute for shaving.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>i used it over a month its good</li>
            <li>GOod</li>
            <li>The power cord has a good size so it allows me to use it in the bath tub.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to deal with batteries (the cord is a good length as well)&lt;br</li>
            <li>And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li>good quality for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price - a lot cheaper than others.  </li>
            <li>It is a good alternative to women who cares about the beauty</li>
            <li>Good item for the price</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product for the money.</li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>Good product and</li>
            <li>so that was good for when I moved.</li>
            <li>And good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t grow immediately like it may after shaving...</li>
            <li>All in all a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product, I used to have a broun brand</li>
            <li>I have used this product before, It had been good.</li>
            <li>It has a good grip as well.</li>
            <li>this one had good reviews and was cheaper too.</li>
            <li>This product is good and delivered on time</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t work as good as this one.</li>
            <li>and I have started to get a lot of ingrown hair which isn&#x27;t good looking with the bumps.</li>
            <li>Works really good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this was a good purchase</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good bye to razor blades and</li>
            <li>Have been using for about 7 months it has worked good but</li>
            <li>This is good on the leg</li>
            <li>It was good at the beginning</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, this is the cheapest epilator I&#x27;ve seen with good reviews</li>
            <li>Received my purchase in really good time, and in good order.  </li>
            <li>Its good.</li>
            <li>and it works good.</li>
            <li>If you have the time to remove hair with this, then this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>In a nutshell, loved the results, loathed the process.</li>
            <li>Fairly good for arms, legs and underarms (it is recommended that you use an antiseptic lotion on your underarms every 2 hours for a day after using this product).</li>
            <li>its a good product to use.</li>
            <li>It turned good.</li>
            <li>Good looking with those flowers.</li>
            <li>I had to drop a star off of the review because it does not get the hair on my knees good</li>
            <li>Pain wise</li>
            <li>So I used waxes and shaving powder for hair removal both of which were fairly ineffective.</li>
            <li>good machine but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>It did a good job of grabbing the hairs, and I didn&#x27;t notice any breaking off.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good to have around.</li>
            <li>I have had another Philips epilators and I loved them.</li>
            <li>This one is good too.</li>
            <li>The hair was gone for a good month before I had to epilate again.</li>
            <li>From shaving to hair removal lotions to waxing, I&#x27;ve tried a fair amount of alternatives.</li>
            <li>wise...</li>
            <li>One thing that you should do with any epilator is to invest in a good exfoliating sponge/brush.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would</li>
            <li>and it had good reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it does a good job keeping those straglers at bay.</li>
            <li>The product is really good.</li>
            <li>You can have a good waxing with sort time.</li>
            <li>gives good hair removal.</li>
            <li>The price was really good</li>
            <li>Loved this product for the month it worked.</li>
            <li>Does a good job removing hairs, even those stubborn ones.  </li>
            <li>This is a good epilator.</li>
            <li>Really good this one.</li>
            <li>Good for what it does.</li>
            <li>If it lasts I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>my legs are fairly hairless.  </li>
            <li>Does a really good job of removing unwanted hair from your body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Over all good looking compact product , however I end up giving them 4 pts as they forgot to send me a cleaning brush which is mentioned as a part of product.</li>
            <li>I think some people did a good job explaining why this product hurts and why it may not.</li>
            <li>The price is good.</li>
            <li>I feel like this would be good to use maybe in between waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li>For the price it was good though.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already had one before and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>This is a good epliator.  </li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Its good</li>
            <li>you buy one, good luck.  </li>
            <li>This is a good, affordable starter modelthough that can help you test the waters and see if epilation works for you.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Good luck and hope you achieve your hairless goals.</li>
            <li>I can use it for almost every part of my body and get good results.</li>
            <li>Best product I have ever used, worth your money!</li>
            <li>Fits very easily in the hand and works great at what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li>This one is streamlined, works great and  is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>and honestly, once you put a wax strip on, you kind of don&#x27;t have a choice but to rip it off lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after a couple uses, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll perfect the usage of this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m super impressed with this epilator.</li>
            <li>Luckily it worked great!</li>
            <li>My leg hairs are somewhat fine, and they were about the ideal 3-4 mm length.</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>With all the \\&quot;painful\\&quot; claims, I decided to still give it a try and am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Waxing is a much better option for me!</li>
            <li>But after that you will love it!</li>
            <li>I totally love this product!</li>
            <li>Did not work well, had to go over areas way too many times and still did not remove any hair!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ignored them and bought it anyways!</li>
            <li>But this time I did more research!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>If you get ingrown hairs after, it&#x27;s okay!</li>
            <li>ok, it still works!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Okay so, I have ZERO tolerance for pain!</li>
            <li>I love the results!</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I was really impressed because it seemed like it had plucked every hair.</li>
            <li>Thought it would work better than this, it doesn&#x27;t even pull the hairs out!</li>
            <li>I seriously love it!</li>
            <li>Much better than shaving!</li>
            <li>so im satisfied!</li>
            <li>But trust me, it gets better!</li>
            <li>Spend the money and get a better one!</li>
            <li>I am glad i ordered it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll tell you FOR SURE!  </li>
            <li>If you are trying the epilator for the first time, it is best to try it over the winter season when shaving your legs isn’t a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed an upgrade and love this!</li>
            <li>First of all, I think this product is awesome in theory.</li>
            <li>and I still could not get most of the hairs in one setting!</li>
            <li>IT took awhile and have to read many reviews!</li>
            <li>My advice is if you&#x27;re looking to buy an epilator for the first time, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li>okay I get it, but damn!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what sort of disaster I was going to have on my hands, but this unit took care of it with no problem!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>so it was even better!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>I love this epilator!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you exfoliate a lot!</li>
            <li>I have even brought most of my family to the hairless side mua hahah!  </li>
            <li>I love Philips!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I have now completed both legs and love that I haven&#x27;t had to shave in over 5 days!  </li>
            <li>Still smooth!!</li>
            <li>This is better!</li>
            <li>I prefer to be able to sit and get a close up look at my legs when I shave them!</li>
            <li>I prefer to be able to sit and get a close up look at my legs when I shave them!</li>
            <li>Maybe others have had better luck but not this gal!</li>
            <li>Love this thing!</li>
            <li>takes more time to hair grow compared to shaving legs!</li>
            <li>Better than the rechargable type because this one doesn&#x27;t stop working!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty impressed!!</li>
            <li>I love this machine!</li>
            <li>I have never been this satisfied with results in a beauty product before!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even aware they made corded ones :D  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and does not hurt at all..just a pinch which is normal!!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie, it&#x27;s not the most pleasant thing in the world to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, and great outcomes.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, does a great job of removing hair on legs.</li>
            <li>(read my wife) am pretty satisfied with the purchase - good for beginners and great value for money!</li>
            <li>Good machine and easy to use with good results</li>
            <li>(remember to exfoliate first!!!!)</li>
            <li>Its great on fine, fuzzy hair but not thicker coarser hair.</li>
            <li>and bikini.doesn&#x27;t work well for fine hair,which is arm and legs!i&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li>It would be great if it were cordless, but for this price, I&#x27;m totally fine with it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and very handy.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she is comfortable and happy about it.</li>
            <li>cheap and great.</li>
            <li>do believe that the skin irritation would  have persisted, but I found another amazing product called Gly-luronic acid serum (makeup artists choice).</li>
            <li>works amazing for under arm</li>
            <li>my skin has never felt this amazing.</li>
            <li>It works great, as it should, leaving my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing</li>
            <li>They looked AMAZING.</li>
            <li>it works amazing. .</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>is perfect, but I really, it hurts a lot of pain, but the results are excellent, if anyone knows how to avoid pain tell me, I really need</li>
            <li>but it got the job done after a couple run overs and her legs are amazingly smoother than using a razor on them.</li>
            <li>when I don&#x27;t feel like waxing I use it.. and amazing results.</li>
            <li>Great product, it tends to hurt but leaves the skin smooth</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I could feel the hairs being ripped out, and honestly, I started shaking and sweating from the pain.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li>and I was a hairy wookie (on purpose just to make this session effective).</li>
            <li>I had to warm myself up to it</li>
            <li>However, the product itself is just not that effective.  </li>
            <li>it was inexpensive, but with good reviews for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I was kind of bummed, until I unwrapped the cord.</li>
            <li>But effective.</li>
            <li>I find it an effective longterm solution.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before choosing this one and chose it because of the good reviews and the price.</li>
            <li>Have you suffered through your own hymenal rupture, birthed a child or suffered the stinging agony of being rejected by a man?</li>
            <li>They do cause ingrown hairs, so as they say, it is more wise to exfoliate in a warm shower beforehand.</li>
            <li>but honestly I think it&#x27;s just because you have no idea</li>
            <li>and it is SO NICE not to have to pay for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, though not painless.</li>
            <li>Works perfect and doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.</li>
            <li>You kind of have to let you hairs grow out to see if it works.  </li>
            <li>I liked how it looked a day after I epilated.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it to see how effective it is at removing hair and softening regrowth.</li>
            <li>It is not that effective.</li>
            <li>This Phillips is nice for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things that I liked about this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Braun was purchased for about $30 more, so this Philips unit is still a good deal.</li>
            <li>However stuck with it and loving the result</li>
            <li>and I will update this if my thoughts change which I kind of expect them</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t as effective as I would have liked for pulling out shorter hairs</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product, looked and felt good in your hand.</li>
            <li>pay more and get a really good quality one...</li>
            <li>I used this on my arms and actually really really liked the results.</li>
            <li>I really liked this epilator.</li>
            <li>:) LOL he would love that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled about this beauty device and even feel a bit &amp;#34;stupid&amp;#34; for not giving it a try years ago.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of pain everyone else is or isn&#x27;t used to</li>
            <li>Maybe just a defective one, otherwise, it worked nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have that kind of time to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is nice.</li>
            <li>I want to be sure that I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs, which would be another good way to measure the effectiveness of the epilator.</li>
            <li>hairless in just minutes without struggling with warm wax in the summer heat.</li>
            <li>How nice.</li>
            <li>My wife tried and liked it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to everyone who wants an affordable epilator to do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>I used to own a rechargeable Braun Silk-Epil unit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I need to try when my skin is warm after bath.</li>
            <li>M loving it.</li>
            <li>It removes the hairs quite effectively.</li>
            <li>and it really is effective.  </li>
            <li>Nice alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li>I also used this on my face to remove some peach fuzz that gets in the way of smooth makeup application and have been very happy with how smooth my face is now.  </li>
            <li>Handy tip</li>
            <li>Something I remembered from being waxed years ago is your hair has its own growth cycle.</li>
            <li>So if you are using it elsewhere, you do so at your own risk.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product removes hair great in not that much tie.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have to buy another kind again soon</li>
            <li>however, when attempting to use it i found it just did not remove hair effectively.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have good lighting</li>
            <li>the wire kind of restricts movement..</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to pay more than $30 for a good epilator.</li>
            <li>it is a really good purchase for sure.</li>
            <li>Every time you do it, you kind of expect what it feels like at that point</li>
            <li>but keep in mind you can&#x27;t wait until you have a forest growing in your armpits because then it&#x27;ll hurt no matter what kind of epilator you have.</li>
            <li>i kinda liked this.</li>
            <li>The product it self was nice, but damn did that hurt.</li>
            <li>This epilator I purchased to use on my face, it is effective and does what it claims.</li>
            <li>and I am loving it.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with the results I get, whether it be on my legs</li>
            <li>But that is just anecdotal evidence, so you may want to do your own research if you are looking for permanent hair</li>
            <li>The pain honestly feels like a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Honestly.</li>
            <li>They never claimed it was a painless method, just that it was effective.</li>
            <li>I end up epilating against the grain, which is something everyone tells me not to do, but I honestly have no choice.</li>
            <li>she told me to buy my own.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this kind of epilator for 12 years.</li>
            <li>I use it on areas of my body that have had laser hair removal (laser isn&#x27;t 100% effective)</li>
            <li>TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</li>
            <li>Get a loofa or a nice exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li>TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</li>
            <li>Get a loofa or a nice exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li>so maybe I have to figure out my own method.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d honestly rather wax.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a product comes along that is so effective, that it deserves accolades.</li>
            <li>I had good results with it most of the time but there were issues with hairs breaking instead of being removed.</li>
            <li>With that said, it&#x27;s kind of supposed to hurt because it&#x27;s pulling your hair out from the root.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>After doing this, all I can think about aside from my own mind bending pain is how on earth</li>
            <li>I found this is a good product for its price and works fantastic !</li>
            <li>honestly.</li>
            <li>I immediately tried it and it&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li>I thought I got a nice product that would help me pull out my underarm hair in affordable price</li>
            <li>This item was not as effective in hair removal as others I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the two speed settings since the highest speed seems to be the best for me.</li>
            <li>It was kind of humiliating.  </li>
            <li>and I liked it.</li>
            <li>If your use to that I could see it working great very powerful</li>
            <li>If you are used to this type of product, this one is very good, and the fact that you can wash the head is a huge plus to help keep it clean!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s totally worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>and then I won&#x27;t even have to worry about packing a razor!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the purchase in my opinion!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary:  this particular epilator is awesome and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I eventually got my hands on the original Epilator and fell in love!!</li>
            <li>NOT PAINFUL # HAPPY</li>
            <li>This one wasn&#x27;t as good at catching my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Needed a new one and this is thee very best one ive ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to know if anyone else has experienced this, and if over time the legs are actually smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is a good size and easy to use though.</li>
            <li>and of course it shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have enough power and when I look at the tweasers the ends don&#x27;t even line up perfectly like good tweasers</li>
            <li>Good product, easy to use.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s very easy to hold&lt;</li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally in love with this product! :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite glad i&#x27;m not paying for wax at the salon or shaving every day before yoga class! :)</li>
            <li>It was not expensive, but it does everything good!</li>
            <li>* most importantly!!</li>
            <li>Love the price and love how it works!</li>
            <li>i like it because its easy to use and it really works and do all the thing that tell you and its a good a very good price for this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use,the top is washable, and after using it once I&#x27;m happy of the result I use it mostly for my forearms and underarm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for first time users, but you always have to prepare yourself for some pain!</li>
            <li>Great buy for the first timer!</li>
            <li>Great first epilator!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works but there may be more effective (albeit a bit pricier) options.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wish it came with a nice pouch to put everything in, but I&#x27;ll just make one :)</li>
            <li>With a razor, you have a perfect full blanket of stubble in 3 days or so and wonder if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Trust me, the joy you get with seeing all your hair disappear makes the discomfort worth it.</li>
            <li>Satinelle Epilator 20 years ago and have had great success and satisfaction with it.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a nice but cheap epilator go for it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to have a plan of action before happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gorgeous baby smooth skin after applying it.</li>
            <li>The epilator is beautiful, and is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Before you ever shave the hair&#x27;s soft and an epilator would work perfectly for the rest of one&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, love it.</li>
            <li>I choose this one and so far I am very happy about it.</li>
            <li>And probably more effective.</li>
            <li>Works great, worth the price</li>
            <li>Lighter, more efficient, nice that head can be washed with water</li>
            <li>The removable head has been handy in making sure it is cleaned after every use (and therefore I&#x27;ve had no issues with sanity).</li>
            <li>but it is definately worth it and a great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>but it is definately worth it and a great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li>I like this designed and tested even esoty esoty performance and reviewing their functions and so far I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li>Nice but is better to look for the cordless version if you do not have a NEMA outlet in bathroom</li>
            <li>find it most effective for my underarms.</li>
            <li>It´s better than waxing, but in order for it to be effective it needs practice and patience.</li>
            <li>Not to sound spoiled, but you&#x27;d think there would be better options for hair removal by now... :P</li>
            <li>She let me try hers and true to her word, the Braun doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great working product that does a good job, is easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>package received right away, product works great.</li>
            <li>Works great, I just have to hold is at the right angle</li>
            <li>I also used it under my arms and it worked great and putting on deodorant right after</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t even use it on my arms which is very fine hairs.</li>
            <li>In fairness I have very fine hair, so this may be the issue.</li>
            <li>though I have a bit of stubble, they are very, very fine hairs and unless you&#x27;re rubbing my legs, you can&#x27;t even tell!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My leg hair grows very quickly!]</li>
            <li>My leg hair grows very quickly!]</li>
            <li>It does hurt in the beginning but after the 2nd time you use it, it gets better! :D</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>Otherwise though, I STRONGLY recommend this!</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time about a month ago &amp; was very happy to see the hairs being pulled right from the root!</li>
            <li>Very good &amp; highly recommended.</li>
            <li>far as the epilator doing a good job removing the hair, it did great.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with it-- some areas need to be gone over a few times - but the results are impressive</li>
            <li>Never going back to razors even the best kind out there.</li>
            <li>, this epilator is easy to clean and is a great size.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping great product</li>
            <li>The product is great and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Great for your first one.</li>
            <li>and it is more suitable for legs.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, and although it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I had hoped, I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>so I was pretty brave.  </li>
            <li>Works great if you can get used to it, i have ;)</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m grateful for Amazon and customer reviews for leading me to a great epilator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunteately, this is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I just taped it and it works fine!</li>
            <li>It results in a very smooth bikini area,</li>
            <li>This item is rather flimsily made, very light.</li>
            <li>My legs are very smooth.</li>
            <li>My legs feel very smooth which never happened with the emjoi.</li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>Very very light weight.</li>
            <li>I bought it again because it works well and very cheap.</li>
            <li>good product, arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Easy to use and quite effective.</li>
            <li>First time using epilator and love it!!</li>
            <li>[At your own risk.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the wonderful world of no bumps, dry hair removal!</li>
            <li>I had this friend in high school you know - beautiful girl - and her prom dress was strapless.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, easy to use, and very effective.</li>
            <li>The picture was 100$ accurate in it&#x27;s depiction!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li>This thing is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>but I think that happens with most epilators.</li>
            <li>I love a smooth face!</li>
            <li>your skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li>/&gt;-No more</li>
            <li>I thought maybe this would be a better alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li>love this epilator and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>It gets most of the hairs under my armpits, but sometimes it leaves some.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quick and the pain decreases over time since you get used to it :)</li>
            <li>I put it on the slowest setting because I find that it works better.</li>
            <li>The more you use it, the more you’re legs are desensitised to the pain, hence the quicker you can use it.</li>
            <li>It’s basically that feeling where someone is pulling out your hair, but many at a time.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>they both love it</li>
            <li>and I surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>then more hair was cutted instead of removed.</li>
            <li>Even better than I excepeted for the price.</li>
            <li>For sure you need to get used to the feeling</li>
            <li>Apply some more oil after you epilate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying another one for my best friend!</li>
            <li>but I wanted something more convenient.</li>
            <li>OK but a wireless one would be better</li>
            <li>I exfoliated beforehand and moisturized afterwards, and my legs are feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Is there a better one out there?  </li>
            <li>I love this device.</li>
            <li>but It was so rewarding</li>
            <li>and I am okay with this</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Would be fitting if it were included in Dante&#x27;s Inferno.</li>
            <li>I bought this one hoping it would be more durable than the Emjoi ones.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this one is well made and it seems to pick up slightly more hair and finer hairs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li>Way better than the $20 epilator I had before.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update, March 12, 2015: I have had the epilator for more than two months now and it is showing signs of wear.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if paying more would get better, but I do know this item</li>
            <li>I have had this epilator for months now and it has paid for itself many times over compared to what I used to pay for waxing.  </li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t even occur to me that this would need to stay plugged in, so many things are cordless nowadays.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I was dealing with reflexive urges to jerk away more than the pain itself.</li>
            <li>Whatever, if I can have awesome-looking legs, I&#x27;m still in love with this</li>
            <li>Much better.</li>
            <li>I like that it has  faster speed, 20 minutes top</li>
            <li>I kept stopping to make sure it was pulling the hairs from the root</li>
            <li>and it was for sure.</li>
            <li>The most I can do with this devil is my underarms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the cheapest, and yet the best of all the epilators I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Package arrived on time and I looked up many YouTube videos and wowsers</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to get every hair</li>
            <li>In fact, this product works better on stouter hair.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother &amp; has a better appearance.</li>
            <li>a college student, so let me just say, I can spend my time doing more productive things.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this one works</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>No stubble, no wax, and its FREE!</li>
            <li>I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, i would recommend to try Epilator with more tweets</li>
            <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>It takes a time or two to get used to this, but it gets better each time you use it.  </li>
            <li>Start at your knees, not your ankles, as the ankle area is more tender.  </li>
            <li>if you are considering about bikini line, you&#x27;d better watch out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are many contradictory reviews about epilators.</li>
            <li>Many reviews said the epilator was like waxing in terms of discomfort.</li>
            <li>more buying disposables or cream&lt;</li>
            <li>It took some maneuvering to get my skin taut, but I figured it out :)</li>
            <li>Love this Epliator...</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t even hurt:)</li>
            <li>This epilator works better</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>more of a tingling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, and people love what is does to my legs and hands.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s been getting better and better with continued use.</li>
            <li>Sure, the hairs were shorter, but I had stubble.</li>
            <li>I love not having to risk getting cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li>And quite pleased about it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve only tryed two type of epilators in my life: this and a Braun one and they work the same).&lt;br /&gt;The best part about epilators</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love using this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my all-time favorite product.  </li>
            <li>This one is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The longer the hair is, the more it hurts too.  </li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>More work you say?</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure because of quantity of hair and coarseness of it.</li>
            <li>but i love philips epilators</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked OK.  </li>
            <li>By OK</li>
            <li>Thank you Philips for making such a great product for an affordable price!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you wash the area</li>
            <li>Make sure you change this out a couple times a day until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Okay, TMI, but</li>
            <li>Which, in my opinion would be okay if I wasn&#x27;t shaving to finish afterwards.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I dealt with that because it says it&#x27;ll take some time to get used to.</li>
            <li>so I plugged it in again for 4 more hrs.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much I love this hair remover.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>glad i bought it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I think sometimes it cuts the hair rather then pull it out, but for the most part it works.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Prefer this much more.  </li>
            <li>Grabs more hairs than the epilady.  </li>
            <li>Works OK...</li>
            <li>And now I can enjoy my hair-free legs!</li>
            <li>I still like it better than shaving</li>
            <li>Much better than my epilady speed</li>
            <li>I finally was on the search for one of these epilators that I&#x27;ve heard great things about and came across this one!</li>
            <li>Really love this product and would recommend to anyone....</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>Ok, I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this for my legs and arms :)</li>
            <li>After 2-3 time you will be ok.</li>
            <li>The pain is manageable but expect more pain in (again)</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for my armpits but it works for my legs too.</li>
            <li>I have heard that this epilator works better with coarser hair so that may be my issue.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect,  as I&#x27;ve never owned/used an epilator.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li>I love this item!&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this item I waxed my armpits.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>If I were a woman, or were to convince my wife to use it, I think she would have better results with this than with waxing.</li>
            <li>hurts like owwwwiiieeeee but works well :)</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several months now and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth for about a week, which is a nice change.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Better than a tweezer.</li>
            <li>I like it :)</li>
            <li>, so I guess it&#x27;s the products one redeeming feature.</li>
            <li>I bought it a year ago and dropped it too many times when using it so it broke</li>
            <li>Hope this helped some of you make a decision :)</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>does it job and better than the 50 dollar one</li>
            <li>THIS IS MAGIC.</li>
            <li>I bought this epilalator with the hopes that I&#x27;s be able use this instead of paying for a wax every six weeks or so.</li>
            <li>otherwise you might have more ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Just be patient when epilating and remember to exfoliate.  :)</li>
            <li>Bought it after reading so many reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Have to go through it many times.</li>
            <li>I love this, I can&#x27;t see up close to tweeze because my glasses with bi focal lenses just don&#x27;t work that way.</li>
            <li>it broke more hair than it pulled out leaving stubble.</li>
            <li>it hurt MORE THAN THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing hurt more than anticipated and then I also had a run with some ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Suppose to get better with more use.</li>
            <li>I will keep it, but might go looking for a better one sometime in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not terribly</li>
            <li>This is way better than waxing.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this many ingrown hairs either.</li>
            <li>It worked okay for a beginner&#x27;s tool I guess.  </li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>Love this epilator.  </li>
            <li>Might work better for someone with more corse hair.</li>
            <li>Also, you do have to go over each section more than once in order to remove all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>I kept it in a drawer safe from any moisture and mis-handling but after plugging it in yesterday it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li>Not everyone has the luxury of being able to take a day off and wait for the UPS to deliver a $30 package when its convenient for them.</li>
            <li>Over time the more you use it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and it worked a lot better than the emjoy.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t leave bumps and removes all (most) of the hair.</li>
            <li>How this works is that it is basically like a bunch of tweezers that rotate and squeeze together at the top to grab your hair and pull it out.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed some more on my legs</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that I can&#x27;t accidentally cut myself with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it lasts longer than shaving, but it comes at a price.</li>
            <li>and I love this.</li>
            <li>If you can capture the hair, it does an amazing job of making legs smooth for longer time.</li>
            <li>I am on a quest to find an epilator that works more efficiently.</li>
            <li>I love my depilator.</li>
            <li>I recommended this to a friend, they bought it, and now they love it as well.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>, I would get an epilator with more speeds or maybe more tweezing blades to make things go faster.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still working on my calf (lower) legs more often - However-- that is because I&#x27;ve shaved my lower legs off &amp; on thru the years.</li>
            <li>It does a better job at getting more hair.</li>
            <li>make sure she never shaves - I so wish I would have never shaved when I was a teenager &amp; had begun with an epilator.</li>
            <li>What I REALLY love are my smooth legs!  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stop touching them :-)  </li>
            <li>the more you do it.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s mostly for women.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>Before that it worked OK.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research prior to my purchase and for the price range, this is considered the best.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had better results with that.  </li>
            <li>And the most affordable reliable epilator for the legs out there.</li>
            <li>Love these device.</li>
            <li>After passing over the area many, many times it still did not remove all the hair.</li>
            <li>Secondly I know nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li>You know the hairs are gone when you don&#x27;t feel pain any more.</li>
            <li>If you just want an epilator, this one is okay.</li>
            <li>should buy one more reliable.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t remove most of the hairs from the root.</li>
            <li>Better designed, the metal tweezers are machined to have closer tolerances resulting in a smother and more efficient (fewer passes) epilation.</li>
            <li>It is painless and the hair becomes more sparse the more you use it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>: The more I have used this epilator, the more my skin is breaking out in a rash.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I tried.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it gets better the more you use it.</li>
            <li>do wish I&#x27;d gotten the more expansive models which are intended for body hair, rather than</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had too many.  </li>
            <li>Wish it too more hair off by the root.</li>
            <li>Love the color and design.  </li>
            <li>I like it :)</li>
            <li>I bought one for my wife and she loves it, because she had one for more than 10 years</li>
            <li>Though it misses some hair I love this.</li>
            <li>Needs two or more swipes sometimes to catch the missed hair.</li>
            <li>even at low speed it did a great job!!</li>
            <li>and I love not having to shave.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the Philips I decided to give it a try, I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>much better than my battery operated emjoi.</li>
            <li>Many times they fester into acne-type lesions.</li>
            <li>Please splurge a bit more for a better epilator.</li>
            <li>but once I&#x27;d gotten them on a bit of a schedule I can go for a week or more without</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this epilator.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>I am a woman in my mid-50s who has never been able to find a descent way to remove hair from my legs.</li>
            <li>gadget came was delivered yesterday and today my legs are free of hair, and I&#x27;m not covered in hair-follicle stubble!</li>
            <li>Great deal, works very well.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I see that where I was able to use it the stubborn hairs are gone and</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I noticed that the epilation is more efficient without this cap.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator</li>
            <li>it is so much better than shaving, and leaves smoother skin.</li>
            <li>but you will get used to it. :)</li>
            <li>It met all of my expectations, better than waxing, better than the</li>
            <li>more than pulled them.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy razor blades or worry about stubble</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and it gets easier, and I Love the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for several months and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li>with this epilator, it took more like 5 or 6 passes.  </li>
            <li>And so amount of scrubbing with release them and they can kind of look like a cyst, but you&#x27;re smooth as a baby.</li>
            <li>Love that it plugs in, so you don&#x27;t need batteries or anything.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Hurts quite a bit but works ok though.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it and will use it.  </li>
            <li>you better stick with a braun</li>
            <li>but philips does a better job faster and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gotten better since.  </li>
            <li>and the more you use it the more you will get use to it.</li>
            <li>This epilator was okay.</li>
            <li>so I returned it and invested in a better one.</li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>I had to go over areas 5,6,7 times before most of it was gone.</li>
            <li>I thought it was more of a permanent hair removal.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for my mom and my daughter and they love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But, in my opinion even the rechargeable ones lose their charging capacity after many uses and require them to be plugged in if you want to use them...</li>
            <li>matter how many times, what pattern and direction I went it</li>
            <li>Save up for a better quality one.</li>
            <li>the more you invest in an epilator, the more pluckers it has</li>
            <li>Many yrs.</li>
            <li>ago I had an Epilady at more than 3 times the price as the Satinelle.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a cheap one just to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li>Eventually I&#x27;d like to try one with more power to it.</li>
            <li>The 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is much better, as what he was seeing was hair under the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to just get waxed or pay for Lazer treatment.</li>
            <li>(They aren&#x27;t magic after all).</li>
            <li>bought this today, and I love it already.</li>
            <li>I did my &amp;#34;test areas,&amp;#34; but I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation to do more on my leg.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>Am wondering about combining more than one epilator.</li>
            <li>The 2nd level works best.</li>
            <li>I am a man and love this thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than others for a better job.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>but overall it did a great job!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your body, it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li>Way better than waxing.</li>
            <li>i love this epilator.</li>
            <li>I found this epilator on amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on something I wasn&#x27;t even sure would work.</li>
            <li>Its ok but can t be used on all the body like it says in internet.</li>
            <li>Great performance, very ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>Ok, do not take off all the hair, use it under arms,</li>
            <li>Works ok</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Its wayy wayyy better than wax.</li>
            <li>My dying Veet epilator did a more thorough job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it never occurred to me that this was still an option, but I&#x27;m really glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>more details, read below:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will probably some day move on to an epilator with more blades (?) and a wider path.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Does what its supposed to do, love it</li>
            <li>It feels more like a &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but is tolerable.</li>
            <li>but OMG I love it after one use.</li>
            <li>Try it and you will love it too.</li>
            <li>the more you use it.  </li>
            <li>This epilator was able to remove the hair, root and all from my legs, bikini line and arm pits.</li>
            <li>but then it gets more tolerable as the hair thins.  </li>
            <li>I simply love this product.</li>
            <li>No need to say more than that...</li>
            <li>but not anymore :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li>product is ok.</li>
            <li>This is excellent, fast and easy to keep is clean.</li>
            <li>It grips the hair better and removes more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Also most battery powered models are not useable once the battery dies.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite hair removal technique</li>
            <li>I am using this machine since more than 10 years</li>
            <li>this is the perfect thing to get him back into shape!</li>
            <li>I am very happy of going back to the basics with this epilator.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that my wife or others who know me would describe me as a wimp, this device produces a lot more pain than discomfort.  </li>
            <li>However, with continued usage you get more used to the pain</li>
            <li>okay so the thing about epilators is that it all depends on YOUR hair type and YOUR skin type&lt;</li>
            <li>and the more it hurts the better its working</li>
            <li>and I just went to town making sure I&#x27;d covered every square inch.</li>
            <li>so glad i purchased this</li>
            <li>I would recommend a corded epilators as I believe they have more power than battery operated ones.</li>
            <li>I could find this epilator much better than that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit OCD. :]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit OCD. :]</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to do many passes at all</li>
            <li>(you don&#x27;t want to do many passes)</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I think that it worked better on areas with courser hair.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, simply love it.</li>
            <li>My Braun epilator was much better...</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheaper if you can do that you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this mostly on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure...</li>
            <li>While it did break some hairs, it works better than home waxing</li>
            <li>Well I love it, I have been using it for just over a month</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my legs and my bikini area, I have tried my chin and my lip</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this and will continue using it.  </li>
            <li>I have used epilators for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>It was okay with legs and arms.</li>
            <li>i really love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t care, glides it across more armpit.</li>
            <li>Ok this one does hurt a lot.</li>
            <li>I even think it&#x27;s better than shaving since I always nick myself with the razor.</li>
            <li>I checked the discs and it doesn&#x27;t break the hair off, it pulls it out by the root, which is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think the more you use it the better and easier</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll be :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I love the product in many ways</li>
            <li>It was ... an interesting experience.  </li>
            <li>Watch the video to get a better idea of how to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>OK, I got this yesterday and used it once.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to all my friends but most cannot endure the pain.</li>
            <li>Only used it ones , but up to now seems great!</li>
            <li>I purchased this stuff for my wife and she loves it more then waxing.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>: 3 Weeks after I tried this, I had tons of ingrown hairs on the lower part of my legs.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>Ok so, I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now</li>
            <li>So much better than waxing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that the more you use it</li>
            <li>some hairs to break off instead of getting plucked, mostly on the legs ironically.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t so sure I would be committing to having my leg hairs ripped out on a long-term</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, now that I do think I will stick with this method of hair removal, I might upgrade to something else to see if it is more efficient.  </li>
            <li>My biggest gripe with this product is that it misses too many hairs.  </li>
            <li>All the clinching probably made my abs better.</li>
            <li>with any hair removal, be sure to exfoliate -</li>
            <li>This one was cheap as well!</li>
            <li>I feel like it never does get all of the hair, but it gets most of it.  </li>
            <li>However, I was determined to make my armpits look better</li>
            <li>I am SO GLAD I did.</li>
            <li>I love mine.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>and my legs are still silky smooth!</li>
            <li>but the more you use it</li>
            <li>and i am sure this will be my go-to product for my under arms.  </li>
            <li>I suggest you may consider buying a one with more blades which will work</li>
            <li>I have been using an epilator for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose Philips Epilator</li>
            <li>Love it, works fast and great.</li>
            <li>but my girls love the results and the feel of their skin afterwards and SWEAR by it.</li>
            <li>Satinelle seems to work better than my Emjoi or Epilady.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>anyone can tell me how to properly epilate without havingn to wake up with prickle legs, that would be great!</li>
            <li>still it&#x27;s ok for the price, it just takes forever to do the job.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have to go over areas more than once.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The results were just okay.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how many razors I go through in the course of a month.  </li>
            <li>When I received the product, I thought it looked kind of cheap and lightweight</li>
            <li>Make sure to exfoliate to avoid ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>It goes without saying that ripping a hair out from the root hurts a lot more than just shaving it.</li>
            <li>You get most of the hair off your legs but it hurt a lot.</li>
            <li>Breaks as many hairs as it pulls out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It works OK.</li>
            <li>I love that I can continually run this with the power cord.</li>
            <li>I tried many times to remove my underarm hair</li>
            <li>It works so much better than a razor because it pulls the root.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you have to build up your endurance for pulling hair out by the roots. :)</li>
            <li>If u can let the leg hair grow over 1/4 of an inch, it would work better on the legs.  </li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t what I thought but was able to return for free!</li>
            <li>but if it has a recharger and can attach and detach the cord that would be a lot better.</li>
            <li>This is the only reason I did not give it five stars--it would be perfect</li>
            <li>Shaving my legs gives me allergies, so I bought this in order to try soemthing different, and I&#x27;m impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I am glad with the price.  </li>
            <li>As a first-time epilator user, it took me awhile to figure out what exact angle and distance works best for my hair type- don&#x27;t give up if you botch the first time; I kept clipping hairs instead of pulling them from the root and thought my device was defective.</li>
            <li>That adjustment period goes for everyone, though I think if you buy a fancier model they might be more intuitive to use.</li>
            <li>Sure did.</li>
            <li>I now mostly use under my arms, once a month</li>
            <li>And got most of the hair!!&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>But it does it&#x27;s job in an ok Manor</li>
            <li>Works great and it is very efficient.</li>
            <li>SE5180 by Braun (the one my sister has) was a much better epilator, and I would recommend that one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Okay, so let&#x27;s get this over with, questions I wanted to know before I bought this was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but yes, the more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll get use to it</li>
            <li>Wait 2-3 days for the hair to grow so the epilator will be able to grab the hairs.</li>
            <li>Your better off with razer rash than this time</li>
            <li>One more shaver turned...</li>
            <li>I was expecting much better marketing</li>
            <li>I love it for my face</li>
            <li>It really hurts during but the outcome is great.  </li>
            <li>I feel so much better showing my face</li>
            <li>as all get out but effective and VERY economical.</li>
            <li>size is just right and its fairly lightweight.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I am new to using an epilator, I am SUPER impressed by this product.</li>
            <li>WAX FIRST!!!</li>
            <li>its really hurt..!!!!</li>
            <li>The product is good, very easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as painful as I thought it would be, very effective and arrived extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Even if I found another good one with a lot more tweezers, I will probably keep this Philips one around because its great for the areas that need something smaller and more precise.    </li>
            <li>Better than the legs, and the legs were pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It did a pretty good job and grabbed most hair.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li>Flimsy, cheap plastic, will break very easily.</li>
            <li>Works great , highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the new tweezers design over the rotating spring, but it works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>The underarm was not bad, honestly.</li>
            <li>Still pretty good though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+the price is pretty good</li>
            <li>Exactly what parts of your body is this good for???</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good device for the money.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job in removing the hair.</li>
            <li>Loved it at first, but over time (3 months) at 3x/monthly usage, it&#x27;s slacking in efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>those who&#x27;ve used an epilator before: if you are willing to be patient, the price is fair.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product for the price offered.</li>
            <li>At first I loved this thing, but then I realized it was breaking the hairs</li>
            <li>Loved it so much, I bought my daughter one!</li>
            <li>For a novice, it would be a good first epilator to purchase.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great little gadget.  </li>
            <li>I never have had this problem with purchases on HSN or QVC.Customer Servive is now telling me that they cannot send me a copy of my original invoice WHICH WAS NEVER INCLIDED IN THE BOX!</li>
            <li>Works great and better than my old Braun shaving device</li>
            <li>Love the shape, easy to hold on to .  </li>
            <li>i loved is so much i bought 2 more for my daughters.</li>
            <li>Great for underarms, it doesn&#x27;t get my leg hair though, probably because its too thin but perfect for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>But each time I used it it was more and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to assemble, use and clean.  </li>
            <li>This has been a great epilator so far!</li>
            <li>clean up !&lt;</li>
            <li>It would take 4 to 5 strokes just to get most of the fine hair, but it wouldn&#x27;t get all of it.</li>
            <li>Most of the time it just breaks the hair on the fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Areas where the hair tends to be more fine are the arms and legs.</li>
            <li>Love it more then the original rotating spring epilady that I used for probably over 15 years before it gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li>So I just bought this, and to be honest when I first turned it on, I was terrified!</li>
            <li>Overall very good.</li>
            <li>This epilator does a very good job of pulling the entire hair out root and all.</li>
            <li>I decided for the price it was a good test into whether I wanted a more high end epilator and would go with it that method of hair removal.  </li>
            <li>So far this product has worked just great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not the most comfortable process in the world, but not unbearable.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t FEEL like completely smooth hair-free skin, but it looks like it for sure.</li>
            <li>Best money spent yet.</li>
            <li>and she is extremely happy about it so far and thankful..</li>
            <li>works great so far I wish I could use it without the cable tho</li>
            <li>Make sure to use after a nice hot shower.</li>
            <li>this product works great, i have had it for over a month, its just a bit loud</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, and works perfect as I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used, and for the price I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I love smooth, hairless-ness..</li>
            <li>If your skin is irritated easily, just use this on your legs and you should be more than fine.</li>
            <li>leave ur legs smooth and sexy 😀</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li>I started the epilator on speed one, and was more scared by the sound than anything.</li>
            <li>Works brilliantly - needs US plug adapter for those who are outside the states.</li>
            <li>As a first time user, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I attribute this to the fact that the hair which had been jerked out by its roots was becoming finer and finer.  </li>
            <li>But again, once all was said and done I was sooooooo smooth and soooo satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>and I found it mostly pain free.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>Nice long cord, works great.</li>
            <li>The area I tested on my arm is hair free and lovely looking.</li>
            <li>Technique is important and you will get better with time.  </li>
            <li>She says it caused a great amount of pain and got nearly nothing done.</li>
            <li>this incredibly loquacious review has helped you make an informed decision!slower setting and only go over the area once or twice.</li>
            <li>the Braun, it hurt like heck, but my arms were smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside and my legs got most of the hair removed as well.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li>I was even more intimidated by the sound and envisioned ripping my skin off with this thing.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the size and light weight</li>
            <li>My pits feel smooth and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am assuming the good reviews can&#x27;t be real.</li>
            <li>Its good however when you don&#x27;t have much time to wax and is quite portable</li>
            <li>powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>Although, to be fair, this is much faster.</li>
            <li>useful product and nice packaging.</li>
            <li>It hurt, but had it been effective the pain would have been worth it.</li>
            <li>Good idea- the waxing also hurt (the woman told me that redheads tend to have longer hair roots, and could hurt more than normal), and when I told her I was planning on using an epilator, she gave me a &amp;#34;good luck&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>I liked but it is not so powerful.</li>
            <li>chose this particular model of epilator based upon the positive reviews and am now happy to add my own to the list.  </li>
            <li>This is easy to clean too!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute, light and arrived very quickly so yay for that.</li>
            <li>As a redhead with lots of peach fuzz on my cheeks, it did a great job on my face removing the hair quickly and with reasonable discomfort.</li>
            <li>Amazingly painless compared to my older one; removes hair quite well, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I received it yesterday and used it right away with amazing results.</li>
            <li>I bought the Philips HP640 Sanitelle Epilator because my cheap Tweezee broke after many years of fine service.  </li>
            <li>but other then that great purchase!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it will be more like my original.</li>
            <li>When I remembered having an original Epilady many years ago, I wondered how it had been improved over the years.</li>
            <li>I use it every to every other day with great results!</li>
            <li>I was brave enough to use it on my armpits, where I have even better results.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;-Inexpensive and easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li>The cap slides off easily to rinse it.</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Compact, easy to travel and works</li>
            <li>then it becomes easy...</li>
            <li>I thought I would have a very bold skin either the legs and under the arms, but the hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled 100%.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure how to replace or clean the head of this thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-noisier than I wanted to deal with&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m one of those people that easily gets ingrown hair</li>

            <li>It really easy to use</li>
            <li>because it is not battery operated definitely more powerful - which for me means more pain&lt;</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>And the head is washable which makes the cleaning easy.</li>
            <li>Painless, easy to use and the epilating head can be rinsed under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and no pain.</li>
            <li>Purchasing this epilator was not an easy decision for me.</li>
            <li>What is more,  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It is going strong.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>I have a Braun which cost approx $30 more, and it is far superior.</li>
            <li>I recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li>i love that it is electric, its a bit loud but works good.</li>
            <li>While an epilator is not for everyone, this particular one is exceptionally good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a strong ass b*tch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great, fast, very fine little device, does a great job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really nice, i like it  very much</li>
            <li>When my daughter asked to purchase an epilator, we settled on the Philips HP6401, as it was a good value and was highly rated.</li>
            <li>It works very fast and effective.</li>
            <li>found that I have the best outcome if I use it right after a shower (exfoliate the area to prevent clogged follicles) and use either an antiseptic spray or astringent like sea breeze on the area immediately (and for the next couple days.)</li>
            <li>my underarms look very nice with this tool and are red for about an hour after, which is better than waxing.  </li>
            <li>while that is true, I&#x27;ve noticed since my hair grows in many directions, that you need to keep the epilator at a 90 degree angle on your leg and just follow the way the hair grows.</li>
            <li>Plus the best part, is it doesn&#x27;t leave dark marks under the skin(underarms and bikini).</li>
            <li>It kind of stings when you use it the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also directed to prepare first time users to shave 2 to 3 days before using this item and also the shower with warm water to prepare the skin.</li>
            <li>the price, however, is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>However, it is true that the more you do it</li>
            <li>and the cord is super long which is a plus ! :D</li>
            <li>Luckily my leg hair is very light and fine as is, but it feels like it&#x27;s just breaking the hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve waxed or tweezed before, you will be fine.</li>
            <li>The first time it  hurts a bit, but the more you use the more tolerable the pain is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s because the hairs are too fine.</li>
            <li>Calf area was fine-</li>
            <li>The hairs are too fine to break the skin.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>THis works fine.  </li>
            <li>fine that you will have to look at your legs to know that you need to use it</li>
            <li>and it works fine for me</li>
            <li>It is light, handy and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought!</li>
            <li>It works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li>But otherwise works just fine.</li>
            <li>If you have black stubborn hair on your legs like I do, and you can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal - this is the best option for</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am fine with the pain, so that doesn&#x27;t figure into my review.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work not even with fine hair.</li>
            <li>but it does its job fine.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I own Braun Silk and epil epilator for a long time and I saw this and the reviews were good on it.</li>
            <li>The HP6401 works fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to keep my legs smooth now</li>
            <li>It is bulky and does not extract fine hairs.  </li>
            <li>I got it to remove the fine hair on my arms.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work on my fine hairs</li>
            <li>Takes off fine hair.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m fine with using it once a month.  </li>
            <li>if you haven&#x27;t done laser and your hair is &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li>it looks fine,</li>
            <li>Product works fine.</li>
            <li>light, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>- I have relatively fine leg hair and maybe that&#x27;s my problem.</li>
            <li>so yes it tends to work faster, and hurt less, cordless, etc etc.. but does great and beats buying disposable razors all the time!</li>
            <li>but this works just fine.</li>
            <li>Over all I think it does just fine.  </li>
            <li>but it works fine for what I need.</li>
            <li>I could use deodorant in the morning just fine.</li>
            <li>I use it on the highest setting and it seems fine.</li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems to do the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>and it doesnt go as easy as light hairs</li>
            <li>It worked fine but after 3 months of using it it stop working</li>
            <li>You can remove it, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>I used it for places that I&#x27;ve waxed before or places with really fine hair/peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>it works fine everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>(but it&#x27;s fine since the box said this was meant for legs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this was easy and hassle free.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re lucky, you might not have to epilate again for a month!</li>
            <li>This reduced tugging on stubborn hairs and made it feel more like a quick tweezer pluck.</li>
            <li>The pain was extraordinary!</li>
            <li>Super pleased.</li>
            <li>It works and makes my legs feel super smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li>Great price, and a great little worker!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>My legs a super soft and its great.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>easy to use , easy to clean , had about a year now and use 3x weekly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to remove the head part and clean it too!</li>
            <li>I had a different brand that was 1/3 the size of this, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to do the job in 1/2 the time!</li>
            <li>I love the size of it most of all which makes it so handy and compact..very simple and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will be because this may be a very cost effective &amp; easy way to be smooth &amp; hair free through all seasons.</li>
            <li>this is a perfect little epilatory machine, and being from philips means quality.</li>
            <li>This little thing does a great job!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so impressed with how efficient this little thing is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed by this little thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really an excellent little machine.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li>I have seen recommendations that you should first shower to clean and warm up the area before using an epilator.  </li>
            <li>It works great for the darker coarser hair but it seems to pass over the fine blonde hairs.</li>
            <li>Its easy, convenient, and always accessible.  </li>
            <li>The price is very good for such a powerful machine.</li>
            <li>The head is removable so you can wash it which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, makes my face look &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and it saves HUGE amounts of time over having to tweeze my racoon face</li>
            <li>Thus is a huge improvement over that torture device.</li>
            <li>epilator has been a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>and this makes a huge difference with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Its light weight, does what it is supposed to do &amp; fits great in my tiny hands.</li>
            <li>so that is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>This is a huge improvement over having stubble 2-3 days after shaving.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in the thickness and texture.</li>
            <li>Im a huge fan of this epilator.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the smooth feel and</li>
            <li>Still smooth Wednesday.</li>
            <li>I used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s arm &amp; he said it felt like a light tattoo needle.</li>
            <li>WASN&#x27;T BRAVE ENOUGH TO TRY MY BIKINI AREA AFTER THAT.</li>
            <li>I got it for my bikini line, and after suffering through, it&#x27;s still smooth after a week- and without the ingrown hairs that shaving leave.</li>
            <li>I should have ended it there and walked away, but I had to keep my eye on the prize of having a smooth groin area.</li>
            <li>but I still have to shave to get the smooth feel.</li>
            <li>After using it on my legs they were silky smooth.</li>
            <li>There are a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>: Doesn&#x27;t leave perfectly smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>And the skin is so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Leaves legs smooth.</li>
            <li>Sheesh, I could have just shaved in 5 minutes and be smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy I finally purchased one of these!!</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for my legs.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>Hair comes in thinner and your legs are smooth for about a week.</li>
            <li>You might say I enjoy maximizing my hair removal repertoire, as in my mind this equates with maximizing my womanliness.  </li>
            <li>If you have coarse hair all over, this might be a great solution for you.  </li>
            <li>I am looking for some pain free stuff</li>
            <li>i still shave afterwards for the smooth finish .</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try anywhere else!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I did not expect this to work, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It looks like a cheap quality product.</li>
            <li>(I have no clue what the actual name is, lol).</li>
            <li>But, it is worth it and more efficient than shaving with knife or using pin.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Does a great job removing facial hair.</li>
            <li>My husband cannot believe how smooth my legs are all the time now.  </li>
            <li>but I leave my legs smooth.</li>
            <li>I do recommend combining it with shaving though if you want it to always keep a smooth feel too.</li>
            <li>clean up is great and very simple and easy.  </li>
            <li>totally worth it :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great after the second time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>/&gt;+it&#x27;s comfortable to hold&lt;</li>
            <li>It sounds and operates like a cheap instrument.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema and have never found anything that lets me remove hair and be comfortable afterwards.</li>
            <li>My husband even noticed and asked if I was wearing makeup on my legs because my legs looked so smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this to use on my chest and arm pit hair (I&#x27;m a male), and it does work great.</li>
            <li>My legs weren&#x27;t smooth, but I attributed that to regrowth that this epilator couldn&#x27;t yet reach.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this epilator after using the Remington Smooth and Silky for over a year.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic device .</li>
            <li>so I recommend getting some lidocaine which can be found for cheap here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This one looks unisex and it was cheap.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m cheap and I was on a &amp;#34;beauty</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cheap, get it girl.</li>
            <li>You will always be smooth 2.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean 4.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works great.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a week since I used it, and my legs are still mostly smooth...</li>
            <li>I am forever grateful to this epilator because I can rub my hand over my face and my skin is completely smooth.</li>
            <li>In the end, buy this if you are looking for a cheap epilator</li>
            <li>I have used others but this is really comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I do enjoy the results of the epilator and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li>I slammed it on my counter, grabbed some lotion and a razor, and had both legs smooth in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>epilator won&#x27;t give the smooth and silky skin that you want, but it will give your legs hairless</li>
            <li>My legs aren&#x27;t as smooth</li>
            <li>After feeling how smooth her legs (and arms) were</li>
            <li>so you can sit comfortably.  </li>
            <li>It got five stars just because her legs is are smooth as I like.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s just not that important to me that they be silky-smooth all the time).</li>
            <li>this smooth</li>
            <li>Easy to clean plus I like the design.</li>
            <li>But even then, not so much pain as kind of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t be intimidated by the sound.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s on the cheap end.</li>
            <li>did nothing for the light hairs.</li>
            <li>Not only can use for legs but also great for my underarms and face.    </li>
            <li>Returned it and embarked on a more costly (but well worth it) laser hair removal experience.</li>
            <li>It is vey nice quality and fast to remove unwanted hair</li>
            <li>I have never had smooth skin until using this.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the sensitivity guard.</li>
            <li>On to the next great idea...</li>
            <li>great eplicator with the exception of it being plug in only, it does what it says on the tin...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get every hair so don&#x27;t expect smooth legs.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and works</li>
            <li>It would be fantastic if I could&#x27;ve endured the torture.</li>
            <li>It is more time-consuming than shaving and getting waxed, but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li>This is a great epilator, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic epilator.</li>
            <li>(note that i have been using epilators almost exclusively for about 10 years now and have had several, all of which worked great.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping that this would give me smooth legs without any noticeable hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waxed, shaved and tweezed and this is such a great solution to hair removal.</li>
            <li>Smooth, silky under arms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The cap is easy to remove and clean.</li>
            <li>It does a great job on peach fuzz on the face and back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Now its the quickest and easiest way to stay smooth.</li>
            <li>However, it does such a great job i use it everywhere (legs, armpits, bikini line).</li>
            <li>It hurts, I&#x27;m not going to lie, but it works well and leaves skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>but as I&#x27;ve never been one to flip my lid over legs that aren&#x27;t completely smooth this is not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>The beauty of it is that you can go at your own pace to gauge how much pain you can tolerate instead of</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator because it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>and so are arm pits but deffinitely worth the results :)</li>
            <li>The epilator is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this as a solution to the constant bother of waxing.</li>
            <li>I used it almost immediately and had legs about as smooth as if I had shaved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since then, it still works great, and it reduces skin irritation while saving me money.    </li>
            <li>Works great for my facial hairs.</li>
            <li>This works well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have currently only used this on my arms and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my arms baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>And if your bathroom is anything like mine, a comfortable spot in which to do this is not close to the outlet.  </li>
            <li>I get smooth arms for a couple weeks with just 30 min or so of pain.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the epilator does work when I shave against the grain...</li>
            <li>and it got them as smooth as if i had shaved them</li>
            <li>If you are too light in the pressure department you will trim your hair and not have it removed fully.</li>
            <li>think this epilator is fantastic.</li>
            <li>think this epilator is fantastic.</li>
            <li>comfortable to hold and remove hair.</li>
            <li>I think is sound scarier than it is.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it had a light - mine</li>
            <li>Even if it breaks in two months (like another reviewer stated) it would STILL be totally worth it as I spend more than that getting waxed.</li>
            <li>However, I still have to shave after epilating to get the perfectly smooth skin that I desire.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used it on my underarms as well and got fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I sometimes have to go over my leg area twice, but overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li>it works great on the face, upper body and leggs.</li>
            <li>It really worked nicely for me.</li>
            <li>after trying shaving and then waxing to get smooth legs</li>
            <li>Just go lightly, &amp;#34;hover&amp;#34; over the hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two days since I tried it and that one part of my leg is still smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I read a review from a man that bought a few, tested them out (on himself) and said this one was the best.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after a while it seems to not remove hair as well but still works great.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a product that works for your legs and is cheap, this will work for you.</li>
            <li>Have used it for several months now, and it works great.</li>
            <li>I will say that the head doesn&#x27;t feel terribly secure.</li>
            <li>The machine does a great job for lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Below my knees, my legs are smooth as ever.</li>
            <li>The charger does not stay securely in the epilator and would fall out if bumped.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten fully smooth with this epilator.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given it five stars if it didn&#x27;t sound like a lawnmower.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cant say it doesn&#x27;t work but can&#x27;t say that I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>I would go over an area a couple of times with this epilator and it would leave the area smooth and hair free.</li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>my legs can be comfortably covered while they heal.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;once, but not for $30 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>It does, however leave your area feeling smooth like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li>Have fun epilating and enjoy smooth skin!</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised it didn&#x27;t hurt when I used it and loved that my leggs felt so smooth after i used it</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to give up shaving and stop paying for salon leg waxes.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Also, I make sure that the length of the hair is good enough so the tweezers in this machine could pull those out nicely!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it helps, but I exfoliate first, use lots of nice cool lotion afterwards</li>
            <li>but I exfoliate with a puff in the shower and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I love love this so much  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>and this one had some pretty good reviews, and was not expensive.  </li>
            <li>It works great, better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I used creams and stuff before and the pain from this tweezer is so much more comfortable than the weeks worth of burning from creams.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is good for beginner epilators to test out to see if its for them and after trying it im willing to save up and get a higher quality one</li>
            <li>(I think sugaring is faster, easier and far more effective).  </li>
            <li>They stayed smooth for a whole week!!!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have had my legs waxed many times in the intervening years, so this epilator was not painful for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a new one!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am very satisfied with this Philips epilator.</li>
            <li>Other than that very good.</li>
            <li>Very good price comparing with other brands.</li>
            <li>Not easy to use, has to be at the perfect angle to remove hair.</li>
            <li>I got the one with the cored because I like it to always have a full strong charge.</li>
            <li>WAX FIRST!!</li>
            <li>WAX FIRST!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT HUUUUUURRTTT BAADDDD the first time!!</li>
            <li>works really well for me!!!</li>
            <li>And yes, pain is perfectly tolerable and it does get better after the first use, but not worth it if the hair is not going to be removed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s very powerful, and does and</li>
            <li>But, I have also seen this remove some very short hairs very effectively.  </li>
            <li>Stuck between useful, very clean</li>
            <li>She isn&#x27;t as excited by the \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; as I am, which means that _I_ get to be smooth while waiting on her to try it out.</li>
            <li>She isn&#x27;t as excited by the \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; as I am, which means that _I_ get to be smooth while waiting on her to try it out.</li>
            <li>On legs, it is not very painful (feels more like a lot of pinching) but if you use it on underarms for example, it hurts like heck.</li>
            <li>My arms look clean and feel smooth.</li>
            <li>But the machine is pretty loud, anyway this is a great product.</li>
            <li>For the first time in yearssss my legs were silky smooth for more than a day.</li>
            <li>Quick &amp; easy.</li>
            <li>No irritation, quick, easy, and pain free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular epilator is nice for your legs.</li>
            <li>This is easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good on longer hair but didn&#x27;t seem to work very well on the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and I purchased it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It may not be the most efficient method, but I was able to brave getting even around my bikini line in this way (obviously another sensitive area).</li>
            <li>Also very useful and clean.</li>
            <li>It removes my unwanted hair flawlessly with very little pain.</li>
            <li>I love this epilator because it&#x27;s easy to use and very practical to carry when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I now do my underarms twice a week but legs and bikini only once a week and am super happy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to order it on amazon.com, it delivered so quick, earlier than it was supposed to.</li>
            <li>handy, easy to carry any where and gives a very clean skin back after the epillating process.</li>
            <li>I went to bed and in the morning the red bumps were gone and my legs looked AMAZING!</li>
            <li>After the first couple of times, it is much better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not friendly to use on your privates.</li>
            <li>In general,  good product.</li>
            <li>The noise and the speed of the tweezers is intimidating but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I got the European version of the Satinelle (Remington) back home in Europe, which is perfect, so when I came to the U.S on vacation I decided to get this one, but I&#x27;m not at all satisfied because sometimes it cuts your hairs instead of pulling them</li>
            <li>My mom warned me about her adventure with the original EpiLady, and I listened.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t have tattoos, so I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best thing to compare it to...</li>
            <li>Ok, so it hurt like HECK the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup is a breeze: just remove the top and run it under hot, soapy water.</li>
            <li>but im pretty pleased for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>but I kept using it because I didn&#x27;t know any better about epilators since it was my first.</li>
            <li>, the first two uses u will love it</li>
            <li>Love this thing, it&#x27;s my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been waxing for four years now, and have seen a significant decrease in hair density and growth.</li>
            <li>I drank a significant amount of vodka before trying this</li>
            <li>travel friendly.</li>
            <li>I was able to get under my arms pretty well without having to contort, twist, or pull.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, the noise doesn&#x27;t bother me as long as the epilator continues to perform great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for,  would have given 5 stars if if had worked better on my face.</li>
            <li>I just received my epilator 2 days ago, so far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>My second use wasn&#x27;t as successful.</li>
            <li>But for $30-50 it is totally worth it to me!</li>
            <li>Ok it hurts alot, but it is my first time ever doing this</li>
            <li>For my first epilator, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>and she is really excited about using it again when her hair is longer.</li>
            <li>Shes really excited about this Epilator(asphalt grinder).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, though.. this thing hurts but the pain is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to continue using this product.</li>
            <li>Okay, lets start with the first thing on everyone&#x27;s mind in these reviews.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll still hurt too.</li>
            <li>it works great  and its very well built ,hopefully we get few years out of it ,good price</li>
            <li>So I was so excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>I used the original Epilady in the 1980s and found it unbearable.</li>
            <li>my printer isn&#x27;t working; and they never sent me an original</li>
            <li>It does hurt at first but the more you use it the easier it gets.</li>
            <li>I can do everything except the most most sensitive area!  </li>
            <li>this is my first epliator, and i love it.</li>
            <li>But completely worth it for how well it works !</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have rich experience for comparison.</li>
            <li>and i have enjoyed going hairless for longer despite hte pain at first.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I can sometimes make a dozen passes over a small patch of skin with visible hairs of a length that should be perfect and</li>
            <li>I even shaved first wait a day then use this, my razor works much better.</li>
            <li>It hurts for the first couple of times but gets better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Discomfort aside, I did notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li>but it really is worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is how women get jumped into and out of gangs.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this thing is powerful and works!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend was excited to use this</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use it</li>
            <li>I had one of the original epilators and it lasted for years.  </li>
            <li>I originally was going to spend $400 on a NONO, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to it.  </li>
            <li>Hell the first time, then it gets better.</li>
            <li>On the day after first time, make sure to clean the area that you epilated which you can do in the shower.</li>
            <li>I JUST LOVE THIS and wanted to reassure you that it does work and is a great little epilator.  </li>
            <li>but after lots of try it kind of died a little, not as good like in the beginning.</li>
            <li>Wow this product really works, I can proudly say I have no more pubes :D!!</li>
            <li>A neat little design which enables easy storage and most importantly does a good job.</li>
            <li>Everything came brand new in it&#x27;s own box.</li>
            <li>The charging cord is very long and great for use in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I believe my skin may be more sensitive than most, and I understand that not everyone experiences this problem.  </li>
            <li>But from what I have experienced this far, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice; When I used it first time, feels bit hurt, but after a minutes I was getting use to it and doesn&#x27;t feel hurt anymore;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use it to clean my side burns.</li>
            <li>Clean finish.</li>
            <li>and you know you are hair free because you do not feel the mild pinching with hair being tweezed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I would have a higher rating of the epilator were it not uncomfortably painful to use.</li>
            <li>so I can take it to the sink and fully immerse it in water and soap to clean it.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected but definitely better than some.</li>
            <li>I epilate maybe once a week, just to clean things up here and there.</li>
            <li>Thus have a clean leg for a longer duration.</li>
            <li>Got this to clean up some &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; and oh my, it works.  </li>
            <li>item itself is Great for Thin clumps of hair and it stays away for a good While.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the epilator, are very usefull for all, i love because is electric and dont need batteries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*essy to clean</li>
            <li>and my skin is super smooth with no razor burn.</li>
            <li>and my arms are still perfectly clean and its been a week</li>
            <li>recommend it to anybody who wants to have an epilatr with reasonable price and good performance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I had such great success with my legs, tried it with my armpits.</li>
            <li>far, I can tell that this product is probably best used for legs only or areas where the hair is NOT dense/coarse.</li>
            <li>This does the job, you have to clean it alot</li>
            <li>I recived as I espected, it came with everything that sais in the box exept for the brush to clean after the use.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I was looking for an epilator that I can clean under the water faucet and had an adapter.</li>
            <li>you get super smooth legs?</li>
            <li>but after that I was completely use to it and find its way better than plucking and shaving any day!</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased and hope it continues to work!</li>
            <li>This epilator is very good and fast, I&#x27;ve had more expensive models but this one in my opinion is equally as good.</li>
            <li>great things about this product would be the fact that the head is removal so you can wash it(love that) and the cord is super long.</li>
            <li>The epilator itself is good with a two-speed setting, a detachable head for easy cleaning, and a long, detachable plug (runs on batteries too).</li>
            <li>I am addicted to using this now, the feeling of having such smooth skin is awesome and its great to now have to use my razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this product gets the job done, although you have to pass certain areas more than once before all the hairs get pulled out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll yank all that right out!</li>
            <li>Philips did this right!</li>
            <li>Keeping the blades clean is the key to good epilation.</li>
            <li>It hurts a little at first, but once you get used to using this epilator it works great!</li>
            <li>(most epilators are marketed at a very high price point)&lt;br</li>
            <li>But most importantly love the fact that it&#x27;s almost pain free to use it, honestly I have little tolerance for any pain and can use this without even flinching!</li>
            <li>[At your own risk.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the wonderful world of no bumps, dry hair removal!Using this epilator anywhere other than your legs?</li>
            <li>but I wish it would be more accurate in getting more of the hairs out without having to go over the same spot three or four times.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to use the second speed; it is working great with first.</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with it, it&#x27;s definitely cheaper than getting waxed</li>
            <li>I thought the epilator would be a nice alternative to waxing and a more long term solution than shaving.</li>
            <li>(There was not much discomfort experienced while using this product, but I will admit that the discomfort&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the epilator was more effective it might have been worth it, but it left lots of hair</li>
            <li>, just AS GOOD, I actually PREFER not having to charge it, I just plug it up and go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After doing the whole shaving thing this is surely a better alternative.</li>
            <li>I love it, works really well, and take off from the root.</li>
            <li>In another hand, I can say that the noise is kind of loud, so would no hear aniything else while you use it.</li>
            <li>check the issues about packaging while the function is good enough.</li>
            <li>Apply some oil (I use Sweet Almond Oil) before you epilate.</li>
            <li>I used to have an Emjoi Gently Silken and it seems to me that the Philps HP 6401 does a better of grabbing and pulling the hair out.</li>
            <li>I love that the hair, when it does return is much softer that the hair it took off.</li>
            <li>Got a full refund</li>
            <li>Is it worth suffering for smooth legs:</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li>but I still think it is better since you can give yourself as much time as you</li>
            <li>and then I have to epilate at full hair growth.</li>
            <li>In fact, not painful at all, (but I have been conditioned by waxing.)</li>
            <li>This is true.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this. :)</li>
            <li>, i really dont expect more than these 2 features from my epilator.</li>
            <li>get waxed, this thing causes way to much pain and takes way too many passes to remove the hair.</li>
            <li>I told her that can&#x27;t be true because mine felt like torture.</li>
            <li>This epilator has been a true lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it is any better than another brand I used</li>
            <li>the most intimate body part this thing touched was</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s kind of loud.</li>
            <li>and it lasts years), and there is simply no reason to spend more money on the more advanced models.</li>
            <li>just good for leg only.</li>
            <li>Those people are true wuzzes.  </li>
            <li>After looking at the product reviews I was sure that this product would seem reasonable but just after a dozen or so uses it decided to stop working.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not painful at all</li>
            <li>the second one i got wasnt that good</li>
            <li>This thing is so cool.</li>
            <li>I thought it was rechargable but its not, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li>No painful wax or messiness from it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good epilator.</li>
            <li>I was very reluctant to give it a try, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Overall its good.</li>
            <li>I managed to use it on most my calves without TOO much pain, but it took over an hour just to get 3/4 of my calves done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where this product works best are areas where hair is thinner, at least that&#x27;s the performance</li>
            <li>Good for simple hair removal</li>
            <li>It does take a lot more time than shaving, but your hair grows in softer, your skin is healthier, and your tan stays much longer.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wish I could love it</li>
            <li>but wow is it effective.</li>
            <li>works just like a charm and for such a good price.</li>
            <li>I personally use it for my legs, armpits and it is also good for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>and while it is true that you can unplug the device from its cord, it stops immediately.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this one so much I was looking for hair on my body to remove.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better when it&#x27;s sticking straight up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just really loud and the device smells kind of smells like overworked device from using electricity.</li>
            <li>i just dislike it how its just kind of loud.</li>
            <li>Unlike creams the tweezer has many my hair grow out so much lighter.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast both times and because of the incident, I was able to grow out some hairs for epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fair enough.  </li>
            <li>Love it, really takes the hair off.</li>
            <li>but this actually works fairly well)&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I felt it pulling the hair, but was relieved that it was not really painful at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure people with lighter, thinner hair would have a much easier time using this product.</li>
            <li>before I had Braun epilator for many years, they are just the same thing this is as good as Braun one and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>so I could do my full body.</li>
            <li>My hair can be coarse in some areas but the machine does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall the epilator is good.</li>
            <li>I just received my epilator and and used it on my lower legs - full power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on full legs, full bikini, and armpits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful at all.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>not bad.</li>
            <li>To me the pain is not bad.</li>
            <li>not a bad product</li>
            <li>My legs were not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not bad.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>and i was told by a review that it is good for sensitive skin and first time</li>
            <li>so this is really nice if you&#x27;re not really sensitive :)</li>
            <li>This one is not bad at all</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not really so bad.</li>
            <li>Does hurt, not really bad</li>
            <li>i am impressed on how well it gets all the hair......even rhe very fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li>Most of the hair on my arms and legs is very fine and blonde, so with these hairs it tends to just break a lot of them instead of pulling them out.  </li>
            <li>It did the job and its fairly inexpensive, but I rather continue waxing my legs for a better finish in less amount of time.</li>
            <li>leg area as well as overall this is a good way to quickly do away with hair.</li>
            <li>No need to wait for the hair to grow until to effective length, and no mess at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this little machine and absolutely I loved!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have baby smooth legs after using it like I can get right after shaving.</li>
            <li>I find it to be quite important that you use it at the right hair growth length.</li>
            <li>The second time, I followed the instructions more fully and made sure my legs were clean and well-exfoliated, before I had applied any lotion to them.  </li>
            <li>but this one is so much better its smaller not as bulky and u can run the top over water to get it clean  </li>
            <li>Any kind of powder, you put enough in those areas, and it will help the epilator runs more smoothly over that area and not irritate it as much.</li>
            <li>I started on the first speed setting and after becoming more confident, moved to the second speed setting.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great, quick and mess free way to take care of the legs.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to completely read and follow the instructions, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>However, it does not pull out some of the fine hairs, but it does clear the most of it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, most of which said it was not painful and the price tag was fairly decent.</li>
            <li>The hair on my body tends to be rather thick/coarse/dark in certain areas such as the armpits, the \\&quot;happy trail\\&quot;, and of course the forbidden pubic area.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I was happy with the experience.</li>
            <li>So far, everything looks perfect for say, wearing a skirt in public but still feels pretty stubbly.  </li>
            <li>But other that that it works great.</li>
            <li>and i barely feel anything at all, love it!</li>
            <li>After several long years of seeking an effective hair removal option, I was really happy to come across this epilator.</li>
            <li>Simply fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my lower back, full front chest and lip area and it does a marvelous job and removing hair!</li>
            <li>and hopefully I won&#x27;t to need to buy a new one for another 10 years! :))</li>
            <li>Does a fine job of ripping out your air ;D</li>
            <li>In all honesty, you just have to get through the pain the first time and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine on more fine hairs, however, does not grab coarse hairs as well.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hairs, so it may just be me.  </li>
            <li>Does the job quickly.</li>
            <li>works JUST AS QUICKLY</li>
            <li>You just have to rip the band aid off and do it quickly.</li>
            <li>Some people say you have to make sure your skin is complete oil free before epilating.</li>
            <li>It mainly breaks my hairs instead of pulling them out by the root, and hurts a lot on top of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and over before you know it.  </li>
            <li>The battery died quick.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all hairs with each use, it&#x27;s more of a some here and there or most each time, but over time definitely works and lasts</li>
            <li>If that did happen, regrowth happened just as quickly as with waxing and chemical remivers5.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to shave as much anymore &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I expected more to be truly honest.</li>
            <li>My mom bought it several years ago with a regular use and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Its not the most expensive, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>So, do a quick section, pick it up, do a section elsewhere, and so on.</li>
            <li>It almost encourages me to use the device regularly, as the longer you wait, the more it hurts (more hairs).</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m in need of a quick underarm cleaning</li>
            <li>It does a quick job, it takes around 30 seconds to do each pit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>item is easy to put together, clean, and fast to use.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a super</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say I will be forever loyal to these two products.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>I quickly tried it.</li>
            <li>If Im in a quick hurry, I just use my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Emjoi is a decent product but the Philips is better.</li>
            <li>SUPER FRICKING LIE</li>
            <li>It helps me to get rid of my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The cord stopped working, luckily within the warranty period</li>
            <li>Excellent product, for the price paid, especially compared to what i could get in NZ for the same price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to clean, it works very well</li>
            <li>Shaving left bumps, waxing left scars, but this was awesome!!!</li>
            <li>A quick call to amazon</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick and doesn&#x27;t hurt. ....</li>
            <li>Better than the older Braun epilator it replaced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived quickly and I tested it out as soon as I got it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its effective enough to use as a primary hair removal method.</li>
            <li>but I quickly got accustomed.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m smooth and hair free much faster.</li>
            <li>i wish i would&#x27;ve invested a tiny bit more on better quality.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>A 7.5 since it does a decent of grabbing many of the hairs</li>
            <li>and after I use it a few more times and get more comfortable with it, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see how great this little device is.</li>
            <li>I must have a high pain tolerance, because so many people whine about it.  </li>
            <li>She tends to have a high pain tolerance (probably from putting up with me)  :)</li>
            <li>This was a great first epilator for me, because it is inexpensive enough that I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This is my very first epilator.  </li>
            <li>You are not going to have that smooth as silk feeling that you get with shaving when you first start using it.  </li>
            <li>So in theory it should have worked on one or the other (ideally both), but it doesn&#x27;t really work with either types of hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this, and will continue to use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with this device and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>It pulls all the hair out very consistently.</li>
            <li>I originally decided to use MOOM sugaring product, and while it worked well above the knee, I wasn&#x27;t really thrilled with how it worked on my lower leg.  </li>
            <li>also doesn&#x27;t have a light which is a pretty neat feature</li>
            <li>but when i read the directions i found out its not for that but its good for legs but takes too long..</li>
            <li>Have been looking for a good epilator for a long time.</li>
            <li>Picture ripping hair wax treatments off slooowly, pulling hair by hair deliciously out by the roots, all the while listening to a cute little pink device hum along cheerfully.  </li>
            <li>Still, Recommended highly for how great a job it does on coarse hair.</li>
            <li>corded kind will never loose charge</li>
            <li>so i decide to buy new one :)</li>
            <li>I love my new Philips Epilator and would have given it 5 stars, but in the end it&#x27;s still not like shaving, but then again it doesn&#x27;t claim to be.</li>
            <li>it is a shocker if your new at it, but it is more a slight/quick sting, then poof gone.  </li>
            <li>I love my new Epilator.</li>
            <li>new one by Phillips seems to be shaped and sized in a way that fits MUCH better....</li>
            <li>OK, So I&#x27;m new to using epilators.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than the epilator I previously owned</li>
            <li>Andreaschoice on youtube has a great video on this subject if you want to watch a how to video.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first one back in February and loved it.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a pretty good pain tolerance, but this was different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Silver lining:&lt;br /&gt;After the first sessions, your hair grows back all nice and fine, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt me anymore</li>
            <li>The product presents a good quality and it is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Its very quick, as fast as shaving 3.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t go back and redo an area, since the results of the first epilation are good.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend to everybody who wants to remove hair</li>
            <li>that I have little time to spend on waxing and shaving because of two jobs, I decided to try this product, mainly because it&#x27;s more affordable than Braun and more popular brands.</li>
            <li>you do use a product like this make sure to get a very natural and soothing lotion or aloe vera to help ease the discomfort and pain caused by these devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it hurt a lot!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use an epilator!</li>
            <li>for such price - i love it!</li>
            <li>and then they use it straight from shaving and it BURNS LIKE FIRE!! ...</li>
            <li>I must say that the first time it HURT!.  </li>
            <li>If you are a first time user of an epilator I think this is a good fit as it is not too rough.</li>
            <li>I first heard of epilators from a friend of mine who would rave about hers!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will still use this one occasionally for sure!</li>
            <li>Pretty good not great but good for the money</li>
            <li>Honestly, I feel like waxing works better and hurts way less.</li>
            <li>it does more work in less time.its amazing...</li>
            <li>someone who struggled through shaving for six years, and waxing for four, this option is cheaper, more effective, and less invasive than anything I have used before.</li>
            <li>Seeing as she has had two children by C-section and two abdominal surgeries she ought to be able to deal with the initial pain easily, right?f</li>
            <li>While dealing with trimming one&#x27;s eyebrows, beard and skull-top hair is easily done and acceptable barbershop routine, hair growing out of one&#x27;s nostrils and on one&#x27;s ear lobes, including the entrance to the hearing canal requires a more personal approach.</li>
            <li>I believe that people who have waxed before will be able to tolerate this easily, it feels like nothing especially on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it was reasonable priced, arrived quickly with all needed parts and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>They last forever, easy to pack and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>My mom claims this one does not do fine hair well, but I don&#x27;t know that I have had so much problem with that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of perplexed by how that happens, but I&#x27;m going to try this product for a few more weeks before really judging its true effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I loved and can not live without !</li>
            <li>Great little epilator...</li>
            <li>Great little machine.</li>
            <li>I experienced little to none.</li>
            <li>def works better on short fine</li>
            <li>I decided this will be the first I will purchase, mostly because of the decent price.</li>
            <li>The cost seemed reasonable (the more expensive ones just seemed to come with more attachments, which I didn&#x27;t need), and the device was fairly straight-forward and seemed easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And, it is clear why this little thing is the best seller in this category on Amazon.</li>
            <li>(I have fine, blonde hair), a light, slow, motion works best.  </li>
            <li>Seems durable, easy to clean, nice little velour bag for packing.</li>
            <li>I use a hard wax to wax my own underarms, but trying to do my own legs takes forever.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a few weeks, I decided to get brave and try it on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>The cord got in my way only once, which is amazing since I switched hands and angles a LOT.</li>
            <li>but its been great to use every few days rather than shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product because it&#x27;s a fast way to get a shaved look on my legs</li>
            <li>My legs feel absolutely amazing, and I&#x27;m not going back to shaving!!</li>
            <li>This gently removes the hair and pulls out the light colored hairs the laser did not get.</li>
            <li>I am not saying it is pain free, but I couldn&#x27;t feel too much.  </li>
            <li>With cream depilatories I often experienced some adverse chemical reaction and with waxing, well, its f@#!ing painful, but probaly the most swift and effective method I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>However, I was ready for some smooth legs and decided to just do it.  </li>
            <li>well worth it.</li>
            <li>My daughter borrowed mine, and loved it so much, I had to buy her one, so I could have mine back.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really worth the investment.</li>
            <li>My old Braun one was good, it had a light and was solid, but eventually the motor wore out.</li>
            <li>You do become used to it, and the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>In her own words, she didn&#x27;t know something so convenient existed - not as much pain as she had anticipated (and she has sensitive skin and waxing hurts</li>
            <li>Overall, I liked it, but I think this one can be improved..</li>
            <li>and it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be much more skin sensitive product</li>
            <li>(the product states that it&#x27;s only intended to be used on legs, so don&#x27;t take that as any kind of validation).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many ways- different lengths of hair, different speeds and techniques, after showering, after exfoliating, all the tips I&#x27;ve been able to find, but it still just breaks most of the hairs off.  </li>
            <li>The product is well worth the price it sells for.</li>
            <li>that you could do a full shaving first, and then use this periodically as hair begins to grow in.</li>
            <li>Hopefully by the time we&#x27;re back to warm weather</li>
            <li>What I can say is that while it does hurt, if it means that I don&#x27;t have to shave for a month it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>and there was some bleeding on the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>BUT SOOOOOOOOOO worth it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The armpits were really fun to do.</li>
            <li>you get your moneys worth from this</li>
            <li>It looks like it pulled the hair with the roots attached, so I am hoping it will be much like having a wax and last a good while.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a cap to use when epilating in the most sensitive areas</li>
            <li>Powerful and efficient.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>So no matter how many times I went over the area it would not make my leg feel smooth, all it left was a prickly leg.</li>
            <li>But it works, and the pain is almost exciting.</li>
            <li>it displays isn&#x27;t worth the hassle or the outcomes.</li>
            <li>and I was constantly having to adjust the angle to make it effective.</li>
            <li>For the price, I thought it was worth it</li>
            <li>To me this is way better that shaving because I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using products like these for many years now, when my old one stopped working I researched and decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve bought it my entire life, and I would say it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied so far but it will only be in time that I know if this is an effective method for me to use.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not as effective on all areas.</li>
            <li>But worth buying</li>
            <li>but it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>over all worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $30.</li>
            <li>To me it was well worth the discomfort.  </li>
            <li>When the box arrived it was packaged nicely and had all necessary materials.</li>
            <li>so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>, the nice thing is it doesn&#x27;t come back in like after shaving.  </li>
            <li>but it is worth it</li>
            <li>The skin around my knees was more sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is simple and effective.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt more.</li>
            <li>You just have to decide if the pain is worth the price of beauty.</li>
            <li>If it continues to do well on my legs, it will be well worth the price I pay on disposable razors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was worth a try, but I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.</li>
            <li>the skin on my thighs is much more sensitive and it hurt like HELL.</li>
            <li>It is really useful and convenient.</li>
            <li>Was effective only for a month or so...</li>
            <li>must say, the advantage of epilating over shaving is well worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li>I love epilating so far.  </li>
            <li>It is far better than doing waxing by self.</li>
            <li>but sure is loud...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>I never would have been able to wax that frequently.</li>
            <li>The pain is definatley worth it!And</li>
            <li>experienced frequent ingrown hairs (even though I followed the directions) and patches the machine simply could not pick up.  </li>
            <li>It is a useful product anyway.</li>
            <li>Worth buying</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you, Philips, for creating such an effective product.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something that worked better than my 13 year old one.</li>
            <li>tried a few and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Those things are better waxed by a professional.</li>
            <li>It is not painful at all, and it gets the job done pretty well.</li>
            <li>I think is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li>Worth the &amp;#34;pain.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>but it was worth it</li>
            <li>This epilator has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But it is so nice to only have to use it about 1 time a week or 1 every 10 days or so.  </li>
            <li>but it is useful for some areas.</li>
            <li>It DOES hurt, of course, because it is yanking the hairs out by the root, but you get used to it and the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li>but once you see the results its worth it&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I can get away with longer periods between hair removal with this as compared to shaving, this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Finally I ordered my own cuz wifey nagging about her epilator</li>
            <li>[Aka where the skin is far more used to this type of sensation</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>I say 5 stars worth of yes.</li>
            <li>[Aka where the skin is far more used to this type of sensation</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>I say 5 stars worth of yes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>so far i love it.</li>
            <li>It is also smaller and able to fit in my pits and bikini line well which the emagine couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li>So worth it to me</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully, on her face, underneath her chin, where she has a tendency to grow a few old lady hairs.</li>
            <li>I assumed epilating would be a good alternative as it really does remove the entire hair follicle.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is worth it to get rid of porcupine legs.</li>
            <li>she indicated the HP6401 seemed worth trying.</li>
            <li>this product really useful in plucking your unwanted hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>Have been using one of these for years, the old one broke, after many years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even imagine using it in more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Although compact and thin, this epilator packs a punch and does what it promises to do...remove hair flawlessly.</li>
            <li>SO worth it.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a useful product that does what it advertises at a fraction of the cost of its competition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall good, it leaves my legs much smoother than using a razor, and for longer.</li>
            <li>So I will continue to use this product, it may take up to 30 minutes to get my legs done, but its worth it.</li>
            <li>I recommend that all users buy some kind of lotion to use after epilation and an exfoliating scrub glove to use prior to epilation.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Apart from the pain, it pulls out some hair but breaks most of them and skin doesn&#x27;t feel soft.</li>
            <li>I had to endure quite a bit of pain (for me) to get the job done, but I&#x27;m thinking it was worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, but only if you know how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li>it would be nice to not have to quickly change into long sweat pants whenever we had a visitor.</li>
            <li>It;s becoming more important to have a good epilator as my eyes become less sharp as I age</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t used an epilator before, just know that it hurts like hell, but, with the right one, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to figure out why in due time.  </li>
            <li>Though it quite hurts using it the first time, next time it becomes much better!</li>
            <li>No more razor bumps, NO paying for waxing, and i&#x27;m sure that my husband is appreciating me not complaining about &#x27;not feeling sexy because I haven&#x27;t shaved&#x27;!</li>
            <li>I found that the batteries ran out fast in my other epilator so having a corded adapter is great for not having it run out on you</li>
            <li>If you have never used an epilator, be aware that it pulls out the hair - so there is some mild discomfort, but it comes with a beginner&#x27;s guard to make it easier.</li>
            <li>For my first time using an epilator, I learned a valuable lesson rather quickly.</li>
            <li>and I got used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The pain went away pretty quickly and I didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li>My first reaction was \\&quot;Jeezes!\\&quot; before quickly turning it off.</li>
            <li>Not worth the bother, get something a little more pricey for results, there are some great ones out there!</li>
            <li>The head pops off easily and it&#x27;s not hard to run it under water or blow on it to get the hair out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud, and my husband asked what was happening, but it was quick and easy to do my feet and lower leg (right to my knees).</li>
            <li>I was so excited I did my whole armpit and</li>
            <li>I either got a bum product, or this isn&#x27;t as good as all the other reviews say it is.  </li>
            <li>Easily one of the most exciting things about using this product is the sheer volume of hair that comes out of the thing, much like a lawn mower.</li>
            <li>I don;t have the right type of skin.</li>
            <li>the guard thing broke right away, you dont need it</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>and I think I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>(ie don&#x27;t do it right before you go</li>
            <li>It really does a great job in getting a lot of hair in a single pass, and most areas only need the one pass.</li>
            <li>If you do it right, you can get a Brazilian thing going.</li>
            <li>Still, we&#x27;re doing this out of convenience, right?</li>
            <li>Otherwise it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, rips the hair right out of you leg.</li>
            <li>Eventually I bit the bullet and finished the right armpit.</li>
            <li>I took it out and tried it right</li>
            <li>Not to mention the time my boyfriend walked in right as I was ripping off the bikini strip, he was horrified.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The pain is right up there with electrocution.</li>
            <li>Basically use it right</li>
            <li>She looked at it Christmas morning and fell for it right off, we read the instruction sheet on the 26th</li>
            <li>the Satinelle right after washing your face and showering and remember to stretch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think it could be because I&#x27;m right side dominant</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice to get the right angle and pressure.  </li>
            <li>then I anticipated so if you&#x27;re looking for painless I&#x27;d say this isn&#x27;t the right thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>Just received it started right away.  </li>
            <li>It pulls the hairs right out</li>
            <li>Having said all of that the subsequent times i have used it have been great, very easy to use, does a great job and is much more convenient than shaving, as well as less expensive.</li>
            <li>I tried this product on my lady parts (even though it isn&#x27;t recommended in the instructions) and surprisingly it hurt far less than on my legs, and worked MUCH better.</li>
            <li>A good exfoliating glove helps tremendously, use it while you&#x27;re in the shower before you use the epilator and it will help expose any hairs that may have started to grown under that thin top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>It woks great but a little tab broke that keeps the head on!</li>
            <li>Epilator works fine, but will most it only can grab hairs that are a certain length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The problem though was that it didn&#x27;t seem to very easily go in and around the curves above my lip etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most of the major visible hairs are gone off my legs.</li>
            <li>The sound is very loud!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a major hair problem, since I have lasered most of my body.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase, even if it isn&#x27;t totally effective, and for the price compared to other epilators I think it does a good enough job.</li>
            <li>I found that this epilator did a good job of removing the coarse hairs, but simply broke the fine hairs off rather than pulling them out.  </li>
            <li>and I might be brave enough to wear them in public for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>I went over the same area many times, slowly, quickly, trying to get them</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, but I don&#x27;t really like being so hairy</li>
            <li>Great service as usual.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; might be different on more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I am not sure but the experience was unforgettable.</li>
            <li>I was very worried about pain, but it&#x27;s not bad at all for me.</li>
            <li>cord is nice and long on this unit</li>
            <li>If you have trouble with the pain, you can try kind of bouncing it, always being sure to keep it perpendicular to your skin, that way you&#x27;re not getting too much pain in one area at a time.</li>
            <li>i have other these 3 times already the first i loved it</li>
            <li>Kind of a hassle when it comes to traveling as well because the cord is so long.</li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long so I do not need to hover over the outlet.</li>
            <li>It catches even tiny hairs easily and does the job much more quickly than my old epilator.</li>
            <li>this product did not remove hair well, at all despite its high rating and overall good reviews, it works as well as most 1 star rated objects, this item barley removes any hair at all and when it does it breaks off and is no different than shaving.</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>The little tweezer blades holds the hair and pulls out from the root, which is always best as it causes the hair to grow back thinner.</li>
            <li>It works great for my arms but is a little much for my face.</li>
            <li>You will probably want to do this on a day you aren&#x27;t showing off the area you are epilating because it WILL have little red polka dots from the irritation of hair being taken out.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely WONDERFUL product.</li>
            <li>It saves me time and injury, it is easily transportable,not dangerous for children, and it is very effective!</li>
            <li>Not very painful, just on armpits and bikini  </li>
            <li>Overall for the price and as a beginner with epilation its a good investment hairs take significantly longer to grow back then they do withat shaving/creams overy time</li>
            <li>I originally started looking at the more expensive ones, but decided on this one because of the good reviews and the cost.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said I have tried other epilators and this one seemed to work great in very sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>but people were right after the first tjme</li>
            <li>the bright side, I am now noticing much less hair growth than before.</li>
            <li>Just try it a few different ways and see what works best for you and your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>*much* longer, with quick repeated uses here and there maintaining a hairless look indefinitely.</li>
            <li>The head is very efficient and works quickly, which minimizes pain.  </li>
            <li>It is also great in removing the occasional rogue facial hair.</li>
            <li>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t give a product low stars based off the physical pain I experienced, something the product warns about, but I gotta give this a starred rating, in addition to this comment though I will talk about the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i wasnt sure if i would like them and didnt want to waste money on a product i wasnt sure about</li>
            <li>I like it, it removes hair very quick, so soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, I liked my initial results so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, I liked my initial results so much</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied,removes hair quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>My skin is not sensitive and I would say that I can tolerate a good amount of irritants before turning red on me and such, and also my level of pain tolerance is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product and it&#x27;s well work sticking through the initial pain to get great results.</li>
            <li>I bought an Emjoi for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;It was a superior</li>
            <li>I do use an alcohol free, fragrance free witch hazel afterwards and then for several nights</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price though, most of the hair takes weeks to grow back!</li>
            <li>it hurts more than others like around the bottom of my legs near my ankle really hurt when using this</li>
            <li>Also I am happy that it can be plug and used whenever I need, the time I need unlike the cordless models that you always have to remember to charge, the battery last 40 minutes only.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very nervous about using it in more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>My wife says not as good as the Braun she previously had.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>If your a wussy you definitely won&#x27;t be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;First time use is a lot more harsh than anytime after that</li>
            <li>I only use it in the bikini area or armpits when I feel brave enough.</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants to know, I am an African-American female on a quest to find a mechanical contraption or formula that will remove body hair effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Not sure there are any epilators like that, but it would be very nice.</li>
            <li>at first i thought it is good to use it down there and arm pits</li>
            <li>I expected pain, pain and more pain!</li>
            <li>, this thing does successfully remove hair as intended, but it&#x27;s more painful than waxing and a million times more time consuming.</li>
            <li>As far as this machine working for plucking hairs:  it works pretty good even though you have to run over an area several times to get all the hairs.  </li>
            <li>It feels as good as waxing, but without the mess or going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Seeing as she has had two children by C-section and two abdominal surgeries she ought to be able to deal with the initial pain easily, right?</li>
            <li>it is wonderful and easy I used to have other similar but the results was not the same.....</li>
            <li>and she likes it very much.  </li>
            <li>the price was also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>also it is very fast: today I epilated both of my legs in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now I have to hold the cord at a very precise angle to get it to work, and even then it&#x27;s only intermittently functional.</li>
            <li>Additionally, my legs still feel very very sightly stubbly since the tiniest of hairs did not come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this would hurt so very much.</li>
            <li>I have and continue to recommend this product very highly!</li>
            <li>I think I am going to like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I like how it has two speed settings as well, although I&#x27;ve gotten used to the highest setting now and don&#x27;t have to use the lower one very much anymore.</li>
            <li>: Very fast.</li>
            <li>The way I see it there are four options: Shaving (cheap and quick but stubble and ingrown hairs), depilatory creams (only moderately effective and can cause chemical burns to sensitive areas), waxing (various types with painful but effective results - works best with someone else doing the \\&quot;ripping\\&quot;) and</li>
            <li>but my leg hairs are really fine and soft.</li>
            <li>I usually use wax but this epilator is faster to use and leaves the skin smooth for about three weeks, so I love it!</li>
            <li>I had bought other that really worked good.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try a new method of hair removal.</li>
            <li>It did hurt very much the first time</li>
            <li>It works great and hardly feel any sort of pain.</li>
            <li>so he left me be with my new favorite gadget!</li>
            <li>This has been my first epilator, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li>and it still works pretty well.</li>
            <li>(THE HEAD CLICKS OFF).&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have a better grip on shorter hair because it doesn&#x27;t have the double tweezing</li>
            <li>looked at others that pull the same length of hair, there is no reason to pay more for an Epilator if they are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty time consuming.</li>
            <li>At first there was still a stubble but just keeping at it, over time there isn&#x27;t anymore stubble.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure it was scratching my skin, but it was just the pain of several hairs being pulled out at the root.</li>
            <li>This is actually my first epilator</li>
            <li>Bought it for my wife recently and after many apprehensions, she decided to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everywhere is so much smoother looking!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li>It sounds exactly like how I imagined the maw to Hell itself sounding.</li>
            <li>I will just spend more next time.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>used some Veet wax strips first so trim my underarm hoping to reduce pain during my epilation process.</li>
            <li>I regularly use tweezers and many types of shavers on my body with zero problems.  </li>
            <li>I thought my skin was pretty well conditioned to this sort of thing.  </li>
            <li>My first epilator.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I have ever bought</li>
            <li>It hurts a bit the first couple of times but you get used to it</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator that I have used, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>It hurts like a mother on the first session</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than constantly gashing my legs with  a razor.</li>
            <li>Its my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>The first thing I&#x27;ll say is that this thing works.</li>
            <li>The longer the hair, the more times this gadget will pull, tug, and jump before finally pulling the hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried a step up because I am not going back to shaving now.</li>
            <li>Before we bought this epilator, I read so many reviews and compared different brands and style.</li>
            <li>It works really well!  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>(literally, I rubbed the area I was working on with a cloth to help open up the pores and desensitise my skin), but I was able to do all of both legs, as well as my underarms</li>
            <li>first I wished it was battery-operated.</li>
            <li>turning on the epilator, it sounds intimidating, but I found that while I was using it, I didn&#x27;t notice sound at all, and it didn&#x27;t seem loud to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe the flatter hairs here meant that some tugs of pain were the hair not quite being removed the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked pretty hairfree for over a month or two now, and it&#x27;s been with almost no care or effort on my part.</li>
            <li>, it works, it&#x27;s pretty, convenient, made well, durable, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>So much faster than waxing!</li>
            <li>so I tried taking a hot bath (soaking my body plus underarms) to soften the area</li>
            <li>Wish I bought more than one, so as to hang on to it for future need.</li>
            <li>More so than I anticipated for chin and upper lip areas.</li>
            <li>I know that the hair may return at a later date, but I&#x27;m sure it will be slower returning.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need practice with it, but I had higher hopes for it.</li>
            <li>This is the best the first time I use it was scary but after my skin get use to , now I will never shave again besti thing ever , and fast shipment !</li>
            <li>It does the job, (even more efficiently if the guard is removed), and it was only about $25.</li>
            <li>First time using an epilator.</li>
            <li>My husband walked in on me while I was using it for the first time and saw how giddy I was</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying an epilator, however, I have tried at home waxing.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE KEY - Put on some music or a tv show to distract yourself  After finding these tricks, I was able to get through both legs.</li>
            <li>Enchanted, I continued to wave this magical device over my lower limbs, waiting to see if the pain might be any different if I kept on going, or if it was just going to continue on.</li>
            <li>you, but more than silky enough.</li>
            <li>Like the slap of a burning hot rubber band,my &#x27;stache was GONE.</li>
            <li>My emjoi cost me close to 100 bucks, as this one which works way better only cost my around $30.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This unit only comes with a power cord that is quite long, which is great.</li>
            <li>I do not care if it can be used in the shower or have all sorts of extra fancy parts that also comes with appropriate amount of</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>But if you WAX FIRST...</li>
            <li>My first epilator.</li>
            <li>quite reasonable price, get it!</li>
            <li>Taking a hot bath and then using does help, reducing the pain just a notch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was surprised my legs didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as if they had just been shaved.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>But I did use the guard cap the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>So, a week later I tried it without the guard cap and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>No noticeable hair is &amp;#34;plucked&amp;#34; with the first pass.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator that I have used before.</li>
            <li>I will admit, it does hurt a lot when you first use it.</li>
            <li>In a whole month!</li>
            <li>the epilator yanks all of the hair it can grab, so what grows back is thinner and more sparse.</li>
            <li>Santinelle was the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 10 years but got burnt in a trip to Europe since I forgot and plugged it in a 220v outlet...</li>
            <li>This epilator is my first</li>
            <li>It gets better with regular use.</li>
            <li>After DECADES of plucking, waxing, and shaving, I have finally found my magic solution.  </li>
            <li>and I love the 2 different speeds.</li>
            <li>this is my first epilator</li>
            <li>Be ready for the pain!</li>
            <li>wish I had returned it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked great for my fingers where the hairs are thinner and slow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has two speeds on it, one for finer hair and a faster setting for more coarse</li>
            <li>Despite the low price tag, I was expecting much better results from a Philips brand product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s efficient and while it doesn&#x27;t alleviate the pain of pulling out your short and curlies, it is more efficient than plucking.</li>
            <li>the first used.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;They say do this after a hot shower/bath.</li>
            <li>definitely have to go over areas more than once.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I got my first one (an Epilady) from groupon and didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>I think the epilday actually works a bit better.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>It works, but it does hurt at first.....</li>
            <li>Thanks, Philips!</li>
            <li>so I use it first</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to try emulation read up on it first.</li>
            <li>First, all the reviewers who said it HURTS are not lying.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hurt.this my first shaver</li>
            <li>Its my first one</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It hurts the first time you use it (just use a numbing cream if you want)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m willing to endure it&amp;#34</li>
            <li>recommend to anyone who wants to get rid of hair!</li>
            <li>The product comes with a guard which I tried to use at first</li>
            <li>I am always in a pretty hairy situation--I shave my legs in the morning and by the time that I get home in the evening, I already have a shadow on my legs.</li>
            <li>so the pain threashold is higher.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product, I have not worn long pants since purchasing this.</li>
            <li>My first epilator machine and it  does take some getting used to, it does hurt a bit.</li>
            <li>I used to spend so much money on waxing, not to mention time on DIY products, and the after tweezing!</li>
            <li>I used it for exactly 6 months and 20 days and it is giving me nerves.</li>
            <li>On first use it did hurt.</li>
            <li>When I first started epilating, it hurt like a MothaF.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get used to it after using it the first time.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I ever bought.</li>
            <li>Hurt like the dickens the first couple times, then no problem at all.</li>
            <li>I love the epilator and won&#x27;t go back to shaving, ever!</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I have ever owned or tried to use.</li>
            <li>but this product is much better because remove even very short hair</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was my first time using an epilator after years of shaving,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy something more specific to my needs.</li>
            <li>But I only bought it 6 months ago and didn&#x27;t even use it more than once a week</li>
            <li>This epilator may be small but it sure is mighty!  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>I have to go in many different directions to get the hair.</li>
            <li>First of all, I would like to point out that the photo of the woman using the epilator as if it is a cordless tool is misleading.  </li>
            <li>I was so ready for this to be my &amp;#34;aha!</li>
            <li>I bought an emjoy for more than double the price on QVC.</li>
            <li>at first I was sacred to get it</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was going to hurt, but turns out that it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use epilator.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>For the price, this is a pretty nifty tool if you&#x27;re wolly like me.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user of any epilator.</li>
            <li>Before, I used to do get hot wax done on my legs.</li>
            <li>like I did the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever used an epilator</li>
            <li>(atleast for a first time user).</li>
            <li>I find that it works a lot better on thicker hair (such as underarms or bikini area)</li>
            <li>It hurts more on the face, the tummy, and especially the bikini area, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.  </li>
            <li>I tried it first with the safety cap and started along my jawline.</li>
            <li>But as I moved along I could handle it pretty well.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s Many different  ones  </li>
            <li>pinches at first.</li>
            <li>My bony knee caps were challenging with the Emjoi, requiring multiple passes.</li>
            <li>#34;plucked&amp;#34; with the first pass</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i am a first time</li>
            <li>Overall was pleased.</li>
            <li>buy if you have a higher pain tolerance adn</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re willing to spend three hours removing your hair.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>first recommendation is this: WAX YOUR LEGS BEFORE YOU USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Never going back :)</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose very well too!</li>
            <li>Pretty noisy</li>
            <li>I tried it on my pits first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#2 take a hot shower and exfoliate&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first time epilating body hair.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, so was a tad nervous about using it after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>The instructions would be better for some if they had a picture showing angle placement they are describing (sometimes a lot of words get in the way of the visual).  </li>
            <li>Hair&amp;#34;-)</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>is that my skin is still kinda irritated on the next day whereas I thought it was going to be okay, but it&#x27;s not something so noticeable.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with my purchase and hope to take advantage of it for a long time.</li>
            <li>and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator ever.</li>
            <li>When you first use this it feels like you are burning your leg with a lighter.</li>
            <li>I was also hesitant at first, but then decided to test that area</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>and I absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence about purchasing an epilator you should try this one before you go and pay way more for something that will work the same.</li>
            <li>it really works under my arms!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an epilator.  </li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess you aren&#x27;t a really women until you have epilated your armpits!  </li>
            <li>Some people love these things, but if you&#x27;re like be and shaving gives you ingrown hairs too, this will just do the same.</li>
            <li>I did use it on my legs but it seemed to take longer than just shaving first then using this to supplement in between.  </li>
            <li>First of all I read mostly all the reviews i could possibly read.</li>
            <li>And you get used to the pulling after the first 10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>Watch videos on youtube about how to do it and read the instructions that come with it, remember the longer the hair is the more it hurts, but too short</li>
            <li>First problem was that it didn&#x27;t contain the head cleaning brush that it was supposed to .  </li>
            <li>it hurt quite a bit at first but after a minute or two I didn&#x27;t feel it at all.  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>The first time you use it you are pulling ALL the hair at once.</li>
            <li>Okay this is my third update</li>
            <li>But I will most definitely be returning this.</li>
            <li>watched a handful of tutorials on epilating before and during use to make sure I was doing it properly.</li>
            <li>I have a higher pain tolerance than some</li>
            <li>and it does exactly what I need it to do ...</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never epilated before and what everyone says about it hurting at first</li>
            <li>I used it without the guard like the 3rd time I picked it up and got way better results.</li>
            <li>and it just may not be the right length at a certain spot.</li>
            <li>after several sessions, my calves stayed smooth for quite a while!</li>
            <li>a first time epilator user, but</li>
            <li>Be aware that you must be plugged in to an outlet for this to work.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The first one I got had a faulty part and stopped working after 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It hurt for me ALOT and decided to do waxing first, as others had recommended.</li>
            <li>you so much!</li>
            <li>it took me forever to do the first because of the pain.</li>
            <li>I got my first epilator</li>
            <li>I have been waxing and am so glad I finally tried this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li>Gets the job done, which is better than manually plucking individual hairs &amp; shaving.</li>
            <li>but it its rather noisy which made me hesitant to use it at first.</li>
            <li>It definitely hurts at first, but you get used to it the more you use it.</li>
            <li>I epilated my arm pits first.</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I wish I would have returned this after I used it the first time.</li>
            <li>Does its job really well!</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator after years of waxing, both at home and at salons.</li>
            <li>When I shave, though my legs are 95% smooth directly after, I will have noticable stubble within 12 hours.</li>
            <li>For the first month, I probably used it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the first month I don&#x27;t even use it once a week.</li>
            <li>I had an Emjoi in the same price range before and this Satinelle epilator is a much better product.</li>
            <li>My last epilator would break many of the hairs and leave the root.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the epilator it hurt quite a bit</li>
            <li>I used this over 3 weeks ago (I did shave the &amp;#34;leftovers in between&amp;#34;) and</li>
            <li>Pretty noisy</li>
            <li>The Braun was my first epilator, and it routinely took me up to an hour to use it on both of my legs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s faster and more thorough than more expensive products with more tweezers, but it is.  </li>
            <li>So I must tell you that the first time i used it I had not shaved my legs for about 5-7 days.</li>
            <li>Absolutely!  </li>
            <li>I went to do my left leg, and it hurt quite a bit more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad my last one broke...!</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Came fast!</li>
            <li>The product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this stuff works very well!</li>
            <li>Must buy for those pretty ladies with man hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using an epilator.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>Happy with it and cord is long enough.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll know exactly what this feels like.</li>
            <li>that was pretty painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epilator.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Braun:  This was the first one I used...</li>
            <li>After I used it the first time, I vowed that I would never epilate again....</li>
            <li>I tried it on my arms first</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, if you think you&#x27;re an expert as a first time user</li>
            <li>My first time using this on my legs</li>
            <li>It will sting the first time or two.</li>
            <li>I was scared of this at first</li>
            <li>Have to run the Philips over the area more to get the same results.</li>
            <li>but I imagine it&#x27;s probably the same with most epilators.</li>
            <li>so I assume it works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>My first epilator.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator experience ever</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife, she loves it, does without say that it&#x27;s not painfree, but according to her, it&#x27;s pretty endurable.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve done nearly my whole body at this point (1 week of use)!</li>
            <li>The size of this may be ok for a smaller person</li>
            <li>Try waxing first</li>
            <li>I do get plenty of ingrown hairs which I have to pluck out with a tweezer as well, even though I exfoliate consistently with exfoliating gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>Definitely got most of the medium-textured hair on my calves.</li>
            <li>Shaving was no longer necessary for the most part.</li>
            <li>I bought this epilator thinking I&#x27;d be able to use it only on my legs.</li>
            <li>Doing your legs may be an all night process your first time.</li>
            <li>A six pack of razors costs just as much!  </li>
            <li>First time user</li>
            <li>I never have had to shave my legs since getting the first one.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my feet the first day I got it</li>
            <li>and it worked very well!</li>
            <li>It hurts more than waxing, but you&#x27;re paying the same price for a one time waxing when you can use the epilator as often as you like.</li>
            <li>Pain is not an issue with me, since I have epilated for so many years and lasered, but I have to say, this unit actually hurt at times.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m really glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I would upgrade to a better product but get the same brand.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using one of these.</li>
            <li>First off, yes, it f***ing hurt.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I got it</li>
            <li>This is my first time using one if these</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special...use only on legs.</li>
            <li>* the first time,</li>
            <li>First impression...</li>
            <li>I let the hair grow out for a couple days before using it the first time and it had no problem grabbing onto the hairs.  </li>
            <li>so this is my first introduction/purchase of an epilator.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first electronic body shaver</li>
            <li>in the beginning use it in stids don&#x27;t think you can do all the area at once as first.  </li>
            <li>this was my first epilator</li>
            <li>For me, it hurt like the dickens the first time I did it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since done it consistently once a week, and both times after the first it has definitely been more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This does take a bit of time, going over the same area, and hasn&#x27;t quite succeeded in getting all hair, although it does get most.  </li>
            <li>first pass did miss some spots, so the next day, I laid a towel out in a well-lit area to do more cleanup.  </li>
            <li>I wound up doing my arms the second day because I&#x27;m so satisfied with the effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, really satisfied.</li>
            <li>The only way that I wish it could be a bit better is if it got all of the hair on the first</li>
            <li>* the first time I used it-</li>
            <li>I had smooth soft body after using this.</li>
            <li>First I wish it worked after the first time because my girls seem to epilate EVERY DAY NON-STOP.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty intimidated by the tweezers.  </li>
            <li>thanks mom and dad!).  </li>
            <li>So I used for the first time yesterday on my arms, legs and underarm.</li>
            <li>It did hurt at first but after a while I got used to it.</li>
            <li>It took several passes to rid most of my hairs and I feel like I still missed some.</li>
            <li>Overall the product was ok.</li>
            <li>Mys first time trying one of these.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>That being said, it works pretty well and can get the tiniest of hairs.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this Epilator it hurt beyond belief however with a painkiller and</li>
            <li>unfortunately many still left than pulled out.</li>
            <li>This is my first elipator ever</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t buy one of these, I hope you get some comic relief reading my review...</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>I read the instructions first.  </li>
            <li>Did it hurt like a mother and bleed the first time I tackled that area?</li>
            <li>I took Tylenol the first time just in case and that helped.</li>
            <li>I missed the first time.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and there was some pain</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li>Now imagine that sensations but triple (actually has 5 of them) cause this epilator has more the one but again, you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
            <li>to finish off this review, I would like to say that I don&#x27;t regret buying this epilator, though it&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li>My hairs grow back more sparsely than before I began using this epilator.</li>
            <li>and I can torture myself when needed.&lt;br /&gt;#1 have a few good drinks before epolating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an Emjoy epilator for a few years now, and it was really good.</li>
            <li>but you can always put a towel down somewhere more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Since the instructions and most reviewers recommended, I took a quick warm shower and also exfoliated my legs to open up the pores and remove any dead skin so that my leg hairs would be easier to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this new one and of course works better than my old one...</li>
            <li>It works very well but not so good as my previous one (Braun).</li>
            <li>Right now it&#x27;s sitting in my closet til I find someone who wants to try it.</li>
            <li>gave this product four stars because, after having this product for about a month now, I noticed that you have to wait for leg hairs to grow a certain length before you can epilate again because if its too short the tweezers on the epilator often times won&#x27;t be able to grasp the shorter hairs.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if I tried another higher quality epilator, it would actually produce smooth legs to make it worth the pain and time, but I&#x27;m not even going to bother.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than my own stupidity, this thing does a pretty good job of ripping the hairs out of my legs.</li>
            <li>I had not used an epilator since the original epilady in the early &#x27;90s.</li>
            <li>It is pretty loud, but i feel like most epilators will be loud.</li>
            <li>Warning to those who have never done it: The first time you will be mostly saying &amp;#34;Mommy!&amp;#34; or some such expletive the whole time.  </li>
            <li>and im honestly kinda nervous to do the other...</li>
            <li>Is using this epilator more enjoyable after a glass of wine and NSAID of your choice, at least at first?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is by far the best thirty dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent on hair removal and in the long run</li>
            <li>It works perfectly if you use it on the opposite direction where your hair grows,  but, sometimes that is hard to do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what percentage of my hairs were ripped vs. pulled out successfully.</li>
            <li>You might have to go over your leg twice at most, but it really does snag any hair you move it over AS LONG AS IT&#x27;S THE RIGHT DIRECTION.</li>
            <li>very handy to have when traveling and not able to go to the salon to wax!</li>
            <li>I think this is only good for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>i cannot use it on those areas any more because it is not accurate and i never get a smooth feel.</li>
            <li>The epilator head doesn&#x27;t pick up hair quickly; I need to glide over a particular area a couple of times to remove all the hair while keeping the movement very slow.&lt;br /&gt;b)</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable but good quality basic epilator.</li>
            <li>I have used it a lot; however, it may still be a good choice for someone who uses it moderately, seeing as the price has dropped further since I bought it.</li>
            <li>As good as your going to get just just short of actually shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved epilators as they are not as messy as wax and as a result a much faster experience.</li>
            <li>and it is removing hair very efficiently, no need to go many times on the same area.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than getting waxed once a month, and most of all, you can do it when you want and in private.</li>
            <li>I was going to dinner with my Aunt and cousins, so I only had time to do one leg before I left, which I felt would be a good trial run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite as confident about it auto-stopping if it picks up some skin by accident (which all epilators tend to do in more delicate spots).</li>
            <li>I tried a friend&#x27;s 25 year old epilator several times to see if I liked using an epilator.</li>
            <li>the hairs on my leg are so much thinner and takes about a week or 2 to grow back :)</li>
            <li>I heard a lot of good things about epilators, and decided to give one a try as the hair removal is supposed to last a big longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>The way it&#x27;s head is designed provides really smooth result very fast without pulling your machine back and fourth many times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well, very fast as I said and seems to get the job done in a shorter time period as I did not expect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting I have a mildly high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>It is amazing product,  cheap, clean, easy and most important less painful....</li>
            <li>over 300 positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Based on a percent of positive feedbacks and price</li>
            <li>The positive part for it is that you won&#x27;t feel hurt when you shave.</li>
            <li>Works great on thin hair, but not so great on thick hair.</li>
            <li>This product seems much more effective at removing the hair although in my opinion it is more painful.</li>
            <li>With this epilator takes as long as a razer but removing most of the hair from root.</li>
            <li>Your first time: So upon tibial touchdown, I felt an electrifying jolt of pain - much like that of a thousand hairs being torn from their follicles all at once.</li>
            <li>First epilator I&#x27;ve tried since the 80s, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t want to wait until my leg hair is as long as his just to see if it works better.</li>
            <li>It really, really does at first, and in some spots, like the front of my legs, you just have to power through it.  </li>
            <li>I applied baby powder before using the epilator and made sure the skin was stretched and taut.</li>
            <li>Did I mention how much this hurt, the first time?</li>
            <li>Nothing that you can&#x27;t tolerate, unless you are a real crybaby ;)</li>
            <li>It arrived pretty fast too</li>
            <li>This is the first corded, real epilator I have ever had</li>
            <li>Other than that it works very well with or without the shield and is effective.</li>
            <li>You can plug it in pretty much in all countries since the input is from 100v to 240v .</li>
            <li>It really hurt when I used it on my lip at first</li>
            <li>I have wookie legs and when I first bought this,  it hurt too much to bear using it.  </li>
            <li>By that time, it had hurt for so long that I couldn&#x27;t take any more.</li>
            <li>The price is great compared to other models I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon and overall</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first epilator, so I may be expecting too much, but i feel like it often doesn&#x27;t pull out from the root, rather snaps the hair.</li>
            <li>First i wanna say this epilator does what its supposed to i recommend it, although i did my leg very thoroughly</li>
            <li>It removes all the hair on the first try, so it makes the work so much faster.</li>
            <li>Also, the first time I epilated my armpits hurt so much tears poured out of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Also, the first time I epilated my armpits hurt so much tears poured out of my eyes.</li>
            <li>It does hurt but it&#x27;s a lot better than waxing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had ir for long, so I can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I want and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I use it to remove hair pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s pretty much how epilation goes anywhere</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair on my legs and it required many passes to completely remove the hair, but rarely the hair broke.</li>
            <li>I like how the product is small and nifty and does a good job.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s not bad though, I guess.</li>
            <li>good job of cleaning up small hairs</li>
            <li>will definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to have a good epilator who does its job properly.</li>
            <li>and I think the results are every bit as good as my usual waxing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, many days later, my half-finished legs are serving as a live before-and-after shot!</li>
            <li>And I know that as you continue to rip the hair out from the root, it stops growing less and less, which is great news for me!</li>
            <li>I only epilated the main triangle, doing most of the visible hair-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had hairless legs, underarms, and most of my bikini line (this area in particular requires quite a bit of finesse) for the last three weeks</li>
            <li>It can get really short hairs and it works super quickly.</li>
            <li>Had a harder time with the very fine hair on my thighs and arms.</li>
            <li>My underarms are a bit more sensitive, but I can do them both in one sitting without any major discomfort.    </li>
            <li>am still not convinced that I let my leg hair grow long enough for this to be super effective, so I will keep trying.  </li>
            <li>Yep, first time hurt like heck, however every time afterwards is easy as shaving with much longer lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It most definitely did not do a great job, and was more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li>when I can take more &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; I put it on high, and when I am in a wimpy mood I put it on low.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend taking a hot shower before epilating, and exfoliating while taking said hot shower.</li>
            <li>She has a very old coil-style Epilady device which still works fine but is more or less torture to use on longer, thicker hair.</li>
            <li>This was my first time epilating, so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other epilators, but I have to say I&#x27;m not too impressed with the experience.  </li>
            <li>but the following times I used this thing.. really not painful at all!</li>
            <li>If I am careful to keep my skin taught by raising my arm and using my other hand to increase the tautness I have been able to effectively use it under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I love this one more than my other because it is shaped kind of flat, not fat or chunky like my other epilator, and also very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Still, it was easy to go slowly (left the efficiency cap off) and I tried to keep the skin taunt in one direction or another.</li>
            <li>It is an electric tweezer and as such pulls longer hairs out rather easily.</li>
            <li>After that first rough week, it&#x27;s been much better.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s easy to use on the legs.</li>
            <li>Only downfall is the head pops off easily if dropped.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that I finally found an epilator that simply does what it&#x27;s been designed to do.</li>
            <li>It is super loud.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t subject myself to that kind of torture to my underarms or bikini area</li>
            <li>Any future hair growth, which will occur, is easily attacked and solved.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also use washcloths in the shower that aren&#x27;t super soft, so they help exfoliate and keep me from getting ingrown</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is dry.</li>
            <li>This might take longer but the results last longer and he&#x27;s easy to do.</li>
            <li>Now I only need to use the epilator twice a month,pain free, and I can wear shorts for weeks straight without needing to worry!</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions and use after a shower with your skin dry.</li>
            <li>You can epilate after a shower but make sure your legs/arms/armpits are dry before epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves hairs on the legs and isn&#x27;t strong enough for the bikini.</li>
            <li>The first few times it worked liked a charm.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t unusually loud, had a nice long cord...</li>
            <li>so I do t have to worry about having a good charge, the cord has been long enough for me to work with</li>
            <li>My previous one was one of those fancy ones with hundred of little things and so perfect in grabbing the hair that sometimes grab the skin too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as silk epil epilator, it&#x27;s very weak and doesn&#x27;t get the hair out easily.</li>
            <li>I have reviewed the cordless ones and most run about 40 minutes on a single charge.</li>
            <li>It gets three stars because it hurts when the hair is pulled and doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, but gets most.</li>
            <li>It certainly pulls the hairs out -</li>
            <li>It is like a large tweezer, so if u can&#x27;t stand the pain of tweeting or waxing, then stick to the razor.</li>
            <li>, I have waxed, I have a large tattoo on my rib cage.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on certain areas of the body because it rips hair out by the root, but I do my legs and underarms with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that I followed the directions well.</li>
            <li>then I would certainly give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works, but the problem is that I have to wait until the hair grows to a certain size, so I can remove them.</li>
            <li>and I certainly don&#x27;t want any strays.</li>
            <li>Certainly something you have to get use to.</li>
            <li>After 3 months of use it gets disconnected in certain angles when i move it.</li>
            <li>I may have to get a little waxing for the very sensitive area but the rest is all good.</li>
            <li>so in long time it&#x27;s more cheap than using wax, and is totally convenient</li>
            <li>but it is mighty and pretty fast which is crucial for getting the job done.</li>
            <li>Have had for a few weeks and misses more hair than it pulls out!</li>
            <li>The price is right, and the pain is not bad enough to stop me from using it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use... &amp; worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>maybe I have super roots on my hair, but no results worth mentioning, unless you could the tiny swatch of tissue that was whisked away...</li>
            <li>I mean, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t agony either.</li>
            <li>underarms certainly hurt quite a bit, but if you&#x27;re used to the pain of waxing your upper thighs or your bikini line, you should be fine with the pain.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, but be careful to use it correctly to avoid as much ingrown hairs as possible!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a lot better for fine hair, since it easily removed longer, finer hairs but not my short thick hairs.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, it does what it says it will do and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This one is probably my favorite because it is so much faster than the single barrel ones.  </li>
            <li>Armpits are a very tender area when you are pulling hairs, so the first couple of times, it might bring a few tears to your eyes, but it is soooooo worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>cord is nice and long, so you don&#x27;t have to sit right next to an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the guard for the first several times, but found that it helped me learn how to hold the machine, and by the third or fourth time using it, I was able to remove it and it worked even better.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull out the fine or short hairs.</li>
            <li>(I cleaned it and tried it on my upper lip which also has fine hairs</li>
            <li>but with this epilator I am fine for 3 entire weeks!</li>
            <li>even if i forget the stubble is usually fine enough to ignore.  </li>
            <li>But when it&#x27;s all fine, it&#x27;s like pulling a regular head hair out of your head.</li>
            <li>I do have to go over each section several times, but it gets the job fine</li>
            <li>My lower legs are kinda coarse, but my thighs and body are fine.</li>
            <li>I would recommend shaving 2-3 days before you epilate and make sure your underarms are dry!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work so well for the upper lip, but seems fine for underarms too.</li>
            <li>Fine, medium, coarse hairs...</li>
            <li>There were some that were blonde &amp; fine and some that were course and darker.  </li>
            <li>The only place that it caused irritation was my bikini line, everywhere else was fine.</li>
            <li>The hair on my legs is mostly fine except coarse hair towards the bottom of my calves.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this epilator for fine Asian hair.</li>
            <li>Used it on my legs, which have fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I have always used epilators (24 years to be exact, started when I was 14) never once a razor and let me just day that this particular one did not the job.</li>
            <li>Actually your lucky if it ever does!</li>
            <li>and it seems to work pretty decently.</li>
            <li>If you have patience and a very high tolerance for pain, get it.</li>
            <li>I say this as someone that has a very, very high pain tolerance (giving birth, tattoos, didn&#x27;t bother me).  </li>
            <li>It was good for getting majority of my fine hair (I have very fine hair on my legs) but still left quite a few for plucking with tweezers or just plain shaving (which defeats the purpose for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I call this little thing amazing.</li>
            <li>and to top it off, it&#x27;s LOUD LOUD LOUD!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already loving this little guy.</li>
            <li>Works very well and gets rid of fine and coarse hairs alike.</li>
            <li>This does seem relatively low pain - on the legs where my hair is relatively fine, no worse than trying to shave with a scratchy razor.  </li>
            <li>I have a high pain tolerance so this is not uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll dip the toothbrush in alcohol first and then turn it to high to get the excess off.</li>
            <li>i have very thick hair on my legs and happy trail and also my armpits</li>
            <li>I tested a little area, that I will continue later on tomorrow, on my legs, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>(in the long run, especially) ° Lets you de-hair pretty much any time and anywhere ° Super easy cleanup ° Very reasonable price °</li>
            <li>Though the sensation is uncomfortable when I epilate my under arms, the epilator work very good and for the price I really recommend it</li>
            <li>Not only is it super fast and easy, but I use it from the neck down and it feels like having baby smooth skin naturally for weeks!!!</li>
            <li>The only thing really positive I can say about this epilator is the regrowth does feel significantly softer than after shaving, though I don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li>Fast response, fast shipping, high quality!</li>
            <li>The result was the same in all areas, smooth for a day or two, and then two weeks of intense itching and ingrow hairs.</li>
            <li>I can use it on my armpits, and a week later, they are still smooth as can be.  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really even use it anymore.</li>
            <li>Much easier than manual plucking.</li>
            <li>It removes all the hairs straight from the root.  </li>
            <li>It really helped.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this product and will continue using it.  </li>
            <li>Now it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than waxing.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and was feeling very optimistic about using it.</li>
            <li>I think that the hair has to be much longer than the instructions call</li>
            <li>thanks Philips...</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li>It is much much louder then some.</li>
            <li>Legs hurt so much for 3 days that rubbing them against the blanket hurt.</li>
            <li>And hair growes thinner and not as much.</li>
            <li>You ready for pain?  </li>
            <li>A bit noise but fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It does its job really well.</li>
            <li>and I did really like the results.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Doing my legs really didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t finish a whole leg.</li>
            <li>When you get used to these methods of hair removal, they don&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>Cordless product would be much nicer than this one.</li>
            <li>Mine doesn&#x27;t hurt--but that&#x27;s because it isn&#x27;t pulling hairs out really...</li>
            <li>Also does not get as much.</li>
            <li>I much much prefer the Emjoi Emagine Dual 72 tweezer.</li>
            <li>Once I thought to tweeze around the bikini line and after an hour I hadn&#x27;t accomplished much and gave up.</li>
            <li>machine works very well</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t seem to matter much except one is faster</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really see what you are doing, even using a mirror.</li>
            <li>Having sweat glands there also meant that moving the epilator smoothly over the skin was not really possible because it kept sticking to the skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing hurt overmuch- not as much as the ankle area of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The hair is much denser there, and doesn&#x27;t grow quite as fast as my underarms.</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Left me feeling totally smooth.</li>
            <li>but the results are so much longer.</li>
            <li>I had never tried waxing but really wanted to and while looking up waxes, I came across epilators.</li>
            <li>but it absolutely does the job.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt that much, but it also doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.  </li>
            <li>It removed all the hair off my legs and arms and left a smooth silky skin.  </li>
            <li>It hurts no worse than tweezing.</li>
            <li>Are you a real woman?</li>
            <li>Then you are ready for this product.</li>
            <li>It can be used for the legs, arms, bikini line, underarms, anywhere really.</li>
            <li>i like it so much.</li>
            <li>really help me a lot.</li>
            <li>the up side, it does seem to work under my arms on THICKER hair very well.</li>
            <li>Shipment was really fast</li>
            <li>Does its job very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product</li>
            <li>It takes me quite a while to do my legs with this, but it lasts much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>although noise level was mentioned In did not find it unusually noisy.  </li>
            <li>Instead I really wanted to go and shave because my legs felt so prickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m very prone to ingrown hair and epilators</li>
            <li>This one pulls the hairs out quite well and works anywhere on the body one wants to remove hair.</li>
            <li>but it hurts more than expected.</li>
            <li>is that you save so much money of waxing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And there in no bag to carry it, what would be very practical.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny and light.</li>
            <li>so really now.</li>
            <li>be ready to deal with ingrowns and exfoliate often.</li>
            <li>the epilator  works really well</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s not as much hair to rip out</li>
            <li>If you can handle it, go for it, me, not so much.</li>
            <li>Razors would irritate my underarm so much that it would sting to put on deoderant.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m much faster at shaving.</li>
            <li>should maybe also mention that I suffer from chronic migraines, so the pain was relatively very manageable in my case.</li>
            <li>and fast I&#x27;ll try it again one day maybe after a couple drinks ouch</li>
            <li>I use Witch Hazel afterward to soothe the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be gross, but if you use this in your butt crack, make sure you ALWAYS keep it (the machine AND your butt crack) clean and dry or</li>
            <li>The cord on the Braun is MUCH longer.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely ridiculous!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My legs feel almost swollen and very agitated.</li>
            <li>It seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>This has really helped with the ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>I ended up returning it, as I still had to shave and there didn&#x27;t seem to be much point.</li>
            <li>It is still somewhat painful to use this, but so far this has the most effective result, satisfied.</li>
            <li>Where they used to be feels like a baby&#x27;s ass, which is very convenient cuz</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>but it was too lengthy and wasn&#x27;t really convenient.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much louder than you would expect a machine of that size to be.</li>
            <li>I really like the Satinelle</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this epilator.</li>
            <li>I used it on a Wednesday and a week later my legs are still smooth.</li>
            <li>back)This is much safer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i don&#x27; use it very often</li>
            <li>but  absolutely tolerable</li>
            <li>Waxing removes a section of hair all at once, whereas an epilator removes the hair one at a time from the root at a fast speed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  </li>
            <li>No one wants to use it.</li>
            <li>Works perfactly and removes hair without much pain.</li>
            <li>Clearly you need to build up a tolerance to using an epilator, I used one many years ago, different style, so I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>I skipped two days shaving and the hair I was getting looked like I had gone a whole winter.</li>
            <li>So I read the reviews , which were very helpful ,ordered  it  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all on legs, but I try to use this on my underarms too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been going too fast and the hairs just end up breaking</li>
            <li>And nobody wants ingrown</li>
            <li>It works but it doesnt really shave all the hair</li>
            <li>Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>if you can handle that much pain do it if not use something else.</li>
            <li>I really like these epilators.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>fast on time  </li>
            <li>Its very nice.easy to use...</li>
            <li>so it really stings and</li>
            <li>But, while to stay smooth I have to shave daily, with this</li>
            <li>This really does remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I do prefer epilation to shaving my arms and legs, as it leaves my skin much smoother</li>
            <li>Very reliable.</li>
            <li>However, now that I have had some practice and getting used to it, the pain really isn&#x27;t noticeable.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It does work very well at removing all the hair.</li>
            <li>it hurted my arms really bad&amp;#62; I was reluctant to re order another one</li>
            <li>I spent hours using this device and found it to be inefficient at removing most of my hairs.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s functional, it really does the job...</li>
            <li>So I ended up just being hairy all the time because who wants to plan a &amp;#34;waxing my f-ing legs&amp;#34; night.</li>
            <li>However, this devices still make too much noise.</li>
            <li>I have much hair growth on my legs.</li>
            <li>So after waxing, within 3 weeks hair will start to be very visible.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient device.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do much anyway.  </li>
            <li>I tried all of the remedies above but never achieved smooth, hair-free results...</li>
            <li>Have smoother skin thanks to.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a really person  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t remove hair very well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look or feel like ingrown hairs, but something really got irritated.</li>
            <li>Does really well to remove hairs from my legs.</li>
            <li>It really helps the epilator not hurt your skin while you epilate.</li>
            <li>Epilate very well</li>
            <li>really hurting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Epilating lasts much longer, with</li>
            <li>Very affordable epilator that does the job</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li>but Phillips wants her to pay for shipping, she might have to go see a dermatologist over this.</li>
            <li>but then it doesn&#x27;t really hurt.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Good in that you have more range, but bad in that It can get kind of tangled up if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li>Well it does plucks your hair, it really does.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My leg hair used to grow really fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and i didn&#x27;t experience any problems from this company.</li>
            <li>It really pulls when you try to get rid of some hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is much smoother and my husband also notices and conpliments me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As you probably guessed, it is not entirely pain free since it pulls the hair from the roots.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t find it to be too much to handle.</li>
            <li>process is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>For what I would have paid for two professional waxings, I bought this epilator instead and in my opinion, from a &#x27;hairy chick&#x27;, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>This one works ok, but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li>works really well, and it is a very practical</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if the epilation lasts &amp;#34;for weeks&amp;#34;.]</li>
            <li>The pain is real though.</li>
            <li>and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>My daughter said it hurts for a bit but works really well.</li>
            <li>I should have used Philips epilators from the get go instead of using Braun, even though Braun don&#x27;t hurt as much so may be if you&#x27;re a beginner</li>
            <li>I do really like my legs after the process.  </li>
            <li>i cant complain really.</li>
            <li>really cordless&lt;br /&gt;Not a wet/dry model</li>
            <li>It worked well, and didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I was fearing.</li>
            <li>With the hair grown back more sparsely and soft, it didn&#x27;t really grab a lot of them as well</li>
            <li>I do agree with a comment that I remember reading when I was choosing to buy one(which was not necessarily about this model), which is that it never felt smooth like after shaving.</li>
            <li>it is so powerful and pull your hair completely.</li>
            <li>It is noisy no matter what speed it&#x27;s on, very intimidating.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>I should have read more carefully though.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was rechargeable, but it must be plugged in the whole time.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is a much cheaper alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li>I have a high tolerance for pain, but no way could I handle this torturous device!  </li>
            <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li>The whole time I was saying &amp;#34;Ow...</li>
            <li>I wanted to use it in intimate area as well..</li>
            <li>like in the beginning when i was using it pulled out almost everything, fast</li>
            <li>Its been a week since I got this and precisely the same time</li>
            <li>and I am much happier.</li>
            <li>I have not had much experience (or luck) with waxing.</li>
            <li>So, I was feeling really nervous to drop my pants and try the rest....</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Imagine my surprise to find that this product is much, much faster.  </li>
            <li>The itching and ingrown hairs became too much</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove my hairs...</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator.</li>
            <li>Very inconsistent maybe removed 10% of hairs and broke the rest.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Epilating the bikini area hurts so much.</li>
            <li>I feel each hair and the pain is very intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Epilating the bikini area hurts so much.</li>
            <li>I feel each hair and the pain is very intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>I expected more for the price and the dact is manufactured by Philips</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare...</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li>me give it to you straight</li>
            <li>it REALLY work</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t do anything in my opinion.</li>
            <li>OK...I&#x27;m a guy and I use epilation to remove body hair that I don&#x27;t really care for...</li>
            <li>but it does not hurt all that much and works</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>not),&lt;br /&gt;It is much simpler to wax and remove alot of hair in one go then trying to use this shipping/functionality 4/5&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>On my legs I did maybe a minute of swiping and couldn&#x27;t really see a difference in hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I felt like it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I suggest to use it in a well lightened place, because it&#x27;s easier to find those tricky hairs if you have enough light.</li>
            <li>It does what it claims to do and it does it very well.</li>
            <li>so ingrown hairs aren&#x27;t a real problem for me.</li>
            <li>I had different epilator that I had lost and it didn&#x27;t run as smoothly as this one does.</li>
            <li>Very sleek.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>However, today I decided to give it a try on my bikini area and, to my surprise, I manage to epilate the whole area (really, EVERYTHING).</li>
            <li>tried under my arms and it hurt more than I expected, and the area was a bit irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have too much hair,</li>
            <li>and i have smooth legs in a short time vs waxing that took me 2 hours sometimes&lt;</li>
            <li>That will really REALLY hurt.</li>
            <li>This requires patience, persistence, and a high pain threshold!  </li>
            <li>After looking at the current products available</li>
            <li>or maybe I epilate too much?</li>
            <li>She said it was like a really fast tweezer running over her legs</li>
            <li>I really like this epilator.</li>
            <li>I have very hairy legs</li>
            <li>I get a lot of ingrown hairs if I do the whole thing</li>
            <li>better then i expected</li>
            <li>Much against my unfounded fear of epilators, I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>Very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Depends on how fast I have to do it again.  </li>
            <li>and I like the dog too much to even go there)</li>
            <li>I have noticed that using this is so much easier than using a disposable razor</li>
            <li>I do not need use very often</li>
            <li>I have to say that I really like this.</li>
            <li>I just received it today, shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO much easier to just have to go over my lower legs in the shower</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to shave so much...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m okay with using just that, but my sole purpose for buying this product is to use it for underarm hair and the infamous \\&quot;happy trail.\\</li>
            <li>This one works really well and has minimum pulling sensation.</li>
            <li>This is a whole bunch of NO.</li>
            <li>and I can say it really gets the job done every time I use it.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, but I really do like this one.  </li>
            <li>I found that it didn&#x27;t cause much pain on my legs and did seem to get almost all of the hair.  </li>
            <li>(I was always so embarrassed to wear tanks or sleeveless dresses in the summer) and this has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know</li>
            <li>it very loud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product for the face because of it&#x27;s size and ripping off too much skin instead of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It works fast and is thorough.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really pull out my hair.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, if you are looking for a fast and efficient epilator.</li>
            <li>Oh and I have very stubborn hair.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this epilator did a fantastic job of removing my coarse armpit hairs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the cord because I felt like it was getting in my way.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt at all and my legs are smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;Armpits and lady bits however, are a different story.</li>
            <li>Hitler even thought the use of this device on crotches was barbaric, if that gives you any indication of how much it hurt.</li>
            <li>: DO NOT OVERUSE THE FAST SPEED.</li>
            <li>I use &amp;#34;Emjoi&amp;#34; After Epilation Cream every time I epilate and it seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>two hours later my leg was hair free, cut free and the red bumps subsisted within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>It feels a bit more aggressive and rough but it also seems to remove the hair faster.  </li>
            <li>It is very efficient.</li>
            <li>How much will it hurt?</li>
            <li>fast does it go?</li>
            <li>Real</li>
            <li>Just pluck from time to time but not as much.</li>
            <li>Bought it for facial hair, so far hasnt worked, ok on leg hair</li>
            <li>It will work for now and is still a good first one, but not good if you are determined to use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I got this hoping that I could get silky smooth legs for the first time in my life and since it take me a long time to shave my legs just for them to have stubble even immediately after.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with the result but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>and i would suggest for the sensitive areas to use a form of aftershave gel (my personal favorite is Bikini Zones aftershave GEL) and apply to the area to soothe irritation after using the epilator.</li>
            <li>It was too rough for facial hair and it did not do a good job.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t unbearable though; I was able to complete the upper triangle as well as my bikini line before I called it quits.</li>
            <li>I generally only use it on my forearms and legs, but by the way it feels, I&#x27;m tempted to try more sensitive</li>
            <li>It also works faster which surprised me because its smaller and more lightweight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;  intensified while using on more sensitive areas such as the underarms, torso, or pubic area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the instruction manual, I noticed that it is recommended that this product is to be used only on the legs and nowhere else, but obviously I want this product to be effective everywhere not just my legs.</li>
            <li>I thought with all that pain it would at least get a good bit of the hairs.</li>
            <li>i thick that is definitely a good buy</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and wear a lot of skirts, so if there&#x27;s a special occasion coming up, I&#x27;ll epilate or shave what stubble I have, which means I&#x27;ll be yanking some hairs out when I epilate next and leaving others, but even with my lack of commitment I only have to epilate every week at the most.  </li>
            <li>It does pluck some hairs, but it&#x27;s hard to tell just how many because it breaks all the other hairs, making it look like it did a good job.</li>
            <li>Yes, if you use this device only on super high-use skin, the sensation you get stays right on the high end of discomfort, not quite tipping over the cusp into pain.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more time consuming and kind of painful, but SO worth it!</li>
            <li>Many of them i can see the tips have the follicle/round black part on them, which mean that they have been successfully pulled off from the root.</li>
            <li>Using it is very easy, and after having my hair used to being ripped out rather than cut off, it honestly wasn&#x27;t painful like it was the first time I tried it or the first time I got waxed.</li>
            <li>After use, very good, shaved fairly clean, not too painful</li>
            <li>I like how easy it is to use and that the cord is long.</li>
            <li>cord is long and the epilator runs strong.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt on the ankle area and on the back of the leg (calf) but other than that, its good.</li>
            <li>This is largely because it just works better--it grabs way more hair on the first few passes</li>
            <li>Also my skin was very irritated after the first time, but that got a little better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This Philips is small and light enough that it&#x27;s easy to handle, love the longer than normal cord that lets me use it wherever I want to regardless of how far the outlet is.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, it was very loud and when I made a pass over my stomach that I had just shaven it hurt a lot.</li>
            <li>After the first few uses I got use it and my legs are pretty smooth now thanks to this!</li>
            <li>This epilator must be plugged in when using I did not realize that, but better I supposed as my other rechargeable one quit working because the battery could not hold charge.  </li>
            <li>but I had the original Epilady back in the 80s (give or take).  </li>
            <li>did not shower beforehand this time, as I feel that the hot water, while it may open pores, also weakens the hair itself, making it more likely to break instead of come out.</li>
            <li>Perhaps other users may gave better luck.</li>
            <li>I would say that the power cord is not that big of a deal any more - I&#x27;ve used it with a different one and it has been working consistently.</li>
            <li>It works better then any other epilator I have ever had.</li>
            <li>All excited to receive it, used it once, and the next rime I plugged it in it would not work.  </li>
            <li>Definitely won&#x27;t serve the purpose originally intended</li>
            <li>The legs on the other hand were almost painless, and the results are better than I could have ever imagined.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have stubble 10 minutes later, in fact I didn&#x27;t see anything worth removing for a week!</li>
            <li>I can do my legs and underarms in 20 minutes flat, and they stay smooth for a week.  </li>
            <li>I like this method much better than any other unwanted hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Love this use on my legs and other parts.</li>
            <li>It was kind of scary at first, but I am getting used to the sound and feeling.</li>
            <li>But to someone who shaving daily, hates waxing, and doesn&#x27;t have luck with hair removal creams, the pain is worth it to me!</li>
            <li>much better than shaving or other alternatives.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have said, this is perhaps not the most efficient Epilator out there</li>
            <li>If being smooth down there is worth intense pain to you, then I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I dont think its just this epilator that causes ingrowns, i think epilating in general causes ingrowns so make sure to exfoliate daily.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair clean enough.</li>
            <li>Epilators are painful at first use, but once you get used to it,they are awesome.</li>
            <li>Yes it does hurt, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that after a few uses I will get used to the pain.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say yet how long this amazing smoothness will last</li>
            <li>Does a clean job with lesser pain.</li>
            <li>I only used it on clean, exfoliated skin, and exfoliated in between the times of use and growth</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased and wished I would have tried this a long long time ago.</li>
            <li>the hair is kind of long on different areas.</li>
            <li>Amazing little device!</li>
            <li>The epilator itself has never shown signs of breaking, slowing down, or becoming less effective.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend to those seeking a reasonable priced&lt;br /&gt;quality product.</li>
            <li>first time I use an epilator , at first it hurts , but gradually you get used to , and I really like it because it lasts much longer shaving, only to be moisturize skin thoroughly after use .</li>
            <li>ordered already 2 replacements heads, each cost almost as a whole new epilator, but I don&#x27;t need the whole device, so I prefered just to buy the spare part.</li>
            <li>Also there is a special sphere of heaven for women who can address those stout hairs on the labia area just above the clitoris with an epilator.</li>
            <li>Although I thought this epilator was a bit pricey ($39.00),  I purchased it because other Philips products that I have bought in the past were very good.  </li>
            <li>The Philips epilator removes this unwanted hair with very little pain and with amazing precision....</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve just been alternating and kind of doing whatever works out, which allows me to avoid shaving tricky areas like knees and ankles (where I typically tend to nick myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But a lot less irritation than waxing and very smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I also really miss the light on my previous one, which with time had slowed down and was not as effective as it once has been.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t take long to build a tolerance.</li>
            <li>Plus I know it won&#x27;t take long for them to be as smooth as my thighs feel if I just stick with it &amp; never shave again.</li>
            <li>Having smooth, stuble-free pits every day is something I wish I had done a long time ago.  </li>
            <li>I ended up shaving what I couldn&#x27;t epilate, and the results are pretty clear.</li>
            <li>Have you reflected with rue upon a dinner party you ruined through your own juvenile, drunken antics?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be completely transparent for a moment, my hair grows fast, and with that fast growing hair are in-grown hairs which the epilator cant really grab.</li>
            <li>Wow at first .. ouch..</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it was intended to do, albeit somewhat loudly.</li>
            <li>The first time you use it it seems not to remove them completely all the way to the root.</li>
            <li>Also, it is pretty loud</li>
            <li>For me it was not painful, and the subsequent times no pain!</li>
            <li>and she used it for the first time, told me hands off this is mine, she loves it so far.</li>
            <li>I gave 4/5 stars because my hair starts growing back sooner than I wanted to (2-3 weeks instead of a full 3 or 4), but that might just be my body.</li>
            <li>THIS one gets more than most but not the truly short and thick hairs.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s loud, but no louder than an electric razor or clippers.  </li>
            <li>but this one is by  far the one with  higher performance.  </li>
            <li>The skin is really soft and smooth and the hair grows back very fine.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might be one of the devils favorite torture tools for really really naughty sinners.</li>
            <li>light, nice grib and long cable didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because didn&#x27;t come with a small case-</li>
            <li>The pain is not bad enough for that in my opinion.</li>
            <li>But when I received the product it is very cheap looking, it doesn&#x27;t come with anything extra, has only one head</li>
            <li>On the longer parts it did hurt quite a bit more, so I definitely recommend shaving a day or two before you use this so that the hair is not too long - but the parts that were just short stubble were fine.</li>
            <li>I DID have the typical ingrown hairs at first, but it was easy to deal with and had no pimples, boils, infections, etc.</li>
            <li>All you women out there, feel free to mock me and men in general for our low pain tolerance, and how most men wouldn&#x27;t be willing to go through half the discomfort/pain</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty loud but seems to be decent quality.</li>
            <li>My legs over the next couple of days definitely did not seem as smooth as they would have been right after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I feel like I have the skin of new born baby now!</li>
            <li>hair blew loose just fine during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some hairs end up being cut rather than pulled, but most are definitely yanked clean out, as you can see the little follicle at the ends.</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations</li>
            <li>I works better than the new models, it takes me less time and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It will cause breakage on about half the hair and require more time than shaving or waxing</li>
            <li>The more you use it the easier and less pain you have.</li>
            <li>As you epilate more and more, the pain DOES get less and less each time until one day you don&#x27;t feel any pain at all.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the discomfort will become less.</li>
            <li>This one has half as many.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a lot more blades than the epilator that I&#x27;ve had previously.</li>
            <li>and it still hurts but pain gets less the more you use it.</li>
            <li>easy to use and not very hurt</li>
            <li>I was having my chin/lip threaded, so I was more or less used to the stinging sensation, so that was no shock.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers are much more efficient at plucking since my previous one tended to break off the hairs.</li>
            <li>People say the more tweezers the less</li>
            <li>In contrast to what the instruction sheet says, I had better results with longer hair (previously unshaven) than with 1/8 stubble.</li>
            <li>Since then I haven&#x27;t enjoyed my epilating sessions because it now takes 40 minutes to do my legs, half of which that time is f**king around with the cord to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not real satisfied on some areas where I wanted it the most.</li>
            <li>Better than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li>My main problem with it is that is doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs.</li>
            <li>I love my solid and sturdy Emjoi red one.</li>
            <li>I think, it is mainly designed for feet (my sister uses it not me).</li>
            <li>and I bought it mainly for my underarms.</li>
            <li>but this one is decently priced and does the job.  </li>
            <li>I have an older Remington epilator, and the battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged anymore, have to keep it plugged in to use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was because of this particular epilator, since I never used another epilator before.</li>
            <li>gave the product 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t know if the pain I felt was from this particular product.</li>
            <li>From my experience with this particular epilator, it does not seem to pull the hair from the root.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this and hoped it would end plucking and harsh chemical hair removers,  but it wasn&#x27;t meant to be.</li>
            <li>Overall, it didn&#x27;t really work for me and it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.</li>
            <li>If you have a decent tolerance to pain, get one.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely continue buying this one if my current one breaks.</li>
            <li>Getting older...</li>
            <li>The hair grows back really quick.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job of grabbing and removing hair at the root, with next to no broken hairs ° Way easier than waxing ° Way less messy than waxing ° Way cheaper than waxing</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Ive also found that shorter and finer hairs it pulls well, doesn&#x27;t grow back quick either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go over this spot several times, diff speeds, different angles and I still pluck most of the hair out..  </li>
            <li>it works decently.</li>
            <li>I ended up with a lot of ingrowns, but I most likely was not using it properly.  </li>
            <li>this one is OK for occasional use only...</li>
            <li>I am lucky because I purchased this last week and it was on sell for $30</li>
            <li>Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>tried it a second time hoping for better results but it was the same deal.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>I had not been able to get rid of all of my facial hair at once without it growing back in days.</li>
            <li>Nothing particular fancy about it</li>
            <li>I always had a basic model of Braun, which works much better, but had to find something with american cord.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for my underarms.</li>
            <li>This particular model must be plugged in for usage.  </li>
            <li>but after inspection the problem seemed to lie in the main compartment where the electrical systems are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily this type of hair removal seems to last a while</li>
            <li>Make sure if you send it back to use insured postage (an extra 5 bucks).</li>
            <li>I browsed online and saw that the price on this one was decent</li>
            <li>I had to do several passes, but I was going quickly to minimize the pain.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a wookie like me, and it&#x27;s your first try with an epilator, I do recommend starting with a wax first and then just using the epilator as needed to manage the regrowth.</li>
            <li>Maybe the more expensive ones get more hair</li>
            <li>she has an older model since 2005 but</li>
            <li>many many angry wasps.</li>
            <li>The main reason why I bought this is its capability to be used across the world.</li>
            <li>But they also left some tiny hairs but its ok.  </li>
            <li>Decent for the price.</li>
            <li>The two speeds are really nice; I use the fast setting on my legs and the slow setting on my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wax myself regularly and this didn&#x27;t feel any different from waxing (and it worked better)</li>
            <li>It fades quickly unless you have a very low pain</li>
            <li>The more expensive ones have more tweezers.</li>
            <li>I rely so much on decent reviews to help me make a choice</li>
            <li>My main epilator will remain an emjoi.</li>
            <li>The main reason I chose the Philips HP6401 was the price.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after my Emjoi epilator finally died after 8 years of loyal service.</li>
            <li>I chose this one mainly because of the price.  </li>
            <li>gave it a 4 because it leaves many short hairs that I need to go over, but it does take it out after the second run.</li>
            <li>Mainly used for under arm.</li>
            <li>I dislike this product for two main reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing most people aren&#x27;t dealing with the same coarse hair I am (</li>
            <li>Sometimes it misses the smaller ones but nothing a quick tweezers touch up can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Glad it wasn&#x27;t more expensive.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a tolerable pain like a multiple quick pinch on your skin.</li>
            <li>The main thing is not to hurry and to believe that beauty demands of &amp;#34;victims&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and it got everything the older one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Try taking a warm/hot shower before using to make your pores open up a little more for a easier removal (make sure you are dry first though because this product is not water resistant).</li>
            <li>I threw out the guard I got with it within a month because it just isn&#x27;t necessary, but it was nice at first because I was a little leery of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really fast, but very loud.</li>
            <li>Very fast and quick with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it seemed to have high ratings for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so they are accessible to the tweezer blades, but I&#x27;d also add to that don&#x27;t wait too long</li>
            <li>: If you have high pain tolerance and are willing to experiment a bit, this is worth adding to your arsenal of hair removal products, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have a high threshold for pain.</li>
            <li>The pores in my pubic area did bleed, mostly up high in the sides of the triangle.</li>
            <li>If you have a high pain tolerance - knock yourself out.</li>
            <li>All in all, I highly recommend this epilator for the money.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend witch hazel after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality design.</li>
            <li>I run it on high</li>
            <li>and I have a high pain</li>
            <li>I came across this one, and read the reviews, the positives highly outweighed the negatives</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product if you have hair in unwanted places.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this epilator for those who are regulars at waxing and threading.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it, but the next time I buy an epilator, I&#x27;ll probably go for a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>I use the high speed mode for faster results.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>do have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>but I have a high pain threshold...</li>
            <li>Just the noise level it makes is high.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have high expectations for the rest of the unit&#x27;s lifespan.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest anything highly scented though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have an extraordinarily high pain tolerance, but this topped it.</li>
            <li>I have lots of tattoos and a high tolerance, but it still hurts.</li>
            <li>i have a high pain tolerance and it feels like youre being burned or maybe cut</li>
            <li>Highly  recommend</li>
            <li>I found getting used to handling it helped and putting it on high.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to cry like a baby, and I tend to have a high tolerance to pain.  </li>
            <li>It was an impulse buy that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely smooth and, visually, no dark spots all over my legs from the hair still left in the follicle.</li>
            <li>I know it says not for use on face, but it does work fine there, but be careful not to overdue it.</li>
            <li>I now have no trouble epilating my underarms and have epilated all other parts of my body :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a significant plus especially on such sensitive zones as armpits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to shave every other day if I was showing my legs, more because of my self conscious.</li>
            <li>but my old one was smaller and funny enough was more loud.</li>
            <li>How this epilator saved me is that, I can easily remove those new and medium long hair easily and with less pain.</li>
            <li>Not horribly, but like little pricks with a needle.</li>
            <li>It sounded like a saw, so I always put my headphones on and listen to some upbeat music to help distract me a little &#x3D;)&lt;</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this product, especially if you&#x27;re a first time user as you can figure out if epilation is meant for you or not!</li>
            <li>The feel of the unit in your hand is also better with the Braun, which is a little rounder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Waxing in the salon had more pain than this little gadget.  </li>
            <li>After a little while you may get use to it and are able to take the guard off (which I did).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend spending a little bit more for an epilator that will work longer than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, a little more detail about epilating if you care to read:  </li>
            <li>it was way better than I expected--just a little stinging but nothing unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>also used it on my armpits (ouch) hurt a little bit more</li>
            <li>Overall, recommended for first epilator!</li>
            <li>and I love this little device.</li>
            <li>we are meant to have soft skin and this is the at home cheaper way to get it!!</li>
            <li>n looks good, but epilator is definitely tough</li>
            <li>but apparently they don&#x27;t use this very much in the States.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really hurts, lives my under arms very very sore, it does not get the hair at all, my daughter try it but the same for her it didn&#x27;t do nothing.</li>
            <li>I do have to go over the same area a few times, but overall I am happy with is.</li>
            <li>Lol needless to say, I returned it.</li>
            <li>My old one was quieter and the vibration much smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just time consuming for my lifestyle because it has to be used on clean and dry skin but at the time I shower I am always in a hurry to rush out the door</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great solution and not as expensive as buying replacement heads for razors or getting waxing done.  </li>
            <li>My legs are so soft and it didn&#x27;t hurt so much, as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to make this review seem too personal or sound like a \\&quot;personals\\&quot; ad, but since this device is used on very \\&quot;discreet\\&quot; parts of the body I might as well disclose all the gritty details.</li>
            <li>I get better results from shaving where I actually feel smooth for at least three days.</li>
            <li>This appeared normal, so all I did was</li>
            <li>I normally wax or shave</li>
            <li>She normally waxes her legs.</li>
            <li>I always get my face and eyebrows threaded, so I wanted pretty much the same method for my legs and all over.</li>
            <li>that, just make sure you exfoliate the shit out of your skin.</li>
            <li>You have to understand that all epilators hurt, pretty much the same degree.</li>
            <li>Much better and easier than messy waxing.</li>
            <li>so I did have to go over a few areas again, but it also started to work more efficiently for me as I got used to using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>while the hair still comes back its worth it and something i would recomend</li>
            <li>Philips epilator is much more lightweight (in a cheapish way), has no light</li>
            <li>Normally I&#x27;m stingy when purchasing products</li>
            <li>There are some places the pain isn&#x27;t worth the result, like my upper thighs and pubes.</li>
            <li>With this thing I can carve out a normal looking beard line.  </li>
            <li>A few months ago I bought Philips and I love it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste any more time looking.</li>
            <li>This is a good entry level, says it&#x27;s for legs only on the package, so I&#x27;m not sure the description here should say it can be used anywhere else.</li>
            <li>This thing works pretty well - but is kind of irritating.  </li>
            <li>Its useful for facial hair n also for arms n</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wax or epilate normally, so</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m a first time user, it&#x27;s possible that I didn&#x27;t get the full extent of pain because i didn&#x27;t hold it correctly, and I only used it on my legs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>the plastic guard is pretty useless, and with it removed you need to use a fair bit of technique to remove hair without it</li>
            <li>(Which was my intent.)&lt;br /&gt;After a few swipes it got better...</li>
            <li>Really fun day at work the next day as my pants kept reminding me of it with every step!</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t sure whether you can deal with the discomfort, try plucking a few hairs (with a tweezer) from the area where you plan on using the epilator.</li>
            <li>but it last so long its ok.</li>
            <li>After using this product I can normally go about 2 weeks without epilating again.</li>
            <li>Definitely does the job, and is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is very basic, simple in use and does the job, much better than many of the expensive epilators that are currently available in the market.</li>
            <li>and I may have to epilate a few hairs, but for the most part my armpits and legs have no hair on them.</li>
            <li>I either shave, pluck, or wait a few more days for those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>long cord, which I prefer than a chargeable one because I want full power and don&#x27;t want to have to worry that its not charged up all the way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the Creams were effectively a bust, I saw the Philips Satinelle Epilator at my local Meijer, I cringed the first few times I saw it, because the picture described that it would be ripping out the hair by the root, like waxing!</li>
            <li>The time gained from not having to shave daily is definitely worth the discomfort of having to endure the hair removal process.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the NoNo that quit working after a few months.</li>
            <li>That may not seem that exciting, but normally after shaving, my legs are prickly again the same day</li>
            <li>and I wanted to wait and use it more than a few times before posting my review.</li>
            <li>and it grows back way fast) or waxing (which is hot, hurts, iffy on how well it works, and gets everywhere).</li>
            <li>In my mind, that&#x27;s worth the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A few more times</li>
            <li>Is my diet making me grow hair faster than normal?</li>
            <li>But a good product and now I am addicted.</li>
            <li>i did a whole leg (took me more than twice as long) before i gave up and went back to my old one.  </li>
            <li>but now its just kind of slow</li>
            <li>and they were worse than this one, the taking off head to rinse feature is really good.</li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li>your hair does grow back, it&#x27;s only a few hairs at a time and they are very light and fine</li>
            <li>&quot; the hairs are very fine and compact, and it was very tricky to go slowly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud and mean looking when you look at what is actually ripping the hair out of your body despite the happy colors.  </li>
            <li>During this time so many new models have been invented, that are just a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li>: Reasonable price and for me, no charging-extra long cord and can be used right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I only have to use it about once ever two weeks, but it takes half an hour to do a nice job.</li>
            <li>I do the shins first while they are still hot, but dry.</li>
            <li>I would also suggest exfoliating regularly, it&#x27;ll not only keep your legs super smooth, but it&#x27;ll also keep the ingrown hairs down.</li>
            <li>I really like not having to shave everyday and this is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and this thing plucked them right out with such speed!</li>
            <li>Right after using it, my legs had red bumps from irritation</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t learn to do it right, you will only break off hairs at the surface and end up with ingrown</li>
            <li>Trying to get the guts to try again right now, as I only got through about a 1x2 inch area when it came.</li>
            <li>It does last longer then shaving when you use it right.</li>
            <li>But I have extremely sensitive skin, and no matter how many times I used a brand new blade, exfoliated, shaved with the grain, used sensitive skin shaving gel and deodorant, treated my post-shave skin with everything I was told to use, and whatever other advice I came across</li>
            <li>Although epilating is more painful than you could imagine (it feels like being stabbed with a bunch of needles), it&#x27;s so much better than shaving!</li>
            <li>I only received it a few days ago and I already love it!</li>
            <li>The cord is super long</li>
            <li>the cord is super long and its not an issue at all.</li>
            <li>It is a little small for my hand but it is better than shaving, and with time hair takes more time to grow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Unfortunately for me, I have super sensitive skin, and can most certainly cannot afford the laser hair removal!</li>
            <li>it was a total disaster she had to go to the doctor after she used for the first time this new one!</li>
            <li>removes all dark hair long enough to be removed and most light hairs.</li>
            <li>The other positive is that when your hair does start growing back in a week later, it is very fine and light colored, not dark and coarse.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I lay down newspapers on the floor before epilating, so its an easy clean-up.</li>
            <li>If you have hair like me, you might want to try a more expensive epilator to catch and pull out the fine hairs on your legs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not yet sure about longterm small marks on the skin, I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>After the initial epilation of my right leg, there were some bumps, and was a little rough, but by the time I returned the bumps had gone away, and my legs were super smooth!</li>
            <li>very time consuming as you have to epilate individual areas instead of removing hair from a large area the way waxing works -</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I thought I was going to jump out of my skin and was surprised at how much it hurt, and I&#x27;ve had regular electrology sessions for three years!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t leave smooth skin like the other reviews said.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what other epilators are like but this one is pain free.</li>
            <li>For more prise you&#x27;ll get only extra heads, expect no miracles with epilators in general.</li>
            <li>but I do miss my light that I had on the other one</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun Silk Epil 7 after meeting up with a college friend who used to be extremely hairy whose arms were now as smooth as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>When you a search for men, this comes up and unless you have super fine hair, its a waste and even then it takes like 3 or 4 swipes in the same area to get everything.</li>
            <li>HONESTLY, it is just a little sting and works so well at removing any stray facial hairs that you might have.  </li>
            <li>If you have very thick and dense hairs, I would recommend going with a more powerful model.</li>
            <li>I even bought a new one, but it died too.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m new to this.</li>
            <li>After a use or two I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt anymore, until I try it on a new area</li>
            <li>live without it and for the price, it is heaven.</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t turn on, looked brand new though</li>
            <li>but i can live with it for that price</li>
            <li>I am new to the epilator experience.</li>
            <li>but i guess that is a feature i will have to live with.</li>
            <li>Now was time to have a new one and</li>
            <li>I may need a new cartridge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#3 tell yourself that tomorrow is a new day and go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this new one</li>
            <li>so Philiips sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>I will add that I&#x27;m new to emulating so it could be user error.</li>
            <li>something missing.&lt;br /&gt;the machine is brand new, but for some reason the cleaning brush was missing.&lt;br /&gt;it could be customer return.</li>
            <li>those new to using an epilator: it hurts.</li>
            <li>Every time I thought it worked, I found a new patch of hair on my legs that it wouldn&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>new one</li>
            <li>As I work those out the device has not noticeably created any new patches; just maybe one or two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spoke to a representative and they shipped a new one to me to my office.</li>
            <li>I understand they have to make new models to keep selling new things, but it does not improve the quality</li>
            <li>I get a new one every 2 years</li>
            <li>It was a new sensation.</li>
            <li>used epilator all my life but here in the US, mine (220v) didn´t work, so I needed a new one with 110v.</li>
            <li>They offered to send me a new replacement</li>
            <li>I am new to epilators</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to epilators, but I&#x27;ve done home waxing and threading before.  </li>
            <li>It will be torture to shave until I get my new machine.</li>
            <li>but I think I can live with it.</li>
            <li>And, I had to go over a few areas from different angles to be effective.</li>
            <li>and since there isn&#x27;t much hair left, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>So after a few epilations It will keep a smooth appearance much longer.</li>
            <li>but I learned if I pull at my skin as I epilate it, not only helps get all the hairs, but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt as much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like it though because I see that it breaks a lot of hairs instead of pulling them out completely.</li>
            <li>roommate in college had an epilator, and the thought of having smooth and non-hairy legs all the time was appealing in a college-setting, where I wore shorts around my room and would have random neighbors visit at all hours of the day and night.</li>
            <li>love this, but you need thick hairs for it to really work.</li>
            <li>First of all, the item is White/Gray per the item description, with a pink add-on attachment for first time users/victims:  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to shave so much with it because the hair does not grow back as fast.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, it&#x27;s pretty small which makes it so much comfortable and</li>
            <li>I love this little machine!</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I went over it there are still those little bits there that never got picked up!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LITTLE THING!</li>
            <li>The sound is pretty loud and it makes it sound super painful.</li>
            <li>It takes some getting used to at first (but the learning curve is not steep), and once you realize to keep the skin tight and hold the epilator at a 90 degree angle, you&#x27;ve pretty much become a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was also very loud.  </li>
            <li>I had a very old Epilady and there have definately been improvements.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li>I had a very old epilator and my niece recommended this one to me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li>You will also notice that around your knees is a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li>Is very loud.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The skin does feel very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud, and seeing the discs rotate was intimidating.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it in any very sensitive areas yet, just my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>When I switched it on, the loud whirring noise made me cringe, since it sounded like a contraption that should be used to edge a lawn, but only the first few seconds hurt a little - once you know what to expect it is absolutely fine (and quick!)!  </li>
            <li>As for hair removal, it would have required going over the same spot a few times to get everything, and I most certainly didn&#x27;t want to keep reliving that.</li>
            <li>knowing that after I finished up, I don&#x27;t have to worry about becoming a hairy Mary for about 2 weeks 😁 chuk de pathe (bring the roof down!)</li>
            <li>This is my second epilator, I love the way this works its smooth and am a tough gal</li>
            <li>However after about 8 months of use it developed a short somewhere in the cord so it only works if it is held in exactly the right spot.</li>
            <li>It was easier to use, more effective and  much less painful than another one that I tried by Remington (smooth and silky, wet/dry epilator).</li>
            <li>I was intimidated by the sound and the rotating tweezers and was honestly scared to put it to my skin, but once I did, it really wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li>Here are  pros/cons and my first impressions, overall, I like this thing, but nothing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first problem with this thing, and the obvious thing, is that this plucks out all of your hairs, so this is no painless experience.  </li>
            <li>I think it was worth it though, because in the long run,</li>
            <li>This is my first and will be my last epilator!</li>
            <li>My first time it took me two hours, second time 1 hr and so on.</li>
            <li>despite the growth (of nearly two months!)</li>
            <li>The instructions said to use the plastic protector if it&#x27;s your first time using an epilator, so I did and it only pulled my hair and it didn&#x27;t even get all my hair</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator and hopefully the last.</li>
            <li>I suggest starting higher on a shin, and working your way lower (my hair is also denser toward my ankle).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I plugged it in and used it, I only made it up to my knees.  </li>
            <li>The next time, I &amp;#34;trimmed&amp;#34; a bit higher.  </li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll just go back to shaving....  ;-)</li>
            <li>Hurts at first but gets easier later on</li>
            <li>The only downside it is pretty loud, my old one is not as loud, but it is pretty bearable.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of pain, I think they all inflict some sort of pain, but I am very used to it now anyway, so it is not a big deal for me anyway</li>
            <li>And ESPECIALLY not for your first use of this.</li>
            <li>whatever it is ( I do all of those with this), then when the hair grows back in slowly, slender and shorter, there is almost zero pain and after a few months of weekly maintenance, you will be as happy as I am!!</li>
            <li>I first purchased a Satinelle several years ago when I saw it in a sale bin.</li>
            <li>First time was a bit of a bust, resulting in VERY red &amp; bumpy skin and not a ton of hair reduction.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I definitely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved for years and my hair is pretty coarse.  </li>
            <li>but I usually prefer to use without this cap because it seems that the epilator works better without it...</li>
            <li>It is my first and only epilator.</li>
            <li>Only hurts some the first couple of times you use it.</li>
            <li>just took too long to be worth it</li>
            <li>I only have to do this like once a week sometimes not even because my hair doesn&#x27;t even grow much!</li>
            <li>Especially the first time, i only use it on my under arms but its worth it for me at least :)</li>
            <li>Since we are in the time where pubic hair is unwanted, we have to decide what method we want to use to keep our naughty bits smooth.</li>
            <li>&quot; WOW!</li>
            <li>This one does a better job, but because it is smaller, it takes more time to do the job, and it doesn&#x27;t get all the difficult areas.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on comments that I would be able to use it on other places, but the instructions explicitly say for legs only, and I don&#x27;t need that</li>
            <li>This epilator is small and cute and portable.</li>
            <li>wanted to try an Epilator because I&#x27;m a pretty hairy individual</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators for the past 15 years and I love this one.</li>
            <li>You may find it miss some hair the first or even second passing,</li>
            <li>I also use this for underarm, which is usually not suggested.</li>
            <li>I used it on my knees and toes which (according to third parties) are pretty hairy.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it wasn&#x27;t doing much first because I was scared of the pain and second because my hairs were too short I believe.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of tattoos which is the process of many small needles piercing your skin repeatedly for hours at a time.</li>
            <li>I have already recommended this product several times to friends, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to switch from waxing and shaving!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed, a basic epilator that works well.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I would epilate every other or every third day to make sure the regrowth was stopped.</li>
            <li>small and efficient love it</li>
            <li>It is pretty basic though, just the epilator and the cable, nothing else.</li>
            <li>This one is exactly what one needs for performing a simple task of removing unwanted hair from your body.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I consistently have is ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>First time using one of these, first time using something other then shaving.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t promise everyone else will feel the same way, since I suppose some may be quite sensitive to pain, but I really didn&#x27;t consider it pain as much as a discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I found it too small and challenging to hold.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this gadget works!</li>
            <li>and wow, did it hurt!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this epilator, it took me a couple of hours just going bit-by-bit, and I only ended up doing just up to my knees.</li>
            <li>I have had another one in the past and this one works better.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>I only felt the pain the first two times I used it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be getting much considering they had to mark it down, so I was pretty much ready to try it, return it, and never talk about this experience again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The edges, even in my leg crease were easy and pain was slight, but near the edges of the labia or \\&quot;lips\\</li>
            <li>Took several uses for it to stop happening and a decent moisturizer can really help with it.</li>
            <li>Especially if I have to continue to go over the same spot over and over again to get a clean hairless spot.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hair free from the neck down</li>
            <li>The first few times were less comfortable but effective on my dark brown leg hair.  </li>
            <li>I thought they were going to break and after a couple minutes my legs felt too wobbly to stand, got light headed, blurred vision and felt the need to lay down.</li>
            <li>the only bad thing I see is that you really need to take time to do it perfectly, but hey, I prefer this than spending money in professional waxing.</li>
            <li>The back of my calves and near the ankles hurt more than the other parts of my leg.</li>
            <li>It was quick and easy, and it hurt way less than the dozens of other epilators I have bought.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s effective, although I have to go over the same area several times to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li>I used my old one in the morning and the new one in the evening</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my first epilator (an expensive, wet/dry Braun model) and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>The pros: smooth skin, convenient, less pain, no redness/swelling; the cons:</li>
            <li>For my legs, I still prefer the smooth feel of shaving, but I do get less irritation when I use this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alright though because I can easily take the remaining few hairs with a tweezer, but I&#x27;d prefer not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>but if you wax your skin first and let the hair grow back in its natural 3 cycle, then it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
            <li>After the first time, I only need a sweep maybe once a week or so to keep my torso almost completely hair-free.</li>
            <li>I loved my Emjoi and was disappointed it was no longer available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far better to work on small areas at a time.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but it is a little loud.</li>
            <li>That is super important, and kinda tough if you are a nervous sweater.&lt;br /&gt;Legs</li>
            <li>If you simply go up and down, then you will call for pain for sure.</li>
            <li>I tried using on my belly where I have fine little hair.</li>
            <li>Take a little getting used to this device, and then it works fine.</li>
            <li>I guess the positive thing is after several mins and umteen angles with this satan device</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has a cord and all because it can get tangled and become a huge mess.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works okay, but ensure your hair is long enough for the epilator to grip and you are using it in a well-lit room.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty much the same, slightly different shape</li>
            <li>Even though it has two speeds, I only use the first one since it is fast enough already.</li>
            <li>All epilators, or I should say &amp;#34;Epilation&amp;#34; DOES hurt, maybe even A WHOLE LOT for some, but only in the beginning like your first and/or second attempts.</li>
            <li>You really have to grit your teeth and spread out your first few uses for how much you can handle at a time.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I was tired of shaving every other day just to keep my legs smooth, and this product works really well at keeping them smooth for much longer.</li>
            <li>But once I suffered through that first time, the hair grew back thinner, and by the second time it was much easier to remove.</li>
            <li>But I guess this is true with any other epilators.</li>
            <li>I was blessed with fine blonde body hair, but it is thick and grows quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of patience to do this yet, nor I dared to go through my lady areas in one full sweep like what I do with other areas, because it will hurt, but it does work, you just have to do it</li>
            <li>so I really needed a new one and at a very low cost.</li>
            <li>but then as i&#x27;m using it often, I feel less pain now Much better and simple then waxing!</li>
            <li>My skin quickly went kind of tingly numb</li>
            <li>I needed less pressure, and more on the back.</li>
            <li>More than shaving, obviously, but less than waxing.</li>
            <li>For its price I get good coverage of hair removal, relatively quick results, few problems such as ingrown hairs, and (over weeks of use) less grow back.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a more convenient and economical method of hair removal, and don&#x27;t get scared away thinking it&#x27;ll be super painful!</li>
            <li>Within minutes the areas where it tore the hair out became super inflamed and red, caused open wounds large enough to bleed.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is very affordable compared to the other ones out there.</li>
            <li>Much like other aspects of passage into womanhood, first it hurts, then you get used to it, then you sort of like it,</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stand getting to the middle under my nose as it really is &amp;#34;nippy&amp;#34; and a tad too sensitive, but figure with some use each day I will get it done!  </li>
            <li>Near my ankles is most sensitive (I used it from knee down only so far).</li>
            <li>Yes you may have to go over certain areas multiple times</li>
            <li>Gets rid of the hair well, but it definitely has to be a certain length (5/8 inch or something)</li>
            <li>, the guard that comes with it is purely for psychological reasons.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget plugs in with a cord, is about the size of my palm, and gets my legs virtually hair free in about 5-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>I like the way that it makes my legs look more &amp;#34;uniform&amp;#34;, meaning that the pores on my legs aren&#x27;t as dark because there is not dark hair left in the follicles.  </li>
            <li>It works fine for all of my body, but I really DO NOT recommend this for facial use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>I have a really high pain tolerance and can barely stand to run this thing over my legs.</li>
            <li>I do think I want something that covers a little more surface area (wider with maybe multiple heads)</li>
            <li>I think you could buy a little bit better epilator and have it last longer.</li>
            <li>Was a little scared to tried the underarm area, but finally tried and love it.</li>
            <li>I can go for two weeks (more, if I&#x27;m not wearing skirts every day) between epilating my legs or underarms, and I have reached the level of epilating expertise where I can domy bikini line with only a little discomfort.  </li>
            <li>After I epilated my lower legs, the hair was significantly finer and less noticeable upon regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other one was battery operated and the batteries drained really quick.</li>
            <li>(I wanna try those too) but this as a first epilator is amazing, is little bit noisy, like a shaving machine, but it is quite practical, small</li>
            <li>It is a little inconvenient that you have to plug it in when in use, but the tweezer heads are good about gripping even the shorter finer hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have found that if you press hard, it will not pick up the hairs as much as if you just run it lightly over your legs/arms.  </li>
            <li>The cord is plenty long if you&#x27;re worried about that, but it does tend to tangle easily, and sometimes when I&#x27;m using it flickers on and off because the part where the cord plugs into the unit is loose or something.  </li>
            <li>Within seconds I had massive amounts of sweat dripping out of my arm pits, face bright cherry red dripping sweat, clinched my teeth so hard</li>
            <li>Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>(I epilate when I&#x27;m cold lol).</li>
            <li>Otherwise steer clear.  </li>
            <li>but I figured I&#x27;d at least get a newer model that works better than my 6 year old one.  </li>
            <li>(the instructions clearly state not to do this).</li>
            <li>My legs never really feel smooth after using this but the results last a lot longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try and clear up some of this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my upper lip and it worked very well so far.</li>
            <li>I put on some natural lotion (one without alcohols or chemical irritants) and within a few hours, smooth legs.</li>
            <li>Although it makes me xxxx,my legs are clear.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve seen a ton of reviews on this specific epilator and although there are many good reviews, I&#x27;m only concerned with the bad ones.</li>
            <li>Now to be clear, I am no city boy hipster that can&#x27;t take pain.</li>
            <li>So far, I have purchased 3 of these.  </li>
            <li>It took time to adapt, so don&#x27;t give up on it too early, give it some time.</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s big but doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair at a time as i wish it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>I almost blacked out from the pain; it was as if each hair follicle was being yanked directly out of my soul.  </li>
            <li>My legs have never been this soft.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I should preface this to say that I&#x27;m now 50 yr old and</li>
            <li>My legs, although hair free, are not completely smooth like waxing or a close shave.</li>
            <li>I was debating whether to go back to shaving with that epilator because it missed so much.</li>
            <li>but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.</li>
            <li>When I rub my hands over my legs it feels like the second or so day after shaving, very stubbly.  </li>
            <li>Sleeping mostly fixed it, and by midday again all was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it as often but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Gave it 3 stars because its kinda loud and i feel like it almost breaks the thicker hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove much hair, and you have to go over and over a spot several times to even get close to removing some hair.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much need for the second speed yet.</li>
            <li>This device comes with a pretty long cord.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like how soft my skin feels after using this product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any complaints so far...</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else as far as discomfort level.</li>
            <li>My facial hair around the lips is gone and what has grown back are very sparce and much lighter hairs</li>
            <li>You must go over the hair SEVERAL times before the desired result is accomplished.</li>
            <li>I chose to buy one because I have sensitive skin and my legs itch after shaving.</li>
            <li>My old one did not have that option.  </li>
            <li>i had old philips epilator</li>
            <li>My legs were soft as ever when I was done and no irritation, no itching afterwards like shaving causes me and not one bit of stubble!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this one and it is loud.  </li>
            <li>Also, if you have really sensitive skin, I would imagine this things pain</li>
            <li>completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I decided that epilating is not for me and rather shave the old fashioned way or shell out for the salon.</li>
            <li>and it felt really sensitive</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>have found you just have to relax completely while you&#x27;re doing it</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>It really does not matter if it&#x27;s a version for females or male.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this Epilator worked well with my underarms and not too well on my legs, considering that the box says that it is for use for the LEGS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but my armpits were so sensitive and hurt for days</li>
            <li>have used this product on all parts of the body, legs, arms, and even sensitive skin (like underarm and bikini line)</li>
            <li>That keeps the \\&quot;area of plucking\\&quot; smaller and pulls the hairs straight out, rather than yanking clumps of hairs from halfway across your testicular sack.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li>It pulled out the hairs completely and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>Wow, takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>This far from what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>As far as epilation goes, I didn&#x27;t like using it on my calves.</li>
            <li>Completely replaced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>LOUD</li>
            <li>Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator - 36</li>
            <li>It stung quite a bit the first time and took a long time (like an hour) to do both legs.</li>
            <li>, it is just weekly and the subsequent uses have gone much faster.</li>
            <li>I initially ran the epilator on my arms, and oh my goodness, I wasn’t quite prepared for the pain, as I was used to running an electric shaver on my arms during the summertime, and that was absolutely painless.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>My hair should have been long enough the first time I tried, but it didn&#x27;t pull out much.</li>
            <li>I got this to replace my old epilator</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how painless it was.</li>
            <li>(my room lights are somewhat dim).</li>
            <li>As far as pain goes, I think it depends a lot on where you plan to use it.  </li>
            <li>Also you must go over the hair several times before the desired effect is accomplished.</li>
            <li>One time I did not use the \\&quot;Efficiency Cap\\&quot; and I developed redness and bumps.    </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, forget about using this.</li>
            <li>but she likes it so far.</li>
            <li>I personally did not feel much pain, but I did experience some redness</li>
            <li>(Its nowhere near the weeks that they promise.)</li>
            <li>This hair is not growing back much at all.  </li>
            <li>But, it only took me 3 weeks to build the tolerance to do a whole session.  </li>
            <li>Second, I wish it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.</li>
            <li>I think it works pretty well with long hairs</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really loud too.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My old one was 13 years old</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve noticed on this one is that instead of pulling the hair off it cuts some of them, so I can see hair coming out after the 2nd day al ready.</li>
            <li>I read on the page about it being for the &amp;#34;most sensitive areas&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Not to be used in those sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>Although this Philips has only 21 tweezers discs, it removes the hair fast and without pain (I use it for underarms, and still no discomfort).</li>
            <li>i was looking to replace my old epilator (over 5 years old)</li>
            <li>No  by far.</li>
            <li>After my old epilator died after 8 years of faithful service, I urgently started to search for a replace.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a minimal epliator, but this is the attachment you probably would use most of the time even with your most expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this twice so far.</li>
            <li>Its loud.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s meant for legs, but I used it on my underarms and they feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin this is a no</li>
            <li>Her legs feel soft.</li>
            <li>and you didnt need to go over the same place so much.</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviewers have already done a good job of outlining the general pros and cons of epilating versus other methods of hair removal, so I will keep my review brief.</li>
            <li>It took a long time the first time I used it and my legs looked like I had some sort of rash or allergic reaction when I was done.</li>
            <li>I do have to admit that this baby is LOUD -- sort of like shaving with a gas-powered lawnmower.</li>
            <li>So far, I am a fan.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li>I had the old model in Europe</li>
            <li>They feel so soft from doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not putting this anywhere near my face or underarms....</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>overall, a cute, innocent-looking pink and white device.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll still be using a razor for the really sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I am just overly sensitive</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice and stopped using the cap because I find life to be far easier without it.</li>
            <li>now I feel no pain and in the sensitive areas of my body I feel an itch or tickle.</li>
            <li>Then I realized I wasn&#x27;t moving the item fast enough.  </li>
            <li>so it hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.</li>
            <li>hair is soft since i wax over 10 years</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs, underarms and my upper bikini line without problem, although the instructions state that is is really supposed to be used solely on legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it is a bit loud.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this worked for the money.</li>
            <li>and my skin is quite sensitive</li>
            <li>Although the product works, it&#x27;s not meant for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The direction you&#x27;re supposed to go will come to you naturally.</li>
            <li>with the epilator i get longer lasting, MUCH smoother results.</li>
            <li>It is kinda loud, though.</li>
            <li>so I talked my 17 year old son into trying it on a spot on his leg (</li>
            <li>and that is a plus when you are busy with working over 12 hours a day.</li>
            <li>Today I still use cream depilatories on my legs that is formulated for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It might take some getting use to since that area is sensitive</li>
            <li>Simple and efficient, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Painless for me that was used to wax.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Again, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve had no problem with in-grown hairs or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am 5ft 6 in tall with really long and pretty hefty legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you want to use this product I suggest you think twice if you mind pain and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But in the end I will do it again, because yet again, I&#x27;m soft and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my old epliady either - another plus.</li>
            <li>I have not used this item in sensitive areas however for legs, stomach, bikini line and arms</li>
            <li>and I have straight corse Asian hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to send the whole thing back</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t surprised by the noise level since I&#x27;ve had an epilator before</li>
            <li>I have seen professional laser removal systems for about $800, and I couldn&#x27;t do that, either.  </li>
            <li>(even though the box of the old one said that I could use it for underarms and bikini as opposed to this one).</li>
            <li>checked the head of the old one I bought 9 years ago (Europe made) and has no rust on it, even when I used it for 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just WOW.</li>
            <li>My armpits are the softest they have ever been since I was like, 6 years old.</li>
            <li>How loud is it?</li>
            <li>After retrying the process a day or so later I still got similar results although no QUITE as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you are not prone to this problem then I think this product is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>and then you can use the epilator again and get better results since they are few and u will definitely see the direction they grow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice gadget that I wish the company could have given a small cleaning brush with it as most other epilators do, even though I use the brush that came with my other epilator.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to go back over areas more than a few</li>
            <li>You have to go over the same area a few times to get all of the hair, but that is the case with most any hair removal device or treatment.</li>
            <li>I liked waxing because the hair took at least 2 weeks to grow back</li>
            <li>I thought it would be okay because I would only have to endure the pain a few times as the hairs would be pulled from the root.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I got tired of spending so much money on waxing, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>So i have only barely used this, its pretty intimidating.</li>
            <li>Definitely have to exfoliate a lot, had quite a few ingrown hairs, but hoping that will get better with time</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful for all body hair (careful not to get scalp hair).</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I use it a few more times I will try to come back here &amp; update the review.</li>
            <li>And, I never had thick, abundant, or coarse hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>, my poor Satinelle gave out on me recently, but 20 years was a good run.</li>
            <li>I used my sisters $100 epilator and and this one was just as good if not better!!!!</li>
            <li>and sometimes I realized it doesn&#x27;t do a good job with thin hair...but still recommend!</li>
            <li>so be sure to go slow.</li>
            <li>It is almost like they are providing false advertising which, to be honest, irks me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it three stars because if you are willing to spend more time during and between using the epilator to save money on buying a more expensive alternative than I would suggest this product, but I think I will be purchasing a quality one later down the road.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest just paying the extra money to have a professional wax you as they can get it done extremely quick and with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>Epilaiton is so painful that I need to be in hot water to open up the pores and have the hair slip out more easily.</li>
            <li>Hurts the first few times, but supposed to hurt less the more it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice little gadget.</li>
            <li>Love this epilator and it&#x27;s ability to pluck small hairs!</li>
            <li>&quot; Overall, I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied, I will use the product a few more times and give an update, but if I&#x27;m not entirely happy with this product I will definitely take advantage of the 45 day full money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t skip your legs in the shower and it will be clean, painless sailing as long as you&#x27;re patient for your first few uses, use it as directed, and don&#x27;t try it on overly sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t skip your legs in the shower and it will be clean, painless sailing as long as you&#x27;re patient for your first few uses, use it as directed, and don&#x27;t try it on overly sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I  am very satisfied with my new epilator, I really love it, it is not as painful as other epilators.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wide flat area, and this way the rotating of the tweezing disks assisted in smooth forward movement of the epilator.</li>
            <li>Had some concerns at first because of my dry skin, but the exfoliating cream should be used with this.  </li>
            <li>This particular epilator seems to have about 15 sets of tweezers, which is a small area, really, so it is very time consuming and it does not get all the hairs the first time</li>
            <li>I can tell a big difference with the hair coming in as far as less often and softer so easy to pluck</li>
            <li>but I controlled by going in small areas and zapping it off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, compact and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I like it very much, but expected it to last much longer.</li>
            <li>but first of all, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair on a single roll/swipe.</li>
            <li>In addition to grabbing his hairs completely, it did leave his skin red and slightly bumpy the next day, which I was surprised about because his skin is a lot more durable than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you go slow it leaves you very clean with just a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My least favorite part is cleaning it, but If you want it to work properly every time you have to clean it at lest every 4 uses, but that applies to any other epilator on the market.</li>
            <li>I am as pale as pale can be, so my hair shows even under my skin, this hurt the first 10 seconds then was fine!</li>
            <li>This little machines is pretty noisy so be ready to crank up the volume on anything you may be listening to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SO, waste of materials, no at all evironmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>More comfortable than waxing, lasts longer, less expensive and very convenient.</li>
            <li>I have only used the 1st settings because it already seemed very fast and the couldn&#x27;t imagine how the second one felt like.</li>
            <li>Although the package says it is for legs only, I use it on my legs, underarms and down there (the top and side part only, I still use wax on the sentitive part).</li>
            <li>It last years until you have to buy a new one!</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator i have ever purchased, and I will tell you right now that I don&#x27;t have any regrets with the money I have spent on this.</li>
            <li>cord is pretty long,which is good and bad.  </li>
            <li>My understanding is that the more regularly you use it the less the hairs grow back.</li>
            <li>Even though I was terrified, it hurt less than I was expecting, and felt similar to a constant static or electric shock on my legs.</li>
            <li>My previous epilators (from a different brand) were only able to run after charging it.</li>
            <li>I know that the first time takes longer than most, but after using it for a half hour on a small section of my leg, my skin became irritated and there was still hair there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not pleased that the description states: &amp;#34;Cordless epilator gives you soft, smooth skin head-to-toe,&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s not cordless at all.</li>
            <li>it just takes a number of passes to get all the hairs, I try going in different directions if it doesn&#x27;t get them up after the first two initial passes.</li>
            <li>Similar to the older I have.</li>
            <li>less messier than wax and quick .</li>
            <li>Using Aloe after it during those first few times really helps.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to pay a higher price for a male version when you can find either one that operates with the same power.</li>
            <li>It is a bit uncomfortable at first, as it starts grabbing hair, but as you progress it gets better.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I would either shave or tweeze the hairs on my leg one strand at a time, which not only took forever, but for some reason, seemed to hurt more.  </li>
            <li>Discomfort for first time users especially if you have coarser hair, but definitely does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use it anywhere besides my legs because I can barely stand that pain, but it&#x27;s perfect for people who hate shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>If I barely skim my face and under my chin with the epilator on low speed, gently, gently I remove that shadow of hair without any irritation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets better though, once you get it on a schedule the hairs come in more fine and in less density making the experience much easier and less painful.</li>
            <li>My main issue was that it caused an enormous amount of ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend getting a wax first and then using this epilator once the hairs start growing back.  </li>
            <li>I had a LOT of hair break off, not actually be ripped out, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>After epilating the same spots as the first time, I decided to give the skin on my chest a break and see if any hair grew back.</li>
            <li>have used several different kinds of epilators through the years--including the first Epilady, which was an instrument of torture whipped up by the Marquis de Sade, I think--</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t totally used to the product the first time, so I went over everything a second time in hopes to capture hairs</li>
            <li>in which I like more because my other one was rechargeable and the charge didn&#x27;t last as long as I wished.</li>
            <li>and there is this cool little attatchment which prevents ripping at your skin etc</li>
            <li>and I have consistently noticed that 1/2 of the leg that I used the epilator on has limited hair re-growth!</li>
            <li>I highly re comes it especially for this price.!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone, even you men who want to get rid of your back hair!  </li>
            <li>my hair now comes thin and its super easy and fast to pass the epilator and for two weeks/week and a half (for my armpits)</li>
            <li>High tension skin only.</li>
            <li>I could clearly see that the waxed areas still had dark roots but those epilated areas were white and clean.</li>
            <li>This is my very first epilator, and previously all I&#x27;ve ever done for hair removal is shave.</li>
            <li>so far I have the same gret product but new.</li>
            <li>Even with the adapter on and using the slow speed you would need to have an incredibly high pain tolerance to do any significant area in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>smooth and painless compared to a previous type used for several years.</li>
            <li>If done correctly you can minimize the pain (tighten up the skin and only lightly contact it with the epilator), and hurts way less than waxing.</li>
            <li>, it did hurt a little when i was doing my underarms, and especially since im right handed, i couldnt do my right underarm properly, and it did hurt</li>
            <li>As you continue to epilate once a week it gets less painful and you get better at being more consistent with the hair you&#x27;re pulling out.</li>
            <li>you might want to do this on a weekend until your skin gets used to it as well, because I had some pretty bad redness and soreness the first time that lasted for the better part of a day.</li>
            <li>It is small and light weight however its size does not interfere with its ability to remove hair.  </li>
            <li>You control the use  and speed (I rarely ever use the second setting), the first couple times I would do small sections at a time and take breaks in between</li>
            <li>The long cable is really helpful for my case.</li>
            <li>I would go as long as I thought I could get away with going before shaving, but it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>It was smooth on the small patch I used it on</li>
            <li>Would take much too long - for that</li>
            <li>I just wish epilators in general weren&#x27;t so loud.</li>
            <li>wow this thing hurts and barely worked.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to continue because of how long it was taking and how much pain</li>
            <li>Works good more painful than waxing but not as messy</li>
            <li>First of all, I expected pain from reading reviews.</li>
            <li>I put some lotion on and by the next morning the skin looked normal again.</li>
            <li>I even took off that dumb cap, as I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s only there for psychological reasons...</li>
            <li>Knowing it could end result in minimal shaving, I was willing to suck it up.</li>
            <li>The good thing is, those few hairs that were not removed from the roots-you can definitely see them grow in a few days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few after doing my full lower leg, and it did frustrate me to no end because it looked noticeable (to me, anyway)</li>
            <li>but after a few uses its not bad.  </li>
            <li>I was shaving every single day and, no matter what, could always feel stubble in certain areas.</li>
            <li>and they are so red and have huge little bumps all over the surface.</li>
            <li>important: the Braun came with a carrying pouch, a little cleaning brush, and three different swappable heads.</li>
            <li>do wish that I had spent a little more money and bought one that was cordless as well.  </li>
            <li>I think cheap or expensive ones all are the same pretty much.</li>
            <li>I would be careful with this one: after less than two months of light usage, the power cord is starting to get temperamental - it needs to be folded in certain ways, otherwise the epilator stops running.</li>
            <li>I find that the pain is fairly easy to deal with, btu I do have to be careful to stretch the skin well with one hand while managing the epilator with the other.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m only now noticing new hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I got used to it and actually honed in on it as that meant I was in a new place and</li>
            <li>I searched online for several days trying to find something new to try when I heard about epilators.</li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for a new method of hair removal, I would definitely recommend this product.wn hairs.</li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for a new method of hair removal, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This definitely compares to the new Phillips epilator for $100.</li>
            <li>The only reason I need a new one is because I dropped mine on the tile floor and it no longer pulls out my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually being lenient with this review on this product, mainly because I was not aware it was only intended for legs only by design, and I also did not know one needed to use these things shortly after a couple of days of exfoliation, and shortly after a shower to loosen the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried the No!No! before (HUGE waste of money, plus gross smelling!)</li>
            <li>It worked well, especially for it&#x27;s price, but I think $40 is way too much for something that won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>However the hair takes much longer to grow back compared to shaving, and it does appear to be growing back thinner.</li>
            <li>Overall, from someone who could shave twice a day and still have stubble, I love epilating because at least when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>When I went back and checked the advertisement I found a chart at the very end of ALL Philips products did show whether cord or cordless, facial or non, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even had decent success on my upper lip, though I needed to get a few straggling hairs with manual tweezing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had another epilator prior to this that would take much longer to cover the same area.</li>
            <li>I have tried my wife&#x27;s epilation prior to purchasing my own...mainly because she would nag too much about her epilator being left unclean etc....</li>
            <li>I would remove the hairs and it seemed like the area was smooth, but a few days later (about 3 days)</li>
            <li>Now I only need one razor for my underarms and genital area and that will last me much longer than if I had to do my legs every night.</li>
            <li>Now I only need one razor for my underarms and genital area and that will last me much longer than if I had to do my legs every night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve personally found that this epilator works pretty well, so long as you take it slow and easy with plentiful breaks.</li>
            <li>The next day I took care of the ingrown hairs which is common, and used the epilator once more.</li>
            <li>A few more tries and I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought this product because I was getting tired of shaving and the hairs growing back thicker.</li>
            <li>My hair grows back much more slowly and thinner now.</li>
            <li>Maybe it hurts more for thick coarse hair?</li>
            <li>Just take it slow and easy.</li>
            <li>Slow and easy.</li>
            <li>Go slow, have a strong drink, pat your skin where it hurts, put on some music, and chill</li>
            <li>This gadget costs less than a single leg wax, has lasted two years, and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>That area was sensitive, but not as sensitive as the high edge of the triangle of hair, in the center.</li>
            <li>The only thing I want to say is that it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li>The knee area, around the sides, and on the back of the knee are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>But it is still a lifesaver for my upper legs (which are very sensitive &amp; prone to razor burn) and my bikini area</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is so loud!</li>
            <li>As a first time user, I can&#x27;t compare this epilator with other brands.</li>
            <li>It hurts at first, but then I just got excited that I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave every other day, and no more pain.  </li>
            <li>I have taken to epilating my once every 2-2.5 weeks which is a major improvement from shaving every couple of days.</li>
            <li>I have not used it on my upper lip which everyone says is so painful yet because I really don&#x27;t have that problem, but on your chin it is is just wonderful and just a little pinch.  </li>
            <li>more and more often the same product.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed.</li>
            <li>The hair usually grows back the next day but this took more than a week.</li>
            <li>The first few times I epilated my armpits they became very irritated but this only lasted overnight.</li>
            <li>The epilating rotating wheel is not sharp and you will not cut yourself.  </li>
            <li>I use mine all over, from the face (light peach fuzz above the lip and on the chin), underarms, and all the way down to the private bits.</li>
            <li>This is a decent little epilator for the price, though I really wish it came with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>I like that it is corded, not rechargeable, and the cord is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to be right next to an outlet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as other epilators in the market (I can see a couple of roots that get trimmed down to the skin rather than pulled out), but it certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li>it can also get small hairs and after using it my skin is soft and clean, the other feature is it is so fast</li>
            <li>I cannot shave because it leaves super painful bumps, and nicks, that have left permanent scars on my legs, no matter what kind of &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; formula shaving cream I tried.</li>
            <li>I did a small area on my tummy, which didn&#x27;t hurt and it did a great job balding the spot.&lt;br /&gt;However thick corse hair!</li>
            <li>It has a decent long cord.</li>
            <li>I am still excited to use it in the next few days.</li>
            <li>Seems to pull a bit more due to speed of product - I have tried a few  this was to replace the one that took a walk..</li>
            <li>She has coarser hair, whereas mine is a mix of thick and fine.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair, I say try it, but if you have fine hair</li>
            <li>Plenty of little tweezers that rarely brake the hairs.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use for my under arm hair and despite the little bit of pain, the results were so worth it.</li>
            <li>So I will continue using this for pubic and armpit hair (nice long lasting results on the pubic area, somewhat less long lasting on armpits)</li>
            <li>I clean it by holding an old toothbrush up to it while it&#x27;s rotating on slow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First things first: Holy cow, I must have really sensitive skin because there were moments when my skin actually bled.</li>
            <li>only good thing I can say about the Philips vs the Braun is that this epilator is far less painful, but that being said, it is only because it doesn&#x27;t actually pick up most of the hair.  </li>
            <li>I was a little red after but not bad.</li>
            <li>While I still have to shave 1-2 times/week, it is significantly less than every single day and smooth as satin for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>It pretty much just grabs those short little jerks causing the pain but not actually removing the hair.</li>
            <li>First off, I am a man who also bought this for his first epilation session, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other epilators, but it hurts less than waxing and tattoos.  </li>
            <li>Never used a more expensive one, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine they could work much better than this.</li>
            <li>Using it on my legs is not too painful and I feel it is a great alternative to shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>It works great, painful but tolerable.</li>
            <li>Not so painful on the arms and legs, if you&#x27;re experienced with the sensation of having been waxed.</li>
            <li>Great for peach fuzz on face, not as painful as legs</li>
            <li>This product is useless as a hair removal device but amazing as a torture device.</li>
            <li>Works great but a bit painful</li>
            <li>At least my underarms will be hair free</li>
            <li>this review toward epilating in general.</li>
            <li>At least my underarms are smooth for a month plus.  </li>
            <li>It was painful to use at first, but you kind of get the feel of it.</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair so not sure how it would work on darker, hairier women.</li>
            <li>The Phillips HP6401 is small enough to fit in the pam of my hand.  </li>
            <li>I would rather spend five minutes everyday for smooth legs than have to spend all day long every week to epilate.</li>
            <li>It is scary at the first use, with the sound and the pain.</li>
            <li>It´s supper comfortable to carry and small enough to store it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I normally purchased much more expensive epilators (Emjois), and I was nervous to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>(even though the directions clearly say to use on legs only.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it first during a cold Minnesota winter, so</li>
            <li>So far the girls have only used it on their legs.</li>
            <li>Minimal pain and gets most of the job done in only a few passes.</li>
            <li>My legs seem to only be sensitive along the shin, and I don&#x27;t shave my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it was relatively painless for an epilator.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to the lasting results on my legs since this epilator is actually made specifically for legs but definitely will not use it on my legs anymore.</li>
            <li>and I barely see any growth.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that its a bit loud.</li>
            <li>If you can bare the pain, go ahead.</li>
            <li>I only have to use this every 6 weeks or so, which beats every week by far.</li>
            <li>o.o</li>
            <li>It works and doesn&#x27;t hurt that much as was expected.</li>
            <li>they all work the same way as far as the mechanism itself.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend use in sensitive areas, such as under arm.</li>
            <li>will definitely use this on my lower legs and again on my pits &amp;#34;gasp&amp;#34;  Even when sober.  </li>
            <li>Works well on Mom&#x27;s sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>This item barely works my legs</li>
            <li>It works fast, minimal pain (compared to waxing), and it worked on underarms as well as bikini area.</li>
            <li>but it barely gets the stubbles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I considered starting to make appointment for professional waxing again, but the cost per event was just not going to be feasible.</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>if anything, I have far fewer ingrown hairs than when I shaved regularly.    </li>
            <li>My old epilator, a rechargeable cordless model, started losing its charge after only two years.</li>
            <li>So far my wife loves her Christmas present.</li>
            <li>I had barely any leg hair.</li>
            <li>I barely used it once every two weeks.</li>
            <li>Enough time has not yet elapsed to see a marked difference</li>
            <li>It takes several passes to completely remove the hair.</li>
            <li>It seriously missed about half the hair no matter how many passes and attempts to stand the hair up straight</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s loud enough for someone to askyou what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it is not painful---or at least not painful for someone used to waxing.</li>
            <li>My first was a $25.00 one (it&#x27;s blue and pink, can&#x27;t remember the name.)</li>
            <li>The more you anticipate the pain and hesitate, it makes it worse.</li>
            <li>I did have to go over some areas a few times, but it&#x27;s worth it to not have to shave.</li>
            <li>I also tried it in my hand and because the hair was much more thin</li>
            <li>Be sure the epilator is at 90degrees to your skin, otherwise you might get broken</li>
            <li>it seems to work on thicker hair better than thin hair.</li>
            <li>Plus, because it leaves so many broken off hairs</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is true, but you can experiment with it.</li>
            <li>like epilators over waxing because it&#x27;s not as messy/sticky, but this one almost isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my ancient Emjoi, but I&#x27;m afraid it just isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Hairs were more often broken than pulled.  </li>
            <li>I just try to go over the hair slowly and try not to go over an area too many times - this will also cause some minor irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of lame, that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so small and sweet</li>
            <li>Also, it takes a pretty long time to epilate my legs (probably about 20 mins) because this is not the most expensive product out there.</li>
            <li>So u may have to shave or use another method on top of this to get rid of those thin hair</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a nice expensive Epilator</li>
            <li>This little tool banged them right out</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this little beauty and the price was right</li>
            <li>After my first round, I had a little bit of redness that went away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>after I was wearing skinny jeans, I took them off to find my legs all red and a little bit tender to the touch like mild razor burn.</li>
            <li>I went nice and slow up and down my legs to see if that helped the machine take the hairs from the root and</li>
            <li>The first time will really hurt, but after that it only takes about half a minute to get used to it (minus the more sensitive areas like behind the knee).  </li>
            <li>Have it face up toward you for your first stroke, then turn it and go down your legs.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use my own tweezers or just go get waxed, it would be faster and most likely less painful.</li>
            <li>This is a decent basic model, but definitely seems like something worth putting a little extra money into.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something a bit less messy (and I liked the idea of not waiting until hair is long to remove).  </li>
            <li>I thought it was just my delicate dry skin causing me to get so many ingrown hairs before.</li>
            <li>although this device is a bit painful and might not be everyones favorite thing to use but its efficient and quick.</li>
            <li>I mean, nothing is going to get you smooth like a razor blade.</li>
            <li>It doesnt get my legs silky smooth, but i no longer have to worry about my legs appearing hairy and no more razor bumps!</li>
            <li>So I kept shaving my right armpit for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>The thick ones get plucked right, but the fine ones just get broken off, so the hair grows back funny.</li>
            <li>and it did hurt less than the first time, but</li>
            <li>Well, I am a redhead and it&#x27;s hard to tell if this thing is working because I have fine blonde hair on my legs.</li>
            <li>Had to do it every three or four days at first due to hairs being in various stages of growth</li>
            <li>I bought this particular one because it has the same number of 4 and 5 ratings as more expensive models.</li>
            <li>A little uncomfortable for the first couple of times but with some alcohol OR pain reliever in the system this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I saw one at a store not long ago and off to Amazon I go!!</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t epilated before and shaving irritates the crab out of you then buy this epilator at least for first timers it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>It worked fairly decent, but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>For those who are not used to it ,well it&#x27;s a little bit painful, but the result is awesome in some months</li>
            <li>but this is on a whole other level of pain in MY opinion.</li>
            <li>The Remington model was not and it was hard to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>after all, what girl wants to hear something like this from other girls every time she changes for gym class: &amp;#34;Eeeew...</li>
            <li>Even though it looked smooth it felt bumpy, so I am not sure if it is actually pulling the hair out from as deep as it should.</li>
            <li>First, let me give a little background history on my experiences with hair removal in general.</li>
            <li>I found that if I went in fast little spurts the initial sting was nothing, and after a few minutes your zipping along in your own little world.  </li>
            <li>I also think (or at least I like to think) that I have a pretty high tolerance to pain.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations because of all the good reviews I read, but was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li>Because those little metal graspers move very fast and screech.  </li>
            <li>I tried waxing but that takes so long, you have to wait for your hair to grow back in, and you have to take a shower and clean up the mess you made.</li>
            <li>Charger comes with American plug so you will need to get yourself a local plug adaptor if you live outside the States.</li>
            <li>And for those who are brave enough to venture to their underarms: This will be tear-inducing painful.</li>
            <li>It seems to be less painful (almost no pain) and seems to do a better job of getting the hair at the root instead of breaking the hair and leaving the root, AND it gets more hairs per pass</li>
            <li>My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have a light</li>
            <li>little unit which is so easy to use is unbelievably fast  for its small size!</li>
            <li>Only complaint about this product is that it has to be plugged in - can&#x27;t move to different locations as easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it one star because the description is misleading, it states that this is a total body hair removal system, but the directions in the package clearly state that it should only be used on the legs.</li>
            <li>I clearly wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything with Nair, but that was only my personal experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that the more I use it, the less and less my hair is starting to grow back.</li>
            <li>I bought another epilator (much more expensive), and it did not work nearly as well</li>
            <li>Sooo... the last time I had my legs professionally waxed, it felt like my skin was being ripped off like some medieval torture technique.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see this as a big problem, as the same thing used to happen with my old electric razor.</li>
            <li>Package arrived before expected, first time I have ever used an epillator, and dont know how Ive lived this long without one.</li>
            <li>If you naturally have finer body hair, that starting pain threshold will be respectively lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My legs did feel the tiniest bit stubbly afterwards, possibly from some hairs being broken instead of pulled, but it was better than my electric razor can do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hairs were getting pulled out like magic, and smooth-looking skin was left behind.</li>
            <li>However, I found more of the hair was broken above the skin line rather than being pulled.  </li>
            <li>I still think it&#x27;s worth using, especially at this price point, shaving to me always feels like a hassle and a waste of water.</li>
            <li>This product does not work NEAR as well, and after the first 2 uses has a small crack in the head cover surrounding the tweezing discs.</li>
            <li>Really cuts down on any body odor, deodorant goes on so smooth and no more razor burn!  </li>
            <li>And this is because there were multiple hair follicles in those particular hair canals (3-4 hair follicles in a single canal)</li>
            <li>First time it can hurt a little..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little painfull at first</li>
            <li>First time I used the epilator it hurt a lot,but then I got used to it, it hurts a little bit</li>
            <li>Hello, little friend ;))))</li>
            <li>I was a little weary at first to buy this based on reviews.</li>
            <li>Have you ever had little drops of hot oil splatter on you while you&#x27;re cooking?</li>
            <li>I use it exactly how the instructions directed me to, but I saw a little to no results.</li>
            <li>Does it hurt a little at first?  </li>
            <li>the first time it hurts a little</li>
            <li>The second time, I got smart and used it just as my hairs were coming in, soooooo much better the second time around, less pain, less hair, less effort.  </li>
            <li>I attempted the hair removal creams next, I had more success with the Veet Sensitive Formula with Aloe, than I did the Nair, which I tried before the Veet, and it left second degree burns on the backs of both my legs, plus it smelled really bad.</li>
            <li>i ordered this so i wouldn&#x27;t have to shave everyday especially with summer right around the corner and after reading everyone&#x27;s reviews i went ahead and ordered it</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t say it hurts less than waxing, especially the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>After the first use it took a week and a half, maybe almost two weeks, for my underarm hair to start growing back.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want super long hairs when you epilate, so shave a few days beforehand.  </li>
            <li>I learned right away, that this little tool could be used as a form of torture treatment!</li>
            <li>I am a person who really is afraid of pain, but this eplilator is totally fine for me!!</li>
            <li>Figured it would be painful but wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for just how much some of the more sensitive spots would hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that I had to go over the same area several times before it was smooth</li>
            <li>It is definitely more painful for underarm, but it gets better after few trials.</li>
            <li>The plug in has not been an issue for me, as there is a long cord, and it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one took too much time to achieve below average results.</li>
            <li>I have another one that I considered seeing if I could have it professionally maintenanced; I&#x27;ve had it a long time and felt that it wasn&#x27;t pulling the hairs out as efficiently as it used to.  </li>
            <li>It says for use only on the legs, but it barely works on my legs.</li>
            <li>For extra sensitive areas (such as the knees), I turned up the speed and moved the device back &amp; forth faster.  </li>
            <li>after you use it once, the second time you barely feel anything.</li>
            <li>its not heavy and the power source has a long cable to don&#x27;t stop never</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised to find that they have come a long way.</li>
            <li>Apparently when they say that it&#x27;s only for legs there is a  reason, my fault anyway</li>
            <li>AS LONG AS YOU CAN SIT NEAR AN OUTLET.</li>
            <li>The first few times will hurt.</li>
            <li>but I was in pain the first few uses.  </li>
            <li>machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower first, and then dried off and used the epilator.</li>
            <li>Lost its effectiveness after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>If you have never epilated or waxed before - it will hurt the first few times you use it.  </li>
            <li>, the first few times I hurts a bit in some areas.</li>
            <li>While at first time you may feel pains when using this on somewhere with heavy hairs.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a wollybear and want to start using one, you might want to wax first... or take a few shots of whiskey.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use lidocaine and it took me a few nights to remove my first bunch of hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be prepared for some pain the first few uses though if you aren&#x27;t used to having your hairs pulled out at the roots.</li>
            <li>I did have a few ingrown hairs the first time but haven&#x27;t had any since then.</li>
            <li>Hurts like a tattoo first few uses (i would know, im covered in art).</li>
            <li>+Take some NSAIDs and/or glass of wine the first few times.  </li>
            <li>I will update in a few weeks if I can give this product a higher score...or</li>
            <li>I suggest y&#x27;all to do it really slowly because if u go fast it will miss out many hairs so go slowly until it removes all the hair.</li>
            <li>Go slowly and the pull of the hair is not bad.</li>
            <li>A little loud (as other online reviews warned me of prior to purchase), but works well and was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, but be very careful when using on your upper lip.</li>
            <li>Shower and spend a little extra time with wash cloth and HOT water on legs.</li>
            <li>I know you want to get it all done, but seeing how you (and your skin reacts) to the first little introduction is crucial.</li>
            <li>But anyway, when I first epilated my underarms, it did hurt and my skin got a little red..</li>
            <li>i may try other ones but for a beginner as myself this is a decent one.</li>
            <li>I toughed through it and did a few 1 inch sections on each leg, some on the thigh where I have baby fine hair and some on the lower leg where I have super thick, dark hair that grows three hairs</li>
            <li>If it does feel uncomfortable, a little trick is to run it over the skin faster than recommended because it creates a kind of sensation that you really get used to and then can slow down and pluck more hairs without initial sting.</li>
            <li>It still hurts more than my legs, but not as badly as when I first epilated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still hurts more than my legs, but not as badly as when I first epilated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have not shave/wax your leg for a while and let the hair grow, it would be pretty painful when you use this since it would have to catch more hair each time when you have hair almost everywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s louder than my previous epilator, but I really like that the head is detachable and washable.  </li>
            <li>Now i just do epilation once a week or less and the hair that grows after that is much softer and tinier than if you shave.</li>
            <li>felt much softer against the skin with less noise.  </li>
            <li>now i understand why some of the previous reviews stated that it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as some epilators: it doesn&#x27;t pluck out all the hair, so</li>
            <li>Apparently epilating can keep hairs from coming back until about 2 weeks later!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to let hair get as long as when you wax, but get the same benefits of longer without stubble and a natural tapered hair (not blunt and whisker-y) when it does grow in.</li>
            <li>I use this one as my quick, secondary one.</li>
            <li>Actually it only hurts the first few times, but then you get used to it.   </li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that it feels like your skin is being cut off the first few times of use.  </li>
            <li>: Its been a few months since I first used this, and after the initial period of returning to my nether region to de-pube it, I \\&quot;let things go\\&quot; for a while.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hurts quite a bit for the few several uses, and I&#x27;m pretty tolerant of pain.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever purchased and used, and after the initial horrifying experience of getting used to the way it feels, I&#x27;m overall pretty pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I got a few ingrown hairs and red spots on my legs at first, but I dealt with them and kept epilating...</li>
            <li>But if I want to wair for every follicle to grow back in, I&#x27;m gonna have to wait for my underarm to be thick and full of hair again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it on both speeds, going over the areas both slowly and quickly with the epilator facing either way, guard on and off, and still misses hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh and if you wonder if it hurts, it does a little the first few times but you get used to it fast.</li>
            <li>The gears are plastic and wear down fast with any degree of moderate use.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t even complete a single leg before giving up in pain.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than a single wax job, and far lower maintenance than shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot compare the effectiveness of this particular device to other devices, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It is painful the first time, which does get better the next time.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on I was a little terrified but ran it across my should and left it perfectly clear with minimal pain.  </li>
            <li>but my boyfriend tried using it and ended up crying......:) not good for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>my 2 biggest problems with it are the fact that you can only use it on dry skin which results in very dry skin and that i cant really use it anywhere but my legs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone has different types of hair and I happen to have semi-fine, straight black hairs (medium dispersal) on my legs.  </li>
            <li>However, if you do this every week or so (depends on how fast your hair grow), you would only need to deal with the new-grow hair, so less dense hair you would have.</li>
            <li>This epilator is very noisy compared to Braun wet &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>It removes the hair super fast so you don&#x27;t spend useless time.</li>
            <li>In addition, the surface of the discs is irritating the skin so much that after epilating my underarm, for example, it would get extremely red.&lt;br /&gt;The same model from 10 years ago was fantastic, but everything nowadays gets more and more weak and artificial, so we can buy</li>
            <li>on the same area that I managed to get done again, I can&#x27;t really tell you if it hurts less the second time around.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>Fine Hair: 75% removed 25% broken ;</li>
            <li>just like the one i was looking, it works perfectly fine and doesnt leave hairs behind, the people who is looking something that doesnt hurt let me tell you that it doesnt exists but is a pain you can handle.</li>
            <li>Once you get to the initial pain of ripping hairs it works better with thick slightly longer hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also I live in a small studio apartment with a very tiny bathroom that doesn&#x27;t leave me, someone with long legs, much room TO shave.</li>
            <li>Also I live in a small studio apartment with a very tiny bathroom that doesn&#x27;t leave me, someone with long legs, much room TO shave.</li>
            <li>They look tons better and the hair has definitely grown back less thick</li>
            <li>It is ok, just difficult to use if the hairs are not very long.  </li>
            <li>It does hurt a little (I&#x27;m used to waxing so it didn&#x27;t hurt me much)</li>
            <li>For what this little machine should do it&#x27;s doing it very well.</li>
            <li>a little pulling, just dont go fast on legs</li>
            <li>so I think that&#x27;s the reason it didn&#x27;t hurt so much and just felt little pinches instead.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t care as long as it come with the major stuff (bought it from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the old one was large and clumsy to handle.</li>
            <li>I have both thick hair in certain areas and soft hair in others.</li>
            <li>Of course all other methods are a little less comfortable than straight up shaving, but the rough stubble and constant upkeep of shaving was something I outgrew in college.</li>
            <li>Not really worth it for everyday use, but if you are going somewhere special and don&#x27;t want to worry about stubble/shaving I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Laser removal is too expensive (and not an option since most of my leg hairs are too light) and shaving is useless, as I have the distinct impression that those persistent little hairs immediately start growing</li>
            <li>It is a bit painful, but if you&#x27;re careful, and don&#x27;t try to mow through too much, too quickly, it&#x27;s not as bad as the youtube videos of guys freaking out at the first touch of these things appear.</li>
            <li>First it takes too long, second it is painful, and third you really don&#x27;t get that sleekness you get from a fresh razor.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> this is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Portable and great for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use on your legs though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now, and I am still happy with it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with those results as well.</li>
            <li> Works great on face.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I am really happy with the Satinelle and I am buying another one to have as a backup.</li>
            <li> This product works great</li>
            <li> Philips is a great brand.</li>
            <li> it is great product</li>
            <li> wax.&lt;br /&gt;I find it works great.  </li>
            <li> She says it works great</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> GREAT customer service on that part.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that washing with a cleanser with Salicylic acid and a loofa greatly reduces this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I still use it when I feel brave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product, use it monthly for underarm, arms, and legs.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way this one worked just because it took forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits just great in my hand.</li>
            <li> This epilator is just great.</li>
            <li> no where in the packing its mentioned as rechargeable, seeing the plug and wire we thought its a rechargeable one, nevertheless seems my wife is happy..</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> for the results, I am happy.  </li>
            <li> However, everywhere else has been great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Purchased this epilator because of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Great for (Pain is bearable):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs&lt;br /&gt;Arms</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not so great for (Beyond my pain tolerance):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li> That got me through, and I&#x27;m happy to report it</li>
            <li> it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Its great if you can stand the pain.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on the peach fuzz, though, and it&#x27;s great on legs.</li>
            <li> I went with this one and man am I happy I did.</li>
            <li> I then used it again and worked great.</li>
            <li> The price is great.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> I thought this product worked GREAT on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great for  price</li>
            <li> Works great, hurt like a B</li>
            <li> And For a great price.</li>
            <li> It is a great price and does the job.</li>
            <li> Works great on under arms and bikini area have not tried the legs yet.</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> but it works just great</li>
            <li> However, if you can steel yourself and work through the pain, the results are great.</li>
            <li> either lol.</li>
            <li> It works great on her, but not on me.</li>
            <li> Great epilator.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my epilator.</li>
            <li> It is great.</li>
            <li> I was happy to come across this one which has both.</li>
            <li> #1:  OMG, lol, I felt as if I&#x27;d been electrocuted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> and I decided for this brand and model, I so happy with my product.</li>
            <li> I read the tips posted in all of these great reviews.  </li>
            <li> happy with the purchase and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> but yet it does a great job removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> My sister bought an epilator that worked great; it made me want to buy one of my own.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for over 10 years and this one is great.  </li>
            <li> Its great for touch ups between waxes.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> on to the Epilator....I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
            <li> This is fabulous !!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t very effective.  </li>
            <li> but when i do it is very nice</li>
            <li> I found it very effective with even shorter hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective.  </li>
            <li> The Philips &amp;#34;Satinelle&amp;#34; epilator, (model HP6401) is very deserving of praise.</li>
            <li> : It is very effective at removing hair.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both speeds successfully.  </li>
            <li> This is the awesome product that i had purchase and this product is better than shaver...</li>
            <li> Wonderful I love it..</li>
            <li> I would rather prefer something witout cord or rechargable and maybe not that noisy :-p</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; was not horrific :D  </li>
            <li> :) I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love it, and it works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> All in all, my warm recommendation!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s not the best at removing hair like the Braun SE 5180 Silk Epil</li>
            <li> I have been using it since 1 or more years ago and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> :P</li>
            <li> She was thrilled when it arrived!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and would greatly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m LOVING IT!</li>
            <li> I love it, best buy yet!</li>
            <li> Yes, is still nice product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good price for a great value!&lt;br /&gt;Phillips is the best!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, does NOT feel pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and happy with the results of the product.</li>
            <li> It is very good, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> than that great product for sure!</li>
            <li> Great thing :)  use it after taking a bath!</li>
            <li> a good buy</li>
            <li> I should probably buy a good exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Loved it until it died.  </li>
            <li> product would have been more ideal if it came with some instructions or tips which guide you through what to do before and after epilation.</li>
            <li> And she loved it.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be good as per the price..</li>
            <li> it is good but it is noisy.</li>
            <li> I have been plucking them for years, and loved the idea of something automatic to save me time.  </li>
            <li> Good one ...</li>
            <li> I wanted a starter epilator and this was a good choice.</li>
            <li> But although it is cheaper, the quality is really good.</li>
            <li> It was good  </li>
            <li> Follow the direction and it will do a good job for you.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> This could have done her a world of good.  </li>
            <li> Good price do what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li> For the redness like bumps on the skin after epilation, use some good creams and the redness will go away.</li>
            <li> think this device is really good for the money.</li>
            <li> I read some good reviews about it,so i bought.</li>
            <li> I cannot get a good finish.</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job, but maybe epilators are not for me.</li>
            <li> still, i do like to have it if I can get over the pain it does a good job.</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but it still hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly they accepted it even though it was used..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning which is a good length, but experiment from time to time.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m not feeling that it&#x27;s a good substitute for shaving.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> i used it over a month its good</li>
            <li> GOod</li>
            <li> The power cord has a good size so it allows me to use it in the bath tub.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to deal with batteries (the cord is a good length as well)&lt;br</li>
            <li> And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li> good quality for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price - a lot cheaper than others.  </li>
            <li> It is a good alternative to women who cares about the beauty</li>
            <li> Good item for the price</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product for the money.</li>
            <li> It is good.</li>
            <li> Good product and</li>
            <li> so that was good for when I moved.</li>
            <li> And good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t grow immediately like it may after shaving...</li>
            <li> All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product, I used to have a broun brand</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, It had been good.</li>
            <li> It has a good grip as well.</li>
            <li> this one had good reviews and was cheaper too.</li>
            <li> This product is good and delivered on time</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t work as good as this one.</li>
            <li> and I have started to get a lot of ingrown hair which isn&#x27;t good looking with the bumps.</li>
            <li> Works really good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this was a good purchase</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good bye to razor blades and</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 7 months it has worked good but</li>
            <li> This is good on the leg</li>
            <li> It was good at the beginning</li>
            <li> and I loved it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, this is the cheapest epilator I&#x27;ve seen with good reviews</li>
            <li> Received my purchase in really good time, and in good order.  </li>
            <li> Its good.</li>
            <li> and it works good.</li>
            <li> If you have the time to remove hair with this, then this is a good buy.</li>
            <li> In a nutshell, loved the results, loathed the process.</li>
            <li> Fairly good for arms, legs and underarms (it is recommended that you use an antiseptic lotion on your underarms every 2 hours for a day after using this product).</li>
            <li> its a good product to use.</li>
            <li> It turned good.</li>
            <li> Good looking with those flowers.</li>
            <li> I had to drop a star off of the review because it does not get the hair on my knees good</li>
            <li> Pain wise</li>
            <li> So I used waxes and shaving powder for hair removal both of which were fairly ineffective.</li>
            <li> good machine but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> It did a good job of grabbing the hairs, and I didn&#x27;t notice any breaking off.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good to have around.</li>
            <li> I have had another Philips epilators and I loved them.</li>
            <li> This one is good too.</li>
            <li> The hair was gone for a good month before I had to epilate again.</li>
            <li> From shaving to hair removal lotions to waxing, I&#x27;ve tried a fair amount of alternatives.</li>
            <li> wise...</li>
            <li> One thing that you should do with any epilator is to invest in a good exfoliating sponge/brush.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would</li>
            <li> and it had good reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it does a good job keeping those straglers at bay.</li>
            <li> The product is really good.</li>
            <li> You can have a good waxing with sort time.</li>
            <li> gives good hair removal.</li>
            <li> The price was really good</li>
            <li> Loved this product for the month it worked.</li>
            <li> Does a good job removing hairs, even those stubborn ones.  </li>
            <li> This is a good epilator.</li>
            <li> Really good this one.</li>
            <li> Good for what it does.</li>
            <li> If it lasts I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> my legs are fairly hairless.  </li>
            <li> Does a really good job of removing unwanted hair from your body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Over all good looking compact product , however I end up giving them 4 pts as they forgot to send me a cleaning brush which is mentioned as a part of product.</li>
            <li> I think some people did a good job explaining why this product hurts and why it may not.</li>
            <li> The price is good.</li>
            <li> I feel like this would be good to use maybe in between waxing or shaving.</li>
            <li> For the price it was good though.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already had one before and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> This is a good epliator.  </li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> Its good</li>
            <li> you buy one, good luck.  </li>
            <li> This is a good, affordable starter modelthough that can help you test the waters and see if epilation works for you.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> Good luck and hope you achieve your hairless goals.</li>
            <li> I can use it for almost every part of my body and get good results.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used, worth your money!</li>
            <li> Fits very easily in the hand and works great at what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li> This one is streamlined, works great and  is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> and honestly, once you put a wax strip on, you kind of don&#x27;t have a choice but to rip it off lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after a couple uses, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll perfect the usage of this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m super impressed with this epilator.</li>
            <li> Luckily it worked great!</li>
            <li> My leg hairs are somewhat fine, and they were about the ideal 3-4 mm length.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I made the decision to get this one.</li>
            <li> The product is very safe to use.</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs and underarms and am very pleased..</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> And the noise when a hair is sucked up is very satisfying.</li>
            <li> Great product, catches even the shortest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> rI love this product it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this nifty contraption.</li>
            <li> Im happy and satisfied.</li>
            <li> The antiseptic/astringent is very important!</li>
            <li> very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This Epilator is great, I love it.</li>
            <li> So happy to have smooth legs all the time!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this epilator.</li>
            <li> Love an epilator and this one is great.</li>
            <li> am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Not the best Satinelle but pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 epilators and have been very satisfied but time does take it&#x27;s toll.</li>
            <li> so I still win. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Work nice, good price.</li>
            <li> If considering, this is a good, inexpensive, handy epilator (for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ( MOST IMPORTANT TIP EVER!!!)</li>
            <li> I am very glad I updated, this works much better!</li>
            <li> I feel like this isn&#x27;t really the best quality wise (you get what you pay for?)</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> With all the \\&quot;painful\\&quot; claims, I decided to still give it a try and am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> Waxing is a much better option for me!</li>
            <li> But after that you will love it!</li>
            <li> I totally love this product!</li>
            <li> Did not work well, had to go over areas way too many times and still did not remove any hair!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ignored them and bought it anyways!</li>
            <li> But this time I did more research!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> If you get ingrown hairs after, it&#x27;s okay!</li>
            <li> ok, it still works!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Okay so, I have ZERO tolerance for pain!</li>
            <li> I love the results!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I was really impressed because it seemed like it had plucked every hair.</li>
            <li> Thought it would work better than this, it doesn&#x27;t even pull the hairs out!</li>
            <li> I seriously love it!</li>
            <li> Much better than shaving!</li>
            <li> so im satisfied!</li>
            <li> But trust me, it gets better!</li>
            <li> Spend the money and get a better one!</li>
            <li> I am glad i ordered it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll tell you FOR SURE!  </li>
            <li> If you are trying the epilator for the first time, it is best to try it over the winter season when shaving your legs isn’t a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed an upgrade and love this!</li>
            <li> First of all, I think this product is awesome in theory.</li>
            <li> and I still could not get most of the hairs in one setting!</li>
            <li> IT took awhile and have to read many reviews!</li>
            <li> My advice is if you&#x27;re looking to buy an epilator for the first time, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> okay I get it, but damn!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure what sort of disaster I was going to have on my hands, but this unit took care of it with no problem!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> so it was even better!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you exfoliate a lot!</li>
            <li> I have even brought most of my family to the hairless side mua hahah!  </li>
            <li> I love Philips!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have now completed both legs and love that I haven&#x27;t had to shave in over 5 days!  </li>
            <li> Still smooth!!</li>
            <li> This is better!</li>
            <li> I prefer to be able to sit and get a close up look at my legs when I shave them!</li>
            <li> I prefer to be able to sit and get a close up look at my legs when I shave them!</li>
            <li> Maybe others have had better luck but not this gal!</li>
            <li> Love this thing!</li>
            <li> takes more time to hair grow compared to shaving legs!</li>
            <li> Better than the rechargable type because this one doesn&#x27;t stop working!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty impressed!!</li>
            <li> I love this machine!</li>
            <li> I have never been this satisfied with results in a beauty product before!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t even aware they made corded ones :D  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and does not hurt at all..just a pinch which is normal!!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, it&#x27;s not the most pleasant thing in the world to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, and great outcomes.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, does a great job of removing hair on legs.</li>
            <li> (read my wife) am pretty satisfied with the purchase - good for beginners and great value for money!</li>
            <li> Good machine and easy to use with good results</li>
            <li> (remember to exfoliate first!!!!)</li>
            <li> Its great on fine, fuzzy hair but not thicker coarser hair.</li>
            <li> and bikini.doesn&#x27;t work well for fine hair,which is arm and legs!i&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li> It would be great if it were cordless, but for this price, I&#x27;m totally fine with it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very handy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she is comfortable and happy about it.</li>
            <li> cheap and great.</li>
            <li> do believe that the skin irritation would  have persisted, but I found another amazing product called Gly-luronic acid serum (makeup artists choice).</li>
            <li> works amazing for under arm</li>
            <li> my skin has never felt this amazing.</li>
            <li> It works great, as it should, leaving my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing</li>
            <li> They looked AMAZING.</li>
            <li> it works amazing. .</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> is perfect, but I really, it hurts a lot of pain, but the results are excellent, if anyone knows how to avoid pain tell me, I really need</li>
            <li> but it got the job done after a couple run overs and her legs are amazingly smoother than using a razor on them.</li>
            <li> when I don&#x27;t feel like waxing I use it.. and amazing results.</li>
            <li> Great product, it tends to hurt but leaves the skin smooth</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I could feel the hairs being ripped out, and honestly, I started shaking and sweating from the pain.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li> and I was a hairy wookie (on purpose just to make this session effective).</li>
            <li> I had to warm myself up to it</li>
            <li> However, the product itself is just not that effective.  </li>
            <li> it was inexpensive, but with good reviews for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I was kind of bummed, until I unwrapped the cord.</li>
            <li> But effective.</li>
            <li> I find it an effective longterm solution.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before choosing this one and chose it because of the good reviews and the price.</li>
            <li> Have you suffered through your own hymenal rupture, birthed a child or suffered the stinging agony of being rejected by a man?</li>
            <li> They do cause ingrown hairs, so as they say, it is more wise to exfoliate in a warm shower beforehand.</li>
            <li> but honestly I think it&#x27;s just because you have no idea</li>
            <li> and it is SO NICE not to have to pay for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, though not painless.</li>
            <li> Works perfect and doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.</li>
            <li> You kind of have to let you hairs grow out to see if it works.  </li>
            <li> I liked how it looked a day after I epilated.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it to see how effective it is at removing hair and softening regrowth.</li>
            <li> It is not that effective.</li>
            <li> This Phillips is nice for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things that I liked about this product:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun was purchased for about $30 more, so this Philips unit is still a good deal.</li>
            <li> However stuck with it and loving the result</li>
            <li> and I will update this if my thoughts change which I kind of expect them</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t as effective as I would have liked for pulling out shorter hairs</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product, looked and felt good in your hand.</li>
            <li> pay more and get a really good quality one...</li>
            <li> I used this on my arms and actually really really liked the results.</li>
            <li> I really liked this epilator.</li>
            <li> :) LOL he would love that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled about this beauty device and even feel a bit &amp;#34;stupid&amp;#34; for not giving it a try years ago.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of pain everyone else is or isn&#x27;t used to</li>
            <li> Maybe just a defective one, otherwise, it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that kind of time to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is nice.</li>
            <li> I want to be sure that I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs, which would be another good way to measure the effectiveness of the epilator.</li>
            <li> hairless in just minutes without struggling with warm wax in the summer heat.</li>
            <li> How nice.</li>
            <li> My wife tried and liked it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to everyone who wants an affordable epilator to do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I used to own a rechargeable Braun Silk-Epil unit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I need to try when my skin is warm after bath.</li>
            <li> M loving it.</li>
            <li> It removes the hairs quite effectively.</li>
            <li> and it really is effective.  </li>
            <li> Nice alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li> I also used this on my face to remove some peach fuzz that gets in the way of smooth makeup application and have been very happy with how smooth my face is now.  </li>
            <li> Handy tip</li>
            <li> Something I remembered from being waxed years ago is your hair has its own growth cycle.</li>
            <li> So if you are using it elsewhere, you do so at your own risk.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product removes hair great in not that much tie.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have to buy another kind again soon</li>
            <li> however, when attempting to use it i found it just did not remove hair effectively.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have good lighting</li>
            <li> the wire kind of restricts movement..</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to pay more than $30 for a good epilator.</li>
            <li> it is a really good purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> Every time you do it, you kind of expect what it feels like at that point</li>
            <li> but keep in mind you can&#x27;t wait until you have a forest growing in your armpits because then it&#x27;ll hurt no matter what kind of epilator you have.</li>
            <li> i kinda liked this.</li>
            <li> The product it self was nice, but damn did that hurt.</li>
            <li> This epilator I purchased to use on my face, it is effective and does what it claims.</li>
            <li> and I am loving it.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with the results I get, whether it be on my legs</li>
            <li> But that is just anecdotal evidence, so you may want to do your own research if you are looking for permanent hair</li>
            <li> The pain honestly feels like a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Honestly.</li>
            <li> They never claimed it was a painless method, just that it was effective.</li>
            <li> I end up epilating against the grain, which is something everyone tells me not to do, but I honestly have no choice.</li>
            <li> she told me to buy my own.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this kind of epilator for 12 years.</li>
            <li> I use it on areas of my body that have had laser hair removal (laser isn&#x27;t 100% effective)</li>
            <li> TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</li>
            <li> Get a loofa or a nice exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</li>
            <li> Get a loofa or a nice exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> so maybe I have to figure out my own method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d honestly rather wax.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a product comes along that is so effective, that it deserves accolades.</li>
            <li> I had good results with it most of the time but there were issues with hairs breaking instead of being removed.</li>
            <li> With that said, it&#x27;s kind of supposed to hurt because it&#x27;s pulling your hair out from the root.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> After doing this, all I can think about aside from my own mind bending pain is how on earth</li>
            <li> I found this is a good product for its price and works fantastic !</li>
            <li> honestly.</li>
            <li> I immediately tried it and it&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li> I thought I got a nice product that would help me pull out my underarm hair in affordable price</li>
            <li> This item was not as effective in hair removal as others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the two speed settings since the highest speed seems to be the best for me.</li>
            <li> It was kind of humiliating.  </li>
            <li> and I liked it.</li>
            <li> If your use to that I could see it working great very powerful</li>
            <li> If you are used to this type of product, this one is very good, and the fact that you can wash the head is a huge plus to help keep it clean!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s totally worth it!!!  </li>
            <li> and then I won&#x27;t even have to worry about packing a razor!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the purchase in my opinion!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary:  this particular epilator is awesome and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I eventually got my hands on the original Epilator and fell in love!!</li>
            <li> NOT PAINFUL # HAPPY</li>
            <li> This one wasn&#x27;t as good at catching my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Needed a new one and this is thee very best one ive ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to know if anyone else has experienced this, and if over time the legs are actually smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is a good size and easy to use though.</li>
            <li> and of course it shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have enough power and when I look at the tweasers the ends don&#x27;t even line up perfectly like good tweasers</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to use.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s very easy to hold&lt;</li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this product! :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite glad i&#x27;m not paying for wax at the salon or shaving every day before yoga class! :)</li>
            <li> It was not expensive, but it does everything good!</li>
            <li> * most importantly!!</li>
            <li> Love the price and love how it works!</li>
            <li> i like it because its easy to use and it really works and do all the thing that tell you and its a good a very good price for this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use,the top is washable, and after using it once I&#x27;m happy of the result I use it mostly for my forearms and underarm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for first time users, but you always have to prepare yourself for some pain!</li>
            <li> Great buy for the first timer!</li>
            <li> Great first epilator!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it works but there may be more effective (albeit a bit pricier) options.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wish it came with a nice pouch to put everything in, but I&#x27;ll just make one :)</li>
            <li> With a razor, you have a perfect full blanket of stubble in 3 days or so and wonder if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Trust me, the joy you get with seeing all your hair disappear makes the discomfort worth it.</li>
            <li> Satinelle Epilator 20 years ago and have had great success and satisfaction with it.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a nice but cheap epilator go for it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to have a plan of action before happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gorgeous baby smooth skin after applying it.</li>
            <li> The epilator is beautiful, and is exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Before you ever shave the hair&#x27;s soft and an epilator would work perfectly for the rest of one&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, love it.</li>
            <li> I choose this one and so far I am very happy about it.</li>
            <li> And probably more effective.</li>
            <li> Works great, worth the price</li>
            <li> Lighter, more efficient, nice that head can be washed with water</li>
            <li> The removable head has been handy in making sure it is cleaned after every use (and therefore I&#x27;ve had no issues with sanity).</li>
            <li> but it is definately worth it and a great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> but it is definately worth it and a great bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this designed and tested even esoty esoty performance and reviewing their functions and so far I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> Nice but is better to look for the cordless version if you do not have a NEMA outlet in bathroom</li>
            <li> find it most effective for my underarms.</li>
            <li> It´s better than waxing, but in order for it to be effective it needs practice and patience.</li>
            <li> Not to sound spoiled, but you&#x27;d think there would be better options for hair removal by now... :P</li>
            <li> She let me try hers and true to her word, the Braun doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great working product that does a good job, is easy to use, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> package received right away, product works great.</li>
            <li> Works great, I just have to hold is at the right angle</li>
            <li> I also used it under my arms and it worked great and putting on deodorant right after</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t even use it on my arms which is very fine hairs.</li>
            <li> In fairness I have very fine hair, so this may be the issue.</li>
            <li> though I have a bit of stubble, they are very, very fine hairs and unless you&#x27;re rubbing my legs, you can&#x27;t even tell!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My leg hair grows very quickly!]</li>
            <li> My leg hair grows very quickly!]</li>
            <li> It does hurt in the beginning but after the 2nd time you use it, it gets better! :D</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Otherwise though, I STRONGLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time about a month ago &amp; was very happy to see the hairs being pulled right from the root!</li>
            <li> Very good &amp; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> far as the epilator doing a good job removing the hair, it did great.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with it-- some areas need to be gone over a few times - but the results are impressive</li>
            <li> Never going back to razors even the best kind out there.</li>
            <li> , this epilator is easy to clean and is a great size.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> The product is great and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Great for your first one.</li>
            <li> and it is more suitable for legs.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, and although it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I had hoped, I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> so I was pretty brave.  </li>
            <li> Works great if you can get used to it, i have ;)</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m grateful for Amazon and customer reviews for leading me to a great epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunteately, this is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I just taped it and it works fine!</li>
            <li> It results in a very smooth bikini area,</li>
            <li> This item is rather flimsily made, very light.</li>
            <li> My legs are very smooth.</li>
            <li> My legs feel very smooth which never happened with the emjoi.</li>
            <li> Very light.</li>
            <li> Very very light weight.</li>
            <li> I bought it again because it works well and very cheap.</li>
            <li> good product, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quite effective.</li>
            <li> First time using epilator and love it!!</li>
            <li> [At your own risk.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the wonderful world of no bumps, dry hair removal!</li>
            <li> I had this friend in high school you know - beautiful girl - and her prom dress was strapless.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, easy to use, and very effective.</li>
            <li> The picture was 100$ accurate in it&#x27;s depiction!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> but I think that happens with most epilators.</li>
            <li> I love a smooth face!</li>
            <li> your skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;-No more</li>
            <li> I thought maybe this would be a better alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li> love this epilator and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> It gets most of the hairs under my armpits, but sometimes it leaves some.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quick and the pain decreases over time since you get used to it :)</li>
            <li> I put it on the slowest setting because I find that it works better.</li>
            <li> The more you use it, the more you’re legs are desensitised to the pain, hence the quicker you can use it.</li>
            <li> It’s basically that feeling where someone is pulling out your hair, but many at a time.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> they both love it</li>
            <li> and I surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> then more hair was cutted instead of removed.</li>
            <li> Even better than I excepeted for the price.</li>
            <li> For sure you need to get used to the feeling</li>
            <li> Apply some more oil after you epilate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying another one for my best friend!</li>
            <li> but I wanted something more convenient.</li>
            <li> OK but a wireless one would be better</li>
            <li> I exfoliated beforehand and moisturized afterwards, and my legs are feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Is there a better one out there?  </li>
            <li> I love this device.</li>
            <li> but It was so rewarding</li>
            <li> and I am okay with this</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Would be fitting if it were included in Dante&#x27;s Inferno.</li>
            <li> I bought this one hoping it would be more durable than the Emjoi ones.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this one is well made and it seems to pick up slightly more hair and finer hairs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li> Way better than the $20 epilator I had before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update, March 12, 2015: I have had the epilator for more than two months now and it is showing signs of wear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if paying more would get better, but I do know this item</li>
            <li> I have had this epilator for months now and it has paid for itself many times over compared to what I used to pay for waxing.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t even occur to me that this would need to stay plugged in, so many things are cordless nowadays.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I was dealing with reflexive urges to jerk away more than the pain itself.</li>
            <li> Whatever, if I can have awesome-looking legs, I&#x27;m still in love with this</li>
            <li> Much better.</li>
            <li> I like that it has  faster speed, 20 minutes top</li>
            <li> I kept stopping to make sure it was pulling the hairs from the root</li>
            <li> and it was for sure.</li>
            <li> The most I can do with this devil is my underarms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the cheapest, and yet the best of all the epilators I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time and I looked up many YouTube videos and wowsers</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to get every hair</li>
            <li> In fact, this product works better on stouter hair.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smoother &amp; has a better appearance.</li>
            <li> a college student, so let me just say, I can spend my time doing more productive things.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this one works</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> No stubble, no wax, and its FREE!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, i would recommend to try Epilator with more tweets</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> It takes a time or two to get used to this, but it gets better each time you use it.  </li>
            <li> Start at your knees, not your ankles, as the ankle area is more tender.  </li>
            <li> if you are considering about bikini line, you&#x27;d better watch out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There are many contradictory reviews about epilators.</li>
            <li> Many reviews said the epilator was like waxing in terms of discomfort.</li>
            <li> more buying disposables or cream&lt;</li>
            <li> It took some maneuvering to get my skin taut, but I figured it out :)</li>
            <li> Love this Epliator...</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t even hurt:)</li>
            <li> This epilator works better</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> more of a tingling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, and people love what is does to my legs and hands.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s been getting better and better with continued use.</li>
            <li> Sure, the hairs were shorter, but I had stubble.</li>
            <li> I love not having to risk getting cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> And quite pleased about it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only tryed two type of epilators in my life: this and a Braun one and they work the same).&lt;br /&gt;The best part about epilators</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love using this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my all-time favorite product.  </li>
            <li> This one is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The longer the hair is, the more it hurts too.  </li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> More work you say?</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure because of quantity of hair and coarseness of it.</li>
            <li> but i love philips epilators</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked OK.  </li>
            <li> By OK</li>
            <li> Thank you Philips for making such a great product for an affordable price!!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you wash the area</li>
            <li> Make sure you change this out a couple times a day until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Okay, TMI, but</li>
            <li> Which, in my opinion would be okay if I wasn&#x27;t shaving to finish afterwards.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I dealt with that because it says it&#x27;ll take some time to get used to.</li>
            <li> so I plugged it in again for 4 more hrs.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I love this hair remover.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> glad i bought it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I think sometimes it cuts the hair rather then pull it out, but for the most part it works.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Prefer this much more.  </li>
            <li> Grabs more hairs than the epilady.  </li>
            <li> Works OK...</li>
            <li> And now I can enjoy my hair-free legs!</li>
            <li> I still like it better than shaving</li>
            <li> Much better than my epilady speed</li>
            <li> I finally was on the search for one of these epilators that I&#x27;ve heard great things about and came across this one!</li>
            <li> Really love this product and would recommend to anyone....</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> Ok, I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this for my legs and arms :)</li>
            <li> After 2-3 time you will be ok.</li>
            <li> The pain is manageable but expect more pain in (again)</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for my armpits but it works for my legs too.</li>
            <li> I have heard that this epilator works better with coarser hair so that may be my issue.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect,  as I&#x27;ve never owned/used an epilator.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li> I love this item!&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this item I waxed my armpits.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> If I were a woman, or were to convince my wife to use it, I think she would have better results with this than with waxing.</li>
            <li> hurts like owwwwiiieeeee but works well :)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months now and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My legs are smooth for about a week, which is a nice change.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Better than a tweezer.</li>
            <li> I like it :)</li>
            <li> , so I guess it&#x27;s the products one redeeming feature.</li>
            <li> I bought it a year ago and dropped it too many times when using it so it broke</li>
            <li> Hope this helped some of you make a decision :)</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> does it job and better than the 50 dollar one</li>
            <li> THIS IS MAGIC.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilalator with the hopes that I&#x27;s be able use this instead of paying for a wax every six weeks or so.</li>
            <li> otherwise you might have more ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Just be patient when epilating and remember to exfoliate.  :)</li>
            <li> Bought it after reading so many reviews about it.</li>
            <li> Have to go through it many times.</li>
            <li> I love this, I can&#x27;t see up close to tweeze because my glasses with bi focal lenses just don&#x27;t work that way.</li>
            <li> it broke more hair than it pulled out leaving stubble.</li>
            <li> it hurt MORE THAN THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing hurt more than anticipated and then I also had a run with some ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Suppose to get better with more use.</li>
            <li> I will keep it, but might go looking for a better one sometime in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not terribly</li>
            <li> This is way better than waxing.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this many ingrown hairs either.</li>
            <li> It worked okay for a beginner&#x27;s tool I guess.  </li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> Love this epilator.  </li>
            <li> Might work better for someone with more corse hair.</li>
            <li> Also, you do have to go over each section more than once in order to remove all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I kept it in a drawer safe from any moisture and mis-handling but after plugging it in yesterday it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> Not everyone has the luxury of being able to take a day off and wait for the UPS to deliver a $30 package when its convenient for them.</li>
            <li> Over time the more you use it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> and it worked a lot better than the emjoy.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave bumps and removes all (most) of the hair.</li>
            <li> How this works is that it is basically like a bunch of tweezers that rotate and squeeze together at the top to grab your hair and pull it out.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed some more on my legs</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that I can&#x27;t accidentally cut myself with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it lasts longer than shaving, but it comes at a price.</li>
            <li> and I love this.</li>
            <li> If you can capture the hair, it does an amazing job of making legs smooth for longer time.</li>
            <li> I am on a quest to find an epilator that works more efficiently.</li>
            <li> I love my depilator.</li>
            <li> I recommended this to a friend, they bought it, and now they love it as well.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> , I would get an epilator with more speeds or maybe more tweezing blades to make things go faster.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still working on my calf (lower) legs more often - However-- that is because I&#x27;ve shaved my lower legs off &amp; on thru the years.</li>
            <li> It does a better job at getting more hair.</li>
            <li> make sure she never shaves - I so wish I would have never shaved when I was a teenager &amp; had begun with an epilator.</li>
            <li> What I REALLY love are my smooth legs!  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stop touching them :-)  </li>
            <li> the more you do it.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s mostly for women.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Before that it worked OK.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research prior to my purchase and for the price range, this is considered the best.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had better results with that.  </li>
            <li> And the most affordable reliable epilator for the legs out there.</li>
            <li> Love these device.</li>
            <li> After passing over the area many, many times it still did not remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> Secondly I know nothing is perfect.</li>
            <li> You know the hairs are gone when you don&#x27;t feel pain any more.</li>
            <li> If you just want an epilator, this one is okay.</li>
            <li> should buy one more reliable.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove most of the hairs from the root.</li>
            <li> Better designed, the metal tweezers are machined to have closer tolerances resulting in a smother and more efficient (fewer passes) epilation.</li>
            <li> It is painless and the hair becomes more sparse the more you use it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> : The more I have used this epilator, the more my skin is breaking out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I tried.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it gets better the more you use it.</li>
            <li> do wish I&#x27;d gotten the more expansive models which are intended for body hair, rather than</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had too many.  </li>
            <li> Wish it too more hair off by the root.</li>
            <li> Love the color and design.  </li>
            <li> I like it :)</li>
            <li> I bought one for my wife and she loves it, because she had one for more than 10 years</li>
            <li> Though it misses some hair I love this.</li>
            <li> Needs two or more swipes sometimes to catch the missed hair.</li>
            <li> even at low speed it did a great job!!</li>
            <li> and I love not having to shave.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the Philips I decided to give it a try, I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> much better than my battery operated emjoi.</li>
            <li> Many times they fester into acne-type lesions.</li>
            <li> Please splurge a bit more for a better epilator.</li>
            <li> but once I&#x27;d gotten them on a bit of a schedule I can go for a week or more without</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this epilator.</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> I am a woman in my mid-50s who has never been able to find a descent way to remove hair from my legs.</li>
            <li> gadget came was delivered yesterday and today my legs are free of hair, and I&#x27;m not covered in hair-follicle stubble!</li>
            <li> Great deal, works very well.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I see that where I was able to use it the stubborn hairs are gone and</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I noticed that the epilation is more efficient without this cap.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator</li>
            <li> it is so much better than shaving, and leaves smoother skin.</li>
            <li> but you will get used to it. :)</li>
            <li> It met all of my expectations, better than waxing, better than the</li>
            <li> more than pulled them.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy razor blades or worry about stubble</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and it gets easier, and I Love the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for several months and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li> with this epilator, it took more like 5 or 6 passes.  </li>
            <li> And so amount of scrubbing with release them and they can kind of look like a cyst, but you&#x27;re smooth as a baby.</li>
            <li> Love that it plugs in, so you don&#x27;t need batteries or anything.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Hurts quite a bit but works ok though.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it and will use it.  </li>
            <li> you better stick with a braun</li>
            <li> but philips does a better job faster and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten better since.  </li>
            <li> and the more you use it the more you will get use to it.</li>
            <li> This epilator was okay.</li>
            <li> so I returned it and invested in a better one.</li>
            <li> I love the product</li>
            <li> I had to go over areas 5,6,7 times before most of it was gone.</li>
            <li> I thought it was more of a permanent hair removal.  </li>
            <li> I bought one for my mom and my daughter and they love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;But, in my opinion even the rechargeable ones lose their charging capacity after many uses and require them to be plugged in if you want to use them...</li>
            <li> matter how many times, what pattern and direction I went it</li>
            <li> Save up for a better quality one.</li>
            <li> the more you invest in an epilator, the more pluckers it has</li>
            <li> Many yrs.</li>
            <li> ago I had an Epilady at more than 3 times the price as the Satinelle.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a cheap one just to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li> Eventually I&#x27;d like to try one with more power to it.</li>
            <li> The 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is much better, as what he was seeing was hair under the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to just get waxed or pay for Lazer treatment.</li>
            <li> (They aren&#x27;t magic after all).</li>
            <li> bought this today, and I love it already.</li>
            <li> I did my &amp;#34;test areas,&amp;#34; but I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation to do more on my leg.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> Am wondering about combining more than one epilator.</li>
            <li> The 2nd level works best.</li>
            <li> I am a man and love this thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than others for a better job.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> but overall it did a great job!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your body, it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> Way better than waxing.</li>
            <li> i love this epilator.</li>
            <li> I found this epilator on amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on something I wasn&#x27;t even sure would work.</li>
            <li> Its ok but can t be used on all the body like it says in internet.</li>
            <li> Great performance, very ergonomic design.</li>
            <li> Ok, do not take off all the hair, use it under arms,</li>
            <li> Works ok</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> Its wayy wayyy better than wax.</li>
            <li> My dying Veet epilator did a more thorough job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it never occurred to me that this was still an option, but I&#x27;m really glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> more details, read below:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will probably some day move on to an epilator with more blades (?) and a wider path.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do, love it</li>
            <li> It feels more like a &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but is tolerable.</li>
            <li> but OMG I love it after one use.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will love it too.</li>
            <li> the more you use it.  </li>
            <li> This epilator was able to remove the hair, root and all from my legs, bikini line and arm pits.</li>
            <li> but then it gets more tolerable as the hair thins.  </li>
            <li> I simply love this product.</li>
            <li> No need to say more than that...</li>
            <li> but not anymore :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> product is ok.</li>
            <li> This is excellent, fast and easy to keep is clean.</li>
            <li> It grips the hair better and removes more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Also most battery powered models are not useable once the battery dies.  </li>
            <li> Not my favorite hair removal technique</li>
            <li> I am using this machine since more than 10 years</li>
            <li> this is the perfect thing to get him back into shape!</li>
            <li> I am very happy of going back to the basics with this epilator.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that my wife or others who know me would describe me as a wimp, this device produces a lot more pain than discomfort.  </li>
            <li> However, with continued usage you get more used to the pain</li>
            <li> okay so the thing about epilators is that it all depends on YOUR hair type and YOUR skin type&lt;</li>
            <li> and the more it hurts the better its working</li>
            <li> and I just went to town making sure I&#x27;d covered every square inch.</li>
            <li> so glad i purchased this</li>
            <li> I would recommend a corded epilators as I believe they have more power than battery operated ones.</li>
            <li> I could find this epilator much better than that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit OCD. :]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit OCD. :]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to do many passes at all</li>
            <li> (you don&#x27;t want to do many passes)</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I think that it worked better on areas with courser hair.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, simply love it.</li>
            <li> My Braun epilator was much better...</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper if you can do that you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mostly on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure...</li>
            <li> While it did break some hairs, it works better than home waxing</li>
            <li> Well I love it, I have been using it for just over a month</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my legs and my bikini area, I have tried my chin and my lip</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this and will continue using it.  </li>
            <li> I have used epilators for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> It was okay with legs and arms.</li>
            <li> i really love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t care, glides it across more armpit.</li>
            <li> Ok this one does hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> I even think it&#x27;s better than shaving since I always nick myself with the razor.</li>
            <li> I checked the discs and it doesn&#x27;t break the hair off, it pulls it out by the root, which is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think the more you use it the better and easier</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll be :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I love the product in many ways</li>
            <li> It was ... an interesting experience.  </li>
            <li> Watch the video to get a better idea of how to get the most out of it.</li>
            <li> OK, I got this yesterday and used it once.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my friends but most cannot endure the pain.</li>
            <li> Only used it ones , but up to now seems great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this stuff for my wife and she loves it more then waxing.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> : 3 Weeks after I tried this, I had tons of ingrown hairs on the lower part of my legs.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> Ok so, I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now</li>
            <li> So much better than waxing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that the more you use it</li>
            <li> some hairs to break off instead of getting plucked, mostly on the legs ironically.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t so sure I would be committing to having my leg hairs ripped out on a long-term</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, now that I do think I will stick with this method of hair removal, I might upgrade to something else to see if it is more efficient.  </li>
            <li> My biggest gripe with this product is that it misses too many hairs.  </li>
            <li> All the clinching probably made my abs better.</li>
            <li> with any hair removal, be sure to exfoliate -</li>
            <li> This one was cheap as well!</li>
            <li> I feel like it never does get all of the hair, but it gets most of it.  </li>
            <li> However, I was determined to make my armpits look better</li>
            <li> I am SO GLAD I did.</li>
            <li> I love mine.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> and my legs are still silky smooth!</li>
            <li> but the more you use it</li>
            <li> and i am sure this will be my go-to product for my under arms.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you may consider buying a one with more blades which will work</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose Philips Epilator</li>
            <li> Love it, works fast and great.</li>
            <li> but my girls love the results and the feel of their skin afterwards and SWEAR by it.</li>
            <li> Satinelle seems to work better than my Emjoi or Epilady.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> anyone can tell me how to properly epilate without havingn to wake up with prickle legs, that would be great!</li>
            <li> still it&#x27;s ok for the price, it just takes forever to do the job.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have to go over areas more than once.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results were just okay.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell you how many razors I go through in the course of a month.  </li>
            <li> When I received the product, I thought it looked kind of cheap and lightweight</li>
            <li> Make sure to exfoliate to avoid ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> It goes without saying that ripping a hair out from the root hurts a lot more than just shaving it.</li>
            <li> You get most of the hair off your legs but it hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> Breaks as many hairs as it pulls out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It works OK.</li>
            <li> I love that I can continually run this with the power cord.</li>
            <li> I tried many times to remove my underarm hair</li>
            <li> It works so much better than a razor because it pulls the root.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you have to build up your endurance for pulling hair out by the roots. :)</li>
            <li> If u can let the leg hair grow over 1/4 of an inch, it would work better on the legs.  </li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t what I thought but was able to return for free!</li>
            <li> but if it has a recharger and can attach and detach the cord that would be a lot better.</li>
            <li> This is the only reason I did not give it five stars--it would be perfect</li>
            <li> Shaving my legs gives me allergies, so I bought this in order to try soemthing different, and I&#x27;m impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I am glad with the price.  </li>
            <li> As a first-time epilator user, it took me awhile to figure out what exact angle and distance works best for my hair type- don&#x27;t give up if you botch the first time; I kept clipping hairs instead of pulling them from the root and thought my device was defective.</li>
            <li> That adjustment period goes for everyone, though I think if you buy a fancier model they might be more intuitive to use.</li>
            <li> Sure did.</li>
            <li> I now mostly use under my arms, once a month</li>
            <li> And got most of the hair!!&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> But it does it&#x27;s job in an ok Manor</li>
            <li> Works great and it is very efficient.</li>
            <li> SE5180 by Braun (the one my sister has) was a much better epilator, and I would recommend that one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, so let&#x27;s get this over with, questions I wanted to know before I bought this was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but yes, the more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll get use to it</li>
            <li> Wait 2-3 days for the hair to grow so the epilator will be able to grab the hairs.</li>
            <li> Your better off with razer rash than this time</li>
            <li> One more shaver turned...</li>
            <li> I was expecting much better marketing</li>
            <li> I love it for my face</li>
            <li> It really hurts during but the outcome is great.  </li>
            <li> I feel so much better showing my face</li>
            <li> as all get out but effective and VERY economical.</li>
            <li> size is just right and its fairly lightweight.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I am new to using an epilator, I am SUPER impressed by this product.</li>
            <li> WAX FIRST!!!</li>
            <li> its really hurt..!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is good, very easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as painful as I thought it would be, very effective and arrived extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> Even if I found another good one with a lot more tweezers, I will probably keep this Philips one around because its great for the areas that need something smaller and more precise.    </li>
            <li> Better than the legs, and the legs were pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It did a pretty good job and grabbed most hair.&lt;br /&gt;Day</li>
            <li> Flimsy, cheap plastic, will break very easily.</li>
            <li> Works great , highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the new tweezers design over the rotating spring, but it works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> The underarm was not bad, honestly.</li>
            <li> Still pretty good though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+the price is pretty good</li>
            <li> Exactly what parts of your body is this good for???</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good device for the money.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job in removing the hair.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first, but over time (3 months) at 3x/monthly usage, it&#x27;s slacking in efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> those who&#x27;ve used an epilator before: if you are willing to be patient, the price is fair.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product for the price offered.</li>
            <li> At first I loved this thing, but then I realized it was breaking the hairs</li>
            <li> Loved it so much, I bought my daughter one!</li>
            <li> For a novice, it would be a good first epilator to purchase.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great little gadget.  </li>
            <li> I never have had this problem with purchases on HSN or QVC.Customer Servive is now telling me that they cannot send me a copy of my original invoice WHICH WAS NEVER INCLIDED IN THE BOX!</li>
            <li> Works great and better than my old Braun shaving device</li>
            <li> Love the shape, easy to hold on to .  </li>
            <li> i loved is so much i bought 2 more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> Great for underarms, it doesn&#x27;t get my leg hair though, probably because its too thin but perfect for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> But each time I used it it was more and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to assemble, use and clean.  </li>
            <li> This has been a great epilator so far!</li>
            <li> clean up !&lt;</li>
            <li> It would take 4 to 5 strokes just to get most of the fine hair, but it wouldn&#x27;t get all of it.</li>
            <li> Most of the time it just breaks the hair on the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Areas where the hair tends to be more fine are the arms and legs.</li>
            <li> Love it more then the original rotating spring epilady that I used for probably over 15 years before it gave up the ghost.  </li>
            <li> So I just bought this, and to be honest when I first turned it on, I was terrified!</li>
            <li> Overall very good.</li>
            <li> This epilator does a very good job of pulling the entire hair out root and all.</li>
            <li> I decided for the price it was a good test into whether I wanted a more high end epilator and would go with it that method of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> So far this product has worked just great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not the most comfortable process in the world, but not unbearable.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t FEEL like completely smooth hair-free skin, but it looks like it for sure.</li>
            <li> Best money spent yet.</li>
            <li> and she is extremely happy about it so far and thankful..</li>
            <li> works great so far I wish I could use it without the cable tho</li>
            <li> Make sure to use after a nice hot shower.</li>
            <li> this product works great, i have had it for over a month, its just a bit loud</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and works perfect as I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used, and for the price I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I love smooth, hairless-ness..</li>
            <li> If your skin is irritated easily, just use this on your legs and you should be more than fine.</li>
            <li> leave ur legs smooth and sexy 😀</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li> I started the epilator on speed one, and was more scared by the sound than anything.</li>
            <li> Works brilliantly - needs US plug adapter for those who are outside the states.</li>
            <li> As a first time user, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I attribute this to the fact that the hair which had been jerked out by its roots was becoming finer and finer.  </li>
            <li> But again, once all was said and done I was sooooooo smooth and soooo satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> and I found it mostly pain free.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> Nice long cord, works great.</li>
            <li> The area I tested on my arm is hair free and lovely looking.</li>
            <li> Technique is important and you will get better with time.  </li>
            <li> She says it caused a great amount of pain and got nearly nothing done.</li>
            <li> this incredibly loquacious review has helped you make an informed decision!slower setting and only go over the area once or twice.</li>
            <li> the Braun, it hurt like heck, but my arms were smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside and my legs got most of the hair removed as well.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great as far as I could tell.</li>
            <li> I was even more intimidated by the sound and envisioned ripping my skin off with this thing.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the size and light weight</li>
            <li> My pits feel smooth and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am assuming the good reviews can&#x27;t be real.</li>
            <li> Its good however when you don&#x27;t have much time to wax and is quite portable</li>
            <li> powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> Although, to be fair, this is much faster.</li>
            <li> useful product and nice packaging.</li>
            <li> It hurt, but had it been effective the pain would have been worth it.</li>
            <li> Good idea- the waxing also hurt (the woman told me that redheads tend to have longer hair roots, and could hurt more than normal), and when I told her I was planning on using an epilator, she gave me a &amp;#34;good luck&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I liked but it is not so powerful.</li>
            <li> chose this particular model of epilator based upon the positive reviews and am now happy to add my own to the list.  </li>
            <li> This is easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute, light and arrived very quickly so yay for that.</li>
            <li> As a redhead with lots of peach fuzz on my cheeks, it did a great job on my face removing the hair quickly and with reasonable discomfort.</li>
            <li> Amazingly painless compared to my older one; removes hair quite well, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received it yesterday and used it right away with amazing results.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips HP640 Sanitelle Epilator because my cheap Tweezee broke after many years of fine service.  </li>
            <li> but other then that great purchase!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it will be more like my original.</li>
            <li> When I remembered having an original Epilady many years ago, I wondered how it had been improved over the years.</li>
            <li> I use it every to every other day with great results!</li>
            <li> I was brave enough to use it on my armpits, where I have even better results.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;-Inexpensive and easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning is easy.</li>

            <li> I thought I would have a very bold skin either the legs and under the arms, but the hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled 100%.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure how to replace or clean the head of this thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-noisier than I wanted to deal with&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m one of those people that easily gets ingrown hair</li>

            <li> And the head is washable which makes the cleaning easy.</li>
            <li> Painless, easy to use and the epilating head can be rinsed under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and no pain.</li>
            <li> Purchasing this epilator was not an easy decision for me.</li>
            <li> What is more,  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It is going strong.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun which cost approx $30 more, and it is far superior.</li>
            <li> I recommend it strongly.</li>
            <li> i love that it is electric, its a bit loud but works good.</li>
            <li> While an epilator is not for everyone, this particular one is exceptionally good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a strong ass b*tch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great, fast, very fine little device, does a great job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really nice, i like it  very much</li>
            <li> When my daughter asked to purchase an epilator, we settled on the Philips HP6401, as it was a good value and was highly rated.</li>
            <li> It works very fast and effective.</li>
            <li> found that I have the best outcome if I use it right after a shower (exfoliate the area to prevent clogged follicles) and use either an antiseptic spray or astringent like sea breeze on the area immediately (and for the next couple days.)</li>
            <li> my underarms look very nice with this tool and are red for about an hour after, which is better than waxing.  </li>
            <li> while that is true, I&#x27;ve noticed since my hair grows in many directions, that you need to keep the epilator at a 90 degree angle on your leg and just follow the way the hair grows.</li>
            <li> Plus the best part, is it doesn&#x27;t leave dark marks under the skin(underarms and bikini).</li>
            <li> It kind of stings when you use it the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also directed to prepare first time users to shave 2 to 3 days before using this item and also the shower with warm water to prepare the skin.</li>
            <li> the price, however, is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> However, it is true that the more you do it</li>
            <li> and the cord is super long which is a plus ! :D</li>
            <li> Luckily my leg hair is very light and fine as is, but it feels like it&#x27;s just breaking the hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve waxed or tweezed before, you will be fine.</li>
            <li> The first time it  hurts a bit, but the more you use the more tolerable the pain is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s because the hairs are too fine.</li>
            <li> Calf area was fine-</li>
            <li> The hairs are too fine to break the skin.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> THis works fine.  </li>
            <li> fine that you will have to look at your legs to know that you need to use it</li>
            <li> and it works fine for me</li>
            <li> It is light, handy and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly fine for me.</li>
            <li> But otherwise works just fine.</li>
            <li> If you have black stubborn hair on your legs like I do, and you can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal - this is the best option for</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am fine with the pain, so that doesn&#x27;t figure into my review.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work not even with fine hair.</li>
            <li> but it does its job fine.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I own Braun Silk and epil epilator for a long time and I saw this and the reviews were good on it.</li>
            <li> The HP6401 works fine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to keep my legs smooth now</li>
            <li> It is bulky and does not extract fine hairs.  </li>
            <li> I got it to remove the fine hair on my arms.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my fine hairs</li>
            <li> Takes off fine hair.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m fine with using it once a month.  </li>
            <li> if you haven&#x27;t done laser and your hair is &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> it looks fine,</li>
            <li> Product works fine.</li>
            <li> light, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> - I have relatively fine leg hair and maybe that&#x27;s my problem.</li>
            <li> so yes it tends to work faster, and hurt less, cordless, etc etc.. but does great and beats buying disposable razors all the time!</li>
            <li> but this works just fine.</li>
            <li> Over all I think it does just fine.  </li>
            <li> but it works fine for what I need.</li>
            <li> I could use deodorant in the morning just fine.</li>
            <li> I use it on the highest setting and it seems fine.</li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems to do the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> and it doesnt go as easy as light hairs</li>
            <li> It worked fine but after 3 months of using it it stop working</li>
            <li> You can remove it, and it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I used it for places that I&#x27;ve waxed before or places with really fine hair/peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> it works fine everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> (but it&#x27;s fine since the box said this was meant for legs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this was easy and hassle free.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re lucky, you might not have to epilate again for a month!</li>
            <li> This reduced tugging on stubborn hairs and made it feel more like a quick tweezer pluck.</li>
            <li> The pain was extraordinary!</li>
            <li> Super pleased.</li>
            <li> It works and makes my legs feel super smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li> Great price, and a great little worker!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My legs a super soft and its great.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> easy to use , easy to clean , had about a year now and use 3x weekly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to remove the head part and clean it too!</li>
            <li> I had a different brand that was 1/3 the size of this, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to do the job in 1/2 the time!</li>
            <li> I love the size of it most of all which makes it so handy and compact..very simple and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will be because this may be a very cost effective &amp; easy way to be smooth &amp; hair free through all seasons.</li>
            <li> this is a perfect little epilatory machine, and being from philips means quality.</li>
            <li> This little thing does a great job!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so impressed with how efficient this little thing is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by this little thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really an excellent little machine.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I have seen recommendations that you should first shower to clean and warm up the area before using an epilator.  </li>
            <li> It works great for the darker coarser hair but it seems to pass over the fine blonde hairs.</li>
            <li> Its easy, convenient, and always accessible.  </li>
            <li> The price is very good for such a powerful machine.</li>
            <li> The head is removable so you can wash it which is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, makes my face look &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and it saves HUGE amounts of time over having to tweeze my racoon face</li>
            <li> Thus is a huge improvement over that torture device.</li>
            <li> epilator has been a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> and this makes a huge difference with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Its light weight, does what it is supposed to do &amp; fits great in my tiny hands.</li>
            <li> so that is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> This is a huge improvement over having stubble 2-3 days after shaving.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in the thickness and texture.</li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of this epilator.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the smooth feel and</li>
            <li> Still smooth Wednesday.</li>
            <li> I used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s arm &amp; he said it felt like a light tattoo needle.</li>
            <li> WASN&#x27;T BRAVE ENOUGH TO TRY MY BIKINI AREA AFTER THAT.</li>
            <li> I got it for my bikini line, and after suffering through, it&#x27;s still smooth after a week- and without the ingrown hairs that shaving leave.</li>
            <li> I should have ended it there and walked away, but I had to keep my eye on the prize of having a smooth groin area.</li>
            <li> but I still have to shave to get the smooth feel.</li>
            <li> After using it on my legs they were silky smooth.</li>
            <li> There are a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> : Doesn&#x27;t leave perfectly smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> And the skin is so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Leaves legs smooth.</li>
            <li> Sheesh, I could have just shaved in 5 minutes and be smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy I finally purchased one of these!!</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for my legs.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Hair comes in thinner and your legs are smooth for about a week.</li>
            <li> You might say I enjoy maximizing my hair removal repertoire, as in my mind this equates with maximizing my womanliness.  </li>
            <li> If you have coarse hair all over, this might be a great solution for you.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for some pain free stuff</li>
            <li> i still shave afterwards for the smooth finish .</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this to work, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It looks like a cheap quality product.</li>
            <li> (I have no clue what the actual name is, lol).</li>
            <li> But, it is worth it and more efficient than shaving with knife or using pin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job removing facial hair.</li>
            <li> My husband cannot believe how smooth my legs are all the time now.  </li>
            <li> but I leave my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> I do recommend combining it with shaving though if you want it to always keep a smooth feel too.</li>
            <li> clean up is great and very simple and easy.  </li>
            <li> totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great after the second time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> /&gt;+it&#x27;s comfortable to hold&lt;</li>
            <li> It sounds and operates like a cheap instrument.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and have never found anything that lets me remove hair and be comfortable afterwards.</li>
            <li> My husband even noticed and asked if I was wearing makeup on my legs because my legs looked so smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my chest and arm pit hair (I&#x27;m a male), and it does work great.</li>
            <li> My legs weren&#x27;t smooth, but I attributed that to regrowth that this epilator couldn&#x27;t yet reach.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have smooth skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this epilator after using the Remington Smooth and Silky for over a year.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic device .</li>
            <li> so I recommend getting some lidocaine which can be found for cheap here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This one looks unisex and it was cheap.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m cheap and I was on a &amp;#34;beauty</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so cheap, get it girl.</li>
            <li> You will always be smooth 2.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean 4.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works great.</li>
            <li> It was cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week since I used it, and my legs are still mostly smooth...</li>
            <li> I am forever grateful to this epilator because I can rub my hand over my face and my skin is completely smooth.</li>
            <li> In the end, buy this if you are looking for a cheap epilator</li>
            <li> I have used others but this is really comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I do enjoy the results of the epilator and have had no issues with it.</li>
            <li> I slammed it on my counter, grabbed some lotion and a razor, and had both legs smooth in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> epilator won&#x27;t give the smooth and silky skin that you want, but it will give your legs hairless</li>
            <li> My legs aren&#x27;t as smooth</li>
            <li> After feeling how smooth her legs (and arms) were</li>
            <li> so you can sit comfortably.  </li>
            <li> It got five stars just because her legs is are smooth as I like.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s just not that important to me that they be silky-smooth all the time).</li>
            <li> this smooth</li>
            <li> Easy to clean plus I like the design.</li>
            <li> But even then, not so much pain as kind of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be intimidated by the sound.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s on the cheap end.</li>
            <li> did nothing for the light hairs.</li>
            <li> Not only can use for legs but also great for my underarms and face.    </li>
            <li> Returned it and embarked on a more costly (but well worth it) laser hair removal experience.</li>
            <li> It is vey nice quality and fast to remove unwanted hair</li>
            <li> I have never had smooth skin until using this.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the sensitivity guard.</li>
            <li> On to the next great idea...</li>
            <li> great eplicator with the exception of it being plug in only, it does what it says on the tin...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get every hair so don&#x27;t expect smooth legs.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and works</li>
            <li> It would be fantastic if I could&#x27;ve endured the torture.</li>
            <li> It is more time-consuming than shaving and getting waxed, but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic epilator.</li>
            <li> (note that i have been using epilators almost exclusively for about 10 years now and have had several, all of which worked great.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping that this would give me smooth legs without any noticeable hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed, shaved and tweezed and this is such a great solution to hair removal.</li>
            <li> Smooth, silky under arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The cap is easy to remove and clean.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on peach fuzz on the face and back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> Now its the quickest and easiest way to stay smooth.</li>
            <li> However, it does such a great job i use it everywhere (legs, armpits, bikini line).</li>
            <li> It hurts, I&#x27;m not going to lie, but it works well and leaves skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> but as I&#x27;ve never been one to flip my lid over legs that aren&#x27;t completely smooth this is not an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> The beauty of it is that you can go at your own pace to gauge how much pain you can tolerate instead of</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator because it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> and so are arm pits but deffinitely worth the results :)</li>
            <li> The epilator is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this as a solution to the constant bother of waxing.</li>
            <li> I used it almost immediately and had legs about as smooth as if I had shaved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since then, it still works great, and it reduces skin irritation while saving me money.    </li>
            <li> Works great for my facial hairs.</li>
            <li> This works well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have currently only used this on my arms and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my arms baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> And if your bathroom is anything like mine, a comfortable spot in which to do this is not close to the outlet.  </li>
            <li> I get smooth arms for a couple weeks with just 30 min or so of pain.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the epilator does work when I shave against the grain...</li>
            <li> and it got them as smooth as if i had shaved them</li>
            <li> If you are too light in the pressure department you will trim your hair and not have it removed fully.</li>
            <li> think this epilator is fantastic.</li>
            <li> think this epilator is fantastic.</li>
            <li> comfortable to hold and remove hair.</li>
            <li> I think is sound scarier than it is.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it had a light - mine</li>
            <li> Even if it breaks in two months (like another reviewer stated) it would STILL be totally worth it as I spend more than that getting waxed.</li>
            <li> However, I still have to shave after epilating to get the perfectly smooth skin that I desire.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used it on my underarms as well and got fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have to go over my leg area twice, but overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li> it works great on the face, upper body and leggs.</li>
            <li> It really worked nicely for me.</li>
            <li> after trying shaving and then waxing to get smooth legs</li>
            <li> Just go lightly, &amp;#34;hover&amp;#34; over the hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two days since I tried it and that one part of my leg is still smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read a review from a man that bought a few, tested them out (on himself) and said this one was the best.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after a while it seems to not remove hair as well but still works great.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a product that works for your legs and is cheap, this will work for you.</li>
            <li> Have used it for several months now, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I will say that the head doesn&#x27;t feel terribly secure.</li>
            <li> The machine does a great job for lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Below my knees, my legs are smooth as ever.</li>
            <li> The charger does not stay securely in the epilator and would fall out if bumped.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten fully smooth with this epilator.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it five stars if it didn&#x27;t sound like a lawnmower.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Cant say it doesn&#x27;t work but can&#x27;t say that I enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> I would go over an area a couple of times with this epilator and it would leave the area smooth and hair free.</li>
            <li> Overall great product</li>
            <li> my legs can be comfortably covered while they heal.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;once, but not for $30 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> It does, however leave your area feeling smooth like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> Have fun epilating and enjoy smooth skin!</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised it didn&#x27;t hurt when I used it and loved that my leggs felt so smooth after i used it</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to give up shaving and stop paying for salon leg waxes.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Also, I make sure that the length of the hair is good enough so the tweezers in this machine could pull those out nicely!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it helps, but I exfoliate first, use lots of nice cool lotion afterwards</li>
            <li> but I exfoliate with a puff in the shower and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I love love this so much  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> and this one had some pretty good reviews, and was not expensive.  </li>
            <li> It works great, better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I used creams and stuff before and the pain from this tweezer is so much more comfortable than the weeks worth of burning from creams.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is good for beginner epilators to test out to see if its for them and after trying it im willing to save up and get a higher quality one</li>
            <li> (I think sugaring is faster, easier and far more effective).  </li>
            <li> They stayed smooth for a whole week!!!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have had my legs waxed many times in the intervening years, so this epilator was not painful for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a new one!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am very satisfied with this Philips epilator.</li>
            <li> Other than that very good.</li>
            <li> Very good price comparing with other brands.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use, has to be at the perfect angle to remove hair.</li>
            <li> I got the one with the cored because I like it to always have a full strong charge.</li>
            <li> WAX FIRST!!</li>
            <li> WAX FIRST!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT HUUUUUURRTTT BAADDDD the first time!!</li>
            <li> works really well for me!!!</li>
            <li> And yes, pain is perfectly tolerable and it does get better after the first use, but not worth it if the hair is not going to be removed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s very powerful, and does and</li>
            <li> But, I have also seen this remove some very short hairs very effectively.  </li>
            <li> Stuck between useful, very clean</li>
            <li> She isn&#x27;t as excited by the \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; as I am, which means that _I_ get to be smooth while waiting on her to try it out.</li>
            <li> She isn&#x27;t as excited by the \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; as I am, which means that _I_ get to be smooth while waiting on her to try it out.</li>
            <li> On legs, it is not very painful (feels more like a lot of pinching) but if you use it on underarms for example, it hurts like heck.</li>
            <li> My arms look clean and feel smooth.</li>
            <li> But the machine is pretty loud, anyway this is a great product.</li>
            <li> For the first time in yearssss my legs were silky smooth for more than a day.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; easy.</li>
            <li> No irritation, quick, easy, and pain free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular epilator is nice for your legs.</li>
            <li> This is easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on longer hair but didn&#x27;t seem to work very well on the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and I purchased it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It may not be the most efficient method, but I was able to brave getting even around my bikini line in this way (obviously another sensitive area).</li>
            <li> Also very useful and clean.</li>
            <li> It removes my unwanted hair flawlessly with very little pain.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator because it&#x27;s easy to use and very practical to carry when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I now do my underarms twice a week but legs and bikini only once a week and am super happy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to order it on amazon.com, it delivered so quick, earlier than it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> handy, easy to carry any where and gives a very clean skin back after the epillating process.</li>
            <li> I went to bed and in the morning the red bumps were gone and my legs looked AMAZING!</li>
            <li> After the first couple of times, it is much better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not friendly to use on your privates.</li>
            <li> In general,  good product.</li>
            <li> The noise and the speed of the tweezers is intimidating but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I got the European version of the Satinelle (Remington) back home in Europe, which is perfect, so when I came to the U.S on vacation I decided to get this one, but I&#x27;m not at all satisfied because sometimes it cuts your hairs instead of pulling them</li>
            <li> My mom warned me about her adventure with the original EpiLady, and I listened.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t have tattoos, so I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best thing to compare it to...</li>
            <li> Ok, so it hurt like HECK the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup is a breeze: just remove the top and run it under hot, soapy water.</li>
            <li> but im pretty pleased for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> but I kept using it because I didn&#x27;t know any better about epilators since it was my first.</li>
            <li> , the first two uses u will love it</li>
            <li> Love this thing, it&#x27;s my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been waxing for four years now, and have seen a significant decrease in hair density and growth.</li>
            <li> I drank a significant amount of vodka before trying this</li>
            <li> travel friendly.</li>
            <li> I was able to get under my arms pretty well without having to contort, twist, or pull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, the noise doesn&#x27;t bother me as long as the epilator continues to perform great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for,  would have given 5 stars if if had worked better on my face.</li>
            <li> I just received my epilator 2 days ago, so far I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My second use wasn&#x27;t as successful.</li>
            <li> But for $30-50 it is totally worth it to me!</li>
            <li> Ok it hurts alot, but it is my first time ever doing this</li>
            <li> For my first epilator, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> and she is really excited about using it again when her hair is longer.</li>
            <li> Shes really excited about this Epilator(asphalt grinder).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, though.. this thing hurts but the pain is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, lets start with the first thing on everyone&#x27;s mind in these reviews.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll still hurt too.</li>
            <li> it works great  and its very well built ,hopefully we get few years out of it ,good price</li>
            <li> So I was so excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> I used the original Epilady in the 1980s and found it unbearable.</li>
            <li> my printer isn&#x27;t working; and they never sent me an original</li>
            <li> It does hurt at first but the more you use it the easier it gets.</li>
            <li> I can do everything except the most most sensitive area!  </li>
            <li> this is my first epliator, and i love it.</li>
            <li> But completely worth it for how well it works !</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have rich experience for comparison.</li>
            <li> and i have enjoyed going hairless for longer despite hte pain at first.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I can sometimes make a dozen passes over a small patch of skin with visible hairs of a length that should be perfect and</li>
            <li> I even shaved first wait a day then use this, my razor works much better.</li>
            <li> It hurts for the first couple of times but gets better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*Discomfort aside, I did notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li> but it really is worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is how women get jumped into and out of gangs.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this thing is powerful and works!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was excited to use this</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use it</li>
            <li> I had one of the original epilators and it lasted for years.  </li>
            <li> I originally was going to spend $400 on a NONO, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to it.  </li>
            <li> Hell the first time, then it gets better.</li>
            <li> On the day after first time, make sure to clean the area that you epilated which you can do in the shower.</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE THIS and wanted to reassure you that it does work and is a great little epilator.  </li>
            <li> but after lots of try it kind of died a little, not as good like in the beginning.</li>
            <li> Wow this product really works, I can proudly say I have no more pubes :D!!</li>
            <li> A neat little design which enables easy storage and most importantly does a good job.</li>
            <li> Everything came brand new in it&#x27;s own box.</li>
            <li> The charging cord is very long and great for use in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I believe my skin may be more sensitive than most, and I understand that not everyone experiences this problem.  </li>
            <li> But from what I have experienced this far, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice; When I used it first time, feels bit hurt, but after a minutes I was getting use to it and doesn&#x27;t feel hurt anymore;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use it to clean my side burns.</li>
            <li> Clean finish.</li>
            <li> and you know you are hair free because you do not feel the mild pinching with hair being tweezed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would have a higher rating of the epilator were it not uncomfortably painful to use.</li>
            <li> so I can take it to the sink and fully immerse it in water and soap to clean it.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected but definitely better than some.</li>
            <li> I epilate maybe once a week, just to clean things up here and there.</li>
            <li> Thus have a clean leg for a longer duration.</li>
            <li> Got this to clean up some &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; and oh my, it works.  </li>
            <li> item itself is Great for Thin clumps of hair and it stays away for a good While.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the epilator, are very usefull for all, i love because is electric and dont need batteries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*essy to clean</li>
            <li> and my skin is super smooth with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> and my arms are still perfectly clean and its been a week</li>
            <li> recommend it to anybody who wants to have an epilatr with reasonable price and good performance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I had such great success with my legs, tried it with my armpits.</li>
            <li> far, I can tell that this product is probably best used for legs only or areas where the hair is NOT dense/coarse.</li>
            <li> This does the job, you have to clean it alot</li>
            <li> I recived as I espected, it came with everything that sais in the box exept for the brush to clean after the use.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I was looking for an epilator that I can clean under the water faucet and had an adapter.</li>
            <li> you get super smooth legs?</li>
            <li> but after that I was completely use to it and find its way better than plucking and shaving any day!</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased and hope it continues to work!</li>
            <li> This epilator is very good and fast, I&#x27;ve had more expensive models but this one in my opinion is equally as good.</li>
            <li> great things about this product would be the fact that the head is removal so you can wash it(love that) and the cord is super long.</li>
            <li> The epilator itself is good with a two-speed setting, a detachable head for easy cleaning, and a long, detachable plug (runs on batteries too).</li>
            <li> I am addicted to using this now, the feeling of having such smooth skin is awesome and its great to now have to use my razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this product gets the job done, although you have to pass certain areas more than once before all the hairs get pulled out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll yank all that right out!</li>
            <li> Philips did this right!</li>
            <li> Keeping the blades clean is the key to good epilation.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little at first, but once you get used to using this epilator it works great!</li>
            <li> (most epilators are marketed at a very high price point)&lt;br</li>
            <li> But most importantly love the fact that it&#x27;s almost pain free to use it, honestly I have little tolerance for any pain and can use this without even flinching!</li>
            <li> [At your own risk.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the wonderful world of no bumps, dry hair removal!Using this epilator anywhere other than your legs?</li>
            <li> but I wish it would be more accurate in getting more of the hairs out without having to go over the same spot three or four times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to use the second speed; it is working great with first.</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with it, it&#x27;s definitely cheaper than getting waxed</li>
            <li> I thought the epilator would be a nice alternative to waxing and a more long term solution than shaving.</li>
            <li> (There was not much discomfort experienced while using this product, but I will admit that the discomfort&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the epilator was more effective it might have been worth it, but it left lots of hair</li>
            <li> , just AS GOOD, I actually PREFER not having to charge it, I just plug it up and go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After doing the whole shaving thing this is surely a better alternative.</li>
            <li> I love it, works really well, and take off from the root.</li>
            <li> In another hand, I can say that the noise is kind of loud, so would no hear aniything else while you use it.</li>
            <li> check the issues about packaging while the function is good enough.</li>
            <li> Apply some oil (I use Sweet Almond Oil) before you epilate.</li>
            <li> I used to have an Emjoi Gently Silken and it seems to me that the Philps HP 6401 does a better of grabbing and pulling the hair out.</li>
            <li> I love that the hair, when it does return is much softer that the hair it took off.</li>
            <li> Got a full refund</li>
            <li> Is it worth suffering for smooth legs:</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li> but I still think it is better since you can give yourself as much time as you</li>
            <li> and then I have to epilate at full hair growth.</li>
            <li> In fact, not painful at all, (but I have been conditioned by waxing.)</li>
            <li> This is true.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this. :)</li>
            <li> , i really dont expect more than these 2 features from my epilator.</li>
            <li> get waxed, this thing causes way to much pain and takes way too many passes to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I told her that can&#x27;t be true because mine felt like torture.</li>
            <li> This epilator has been a true lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it is any better than another brand I used</li>
            <li> the most intimate body part this thing touched was</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s kind of loud.</li>
            <li> and it lasts years), and there is simply no reason to spend more money on the more advanced models.</li>
            <li> just good for leg only.</li>
            <li> Those people are true wuzzes.  </li>
            <li> After looking at the product reviews I was sure that this product would seem reasonable but just after a dozen or so uses it decided to stop working.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not painful at all</li>
            <li> the second one i got wasnt that good</li>
            <li> This thing is so cool.</li>
            <li> I thought it was rechargable but its not, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> No painful wax or messiness from it.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good epilator.</li>
            <li> I was very reluctant to give it a try, but I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Overall its good.</li>
            <li> I managed to use it on most my calves without TOO much pain, but it took over an hour just to get 3/4 of my calves done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where this product works best are areas where hair is thinner, at least that&#x27;s the performance</li>
            <li> Good for simple hair removal</li>
            <li> It does take a lot more time than shaving, but your hair grows in softer, your skin is healthier, and your tan stays much longer.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish I could love it</li>
            <li> but wow is it effective.</li>
            <li> works just like a charm and for such a good price.</li>
            <li> I personally use it for my legs, armpits and it is also good for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> and while it is true that you can unplug the device from its cord, it stops immediately.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed this one so much I was looking for hair on my body to remove.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better when it&#x27;s sticking straight up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just really loud and the device smells kind of smells like overworked device from using electricity.</li>
            <li> i just dislike it how its just kind of loud.</li>
            <li> Unlike creams the tweezer has many my hair grow out so much lighter.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast both times and because of the incident, I was able to grow out some hairs for epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fair enough.  </li>
            <li> Love it, really takes the hair off.</li>
            <li> but this actually works fairly well)&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I felt it pulling the hair, but was relieved that it was not really painful at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure people with lighter, thinner hair would have a much easier time using this product.</li>
            <li> before I had Braun epilator for many years, they are just the same thing this is as good as Braun one and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> so I could do my full body.</li>
            <li> My hair can be coarse in some areas but the machine does a good job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall the epilator is good.</li>
            <li> I just received my epilator and and used it on my lower legs - full power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on full legs, full bikini, and armpits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful at all.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> not bad.</li>
            <li> To me the pain is not bad.</li>
            <li> not a bad product</li>
            <li> My legs were not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not bad.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> and i was told by a review that it is good for sensitive skin and first time</li>
            <li> so this is really nice if you&#x27;re not really sensitive :)</li>
            <li> This one is not bad at all</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really so bad.</li>
            <li> Does hurt, not really bad</li>
            <li> i am impressed on how well it gets all the hair......even rhe very fine, thin hair!</li>
            <li> Most of the hair on my arms and legs is very fine and blonde, so with these hairs it tends to just break a lot of them instead of pulling them out.  </li>
            <li> It did the job and its fairly inexpensive, but I rather continue waxing my legs for a better finish in less amount of time.</li>
            <li> leg area as well as overall this is a good way to quickly do away with hair.</li>
            <li> No need to wait for the hair to grow until to effective length, and no mess at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this little machine and absolutely I loved!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have baby smooth legs after using it like I can get right after shaving.</li>
            <li> I find it to be quite important that you use it at the right hair growth length.</li>
            <li> The second time, I followed the instructions more fully and made sure my legs were clean and well-exfoliated, before I had applied any lotion to them.  </li>
            <li> but this one is so much better its smaller not as bulky and u can run the top over water to get it clean  </li>
            <li> Any kind of powder, you put enough in those areas, and it will help the epilator runs more smoothly over that area and not irritate it as much.</li>
            <li> I started on the first speed setting and after becoming more confident, moved to the second speed setting.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a great, quick and mess free way to take care of the legs.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to completely read and follow the instructions, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> However, it does not pull out some of the fine hairs, but it does clear the most of it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, most of which said it was not painful and the price tag was fairly decent.</li>
            <li> The hair on my body tends to be rather thick/coarse/dark in certain areas such as the armpits, the \\&quot;happy trail\\&quot;, and of course the forbidden pubic area.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I was happy with the experience.</li>
            <li> So far, everything looks perfect for say, wearing a skirt in public but still feels pretty stubbly.  </li>
            <li> But other that that it works great.</li>
            <li> and i barely feel anything at all, love it!</li>
            <li> After several long years of seeking an effective hair removal option, I was really happy to come across this epilator.</li>
            <li> Simply fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my lower back, full front chest and lip area and it does a marvelous job and removing hair!</li>
            <li> and hopefully I won&#x27;t to need to buy a new one for another 10 years! :))</li>
            <li> Does a fine job of ripping out your air ;D</li>
            <li> In all honesty, you just have to get through the pain the first time and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine on more fine hairs, however, does not grab coarse hairs as well.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine hairs, so it may just be me.  </li>
            <li> Does the job quickly.</li>
            <li> works JUST AS QUICKLY</li>
            <li> You just have to rip the band aid off and do it quickly.</li>
            <li> Some people say you have to make sure your skin is complete oil free before epilating.</li>
            <li> It mainly breaks my hairs instead of pulling them out by the root, and hurts a lot on top of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and over before you know it.  </li>
            <li> The battery died quick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all hairs with each use, it&#x27;s more of a some here and there or most each time, but over time definitely works and lasts</li>
            <li> If that did happen, regrowth happened just as quickly as with waxing and chemical remivers5.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to shave as much anymore &amp; easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I expected more to be truly honest.</li>
            <li> My mom bought it several years ago with a regular use and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Its not the most expensive, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> So, do a quick section, pick it up, do a section elsewhere, and so on.</li>
            <li> It almost encourages me to use the device regularly, as the longer you wait, the more it hurts (more hairs).</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m in need of a quick underarm cleaning</li>
            <li> It does a quick job, it takes around 30 seconds to do each pit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> item is easy to put together, clean, and fast to use.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a super</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say I will be forever loyal to these two products.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> I quickly tried it.</li>
            <li> If Im in a quick hurry, I just use my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Emjoi is a decent product but the Philips is better.</li>
            <li> SUPER FRICKING LIE</li>
            <li> It helps me to get rid of my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The cord stopped working, luckily within the warranty period</li>
            <li> Excellent product, for the price paid, especially compared to what i could get in NZ for the same price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to clean, it works very well</li>
            <li> Shaving left bumps, waxing left scars, but this was awesome!!!</li>
            <li> A quick call to amazon</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick and doesn&#x27;t hurt. ....</li>
            <li> Better than the older Braun epilator it replaced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived quickly and I tested it out as soon as I got it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think its effective enough to use as a primary hair removal method.</li>
            <li> but I quickly got accustomed.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m smooth and hair free much faster.</li>
            <li> i wish i would&#x27;ve invested a tiny bit more on better quality.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> A 7.5 since it does a decent of grabbing many of the hairs</li>
            <li> and after I use it a few more times and get more comfortable with it, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see how great this little device is.</li>
            <li> I must have a high pain tolerance, because so many people whine about it.  </li>
            <li> She tends to have a high pain tolerance (probably from putting up with me)  :)</li>
            <li> This was a great first epilator for me, because it is inexpensive enough that I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator.  </li>
            <li> You are not going to have that smooth as silk feeling that you get with shaving when you first start using it.  </li>
            <li> So in theory it should have worked on one or the other (ideally both), but it doesn&#x27;t really work with either types of hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this, and will continue to use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very pleased with this device and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> It pulls all the hair out very consistently.</li>
            <li> I originally decided to use MOOM sugaring product, and while it worked well above the knee, I wasn&#x27;t really thrilled with how it worked on my lower leg.  </li>
            <li> also doesn&#x27;t have a light which is a pretty neat feature</li>
            <li> but when i read the directions i found out its not for that but its good for legs but takes too long..</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a good epilator for a long time.</li>
            <li> Picture ripping hair wax treatments off slooowly, pulling hair by hair deliciously out by the roots, all the while listening to a cute little pink device hum along cheerfully.  </li>
            <li> Still, Recommended highly for how great a job it does on coarse hair.</li>
            <li> corded kind will never loose charge</li>
            <li> so i decide to buy new one :)</li>
            <li> I love my new Philips Epilator and would have given it 5 stars, but in the end it&#x27;s still not like shaving, but then again it doesn&#x27;t claim to be.</li>
            <li> it is a shocker if your new at it, but it is more a slight/quick sting, then poof gone.  </li>
            <li> I love my new Epilator.</li>
            <li> new one by Phillips seems to be shaped and sized in a way that fits MUCH better....</li>
            <li> OK, So I&#x27;m new to using epilators.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than the epilator I previously owned</li>
            <li> Andreaschoice on youtube has a great video on this subject if you want to watch a how to video.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first one back in February and loved it.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a pretty good pain tolerance, but this was different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Silver lining:&lt;br /&gt;After the first sessions, your hair grows back all nice and fine, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt me anymore</li>
            <li> The product presents a good quality and it is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Its very quick, as fast as shaving 3.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t go back and redo an area, since the results of the first epilation are good.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend to everybody who wants to remove hair</li>
            <li> that I have little time to spend on waxing and shaving because of two jobs, I decided to try this product, mainly because it&#x27;s more affordable than Braun and more popular brands.</li>
            <li> you do use a product like this make sure to get a very natural and soothing lotion or aloe vera to help ease the discomfort and pain caused by these devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first it hurt a lot!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use an epilator!</li>
            <li> for such price - i love it!</li>
            <li> and then they use it straight from shaving and it BURNS LIKE FIRE!! ...</li>
            <li> I must say that the first time it HURT!.  </li>
            <li> If you are a first time user of an epilator I think this is a good fit as it is not too rough.</li>
            <li> I first heard of epilators from a friend of mine who would rave about hers!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will still use this one occasionally for sure!</li>
            <li> Pretty good not great but good for the money</li>
            <li> Honestly, I feel like waxing works better and hurts way less.</li>
            <li> it does more work in less time.its amazing...</li>
            <li> someone who struggled through shaving for six years, and waxing for four, this option is cheaper, more effective, and less invasive than anything I have used before.</li>
            <li> Seeing as she has had two children by C-section and two abdominal surgeries she ought to be able to deal with the initial pain easily, right?f</li>
            <li> While dealing with trimming one&#x27;s eyebrows, beard and skull-top hair is easily done and acceptable barbershop routine, hair growing out of one&#x27;s nostrils and on one&#x27;s ear lobes, including the entrance to the hearing canal requires a more personal approach.</li>
            <li> I believe that people who have waxed before will be able to tolerate this easily, it feels like nothing especially on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it was reasonable priced, arrived quickly with all needed parts and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> They last forever, easy to pack and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My mom claims this one does not do fine hair well, but I don&#x27;t know that I have had so much problem with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of perplexed by how that happens, but I&#x27;m going to try this product for a few more weeks before really judging its true effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I loved and can not live without !</li>
            <li> Great little epilator...</li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> I experienced little to none.</li>
            <li> def works better on short fine</li>
            <li> I decided this will be the first I will purchase, mostly because of the decent price.</li>
            <li> The cost seemed reasonable (the more expensive ones just seemed to come with more attachments, which I didn&#x27;t need), and the device was fairly straight-forward and seemed easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And, it is clear why this little thing is the best seller in this category on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (I have fine, blonde hair), a light, slow, motion works best.  </li>
            <li> Seems durable, easy to clean, nice little velour bag for packing.</li>
            <li> I use a hard wax to wax my own underarms, but trying to do my own legs takes forever.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, I decided to get brave and try it on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> The cord got in my way only once, which is amazing since I switched hands and angles a LOT.</li>
            <li> but its been great to use every few days rather than shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product because it&#x27;s a fast way to get a shaved look on my legs</li>
            <li> My legs feel absolutely amazing, and I&#x27;m not going back to shaving!!</li>
            <li> This gently removes the hair and pulls out the light colored hairs the laser did not get.</li>
            <li> I am not saying it is pain free, but I couldn&#x27;t feel too much.  </li>
            <li> With cream depilatories I often experienced some adverse chemical reaction and with waxing, well, its f@#!ing painful, but probaly the most swift and effective method I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> However, I was ready for some smooth legs and decided to just do it.  </li>
            <li> well worth it.</li>
            <li> My daughter borrowed mine, and loved it so much, I had to buy her one, so I could have mine back.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really worth the investment.</li>
            <li> My old Braun one was good, it had a light and was solid, but eventually the motor wore out.</li>
            <li> You do become used to it, and the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> In her own words, she didn&#x27;t know something so convenient existed - not as much pain as she had anticipated (and she has sensitive skin and waxing hurts</li>
            <li> Overall, I liked it, but I think this one can be improved..</li>
            <li> and it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be much more skin sensitive product</li>
            <li> (the product states that it&#x27;s only intended to be used on legs, so don&#x27;t take that as any kind of validation).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many ways- different lengths of hair, different speeds and techniques, after showering, after exfoliating, all the tips I&#x27;ve been able to find, but it still just breaks most of the hairs off.  </li>
            <li> The product is well worth the price it sells for.</li>
            <li> that you could do a full shaving first, and then use this periodically as hair begins to grow in.</li>
            <li> Hopefully by the time we&#x27;re back to warm weather</li>
            <li> What I can say is that while it does hurt, if it means that I don&#x27;t have to shave for a month it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> and there was some bleeding on the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> BUT SOOOOOOOOOO worth it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The armpits were really fun to do.</li>
            <li> you get your moneys worth from this</li>
            <li> It looks like it pulled the hair with the roots attached, so I am hoping it will be much like having a wax and last a good while.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a cap to use when epilating in the most sensitive areas</li>
            <li> Powerful and efficient.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> So no matter how many times I went over the area it would not make my leg feel smooth, all it left was a prickly leg.</li>
            <li> But it works, and the pain is almost exciting.</li>
            <li> it displays isn&#x27;t worth the hassle or the outcomes.</li>
            <li> and I was constantly having to adjust the angle to make it effective.</li>
            <li> For the price, I thought it was worth it</li>
            <li> To me this is way better that shaving because I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using products like these for many years now, when my old one stopped working I researched and decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve bought it my entire life, and I would say it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied so far but it will only be in time that I know if this is an effective method for me to use.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not as effective on all areas.</li>
            <li> But worth buying</li>
            <li> but it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> over all worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $30.</li>
            <li> To me it was well worth the discomfort.  </li>
            <li> When the box arrived it was packaged nicely and had all necessary materials.</li>
            <li> so it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> , the nice thing is it doesn&#x27;t come back in like after shaving.  </li>
            <li> but it is worth it</li>
            <li> The skin around my knees was more sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is simple and effective.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt more.</li>
            <li> You just have to decide if the pain is worth the price of beauty.</li>
            <li> If it continues to do well on my legs, it will be well worth the price I pay on disposable razors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was worth a try, but I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.</li>
            <li> the skin on my thighs is much more sensitive and it hurt like HELL.</li>
            <li> It is really useful and convenient.</li>
            <li> Was effective only for a month or so...</li>
            <li> must say, the advantage of epilating over shaving is well worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> I love epilating so far.  </li>
            <li> It is far better than doing waxing by self.</li>
            <li> but sure is loud...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> I never would have been able to wax that frequently.</li>
            <li> The pain is definatley worth it!And</li>
            <li> experienced frequent ingrown hairs (even though I followed the directions) and patches the machine simply could not pick up.  </li>
            <li> It is a useful product anyway.</li>
            <li> Worth buying</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you, Philips, for creating such an effective product.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something that worked better than my 13 year old one.</li>
            <li> tried a few and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Those things are better waxed by a professional.</li>
            <li> It is not painful at all, and it gets the job done pretty well.</li>
            <li> I think is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li> Worth the &amp;#34;pain.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> but it was worth it</li>
            <li> This epilator has been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> But it is so nice to only have to use it about 1 time a week or 1 every 10 days or so.  </li>
            <li> but it is useful for some areas.</li>
            <li> It DOES hurt, of course, because it is yanking the hairs out by the root, but you get used to it and the results are worth it.  </li>
            <li> but once you see the results its worth it&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I can get away with longer periods between hair removal with this as compared to shaving, this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Finally I ordered my own cuz wifey nagging about her epilator</li>
            <li> [Aka where the skin is far more used to this type of sensation</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?</li>
            <li> I say 5 stars worth of yes.</li>
            <li> [Aka where the skin is far more used to this type of sensation</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?</li>
            <li> I say 5 stars worth of yes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> so far i love it.</li>
            <li> It is also smaller and able to fit in my pits and bikini line well which the emagine couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> So worth it to me</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully, on her face, underneath her chin, where she has a tendency to grow a few old lady hairs.</li>
            <li> I assumed epilating would be a good alternative as it really does remove the entire hair follicle.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is worth it to get rid of porcupine legs.</li>
            <li> she indicated the HP6401 seemed worth trying.</li>
            <li> this product really useful in plucking your unwanted hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> Have been using one of these for years, the old one broke, after many years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine using it in more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Although compact and thin, this epilator packs a punch and does what it promises to do...remove hair flawlessly.</li>
            <li> SO worth it.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a useful product that does what it advertises at a fraction of the cost of its competition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall good, it leaves my legs much smoother than using a razor, and for longer.</li>
            <li> So I will continue to use this product, it may take up to 30 minutes to get my legs done, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I recommend that all users buy some kind of lotion to use after epilation and an exfoliating scrub glove to use prior to epilation.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Apart from the pain, it pulls out some hair but breaks most of them and skin doesn&#x27;t feel soft.</li>
            <li> I had to endure quite a bit of pain (for me) to get the job done, but I&#x27;m thinking it was worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, but only if you know how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> it would be nice to not have to quickly change into long sweat pants whenever we had a visitor.</li>
            <li> It;s becoming more important to have a good epilator as my eyes become less sharp as I age</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used an epilator before, just know that it hurts like hell, but, with the right one, it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to figure out why in due time.  </li>
            <li> Though it quite hurts using it the first time, next time it becomes much better!</li>
            <li> No more razor bumps, NO paying for waxing, and i&#x27;m sure that my husband is appreciating me not complaining about &#x27;not feeling sexy because I haven&#x27;t shaved&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I found that the batteries ran out fast in my other epilator so having a corded adapter is great for not having it run out on you</li>
            <li> If you have never used an epilator, be aware that it pulls out the hair - so there is some mild discomfort, but it comes with a beginner&#x27;s guard to make it easier.</li>
            <li> For my first time using an epilator, I learned a valuable lesson rather quickly.</li>
            <li> and I got used to it pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> The pain went away pretty quickly and I didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> My first reaction was \\&quot;Jeezes!\\&quot; before quickly turning it off.</li>
            <li> Not worth the bother, get something a little more pricey for results, there are some great ones out there!</li>
            <li> The head pops off easily and it&#x27;s not hard to run it under water or blow on it to get the hair out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, and my husband asked what was happening, but it was quick and easy to do my feet and lower leg (right to my knees).</li>
            <li> I was so excited I did my whole armpit and</li>
            <li> I either got a bum product, or this isn&#x27;t as good as all the other reviews say it is.  </li>
            <li> Easily one of the most exciting things about using this product is the sheer volume of hair that comes out of the thing, much like a lawn mower.</li>
            <li> I don;t have the right type of skin.</li>
            <li> the guard thing broke right away, you dont need it</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> and I think I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> (ie don&#x27;t do it right before you go</li>
            <li> It really does a great job in getting a lot of hair in a single pass, and most areas only need the one pass.</li>
            <li> If you do it right, you can get a Brazilian thing going.</li>
            <li> Still, we&#x27;re doing this out of convenience, right?</li>
            <li> Otherwise it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, rips the hair right out of you leg.</li>
            <li> Eventually I bit the bullet and finished the right armpit.</li>
            <li> I took it out and tried it right</li>
            <li> Not to mention the time my boyfriend walked in right as I was ripping off the bikini strip, he was horrified.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The pain is right up there with electrocution.</li>
            <li> Basically use it right</li>
            <li> She looked at it Christmas morning and fell for it right off, we read the instruction sheet on the 26th</li>
            <li> the Satinelle right after washing your face and showering and remember to stretch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it could be because I&#x27;m right side dominant</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice to get the right angle and pressure.  </li>
            <li> then I anticipated so if you&#x27;re looking for painless I&#x27;d say this isn&#x27;t the right thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> Just received it started right away.  </li>
            <li> It pulls the hairs right out</li>
            <li> Having said all of that the subsequent times i have used it have been great, very easy to use, does a great job and is much more convenient than shaving, as well as less expensive.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my lady parts (even though it isn&#x27;t recommended in the instructions) and surprisingly it hurt far less than on my legs, and worked MUCH better.</li>
            <li> A good exfoliating glove helps tremendously, use it while you&#x27;re in the shower before you use the epilator and it will help expose any hairs that may have started to grown under that thin top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> It woks great but a little tab broke that keeps the head on!</li>
            <li> Epilator works fine, but will most it only can grab hairs that are a certain length.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The problem though was that it didn&#x27;t seem to very easily go in and around the curves above my lip etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> most of the major visible hairs are gone off my legs.</li>
            <li> The sound is very loud!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a major hair problem, since I have lasered most of my body.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase, even if it isn&#x27;t totally effective, and for the price compared to other epilators I think it does a good enough job.</li>
            <li> I found that this epilator did a good job of removing the coarse hairs, but simply broke the fine hairs off rather than pulling them out.  </li>
            <li> and I might be brave enough to wear them in public for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> I went over the same area many times, slowly, quickly, trying to get them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, but I don&#x27;t really like being so hairy</li>
            <li> Great service as usual.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; might be different on more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I am not sure but the experience was unforgettable.</li>
            <li> I was very worried about pain, but it&#x27;s not bad at all for me.</li>
            <li> cord is nice and long on this unit</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with the pain, you can try kind of bouncing it, always being sure to keep it perpendicular to your skin, that way you&#x27;re not getting too much pain in one area at a time.</li>
            <li> i have other these 3 times already the first i loved it</li>
            <li> Kind of a hassle when it comes to traveling as well because the cord is so long.</li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long so I do not need to hover over the outlet.</li>
            <li> It catches even tiny hairs easily and does the job much more quickly than my old epilator.</li>
            <li> this product did not remove hair well, at all despite its high rating and overall good reviews, it works as well as most 1 star rated objects, this item barley removes any hair at all and when it does it breaks off and is no different than shaving.</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair</li>
            <li> The little tweezer blades holds the hair and pulls out from the root, which is always best as it causes the hair to grow back thinner.</li>
            <li> It works great for my arms but is a little much for my face.</li>
            <li> You will probably want to do this on a day you aren&#x27;t showing off the area you are epilating because it WILL have little red polka dots from the irritation of hair being taken out.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely WONDERFUL product.</li>
            <li> It saves me time and injury, it is easily transportable,not dangerous for children, and it is very effective!</li>
            <li> Not very painful, just on armpits and bikini  </li>
            <li> Overall for the price and as a beginner with epilation its a good investment hairs take significantly longer to grow back then they do withat shaving/creams overy time</li>
            <li> I originally started looking at the more expensive ones, but decided on this one because of the good reviews and the cost.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said I have tried other epilators and this one seemed to work great in very sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> but people were right after the first tjme</li>
            <li> the bright side, I am now noticing much less hair growth than before.</li>
            <li> Just try it a few different ways and see what works best for you and your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> *much* longer, with quick repeated uses here and there maintaining a hairless look indefinitely.</li>
            <li> The head is very efficient and works quickly, which minimizes pain.  </li>
            <li> It is also great in removing the occasional rogue facial hair.</li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t give a product low stars based off the physical pain I experienced, something the product warns about, but I gotta give this a starred rating, in addition to this comment though I will talk about the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i wasnt sure if i would like them and didnt want to waste money on a product i wasnt sure about</li>
            <li> I like it, it removes hair very quick, so soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, I liked my initial results so much</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, I liked my initial results so much</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied,removes hair quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive and I would say that I can tolerate a good amount of irritants before turning red on me and such, and also my level of pain tolerance is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and it&#x27;s well work sticking through the initial pain to get great results.</li>
            <li> I bought an Emjoi for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;It was a superior</li>
            <li> I do use an alcohol free, fragrance free witch hazel afterwards and then for several nights</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price though, most of the hair takes weeks to grow back!</li>
            <li> it hurts more than others like around the bottom of my legs near my ankle really hurt when using this</li>
            <li> Also I am happy that it can be plug and used whenever I need, the time I need unlike the cordless models that you always have to remember to charge, the battery last 40 minutes only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very nervous about using it in more sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> My wife says not as good as the Braun she previously had.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> If your a wussy you definitely won&#x27;t be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;First time use is a lot more harsh than anytime after that</li>
            <li> I only use it in the bikini area or armpits when I feel brave enough.</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants to know, I am an African-American female on a quest to find a mechanical contraption or formula that will remove body hair effectively and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Not sure there are any epilators like that, but it would be very nice.</li>
            <li> at first i thought it is good to use it down there and arm pits</li>
            <li> I expected pain, pain and more pain!</li>
            <li> , this thing does successfully remove hair as intended, but it&#x27;s more painful than waxing and a million times more time consuming.</li>
            <li> As far as this machine working for plucking hairs:  it works pretty good even though you have to run over an area several times to get all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It feels as good as waxing, but without the mess or going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seeing as she has had two children by C-section and two abdominal surgeries she ought to be able to deal with the initial pain easily, right?</li>
            <li> it is wonderful and easy I used to have other similar but the results was not the same.....</li>
            <li> and she likes it very much.  </li>
            <li> the price was also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> also it is very fast: today I epilated both of my legs in 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Now I have to hold the cord at a very precise angle to get it to work, and even then it&#x27;s only intermittently functional.</li>
            <li> Additionally, my legs still feel very very sightly stubbly since the tiniest of hairs did not come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this would hurt so very much.</li>
            <li> I have and continue to recommend this product very highly!</li>
            <li> I think I am going to like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I like how it has two speed settings as well, although I&#x27;ve gotten used to the highest setting now and don&#x27;t have to use the lower one very much anymore.</li>
            <li> : Very fast.</li>
            <li> The way I see it there are four options: Shaving (cheap and quick but stubble and ingrown hairs), depilatory creams (only moderately effective and can cause chemical burns to sensitive areas), waxing (various types with painful but effective results - works best with someone else doing the \\&quot;ripping\\&quot;) and</li>
            <li> but my leg hairs are really fine and soft.</li>
            <li> I usually use wax but this epilator is faster to use and leaves the skin smooth for about three weeks, so I love it!</li>
            <li> I had bought other that really worked good.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try a new method of hair removal.</li>
            <li> It did hurt very much the first time</li>
            <li> It works great and hardly feel any sort of pain.</li>
            <li> so he left me be with my new favorite gadget!</li>
            <li> This has been my first epilator, so I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> and it still works pretty well.</li>
            <li> (THE HEAD CLICKS OFF).&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have a better grip on shorter hair because it doesn&#x27;t have the double tweezing</li>
            <li> looked at others that pull the same length of hair, there is no reason to pay more for an Epilator if they are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty time consuming.</li>
            <li> At first there was still a stubble but just keeping at it, over time there isn&#x27;t anymore stubble.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure it was scratching my skin, but it was just the pain of several hairs being pulled out at the root.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first epilator</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife recently and after many apprehensions, she decided to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everywhere is so much smoother looking!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> It sounds exactly like how I imagined the maw to Hell itself sounding.</li>
            <li> I will just spend more next time.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> used some Veet wax strips first so trim my underarm hoping to reduce pain during my epilation process.</li>
            <li> I regularly use tweezers and many types of shavers on my body with zero problems.  </li>
            <li> I thought my skin was pretty well conditioned to this sort of thing.  </li>
            <li> My first epilator.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have ever bought</li>
            <li> It hurts a bit the first couple of times but you get used to it</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I have used, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> It hurts like a mother on the first session</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than constantly gashing my legs with  a razor.</li>
            <li> Its my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> The first thing I&#x27;ll say is that this thing works.</li>
            <li> The longer the hair, the more times this gadget will pull, tug, and jump before finally pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried a step up because I am not going back to shaving now.</li>
            <li> Before we bought this epilator, I read so many reviews and compared different brands and style.</li>
            <li> It works really well!  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> (literally, I rubbed the area I was working on with a cloth to help open up the pores and desensitise my skin), but I was able to do all of both legs, as well as my underarms</li>
            <li> first I wished it was battery-operated.</li>
            <li> turning on the epilator, it sounds intimidating, but I found that while I was using it, I didn&#x27;t notice sound at all, and it didn&#x27;t seem loud to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe the flatter hairs here meant that some tugs of pain were the hair not quite being removed the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked pretty hairfree for over a month or two now, and it&#x27;s been with almost no care or effort on my part.</li>
            <li> , it works, it&#x27;s pretty, convenient, made well, durable, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> So much faster than waxing!</li>
            <li> so I tried taking a hot bath (soaking my body plus underarms) to soften the area</li>
            <li> Wish I bought more than one, so as to hang on to it for future need.</li>
            <li> More so than I anticipated for chin and upper lip areas.</li>
            <li> I know that the hair may return at a later date, but I&#x27;m sure it will be slower returning.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need practice with it, but I had higher hopes for it.</li>
            <li> This is the best the first time I use it was scary but after my skin get use to , now I will never shave again besti thing ever , and fast shipment !</li>
            <li> It does the job, (even more efficiently if the guard is removed), and it was only about $25.</li>
            <li> First time using an epilator.</li>
            <li> My husband walked in on me while I was using it for the first time and saw how giddy I was</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying an epilator, however, I have tried at home waxing.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE KEY - Put on some music or a tv show to distract yourself  After finding these tricks, I was able to get through both legs.</li>
            <li> Enchanted, I continued to wave this magical device over my lower limbs, waiting to see if the pain might be any different if I kept on going, or if it was just going to continue on.</li>
            <li> you, but more than silky enough.</li>
            <li> Like the slap of a burning hot rubber band,my &#x27;stache was GONE.</li>
            <li> My emjoi cost me close to 100 bucks, as this one which works way better only cost my around $30.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This unit only comes with a power cord that is quite long, which is great.</li>
            <li> I do not care if it can be used in the shower or have all sorts of extra fancy parts that also comes with appropriate amount of</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> But if you WAX FIRST...</li>
            <li> My first epilator.</li>
            <li> quite reasonable price, get it!</li>
            <li> Taking a hot bath and then using does help, reducing the pain just a notch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was surprised my legs didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as if they had just been shaved.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> But I did use the guard cap the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> So, a week later I tried it without the guard cap and was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> No noticeable hair is &amp;#34;plucked&amp;#34; with the first pass.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I have used before.</li>
            <li> I will admit, it does hurt a lot when you first use it.</li>
            <li> In a whole month!</li>
            <li> the epilator yanks all of the hair it can grab, so what grows back is thinner and more sparse.</li>
            <li> Santinelle was the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 10 years but got burnt in a trip to Europe since I forgot and plugged it in a 220v outlet...</li>
            <li> This epilator is my first</li>
            <li> It gets better with regular use.</li>
            <li> After DECADES of plucking, waxing, and shaving, I have finally found my magic solution.  </li>
            <li> and I love the 2 different speeds.</li>
            <li> this is my first epilator</li>
            <li> Be ready for the pain!</li>
            <li> wish I had returned it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked great for my fingers where the hairs are thinner and slow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has two speeds on it, one for finer hair and a faster setting for more coarse</li>
            <li> Despite the low price tag, I was expecting much better results from a Philips brand product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s efficient and while it doesn&#x27;t alleviate the pain of pulling out your short and curlies, it is more efficient than plucking.</li>
            <li> the first used.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;They say do this after a hot shower/bath.</li>
            <li> definitely have to go over areas more than once.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I got my first one (an Epilady) from groupon and didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> I think the epilday actually works a bit better.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> It works, but it does hurt at first.....</li>
            <li> Thanks, Philips!</li>
            <li> so I use it first</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to try emulation read up on it first.</li>
            <li> First, all the reviewers who said it HURTS are not lying.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hurt.this my first shaver</li>
            <li> Its my first one</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It hurts the first time you use it (just use a numbing cream if you want)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m willing to endure it&amp;#34</li>
            <li> recommend to anyone who wants to get rid of hair!</li>
            <li> The product comes with a guard which I tried to use at first</li>
            <li> I am always in a pretty hairy situation--I shave my legs in the morning and by the time that I get home in the evening, I already have a shadow on my legs.</li>
            <li> so the pain threashold is higher.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product, I have not worn long pants since purchasing this.</li>
            <li> My first epilator machine and it  does take some getting used to, it does hurt a bit.</li>
            <li> I used to spend so much money on waxing, not to mention time on DIY products, and the after tweezing!</li>
            <li> I used it for exactly 6 months and 20 days and it is giving me nerves.</li>
            <li> On first use it did hurt.</li>
            <li> When I first started epilating, it hurt like a MothaF.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get used to it after using it the first time.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Hurt like the dickens the first couple times, then no problem at all.</li>
            <li> I love the epilator and won&#x27;t go back to shaving, ever!</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have ever owned or tried to use.</li>
            <li> but this product is much better because remove even very short hair</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was my first time using an epilator after years of shaving,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy something more specific to my needs.</li>
            <li> But I only bought it 6 months ago and didn&#x27;t even use it more than once a week</li>
            <li> This epilator may be small but it sure is mighty!  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> I have to go in many different directions to get the hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, I would like to point out that the photo of the woman using the epilator as if it is a cordless tool is misleading.  </li>
            <li> I was so ready for this to be my &amp;#34;aha!</li>
            <li> I bought an emjoy for more than double the price on QVC.</li>
            <li> at first I was sacred to get it</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was going to hurt, but turns out that it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use epilator.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a pretty nifty tool if you&#x27;re wolly like me.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of any epilator.</li>
            <li> Before, I used to do get hot wax done on my legs.</li>
            <li> like I did the first time.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used an epilator</li>
            <li> (atleast for a first time user).</li>
            <li> I find that it works a lot better on thicker hair (such as underarms or bikini area)</li>
            <li> It hurts more on the face, the tummy, and especially the bikini area, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> I tried it first with the safety cap and started along my jawline.</li>
            <li> But as I moved along I could handle it pretty well.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s Many different  ones  </li>
            <li> pinches at first.</li>
            <li> My bony knee caps were challenging with the Emjoi, requiring multiple passes.</li>
            <li> #34;plucked&amp;#34; with the first pass</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i am a first time</li>
            <li> Overall was pleased.</li>
            <li> buy if you have a higher pain tolerance adn</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re willing to spend three hours removing your hair.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> first recommendation is this: WAX YOUR LEGS BEFORE YOU USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Never going back :)</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose very well too!</li>
            <li> Pretty noisy</li>
            <li> I tried it on my pits first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#2 take a hot shower and exfoliate&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first time epilating body hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, so was a tad nervous about using it after reading some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> The instructions would be better for some if they had a picture showing angle placement they are describing (sometimes a lot of words get in the way of the visual).  </li>
            <li> Hair&amp;#34;-)</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> is that my skin is still kinda irritated on the next day whereas I thought it was going to be okay, but it&#x27;s not something so noticeable.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with my purchase and hope to take advantage of it for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator ever.</li>
            <li> When you first use this it feels like you are burning your leg with a lighter.</li>
            <li> I was also hesitant at first, but then decided to test that area</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> and I absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about purchasing an epilator you should try this one before you go and pay way more for something that will work the same.</li>
            <li> it really works under my arms!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an epilator.  </li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess you aren&#x27;t a really women until you have epilated your armpits!  </li>
            <li> Some people love these things, but if you&#x27;re like be and shaving gives you ingrown hairs too, this will just do the same.</li>
            <li> I did use it on my legs but it seemed to take longer than just shaving first then using this to supplement in between.  </li>
            <li> First of all I read mostly all the reviews i could possibly read.</li>
            <li> And you get used to the pulling after the first 10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> Watch videos on youtube about how to do it and read the instructions that come with it, remember the longer the hair is the more it hurts, but too short</li>
            <li> First problem was that it didn&#x27;t contain the head cleaning brush that it was supposed to .  </li>
            <li> it hurt quite a bit at first but after a minute or two I didn&#x27;t feel it at all.  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> The first time you use it you are pulling ALL the hair at once.</li>
            <li> Okay this is my third update</li>
            <li> But I will most definitely be returning this.</li>
            <li> watched a handful of tutorials on epilating before and during use to make sure I was doing it properly.</li>
            <li> I have a higher pain tolerance than some</li>
            <li> and it does exactly what I need it to do ...</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never epilated before and what everyone says about it hurting at first</li>
            <li> I used it without the guard like the 3rd time I picked it up and got way better results.</li>
            <li> and it just may not be the right length at a certain spot.</li>
            <li> after several sessions, my calves stayed smooth for quite a while!</li>
            <li> a first time epilator user, but</li>
            <li> Be aware that you must be plugged in to an outlet for this to work.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The first one I got had a faulty part and stopped working after 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> It hurt for me ALOT and decided to do waxing first, as others had recommended.</li>
            <li> you so much!</li>
            <li> it took me forever to do the first because of the pain.</li>
            <li> I got my first epilator</li>
            <li> I have been waxing and am so glad I finally tried this type of hair removal.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done, which is better than manually plucking individual hairs &amp; shaving.</li>
            <li> but it its rather noisy which made me hesitant to use it at first.</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts at first, but you get used to it the more you use it.</li>
            <li> I epilated my arm pits first.</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have returned this after I used it the first time.</li>
            <li> Does its job really well!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator after years of waxing, both at home and at salons.</li>
            <li> When I shave, though my legs are 95% smooth directly after, I will have noticable stubble within 12 hours.</li>
            <li> For the first month, I probably used it 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the first month I don&#x27;t even use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I had an Emjoi in the same price range before and this Satinelle epilator is a much better product.</li>
            <li> My last epilator would break many of the hairs and leave the root.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the epilator it hurt quite a bit</li>
            <li> I used this over 3 weeks ago (I did shave the &amp;#34;leftovers in between&amp;#34;) and</li>
            <li> Pretty noisy</li>
            <li> The Braun was my first epilator, and it routinely took me up to an hour to use it on both of my legs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s faster and more thorough than more expensive products with more tweezers, but it is.  </li>
            <li> So I must tell you that the first time i used it I had not shaved my legs for about 5-7 days.</li>
            <li> Absolutely!  </li>
            <li> I went to do my left leg, and it hurt quite a bit more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad my last one broke...!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Came fast!</li>
            <li> The product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Anyways, this stuff works very well!</li>
            <li> Must buy for those pretty ladies with man hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an epilator.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> Happy with it and cord is long enough.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll know exactly what this feels like.</li>
            <li> that was pretty painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Braun:  This was the first one I used...</li>
            <li> After I used it the first time, I vowed that I would never epilate again....</li>
            <li> I tried it on my arms first</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, if you think you&#x27;re an expert as a first time user</li>
            <li> My first time using this on my legs</li>
            <li> It will sting the first time or two.</li>
            <li> I was scared of this at first</li>
            <li> Have to run the Philips over the area more to get the same results.</li>
            <li> but I imagine it&#x27;s probably the same with most epilators.</li>
            <li> so I assume it works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> My first epilator.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator experience ever</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it, does without say that it&#x27;s not painfree, but according to her, it&#x27;s pretty endurable.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve done nearly my whole body at this point (1 week of use)!</li>
            <li> The size of this may be ok for a smaller person</li>
            <li> Try waxing first</li>
            <li> I do get plenty of ingrown hairs which I have to pluck out with a tweezer as well, even though I exfoliate consistently with exfoliating gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> Definitely got most of the medium-textured hair on my calves.</li>
            <li> Shaving was no longer necessary for the most part.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator thinking I&#x27;d be able to use it only on my legs.</li>
            <li> Doing your legs may be an all night process your first time.</li>
            <li> A six pack of razors costs just as much!  </li>
            <li> First time user</li>
            <li> I never have had to shave my legs since getting the first one.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my feet the first day I got it</li>
            <li> and it worked very well!</li>
            <li> It hurts more than waxing, but you&#x27;re paying the same price for a one time waxing when you can use the epilator as often as you like.</li>
            <li> Pain is not an issue with me, since I have epilated for so many years and lasered, but I have to say, this unit actually hurt at times.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m really glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I would upgrade to a better product but get the same brand.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using one of these.</li>
            <li> First off, yes, it f***ing hurt.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sorry I got it</li>
            <li> This is my first time using one if these</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special...use only on legs.</li>
            <li> * the first time,</li>
            <li> First impression...</li>
            <li> I let the hair grow out for a couple days before using it the first time and it had no problem grabbing onto the hairs.  </li>
            <li> so this is my first introduction/purchase of an epilator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electronic body shaver</li>
            <li> in the beginning use it in stids don&#x27;t think you can do all the area at once as first.  </li>
            <li> this was my first epilator</li>
            <li> For me, it hurt like the dickens the first time I did it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since done it consistently once a week, and both times after the first it has definitely been more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does take a bit of time, going over the same area, and hasn&#x27;t quite succeeded in getting all hair, although it does get most.  </li>
            <li> first pass did miss some spots, so the next day, I laid a towel out in a well-lit area to do more cleanup.  </li>
            <li> I wound up doing my arms the second day because I&#x27;m so satisfied with the effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, really satisfied.</li>
            <li> The only way that I wish it could be a bit better is if it got all of the hair on the first</li>
            <li> * the first time I used it-</li>
            <li> I had smooth soft body after using this.</li>
            <li> First I wish it worked after the first time because my girls seem to epilate EVERY DAY NON-STOP.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty intimidated by the tweezers.  </li>
            <li> thanks mom and dad!).  </li>
            <li> So I used for the first time yesterday on my arms, legs and underarm.</li>
            <li> It did hurt at first but after a while I got used to it.</li>
            <li> It took several passes to rid most of my hairs and I feel like I still missed some.</li>
            <li> Overall the product was ok.</li>
            <li> Mys first time trying one of these.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> That being said, it works pretty well and can get the tiniest of hairs.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this Epilator it hurt beyond belief however with a painkiller and</li>
            <li> unfortunately many still left than pulled out.</li>
            <li> This is my first elipator ever</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t buy one of these, I hope you get some comic relief reading my review...</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions first.  </li>
            <li> Did it hurt like a mother and bleed the first time I tackled that area?</li>
            <li> I took Tylenol the first time just in case and that helped.</li>
            <li> I missed the first time.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time and there was some pain</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive</li>
            <li> Now imagine that sensations but triple (actually has 5 of them) cause this epilator has more the one but again, you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
            <li> to finish off this review, I would like to say that I don&#x27;t regret buying this epilator, though it&#x27;s my first one</li>
            <li> My hairs grow back more sparsely than before I began using this epilator.</li>
            <li> and I can torture myself when needed.&lt;br /&gt;#1 have a few good drinks before epolating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Emjoy epilator for a few years now, and it was really good.</li>
            <li> but you can always put a towel down somewhere more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Since the instructions and most reviewers recommended, I took a quick warm shower and also exfoliated my legs to open up the pores and remove any dead skin so that my leg hairs would be easier to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this new one and of course works better than my old one...</li>
            <li> It works very well but not so good as my previous one (Braun).</li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s sitting in my closet til I find someone who wants to try it.</li>
            <li> gave this product four stars because, after having this product for about a month now, I noticed that you have to wait for leg hairs to grow a certain length before you can epilate again because if its too short the tweezers on the epilator often times won&#x27;t be able to grasp the shorter hairs.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if I tried another higher quality epilator, it would actually produce smooth legs to make it worth the pain and time, but I&#x27;m not even going to bother.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than my own stupidity, this thing does a pretty good job of ripping the hairs out of my legs.</li>
            <li> I had not used an epilator since the original epilady in the early &#x27;90s.</li>
            <li> It is pretty loud, but i feel like most epilators will be loud.</li>
            <li> Warning to those who have never done it: The first time you will be mostly saying &amp;#34;Mommy!&amp;#34; or some such expletive the whole time.  </li>
            <li> and im honestly kinda nervous to do the other...</li>
            <li> Is using this epilator more enjoyable after a glass of wine and NSAID of your choice, at least at first?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this is by far the best thirty dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent on hair removal and in the long run</li>
            <li> It works perfectly if you use it on the opposite direction where your hair grows,  but, sometimes that is hard to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what percentage of my hairs were ripped vs. pulled out successfully.</li>
            <li> You might have to go over your leg twice at most, but it really does snag any hair you move it over AS LONG AS IT&#x27;S THE RIGHT DIRECTION.</li>
            <li> very handy to have when traveling and not able to go to the salon to wax!</li>
            <li> I think this is only good for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> i cannot use it on those areas any more because it is not accurate and i never get a smooth feel.</li>
            <li> The epilator head doesn&#x27;t pick up hair quickly; I need to glide over a particular area a couple of times to remove all the hair while keeping the movement very slow.&lt;br /&gt;b)</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable but good quality basic epilator.</li>
            <li> I have used it a lot; however, it may still be a good choice for someone who uses it moderately, seeing as the price has dropped further since I bought it.</li>
            <li> As good as your going to get just just short of actually shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved epilators as they are not as messy as wax and as a result a much faster experience.</li>
            <li> and it is removing hair very efficiently, no need to go many times on the same area.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than getting waxed once a month, and most of all, you can do it when you want and in private.</li>
            <li> I was going to dinner with my Aunt and cousins, so I only had time to do one leg before I left, which I felt would be a good trial run.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite as confident about it auto-stopping if it picks up some skin by accident (which all epilators tend to do in more delicate spots).</li>
            <li> I tried a friend&#x27;s 25 year old epilator several times to see if I liked using an epilator.</li>
            <li> the hairs on my leg are so much thinner and takes about a week or 2 to grow back :)</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about epilators, and decided to give one a try as the hair removal is supposed to last a big longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> The way it&#x27;s head is designed provides really smooth result very fast without pulling your machine back and fourth many times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well, very fast as I said and seems to get the job done in a shorter time period as I did not expect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting I have a mildly high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> It is amazing product,  cheap, clean, easy and most important less painful....</li>
            <li> over 300 positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on a percent of positive feedbacks and price</li>
            <li> The positive part for it is that you won&#x27;t feel hurt when you shave.</li>
            <li> Works great on thin hair, but not so great on thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product seems much more effective at removing the hair although in my opinion it is more painful.</li>
            <li> With this epilator takes as long as a razer but removing most of the hair from root.</li>
            <li> Your first time: So upon tibial touchdown, I felt an electrifying jolt of pain - much like that of a thousand hairs being torn from their follicles all at once.</li>
            <li> First epilator I&#x27;ve tried since the 80s, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t want to wait until my leg hair is as long as his just to see if it works better.</li>
            <li> It really, really does at first, and in some spots, like the front of my legs, you just have to power through it.  </li>
            <li> I applied baby powder before using the epilator and made sure the skin was stretched and taut.</li>
            <li> Did I mention how much this hurt, the first time?</li>
            <li> Nothing that you can&#x27;t tolerate, unless you are a real crybaby ;)</li>
            <li> It arrived pretty fast too</li>
            <li> This is the first corded, real epilator I have ever had</li>
            <li> Other than that it works very well with or without the shield and is effective.</li>
            <li> You can plug it in pretty much in all countries since the input is from 100v to 240v .</li>
            <li> It really hurt when I used it on my lip at first</li>
            <li> I have wookie legs and when I first bought this,  it hurt too much to bear using it.  </li>
            <li> By that time, it had hurt for so long that I couldn&#x27;t take any more.</li>
            <li> The price is great compared to other models I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon and overall</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first epilator, so I may be expecting too much, but i feel like it often doesn&#x27;t pull out from the root, rather snaps the hair.</li>
            <li> First i wanna say this epilator does what its supposed to i recommend it, although i did my leg very thoroughly</li>
            <li> It removes all the hair on the first try, so it makes the work so much faster.</li>
            <li> Also, the first time I epilated my armpits hurt so much tears poured out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Also, the first time I epilated my armpits hurt so much tears poured out of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does hurt but it&#x27;s a lot better than waxing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had ir for long, so I can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I want and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I use it to remove hair pretty much anywhere.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s pretty much how epilation goes anywhere</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair on my legs and it required many passes to completely remove the hair, but rarely the hair broke.</li>
            <li> I like how the product is small and nifty and does a good job.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s not bad though, I guess.</li>
            <li> good job of cleaning up small hairs</li>
            <li> will definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to have a good epilator who does its job properly.</li>
            <li> and I think the results are every bit as good as my usual waxing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, many days later, my half-finished legs are serving as a live before-and-after shot!</li>
            <li> And I know that as you continue to rip the hair out from the root, it stops growing less and less, which is great news for me!</li>
            <li> I only epilated the main triangle, doing most of the visible hair-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had hairless legs, underarms, and most of my bikini line (this area in particular requires quite a bit of finesse) for the last three weeks</li>
            <li> It can get really short hairs and it works super quickly.</li>
            <li> Had a harder time with the very fine hair on my thighs and arms.</li>
            <li> My underarms are a bit more sensitive, but I can do them both in one sitting without any major discomfort.    </li>
            <li> am still not convinced that I let my leg hair grow long enough for this to be super effective, so I will keep trying.  </li>
            <li> Yep, first time hurt like heck, however every time afterwards is easy as shaving with much longer lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It most definitely did not do a great job, and was more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> when I can take more &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; I put it on high, and when I am in a wimpy mood I put it on low.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend taking a hot shower before epilating, and exfoliating while taking said hot shower.</li>
            <li> She has a very old coil-style Epilady device which still works fine but is more or less torture to use on longer, thicker hair.</li>
            <li> This was my first time epilating, so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other epilators, but I have to say I&#x27;m not too impressed with the experience.  </li>
            <li> but the following times I used this thing.. really not painful at all!</li>
            <li> If I am careful to keep my skin taught by raising my arm and using my other hand to increase the tautness I have been able to effectively use it under my arms.  </li>
            <li> I love this one more than my other because it is shaped kind of flat, not fat or chunky like my other epilator, and also very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Still, it was easy to go slowly (left the efficiency cap off) and I tried to keep the skin taunt in one direction or another.</li>
            <li> It is an electric tweezer and as such pulls longer hairs out rather easily.</li>
            <li> After that first rough week, it&#x27;s been much better.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s easy to use on the legs.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is the head pops off easily if dropped.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that I finally found an epilator that simply does what it&#x27;s been designed to do.</li>
            <li> It is super loud.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t subject myself to that kind of torture to my underarms or bikini area</li>
            <li> Any future hair growth, which will occur, is easily attacked and solved.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also use washcloths in the shower that aren&#x27;t super soft, so they help exfoliate and keep me from getting ingrown</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> This might take longer but the results last longer and he&#x27;s easy to do.</li>
            <li> Now I only need to use the epilator twice a month,pain free, and I can wear shorts for weeks straight without needing to worry!</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions and use after a shower with your skin dry.</li>
            <li> You can epilate after a shower but make sure your legs/arms/armpits are dry before epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves hairs on the legs and isn&#x27;t strong enough for the bikini.</li>
            <li> The first few times it worked liked a charm.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t unusually loud, had a nice long cord...</li>
            <li> so I do t have to worry about having a good charge, the cord has been long enough for me to work with</li>
            <li> My previous one was one of those fancy ones with hundred of little things and so perfect in grabbing the hair that sometimes grab the skin too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as silk epil epilator, it&#x27;s very weak and doesn&#x27;t get the hair out easily.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed the cordless ones and most run about 40 minutes on a single charge.</li>
            <li> It gets three stars because it hurts when the hair is pulled and doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, but gets most.</li>
            <li> It certainly pulls the hairs out -</li>
            <li> It is like a large tweezer, so if u can&#x27;t stand the pain of tweeting or waxing, then stick to the razor.</li>
            <li> , I have waxed, I have a large tattoo on my rib cage.</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on certain areas of the body because it rips hair out by the root, but I do my legs and underarms with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that I followed the directions well.</li>
            <li> then I would certainly give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works, but the problem is that I have to wait until the hair grows to a certain size, so I can remove them.</li>
            <li> and I certainly don&#x27;t want any strays.</li>
            <li> Certainly something you have to get use to.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use it gets disconnected in certain angles when i move it.</li>
            <li> I may have to get a little waxing for the very sensitive area but the rest is all good.</li>
            <li> so in long time it&#x27;s more cheap than using wax, and is totally convenient</li>
            <li> but it is mighty and pretty fast which is crucial for getting the job done.</li>
            <li> Have had for a few weeks and misses more hair than it pulls out!</li>
            <li> The price is right, and the pain is not bad enough to stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use... &amp; worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> maybe I have super roots on my hair, but no results worth mentioning, unless you could the tiny swatch of tissue that was whisked away...</li>
            <li> I mean, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t agony either.</li>
            <li> underarms certainly hurt quite a bit, but if you&#x27;re used to the pain of waxing your upper thighs or your bikini line, you should be fine with the pain.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but be careful to use it correctly to avoid as much ingrown hairs as possible!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a lot better for fine hair, since it easily removed longer, finer hairs but not my short thick hairs.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, it does what it says it will do and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This one is probably my favorite because it is so much faster than the single barrel ones.  </li>
            <li> Armpits are a very tender area when you are pulling hairs, so the first couple of times, it might bring a few tears to your eyes, but it is soooooo worth it!!!  </li>
            <li> cord is nice and long, so you don&#x27;t have to sit right next to an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the guard for the first several times, but found that it helped me learn how to hold the machine, and by the third or fourth time using it, I was able to remove it and it worked even better.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull out the fine or short hairs.</li>
            <li> (I cleaned it and tried it on my upper lip which also has fine hairs</li>
            <li> but with this epilator I am fine for 3 entire weeks!</li>
            <li> even if i forget the stubble is usually fine enough to ignore.  </li>
            <li> But when it&#x27;s all fine, it&#x27;s like pulling a regular head hair out of your head.</li>
            <li> I do have to go over each section several times, but it gets the job fine</li>
            <li> My lower legs are kinda coarse, but my thighs and body are fine.</li>
            <li> I would recommend shaving 2-3 days before you epilate and make sure your underarms are dry!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work so well for the upper lip, but seems fine for underarms too.</li>
            <li> Fine, medium, coarse hairs...</li>
            <li> There were some that were blonde &amp; fine and some that were course and darker.  </li>
            <li> The only place that it caused irritation was my bikini line, everywhere else was fine.</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is mostly fine except coarse hair towards the bottom of my calves.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this epilator for fine Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Used it on my legs, which have fine blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have always used epilators (24 years to be exact, started when I was 14) never once a razor and let me just day that this particular one did not the job.</li>
            <li> Actually your lucky if it ever does!</li>
            <li> and it seems to work pretty decently.</li>
            <li> If you have patience and a very high tolerance for pain, get it.</li>
            <li> I say this as someone that has a very, very high pain tolerance (giving birth, tattoos, didn&#x27;t bother me).  </li>
            <li> It was good for getting majority of my fine hair (I have very fine hair on my legs) but still left quite a few for plucking with tweezers or just plain shaving (which defeats the purpose for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I call this little thing amazing.</li>
            <li> and to top it off, it&#x27;s LOUD LOUD LOUD!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already loving this little guy.</li>
            <li> Works very well and gets rid of fine and coarse hairs alike.</li>
            <li> This does seem relatively low pain - on the legs where my hair is relatively fine, no worse than trying to shave with a scratchy razor.  </li>
            <li> I have a high pain tolerance so this is not uncomfortable for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll dip the toothbrush in alcohol first and then turn it to high to get the excess off.</li>
            <li> i have very thick hair on my legs and happy trail and also my armpits</li>
            <li> I tested a little area, that I will continue later on tomorrow, on my legs, and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> (in the long run, especially) ° Lets you de-hair pretty much any time and anywhere ° Super easy cleanup ° Very reasonable price °</li>
            <li> Though the sensation is uncomfortable when I epilate my under arms, the epilator work very good and for the price I really recommend it</li>
            <li> Not only is it super fast and easy, but I use it from the neck down and it feels like having baby smooth skin naturally for weeks!!!</li>
            <li> The only thing really positive I can say about this epilator is the regrowth does feel significantly softer than after shaving, though I don&#x27;t know why.  </li>
            <li> Fast response, fast shipping, high quality!</li>
            <li> The result was the same in all areas, smooth for a day or two, and then two weeks of intense itching and ingrow hairs.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my armpits, and a week later, they are still smooth as can be.  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really even use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Much easier than manual plucking.</li>
            <li> It removes all the hairs straight from the root.  </li>
            <li> It really helped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this product and will continue using it.  </li>
            <li> Now it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than waxing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was feeling very optimistic about using it.</li>
            <li> I think that the hair has to be much longer than the instructions call</li>
            <li> thanks Philips...</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much</li>
            <li> It is much much louder then some.</li>
            <li> Legs hurt so much for 3 days that rubbing them against the blanket hurt.</li>
            <li> And hair growes thinner and not as much.</li>
            <li> You ready for pain?  </li>
            <li> A bit noise but fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It does its job really well.</li>
            <li> and I did really like the results.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Doing my legs really didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t finish a whole leg.</li>
            <li> When you get used to these methods of hair removal, they don&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> Cordless product would be much nicer than this one.</li>
            <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t hurt--but that&#x27;s because it isn&#x27;t pulling hairs out really...</li>
            <li> Also does not get as much.</li>
            <li> I much much prefer the Emjoi Emagine Dual 72 tweezer.</li>
            <li> Once I thought to tweeze around the bikini line and after an hour I hadn&#x27;t accomplished much and gave up.</li>
            <li> machine works very well</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t seem to matter much except one is faster</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really see what you are doing, even using a mirror.</li>
            <li> Having sweat glands there also meant that moving the epilator smoothly over the skin was not really possible because it kept sticking to the skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing hurt overmuch- not as much as the ankle area of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The hair is much denser there, and doesn&#x27;t grow quite as fast as my underarms.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Left me feeling totally smooth.</li>
            <li> but the results are so much longer.</li>
            <li> I had never tried waxing but really wanted to and while looking up waxes, I came across epilators.</li>
            <li> but it absolutely does the job.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt that much, but it also doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.  </li>
            <li> It removed all the hair off my legs and arms and left a smooth silky skin.  </li>
            <li> It hurts no worse than tweezing.</li>
            <li> Are you a real woman?</li>
            <li> Then you are ready for this product.</li>
            <li> It can be used for the legs, arms, bikini line, underarms, anywhere really.</li>
            <li> i like it so much.</li>
            <li> really help me a lot.</li>
            <li> the up side, it does seem to work under my arms on THICKER hair very well.</li>
            <li> Shipment was really fast</li>
            <li> Does its job very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product</li>
            <li> It takes me quite a while to do my legs with this, but it lasts much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> although noise level was mentioned In did not find it unusually noisy.  </li>
            <li> Instead I really wanted to go and shave because my legs felt so prickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m very prone to ingrown hair and epilators</li>
            <li> This one pulls the hairs out quite well and works anywhere on the body one wants to remove hair.</li>
            <li> but it hurts more than expected.</li>
            <li> is that you save so much money of waxing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And there in no bag to carry it, what would be very practical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny and light.</li>
            <li> so really now.</li>
            <li> be ready to deal with ingrowns and exfoliate often.</li>
            <li> the epilator  works really well</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not as much hair to rip out</li>
            <li> If you can handle it, go for it, me, not so much.</li>
            <li> Razors would irritate my underarm so much that it would sting to put on deoderant.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m much faster at shaving.</li>
            <li> should maybe also mention that I suffer from chronic migraines, so the pain was relatively very manageable in my case.</li>
            <li> and fast I&#x27;ll try it again one day maybe after a couple drinks ouch</li>
            <li> I use Witch Hazel afterward to soothe the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be gross, but if you use this in your butt crack, make sure you ALWAYS keep it (the machine AND your butt crack) clean and dry or</li>
            <li> The cord on the Braun is MUCH longer.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My legs feel almost swollen and very agitated.</li>
            <li> It seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> This has really helped with the ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I ended up returning it, as I still had to shave and there didn&#x27;t seem to be much point.</li>
            <li> It is still somewhat painful to use this, but so far this has the most effective result, satisfied.</li>
            <li> Where they used to be feels like a baby&#x27;s ass, which is very convenient cuz</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> but it was too lengthy and wasn&#x27;t really convenient.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much louder than you would expect a machine of that size to be.</li>
            <li> I really like the Satinelle</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this epilator.</li>
            <li> I used it on a Wednesday and a week later my legs are still smooth.</li>
            <li> back)This is much safer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i don&#x27; use it very often</li>
            <li> but  absolutely tolerable</li>
            <li> Waxing removes a section of hair all at once, whereas an epilator removes the hair one at a time from the root at a fast speed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to use it.</li>
            <li> Works perfactly and removes hair without much pain.</li>
            <li> Clearly you need to build up a tolerance to using an epilator, I used one many years ago, different style, so I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> I skipped two days shaving and the hair I was getting looked like I had gone a whole winter.</li>
            <li> So I read the reviews , which were very helpful ,ordered  it  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all on legs, but I try to use this on my underarms too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going too fast and the hairs just end up breaking</li>
            <li> And nobody wants ingrown</li>
            <li> It works but it doesnt really shave all the hair</li>
            <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> if you can handle that much pain do it if not use something else.</li>
            <li> I really like these epilators.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> fast on time  </li>
            <li> Its very nice.easy to use...</li>
            <li> so it really stings and</li>
            <li> But, while to stay smooth I have to shave daily, with this</li>
            <li> This really does remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I do prefer epilation to shaving my arms and legs, as it leaves my skin much smoother</li>
            <li> Very reliable.</li>
            <li> However, now that I have had some practice and getting used to it, the pain really isn&#x27;t noticeable.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It does work very well at removing all the hair.</li>
            <li> it hurted my arms really bad&amp;#62; I was reluctant to re order another one</li>
            <li> I spent hours using this device and found it to be inefficient at removing most of my hairs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s functional, it really does the job...</li>
            <li> So I ended up just being hairy all the time because who wants to plan a &amp;#34;waxing my f-ing legs&amp;#34; night.</li>
            <li> However, this devices still make too much noise.</li>
            <li> I have much hair growth on my legs.</li>
            <li> So after waxing, within 3 weeks hair will start to be very visible.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient device.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do much anyway.  </li>
            <li> I tried all of the remedies above but never achieved smooth, hair-free results...</li>
            <li> Have smoother skin thanks to.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really person  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair very well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look or feel like ingrown hairs, but something really got irritated.</li>
            <li> Does really well to remove hairs from my legs.</li>
            <li> It really helps the epilator not hurt your skin while you epilate.</li>
            <li> Epilate very well</li>
            <li> really hurting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Epilating lasts much longer, with</li>
            <li> Very affordable epilator that does the job</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really use it anymore.</li>
            <li> but Phillips wants her to pay for shipping, she might have to go see a dermatologist over this.</li>
            <li> but then it doesn&#x27;t really hurt.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Good in that you have more range, but bad in that It can get kind of tangled up if you aren&#x27;t careful.  </li>
            <li> Well it does plucks your hair, it really does.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My leg hair used to grow really fast.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and i didn&#x27;t experience any problems from this company.</li>
            <li> It really pulls when you try to get rid of some hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is much smoother and my husband also notices and conpliments me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As you probably guessed, it is not entirely pain free since it pulls the hair from the roots.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t find it to be too much to handle.</li>
            <li> process is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> For what I would have paid for two professional waxings, I bought this epilator instead and in my opinion, from a &#x27;hairy chick&#x27;, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> This one works ok, but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> works really well, and it is a very practical</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if the epilation lasts &amp;#34;for weeks&amp;#34;.]</li>
            <li> The pain is real though.</li>
            <li> and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> My daughter said it hurts for a bit but works really well.</li>
            <li> I should have used Philips epilators from the get go instead of using Braun, even though Braun don&#x27;t hurt as much so may be if you&#x27;re a beginner</li>
            <li> I do really like my legs after the process.  </li>
            <li> i cant complain really.</li>
            <li> really cordless&lt;br /&gt;Not a wet/dry model</li>
            <li> It worked well, and didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I was fearing.</li>
            <li> With the hair grown back more sparsely and soft, it didn&#x27;t really grab a lot of them as well</li>
            <li> I do agree with a comment that I remember reading when I was choosing to buy one(which was not necessarily about this model), which is that it never felt smooth like after shaving.</li>
            <li> it is so powerful and pull your hair completely.</li>
            <li> It is noisy no matter what speed it&#x27;s on, very intimidating.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> I should have read more carefully though.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was rechargeable, but it must be plugged in the whole time.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is a much cheaper alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain, but no way could I handle this torturous device!  </li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> The whole time I was saying &amp;#34;Ow...</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it in intimate area as well..</li>
            <li> like in the beginning when i was using it pulled out almost everything, fast</li>
            <li> Its been a week since I got this and precisely the same time</li>
            <li> and I am much happier.</li>
            <li> I have not had much experience (or luck) with waxing.</li>
            <li> So, I was feeling really nervous to drop my pants and try the rest....</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise to find that this product is much, much faster.  </li>
            <li> The itching and ingrown hairs became too much</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove my hairs...</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator.</li>
            <li> Very inconsistent maybe removed 10% of hairs and broke the rest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epilating the bikini area hurts so much.</li>
            <li> I feel each hair and the pain is very intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epilating the bikini area hurts so much.</li>
            <li> I feel each hair and the pain is very intense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> I expected more for the price and the dact is manufactured by Philips</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare...</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li> me give it to you straight</li>
            <li> it REALLY work</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t do anything in my opinion.</li>
            <li> OK...I&#x27;m a guy and I use epilation to remove body hair that I don&#x27;t really care for...</li>
            <li> but it does not hurt all that much and works</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> not),&lt;br /&gt;It is much simpler to wax and remove alot of hair in one go then trying to use this shipping/functionality 4/5&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> On my legs I did maybe a minute of swiping and couldn&#x27;t really see a difference in hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I felt like it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I suggest to use it in a well lightened place, because it&#x27;s easier to find those tricky hairs if you have enough light.</li>
            <li> It does what it claims to do and it does it very well.</li>
            <li> so ingrown hairs aren&#x27;t a real problem for me.</li>
            <li> I had different epilator that I had lost and it didn&#x27;t run as smoothly as this one does.</li>
            <li> Very sleek.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> However, today I decided to give it a try on my bikini area and, to my surprise, I manage to epilate the whole area (really, EVERYTHING).</li>
            <li> tried under my arms and it hurt more than I expected, and the area was a bit irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have too much hair,</li>
            <li> and i have smooth legs in a short time vs waxing that took me 2 hours sometimes&lt;</li>
            <li> That will really REALLY hurt.</li>
            <li> This requires patience, persistence, and a high pain threshold!  </li>
            <li> After looking at the current products available</li>
            <li> or maybe I epilate too much?</li>
            <li> She said it was like a really fast tweezer running over her legs</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator.</li>
            <li> I have very hairy legs</li>
            <li> I get a lot of ingrown hairs if I do the whole thing</li>
            <li> better then i expected</li>
            <li> Much against my unfounded fear of epilators, I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> Very annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depends on how fast I have to do it again.  </li>
            <li> and I like the dog too much to even go there)</li>
            <li> I have noticed that using this is so much easier than using a disposable razor</li>
            <li> I do not need use very often</li>
            <li> I have to say that I really like this.</li>
            <li> I just received it today, shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO much easier to just have to go over my lower legs in the shower</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to shave so much...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m okay with using just that, but my sole purpose for buying this product is to use it for underarm hair and the infamous \\&quot;happy trail.\\</li>
            <li> This one works really well and has minimum pulling sensation.</li>
            <li> This is a whole bunch of NO.</li>
            <li> and I can say it really gets the job done every time I use it.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, but I really do like this one.  </li>
            <li> I found that it didn&#x27;t cause much pain on my legs and did seem to get almost all of the hair.  </li>
            <li> (I was always so embarrassed to wear tanks or sleeveless dresses in the summer) and this has really helped.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know</li>
            <li> it very loud.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product for the face because of it&#x27;s size and ripping off too much skin instead of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It works fast and is thorough.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really pull out my hair.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, if you are looking for a fast and efficient epilator.</li>
            <li> Oh and I have very stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this epilator did a fantastic job of removing my coarse armpit hairs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the cord because I felt like it was getting in my way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt at all and my legs are smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;Armpits and lady bits however, are a different story.</li>
            <li> Hitler even thought the use of this device on crotches was barbaric, if that gives you any indication of how much it hurt.</li>
            <li> : DO NOT OVERUSE THE FAST SPEED.</li>
            <li> I use &amp;#34;Emjoi&amp;#34; After Epilation Cream every time I epilate and it seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> two hours later my leg was hair free, cut free and the red bumps subsisted within 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit more aggressive and rough but it also seems to remove the hair faster.  </li>
            <li> It is very efficient.</li>
            <li> How much will it hurt?</li>
            <li> fast does it go?</li>
            <li> Real</li>
            <li> Just pluck from time to time but not as much.</li>
            <li> Bought it for facial hair, so far hasnt worked, ok on leg hair</li>
            <li> It will work for now and is still a good first one, but not good if you are determined to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping that I could get silky smooth legs for the first time in my life and since it take me a long time to shave my legs just for them to have stubble even immediately after.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with the result but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> and i would suggest for the sensitive areas to use a form of aftershave gel (my personal favorite is Bikini Zones aftershave GEL) and apply to the area to soothe irritation after using the epilator.</li>
            <li> It was too rough for facial hair and it did not do a good job.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t unbearable though; I was able to complete the upper triangle as well as my bikini line before I called it quits.</li>
            <li> I generally only use it on my forearms and legs, but by the way it feels, I&#x27;m tempted to try more sensitive</li>
            <li> It also works faster which surprised me because its smaller and more lightweight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  intensified while using on more sensitive areas such as the underarms, torso, or pubic area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading the instruction manual, I noticed that it is recommended that this product is to be used only on the legs and nowhere else, but obviously I want this product to be effective everywhere not just my legs.</li>
            <li> I thought with all that pain it would at least get a good bit of the hairs.</li>
            <li> i thick that is definitely a good buy</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and wear a lot of skirts, so if there&#x27;s a special occasion coming up, I&#x27;ll epilate or shave what stubble I have, which means I&#x27;ll be yanking some hairs out when I epilate next and leaving others, but even with my lack of commitment I only have to epilate every week at the most.  </li>
            <li> It does pluck some hairs, but it&#x27;s hard to tell just how many because it breaks all the other hairs, making it look like it did a good job.</li>
            <li> Yes, if you use this device only on super high-use skin, the sensation you get stays right on the high end of discomfort, not quite tipping over the cusp into pain.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more time consuming and kind of painful, but SO worth it!</li>
            <li> Many of them i can see the tips have the follicle/round black part on them, which mean that they have been successfully pulled off from the root.</li>
            <li> Using it is very easy, and after having my hair used to being ripped out rather than cut off, it honestly wasn&#x27;t painful like it was the first time I tried it or the first time I got waxed.</li>
            <li> After use, very good, shaved fairly clean, not too painful</li>
            <li> I like how easy it is to use and that the cord is long.</li>
            <li> cord is long and the epilator runs strong.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt on the ankle area and on the back of the leg (calf) but other than that, its good.</li>
            <li> This is largely because it just works better--it grabs way more hair on the first few passes</li>
            <li> Also my skin was very irritated after the first time, but that got a little better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Philips is small and light enough that it&#x27;s easy to handle, love the longer than normal cord that lets me use it wherever I want to regardless of how far the outlet is.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, it was very loud and when I made a pass over my stomach that I had just shaven it hurt a lot.</li>
            <li> After the first few uses I got use it and my legs are pretty smooth now thanks to this!</li>
            <li> This epilator must be plugged in when using I did not realize that, but better I supposed as my other rechargeable one quit working because the battery could not hold charge.  </li>
            <li> but I had the original Epilady back in the 80s (give or take).  </li>
            <li> did not shower beforehand this time, as I feel that the hot water, while it may open pores, also weakens the hair itself, making it more likely to break instead of come out.</li>
            <li> Perhaps other users may gave better luck.</li>
            <li> I would say that the power cord is not that big of a deal any more - I&#x27;ve used it with a different one and it has been working consistently.</li>
            <li> It works better then any other epilator I have ever had.</li>
            <li> All excited to receive it, used it once, and the next rime I plugged it in it would not work.  </li>
            <li> Definitely won&#x27;t serve the purpose originally intended</li>
            <li> The legs on the other hand were almost painless, and the results are better than I could have ever imagined.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have stubble 10 minutes later, in fact I didn&#x27;t see anything worth removing for a week!</li>
            <li> I can do my legs and underarms in 20 minutes flat, and they stay smooth for a week.  </li>
            <li> I like this method much better than any other unwanted hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Love this use on my legs and other parts.</li>
            <li> It was kind of scary at first, but I am getting used to the sound and feeling.</li>
            <li> But to someone who shaving daily, hates waxing, and doesn&#x27;t have luck with hair removal creams, the pain is worth it to me!</li>
            <li> much better than shaving or other alternatives.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this is perhaps not the most efficient Epilator out there</li>
            <li> If being smooth down there is worth intense pain to you, then I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I dont think its just this epilator that causes ingrowns, i think epilating in general causes ingrowns so make sure to exfoliate daily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair clean enough.</li>
            <li> Epilators are painful at first use, but once you get used to it,they are awesome.</li>
            <li> Yes it does hurt, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that after a few uses I will get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say yet how long this amazing smoothness will last</li>
            <li> Does a clean job with lesser pain.</li>
            <li> I only used it on clean, exfoliated skin, and exfoliated in between the times of use and growth</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased and wished I would have tried this a long long time ago.</li>
            <li> the hair is kind of long on different areas.</li>
            <li> Amazing little device!</li>
            <li> The epilator itself has never shown signs of breaking, slowing down, or becoming less effective.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend to those seeking a reasonable priced&lt;br /&gt;quality product.</li>
            <li> first time I use an epilator , at first it hurts , but gradually you get used to , and I really like it because it lasts much longer shaving, only to be moisturize skin thoroughly after use .</li>
            <li> ordered already 2 replacements heads, each cost almost as a whole new epilator, but I don&#x27;t need the whole device, so I prefered just to buy the spare part.</li>
            <li> Also there is a special sphere of heaven for women who can address those stout hairs on the labia area just above the clitoris with an epilator.</li>
            <li> Although I thought this epilator was a bit pricey ($39.00),  I purchased it because other Philips products that I have bought in the past were very good.  </li>
            <li> The Philips epilator removes this unwanted hair with very little pain and with amazing precision....</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve just been alternating and kind of doing whatever works out, which allows me to avoid shaving tricky areas like knees and ankles (where I typically tend to nick myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But a lot less irritation than waxing and very smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I also really miss the light on my previous one, which with time had slowed down and was not as effective as it once has been.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t take long to build a tolerance.</li>
            <li> Plus I know it won&#x27;t take long for them to be as smooth as my thighs feel if I just stick with it &amp; never shave again.</li>
            <li> Having smooth, stuble-free pits every day is something I wish I had done a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I ended up shaving what I couldn&#x27;t epilate, and the results are pretty clear.</li>
            <li> Have you reflected with rue upon a dinner party you ruined through your own juvenile, drunken antics?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be completely transparent for a moment, my hair grows fast, and with that fast growing hair are in-grown hairs which the epilator cant really grab.</li>
            <li> Wow at first .. ouch..</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it was intended to do, albeit somewhat loudly.</li>
            <li> The first time you use it it seems not to remove them completely all the way to the root.</li>
            <li> Also, it is pretty loud</li>
            <li> For me it was not painful, and the subsequent times no pain!</li>
            <li> and she used it for the first time, told me hands off this is mine, she loves it so far.</li>
            <li> I gave 4/5 stars because my hair starts growing back sooner than I wanted to (2-3 weeks instead of a full 3 or 4), but that might just be my body.</li>
            <li> THIS one gets more than most but not the truly short and thick hairs.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s loud, but no louder than an electric razor or clippers.  </li>
            <li> but this one is by  far the one with  higher performance.  </li>
            <li> The skin is really soft and smooth and the hair grows back very fine.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might be one of the devils favorite torture tools for really really naughty sinners.</li>
            <li> light, nice grib and long cable didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because didn&#x27;t come with a small case-</li>
            <li> The pain is not bad enough for that in my opinion.</li>
            <li> But when I received the product it is very cheap looking, it doesn&#x27;t come with anything extra, has only one head</li>
            <li> On the longer parts it did hurt quite a bit more, so I definitely recommend shaving a day or two before you use this so that the hair is not too long - but the parts that were just short stubble were fine.</li>
            <li> I DID have the typical ingrown hairs at first, but it was easy to deal with and had no pimples, boils, infections, etc.</li>
            <li> All you women out there, feel free to mock me and men in general for our low pain tolerance, and how most men wouldn&#x27;t be willing to go through half the discomfort/pain</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty loud but seems to be decent quality.</li>
            <li> My legs over the next couple of days definitely did not seem as smooth as they would have been right after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I feel like I have the skin of new born baby now!</li>
            <li> hair blew loose just fine during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some hairs end up being cut rather than pulled, but most are definitely yanked clean out, as you can see the little follicle at the ends.</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations</li>
            <li> I works better than the new models, it takes me less time and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It will cause breakage on about half the hair and require more time than shaving or waxing</li>
            <li> The more you use it the easier and less pain you have.</li>
            <li> As you epilate more and more, the pain DOES get less and less each time until one day you don&#x27;t feel any pain at all.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the discomfort will become less.</li>
            <li> This one has half as many.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a lot more blades than the epilator that I&#x27;ve had previously.</li>
            <li> and it still hurts but pain gets less the more you use it.</li>
            <li> easy to use and not very hurt</li>
            <li> I was having my chin/lip threaded, so I was more or less used to the stinging sensation, so that was no shock.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are much more efficient at plucking since my previous one tended to break off the hairs.</li>
            <li> People say the more tweezers the less</li>
            <li> In contrast to what the instruction sheet says, I had better results with longer hair (previously unshaven) than with 1/8 stubble.</li>
            <li> Since then I haven&#x27;t enjoyed my epilating sessions because it now takes 40 minutes to do my legs, half of which that time is f**king around with the cord to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not real satisfied on some areas where I wanted it the most.</li>
            <li> Better than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li> My main problem with it is that is doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> I love my solid and sturdy Emjoi red one.</li>
            <li> I think, it is mainly designed for feet (my sister uses it not me).</li>
            <li> and I bought it mainly for my underarms.</li>
            <li> but this one is decently priced and does the job.  </li>
            <li> I have an older Remington epilator, and the battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged anymore, have to keep it plugged in to use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was because of this particular epilator, since I never used another epilator before.</li>
            <li> gave the product 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t know if the pain I felt was from this particular product.</li>
            <li> From my experience with this particular epilator, it does not seem to pull the hair from the root.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this and hoped it would end plucking and harsh chemical hair removers,  but it wasn&#x27;t meant to be.</li>
            <li> Overall, it didn&#x27;t really work for me and it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.</li>
            <li> If you have a decent tolerance to pain, get one.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely continue buying this one if my current one breaks.</li>
            <li> Getting older...</li>
            <li> The hair grows back really quick.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of grabbing and removing hair at the root, with next to no broken hairs ° Way easier than waxing ° Way less messy than waxing ° Way cheaper than waxing</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Ive also found that shorter and finer hairs it pulls well, doesn&#x27;t grow back quick either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go over this spot several times, diff speeds, different angles and I still pluck most of the hair out..  </li>
            <li> it works decently.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a lot of ingrowns, but I most likely was not using it properly.  </li>
            <li> this one is OK for occasional use only...</li>
            <li> I am lucky because I purchased this last week and it was on sell for $30</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> tried it a second time hoping for better results but it was the same deal.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I had not been able to get rid of all of my facial hair at once without it growing back in days.</li>
            <li> Nothing particular fancy about it</li>
            <li> I always had a basic model of Braun, which works much better, but had to find something with american cord.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my underarms.</li>
            <li> This particular model must be plugged in for usage.  </li>
            <li> but after inspection the problem seemed to lie in the main compartment where the electrical systems are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily this type of hair removal seems to last a while</li>
            <li> Make sure if you send it back to use insured postage (an extra 5 bucks).</li>
            <li> I browsed online and saw that the price on this one was decent</li>
            <li> I had to do several passes, but I was going quickly to minimize the pain.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a wookie like me, and it&#x27;s your first try with an epilator, I do recommend starting with a wax first and then just using the epilator as needed to manage the regrowth.</li>
            <li> Maybe the more expensive ones get more hair</li>
            <li> she has an older model since 2005 but</li>
            <li> many many angry wasps.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I bought this is its capability to be used across the world.</li>
            <li> But they also left some tiny hairs but its ok.  </li>
            <li> Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> The two speeds are really nice; I use the fast setting on my legs and the slow setting on my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wax myself regularly and this didn&#x27;t feel any different from waxing (and it worked better)</li>
            <li> It fades quickly unless you have a very low pain</li>
            <li> The more expensive ones have more tweezers.</li>
            <li> I rely so much on decent reviews to help me make a choice</li>
            <li> My main epilator will remain an emjoi.</li>
            <li> The main reason I chose the Philips HP6401 was the price.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my Emjoi epilator finally died after 8 years of loyal service.</li>
            <li> I chose this one mainly because of the price.  </li>
            <li> gave it a 4 because it leaves many short hairs that I need to go over, but it does take it out after the second run.</li>
            <li> Mainly used for under arm.</li>
            <li> I dislike this product for two main reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing most people aren&#x27;t dealing with the same coarse hair I am (</li>
            <li> Sometimes it misses the smaller ones but nothing a quick tweezers touch up can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Glad it wasn&#x27;t more expensive.  </li>
            <li> It gives you a tolerable pain like a multiple quick pinch on your skin.</li>
            <li> The main thing is not to hurry and to believe that beauty demands of &amp;#34;victims&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and it got everything the older one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Try taking a warm/hot shower before using to make your pores open up a little more for a easier removal (make sure you are dry first though because this product is not water resistant).</li>
            <li> I threw out the guard I got with it within a month because it just isn&#x27;t necessary, but it was nice at first because I was a little leery of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fast, but very loud.</li>
            <li> Very fast and quick with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it seemed to have high ratings for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so they are accessible to the tweezer blades, but I&#x27;d also add to that don&#x27;t wait too long</li>
            <li> : If you have high pain tolerance and are willing to experiment a bit, this is worth adding to your arsenal of hair removal products, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a high threshold for pain.</li>
            <li> The pores in my pubic area did bleed, mostly up high in the sides of the triangle.</li>
            <li> If you have a high pain tolerance - knock yourself out.</li>
            <li> All in all, I highly recommend this epilator for the money.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend witch hazel after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality design.</li>
            <li> I run it on high</li>
            <li> and I have a high pain</li>
            <li> I came across this one, and read the reviews, the positives highly outweighed the negatives</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product if you have hair in unwanted places.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this epilator for those who are regulars at waxing and threading.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it, but the next time I buy an epilator, I&#x27;ll probably go for a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I use the high speed mode for faster results.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> do have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> but I have a high pain threshold...</li>
            <li> Just the noise level it makes is high.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have high expectations for the rest of the unit&#x27;s lifespan.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest anything highly scented though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have an extraordinarily high pain tolerance, but this topped it.</li>
            <li> I have lots of tattoos and a high tolerance, but it still hurts.</li>
            <li> i have a high pain tolerance and it feels like youre being burned or maybe cut</li>
            <li> Highly  recommend</li>
            <li> I found getting used to handling it helped and putting it on high.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to cry like a baby, and I tend to have a high tolerance to pain.  </li>
            <li> It was an impulse buy that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely smooth and, visually, no dark spots all over my legs from the hair still left in the follicle.</li>
            <li> I know it says not for use on face, but it does work fine there, but be careful not to overdue it.</li>
            <li> I now have no trouble epilating my underarms and have epilated all other parts of my body :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a significant plus especially on such sensitive zones as armpits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to shave every other day if I was showing my legs, more because of my self conscious.</li>
            <li> but my old one was smaller and funny enough was more loud.</li>
            <li> How this epilator saved me is that, I can easily remove those new and medium long hair easily and with less pain.</li>
            <li> Not horribly, but like little pricks with a needle.</li>
            <li> It sounded like a saw, so I always put my headphones on and listen to some upbeat music to help distract me a little &#x3D;)&lt;</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this product, especially if you&#x27;re a first time user as you can figure out if epilation is meant for you or not!</li>
            <li> The feel of the unit in your hand is also better with the Braun, which is a little rounder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waxing in the salon had more pain than this little gadget.  </li>
            <li> After a little while you may get use to it and are able to take the guard off (which I did).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend spending a little bit more for an epilator that will work longer than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, a little more detail about epilating if you care to read:  </li>
            <li> it was way better than I expected--just a little stinging but nothing unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> also used it on my armpits (ouch) hurt a little bit more</li>
            <li> Overall, recommended for first epilator!</li>
            <li> and I love this little device.</li>
            <li> we are meant to have soft skin and this is the at home cheaper way to get it!!</li>
            <li> n looks good, but epilator is definitely tough</li>
            <li> but apparently they don&#x27;t use this very much in the States.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really hurts, lives my under arms very very sore, it does not get the hair at all, my daughter try it but the same for her it didn&#x27;t do nothing.</li>
            <li> I do have to go over the same area a few times, but overall I am happy with is.</li>
            <li> Lol needless to say, I returned it.</li>
            <li> My old one was quieter and the vibration much smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just time consuming for my lifestyle because it has to be used on clean and dry skin but at the time I shower I am always in a hurry to rush out the door</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great solution and not as expensive as buying replacement heads for razors or getting waxing done.  </li>
            <li> My legs are so soft and it didn&#x27;t hurt so much, as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to make this review seem too personal or sound like a \\&quot;personals\\&quot; ad, but since this device is used on very \\&quot;discreet\\&quot; parts of the body I might as well disclose all the gritty details.</li>
            <li> I get better results from shaving where I actually feel smooth for at least three days.</li>
            <li> This appeared normal, so all I did was</li>
            <li> I normally wax or shave</li>
            <li> She normally waxes her legs.</li>
            <li> I always get my face and eyebrows threaded, so I wanted pretty much the same method for my legs and all over.</li>
            <li> that, just make sure you exfoliate the shit out of your skin.</li>
            <li> You have to understand that all epilators hurt, pretty much the same degree.</li>
            <li> Much better and easier than messy waxing.</li>
            <li> so I did have to go over a few areas again, but it also started to work more efficiently for me as I got used to using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> while the hair still comes back its worth it and something i would recomend</li>
            <li> Philips epilator is much more lightweight (in a cheapish way), has no light</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m stingy when purchasing products</li>
            <li> There are some places the pain isn&#x27;t worth the result, like my upper thighs and pubes.</li>
            <li> With this thing I can carve out a normal looking beard line.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago I bought Philips and I love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste any more time looking.</li>
            <li> This is a good entry level, says it&#x27;s for legs only on the package, so I&#x27;m not sure the description here should say it can be used anywhere else.</li>
            <li> This thing works pretty well - but is kind of irritating.  </li>
            <li> Its useful for facial hair n also for arms n</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wax or epilate normally, so</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m a first time user, it&#x27;s possible that I didn&#x27;t get the full extent of pain because i didn&#x27;t hold it correctly, and I only used it on my legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> the plastic guard is pretty useless, and with it removed you need to use a fair bit of technique to remove hair without it</li>
            <li> (Which was my intent.)&lt;br /&gt;After a few swipes it got better...</li>
            <li> Really fun day at work the next day as my pants kept reminding me of it with every step!</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t sure whether you can deal with the discomfort, try plucking a few hairs (with a tweezer) from the area where you plan on using the epilator.</li>
            <li> but it last so long its ok.</li>
            <li> After using this product I can normally go about 2 weeks without epilating again.</li>
            <li> Definitely does the job, and is worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It is very basic, simple in use and does the job, much better than many of the expensive epilators that are currently available in the market.</li>
            <li> and I may have to epilate a few hairs, but for the most part my armpits and legs have no hair on them.</li>
            <li> I either shave, pluck, or wait a few more days for those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long cord, which I prefer than a chargeable one because I want full power and don&#x27;t want to have to worry that its not charged up all the way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the Creams were effectively a bust, I saw the Philips Satinelle Epilator at my local Meijer, I cringed the first few times I saw it, because the picture described that it would be ripping out the hair by the root, like waxing!</li>
            <li> The time gained from not having to shave daily is definitely worth the discomfort of having to endure the hair removal process.  </li>
            <li> So much better than the NoNo that quit working after a few months.</li>
            <li> That may not seem that exciting, but normally after shaving, my legs are prickly again the same day</li>
            <li> and I wanted to wait and use it more than a few times before posting my review.</li>
            <li> and it grows back way fast) or waxing (which is hot, hurts, iffy on how well it works, and gets everywhere).</li>
            <li> In my mind, that&#x27;s worth the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A few more times</li>
            <li> Is my diet making me grow hair faster than normal?</li>
            <li> But a good product and now I am addicted.</li>
            <li> i did a whole leg (took me more than twice as long) before i gave up and went back to my old one.  </li>
            <li> but now its just kind of slow</li>
            <li> and they were worse than this one, the taking off head to rinse feature is really good.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW!!!!  </li>
            <li> your hair does grow back, it&#x27;s only a few hairs at a time and they are very light and fine</li>
            <li> &quot; the hairs are very fine and compact, and it was very tricky to go slowly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud and mean looking when you look at what is actually ripping the hair out of your body despite the happy colors.  </li>
            <li> During this time so many new models have been invented, that are just a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> : Reasonable price and for me, no charging-extra long cord and can be used right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I only have to use it about once ever two weeks, but it takes half an hour to do a nice job.</li>
            <li> I do the shins first while they are still hot, but dry.</li>
            <li> I would also suggest exfoliating regularly, it&#x27;ll not only keep your legs super smooth, but it&#x27;ll also keep the ingrown hairs down.</li>
            <li> I really like not having to shave everyday and this is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and this thing plucked them right out with such speed!</li>
            <li> Right after using it, my legs had red bumps from irritation</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t learn to do it right, you will only break off hairs at the surface and end up with ingrown</li>
            <li> Trying to get the guts to try again right now, as I only got through about a 1x2 inch area when it came.</li>
            <li> It does last longer then shaving when you use it right.</li>
            <li> But I have extremely sensitive skin, and no matter how many times I used a brand new blade, exfoliated, shaved with the grain, used sensitive skin shaving gel and deodorant, treated my post-shave skin with everything I was told to use, and whatever other advice I came across</li>
            <li> Although epilating is more painful than you could imagine (it feels like being stabbed with a bunch of needles), it&#x27;s so much better than shaving!</li>
            <li> I only received it a few days ago and I already love it!</li>
            <li> The cord is super long</li>
            <li> the cord is super long and its not an issue at all.</li>
            <li> It is a little small for my hand but it is better than shaving, and with time hair takes more time to grow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I have super sensitive skin, and can most certainly cannot afford the laser hair removal!</li>
            <li> it was a total disaster she had to go to the doctor after she used for the first time this new one!</li>
            <li> removes all dark hair long enough to be removed and most light hairs.</li>
            <li> The other positive is that when your hair does start growing back in a week later, it is very fine and light colored, not dark and coarse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I lay down newspapers on the floor before epilating, so its an easy clean-up.</li>
            <li> If you have hair like me, you might want to try a more expensive epilator to catch and pull out the fine hairs on your legs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not yet sure about longterm small marks on the skin, I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> After the initial epilation of my right leg, there were some bumps, and was a little rough, but by the time I returned the bumps had gone away, and my legs were super smooth!</li>
            <li> very time consuming as you have to epilate individual areas instead of removing hair from a large area the way waxing works -</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I thought I was going to jump out of my skin and was surprised at how much it hurt, and I&#x27;ve had regular electrology sessions for three years!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t leave smooth skin like the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other epilators are like but this one is pain free.</li>
            <li> For more prise you&#x27;ll get only extra heads, expect no miracles with epilators in general.</li>
            <li> but I do miss my light that I had on the other one</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Silk Epil 7 after meeting up with a college friend who used to be extremely hairy whose arms were now as smooth as a baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> When you a search for men, this comes up and unless you have super fine hair, its a waste and even then it takes like 3 or 4 swipes in the same area to get everything.</li>
            <li> HONESTLY, it is just a little sting and works so well at removing any stray facial hairs that you might have.  </li>
            <li> If you have very thick and dense hairs, I would recommend going with a more powerful model.</li>
            <li> I even bought a new one, but it died too.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m new to this.</li>
            <li> After a use or two I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt anymore, until I try it on a new area</li>
            <li> live without it and for the price, it is heaven.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t turn on, looked brand new though</li>
            <li> but i can live with it for that price</li>
            <li> I am new to the epilator experience.</li>
            <li> but i guess that is a feature i will have to live with.</li>
            <li> Now was time to have a new one and</li>
            <li> I may need a new cartridge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#3 tell yourself that tomorrow is a new day and go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this new one</li>
            <li> so Philiips sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> I will add that I&#x27;m new to emulating so it could be user error.</li>
            <li> something missing.&lt;br /&gt;the machine is brand new, but for some reason the cleaning brush was missing.&lt;br /&gt;it could be customer return.</li>
            <li> those new to using an epilator: it hurts.</li>
            <li> Every time I thought it worked, I found a new patch of hair on my legs that it wouldn&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> new one</li>
            <li> As I work those out the device has not noticeably created any new patches; just maybe one or two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spoke to a representative and they shipped a new one to me to my office.</li>
            <li> I understand they have to make new models to keep selling new things, but it does not improve the quality</li>
            <li> I get a new one every 2 years</li>
            <li> It was a new sensation.</li>
            <li> used epilator all my life but here in the US, mine (220v) didn´t work, so I needed a new one with 110v.</li>
            <li> They offered to send me a new replacement</li>
            <li> I am new to epilators</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to epilators, but I&#x27;ve done home waxing and threading before.  </li>
            <li> It will be torture to shave until I get my new machine.</li>
            <li> but I think I can live with it.</li>
            <li> And, I had to go over a few areas from different angles to be effective.</li>
            <li> and since there isn&#x27;t much hair left, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> So after a few epilations It will keep a smooth appearance much longer.</li>
            <li> but I learned if I pull at my skin as I epilate it, not only helps get all the hairs, but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like it though because I see that it breaks a lot of hairs instead of pulling them out completely.</li>
            <li> roommate in college had an epilator, and the thought of having smooth and non-hairy legs all the time was appealing in a college-setting, where I wore shorts around my room and would have random neighbors visit at all hours of the day and night.</li>
            <li> love this, but you need thick hairs for it to really work.</li>
            <li> First of all, the item is White/Gray per the item description, with a pink add-on attachment for first time users/victims:  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave so much with it because the hair does not grow back as fast.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, it&#x27;s pretty small which makes it so much comfortable and</li>
            <li> I love this little machine!</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I went over it there are still those little bits there that never got picked up!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LITTLE THING!</li>
            <li> The sound is pretty loud and it makes it sound super painful.</li>
            <li> It takes some getting used to at first (but the learning curve is not steep), and once you realize to keep the skin tight and hold the epilator at a 90 degree angle, you&#x27;ve pretty much become a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was also very loud.  </li>
            <li> I had a very old Epilady and there have definately been improvements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> I had a very old epilator and my niece recommended this one to me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> You will also notice that around your knees is a very sensitive area.</li>
            <li> Is very loud.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The skin does feel very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud, and seeing the discs rotate was intimidating.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in any very sensitive areas yet, just my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> When I switched it on, the loud whirring noise made me cringe, since it sounded like a contraption that should be used to edge a lawn, but only the first few seconds hurt a little - once you know what to expect it is absolutely fine (and quick!)!  </li>
            <li> As for hair removal, it would have required going over the same spot a few times to get everything, and I most certainly didn&#x27;t want to keep reliving that.</li>
            <li> knowing that after I finished up, I don&#x27;t have to worry about becoming a hairy Mary for about 2 weeks 😁 chuk de pathe (bring the roof down!)</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator, I love the way this works its smooth and am a tough gal</li>
            <li> However after about 8 months of use it developed a short somewhere in the cord so it only works if it is held in exactly the right spot.</li>
            <li> It was easier to use, more effective and  much less painful than another one that I tried by Remington (smooth and silky, wet/dry epilator).</li>
            <li> I was intimidated by the sound and the rotating tweezers and was honestly scared to put it to my skin, but once I did, it really wasn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Here are  pros/cons and my first impressions, overall, I like this thing, but nothing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first problem with this thing, and the obvious thing, is that this plucks out all of your hairs, so this is no painless experience.  </li>
            <li> I think it was worth it though, because in the long run,</li>
            <li> This is my first and will be my last epilator!</li>
            <li> My first time it took me two hours, second time 1 hr and so on.</li>
            <li> despite the growth (of nearly two months!)</li>
            <li> The instructions said to use the plastic protector if it&#x27;s your first time using an epilator, so I did and it only pulled my hair and it didn&#x27;t even get all my hair</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator and hopefully the last.</li>
            <li> I suggest starting higher on a shin, and working your way lower (my hair is also denser toward my ankle).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I plugged it in and used it, I only made it up to my knees.  </li>
            <li> The next time, I &amp;#34;trimmed&amp;#34; a bit higher.  </li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ll just go back to shaving....  ;-)</li>
            <li> Hurts at first but gets easier later on</li>
            <li> The only downside it is pretty loud, my old one is not as loud, but it is pretty bearable.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of pain, I think they all inflict some sort of pain, but I am very used to it now anyway, so it is not a big deal for me anyway</li>
            <li> And ESPECIALLY not for your first use of this.</li>
            <li> whatever it is ( I do all of those with this), then when the hair grows back in slowly, slender and shorter, there is almost zero pain and after a few months of weekly maintenance, you will be as happy as I am!!</li>
            <li> I first purchased a Satinelle several years ago when I saw it in a sale bin.</li>
            <li> First time was a bit of a bust, resulting in VERY red &amp; bumpy skin and not a ton of hair reduction.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I definitely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved for years and my hair is pretty coarse.  </li>
            <li> but I usually prefer to use without this cap because it seems that the epilator works better without it...</li>
            <li> It is my first and only epilator.</li>
            <li> Only hurts some the first couple of times you use it.</li>
            <li> just took too long to be worth it</li>
            <li> I only have to do this like once a week sometimes not even because my hair doesn&#x27;t even grow much!</li>
            <li> Especially the first time, i only use it on my under arms but its worth it for me at least :)</li>
            <li> Since we are in the time where pubic hair is unwanted, we have to decide what method we want to use to keep our naughty bits smooth.</li>
            <li> &quot; WOW!</li>
            <li> This one does a better job, but because it is smaller, it takes more time to do the job, and it doesn&#x27;t get all the difficult areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on comments that I would be able to use it on other places, but the instructions explicitly say for legs only, and I don&#x27;t need that</li>
            <li> This epilator is small and cute and portable.</li>
            <li> wanted to try an Epilator because I&#x27;m a pretty hairy individual</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for the past 15 years and I love this one.</li>
            <li> You may find it miss some hair the first or even second passing,</li>
            <li> I also use this for underarm, which is usually not suggested.</li>
            <li> I used it on my knees and toes which (according to third parties) are pretty hairy.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it wasn&#x27;t doing much first because I was scared of the pain and second because my hairs were too short I believe.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of tattoos which is the process of many small needles piercing your skin repeatedly for hours at a time.</li>
            <li> I have already recommended this product several times to friends, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to switch from waxing and shaving!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed, a basic epilator that works well.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I would epilate every other or every third day to make sure the regrowth was stopped.</li>
            <li> small and efficient love it</li>
            <li> It is pretty basic though, just the epilator and the cable, nothing else.</li>
            <li> This one is exactly what one needs for performing a simple task of removing unwanted hair from your body.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I consistently have is ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> First time using one of these, first time using something other then shaving.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t promise everyone else will feel the same way, since I suppose some may be quite sensitive to pain, but I really didn&#x27;t consider it pain as much as a discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I found it too small and challenging to hold.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this gadget works!</li>
            <li> and wow, did it hurt!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this epilator, it took me a couple of hours just going bit-by-bit, and I only ended up doing just up to my knees.</li>
            <li> I have had another one in the past and this one works better.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I only felt the pain the first two times I used it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be getting much considering they had to mark it down, so I was pretty much ready to try it, return it, and never talk about this experience again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The edges, even in my leg crease were easy and pain was slight, but near the edges of the labia or \\&quot;lips\\</li>
            <li> Took several uses for it to stop happening and a decent moisturizer can really help with it.</li>
            <li> Especially if I have to continue to go over the same spot over and over again to get a clean hairless spot.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hair free from the neck down</li>
            <li> The first few times were less comfortable but effective on my dark brown leg hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought they were going to break and after a couple minutes my legs felt too wobbly to stand, got light headed, blurred vision and felt the need to lay down.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing I see is that you really need to take time to do it perfectly, but hey, I prefer this than spending money in professional waxing.</li>
            <li> The back of my calves and near the ankles hurt more than the other parts of my leg.</li>
            <li> It was quick and easy, and it hurt way less than the dozens of other epilators I have bought.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s effective, although I have to go over the same area several times to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> I used my old one in the morning and the new one in the evening</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my first epilator (an expensive, wet/dry Braun model) and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> The pros: smooth skin, convenient, less pain, no redness/swelling; the cons:</li>
            <li> For my legs, I still prefer the smooth feel of shaving, but I do get less irritation when I use this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright though because I can easily take the remaining few hairs with a tweezer, but I&#x27;d prefer not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> but if you wax your skin first and let the hair grow back in its natural 3 cycle, then it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
            <li> After the first time, I only need a sweep maybe once a week or so to keep my torso almost completely hair-free.</li>
            <li> I loved my Emjoi and was disappointed it was no longer available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far better to work on small areas at a time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but it is a little loud.</li>
            <li> That is super important, and kinda tough if you are a nervous sweater.&lt;br /&gt;Legs</li>
            <li> If you simply go up and down, then you will call for pain for sure.</li>
            <li> I tried using on my belly where I have fine little hair.</li>
            <li> Take a little getting used to this device, and then it works fine.</li>
            <li> I guess the positive thing is after several mins and umteen angles with this satan device</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has a cord and all because it can get tangled and become a huge mess.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works okay, but ensure your hair is long enough for the epilator to grip and you are using it in a well-lit room.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty much the same, slightly different shape</li>
            <li> Even though it has two speeds, I only use the first one since it is fast enough already.</li>
            <li> All epilators, or I should say &amp;#34;Epilation&amp;#34; DOES hurt, maybe even A WHOLE LOT for some, but only in the beginning like your first and/or second attempts.</li>
            <li> You really have to grit your teeth and spread out your first few uses for how much you can handle at a time.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of shaving every other day just to keep my legs smooth, and this product works really well at keeping them smooth for much longer.</li>
            <li> But once I suffered through that first time, the hair grew back thinner, and by the second time it was much easier to remove.</li>
            <li> But I guess this is true with any other epilators.</li>
            <li> I was blessed with fine blonde body hair, but it is thick and grows quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of patience to do this yet, nor I dared to go through my lady areas in one full sweep like what I do with other areas, because it will hurt, but it does work, you just have to do it</li>
            <li> so I really needed a new one and at a very low cost.</li>
            <li> but then as i&#x27;m using it often, I feel less pain now Much better and simple then waxing!</li>
            <li> My skin quickly went kind of tingly numb</li>
            <li> I needed less pressure, and more on the back.</li>
            <li> More than shaving, obviously, but less than waxing.</li>
            <li> For its price I get good coverage of hair removal, relatively quick results, few problems such as ingrown hairs, and (over weeks of use) less grow back.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a more convenient and economical method of hair removal, and don&#x27;t get scared away thinking it&#x27;ll be super painful!</li>
            <li> Within minutes the areas where it tore the hair out became super inflamed and red, caused open wounds large enough to bleed.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is very affordable compared to the other ones out there.</li>
            <li> Much like other aspects of passage into womanhood, first it hurts, then you get used to it, then you sort of like it,</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand getting to the middle under my nose as it really is &amp;#34;nippy&amp;#34; and a tad too sensitive, but figure with some use each day I will get it done!  </li>
            <li> Near my ankles is most sensitive (I used it from knee down only so far).</li>
            <li> Yes you may have to go over certain areas multiple times</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the hair well, but it definitely has to be a certain length (5/8 inch or something)</li>
            <li> , the guard that comes with it is purely for psychological reasons.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget plugs in with a cord, is about the size of my palm, and gets my legs virtually hair free in about 5-8 minutes.</li>
            <li> I like the way that it makes my legs look more &amp;#34;uniform&amp;#34;, meaning that the pores on my legs aren&#x27;t as dark because there is not dark hair left in the follicles.  </li>
            <li> It works fine for all of my body, but I really DO NOT recommend this for facial use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> I have a really high pain tolerance and can barely stand to run this thing over my legs.</li>
            <li> I do think I want something that covers a little more surface area (wider with maybe multiple heads)</li>
            <li> I think you could buy a little bit better epilator and have it last longer.</li>
            <li> Was a little scared to tried the underarm area, but finally tried and love it.</li>
            <li> I can go for two weeks (more, if I&#x27;m not wearing skirts every day) between epilating my legs or underarms, and I have reached the level of epilating expertise where I can domy bikini line with only a little discomfort.  </li>
            <li> After I epilated my lower legs, the hair was significantly finer and less noticeable upon regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other one was battery operated and the batteries drained really quick.</li>
            <li> (I wanna try those too) but this as a first epilator is amazing, is little bit noisy, like a shaving machine, but it is quite practical, small</li>
            <li> It is a little inconvenient that you have to plug it in when in use, but the tweezer heads are good about gripping even the shorter finer hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have found that if you press hard, it will not pick up the hairs as much as if you just run it lightly over your legs/arms.  </li>
            <li> The cord is plenty long if you&#x27;re worried about that, but it does tend to tangle easily, and sometimes when I&#x27;m using it flickers on and off because the part where the cord plugs into the unit is loose or something.  </li>
            <li> Within seconds I had massive amounts of sweat dripping out of my arm pits, face bright cherry red dripping sweat, clinched my teeth so hard</li>
            <li> Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> (I epilate when I&#x27;m cold lol).</li>
            <li> Otherwise steer clear.  </li>
            <li> but I figured I&#x27;d at least get a newer model that works better than my 6 year old one.  </li>
            <li> (the instructions clearly state not to do this).</li>
            <li> My legs never really feel smooth after using this but the results last a lot longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and clear up some of this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my upper lip and it worked very well so far.</li>
            <li> I put on some natural lotion (one without alcohols or chemical irritants) and within a few hours, smooth legs.</li>
            <li> Although it makes me xxxx,my legs are clear.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve seen a ton of reviews on this specific epilator and although there are many good reviews, I&#x27;m only concerned with the bad ones.</li>
            <li> Now to be clear, I am no city boy hipster that can&#x27;t take pain.</li>
            <li> So far, I have purchased 3 of these.  </li>
            <li> It took time to adapt, so don&#x27;t give up on it too early, give it some time.</li>
            <li> also it&#x27;s big but doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair at a time as i wish it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> I almost blacked out from the pain; it was as if each hair follicle was being yanked directly out of my soul.  </li>
            <li> My legs have never been this soft.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I should preface this to say that I&#x27;m now 50 yr old and</li>
            <li> My legs, although hair free, are not completely smooth like waxing or a close shave.</li>
            <li> I was debating whether to go back to shaving with that epilator because it missed so much.</li>
            <li> but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.</li>
            <li> When I rub my hands over my legs it feels like the second or so day after shaving, very stubbly.  </li>
            <li> Sleeping mostly fixed it, and by midday again all was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it as often but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Gave it 3 stars because its kinda loud and i feel like it almost breaks the thicker hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t remove much hair, and you have to go over and over a spot several times to even get close to removing some hair.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much need for the second speed yet.</li>
            <li> This device comes with a pretty long cord.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like how soft my skin feels after using this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any complaints so far...</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else as far as discomfort level.</li>
            <li> My facial hair around the lips is gone and what has grown back are very sparce and much lighter hairs</li>
            <li> You must go over the hair SEVERAL times before the desired result is accomplished.</li>
            <li> I chose to buy one because I have sensitive skin and my legs itch after shaving.</li>
            <li> My old one did not have that option.  </li>
            <li> i had old philips epilator</li>
            <li> My legs were soft as ever when I was done and no irritation, no itching afterwards like shaving causes me and not one bit of stubble!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this one and it is loud.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you have really sensitive skin, I would imagine this things pain</li>
            <li> completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I decided that epilating is not for me and rather shave the old fashioned way or shell out for the salon.</li>
            <li> and it felt really sensitive</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> have found you just have to relax completely while you&#x27;re doing it</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> It really does not matter if it&#x27;s a version for females or male.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this Epilator worked well with my underarms and not too well on my legs, considering that the box says that it is for use for the LEGS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but my armpits were so sensitive and hurt for days</li>
            <li> have used this product on all parts of the body, legs, arms, and even sensitive skin (like underarm and bikini line)</li>
            <li> That keeps the \\&quot;area of plucking\\&quot; smaller and pulls the hairs straight out, rather than yanking clumps of hairs from halfway across your testicular sack.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li> It pulled out the hairs completely and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> Wow, takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> This far from what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> As far as epilation goes, I didn&#x27;t like using it on my calves.</li>
            <li> Completely replaced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> LOUD</li>
            <li> Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator - 36</li>
            <li> It stung quite a bit the first time and took a long time (like an hour) to do both legs.</li>
            <li> , it is just weekly and the subsequent uses have gone much faster.</li>
            <li> I initially ran the epilator on my arms, and oh my goodness, I wasn’t quite prepared for the pain, as I was used to running an electric shaver on my arms during the summertime, and that was absolutely painless.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> My hair should have been long enough the first time I tried, but it didn&#x27;t pull out much.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace my old epilator</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how painless it was.</li>
            <li> (my room lights are somewhat dim).</li>
            <li> As far as pain goes, I think it depends a lot on where you plan to use it.  </li>
            <li> Also you must go over the hair several times before the desired effect is accomplished.</li>
            <li> One time I did not use the \\&quot;Efficiency Cap\\&quot; and I developed redness and bumps.    </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, forget about using this.</li>
            <li> but she likes it so far.</li>
            <li> I personally did not feel much pain, but I did experience some redness</li>
            <li> (Its nowhere near the weeks that they promise.)</li>
            <li> This hair is not growing back much at all.  </li>
            <li> But, it only took me 3 weeks to build the tolerance to do a whole session.  </li>
            <li> Second, I wish it didn&#x27;t hurt so much.</li>
            <li> I think it works pretty well with long hairs</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really loud too.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My old one was 13 years old</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve noticed on this one is that instead of pulling the hair off it cuts some of them, so I can see hair coming out after the 2nd day al ready.</li>
            <li> I read on the page about it being for the &amp;#34;most sensitive areas&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not to be used in those sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> Although this Philips has only 21 tweezers discs, it removes the hair fast and without pain (I use it for underarms, and still no discomfort).</li>
            <li> i was looking to replace my old epilator (over 5 years old)</li>
            <li> No  by far.</li>
            <li> After my old epilator died after 8 years of faithful service, I urgently started to search for a replace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a minimal epliator, but this is the attachment you probably would use most of the time even with your most expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this twice so far.</li>
            <li> Its loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s meant for legs, but I used it on my underarms and they feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin this is a no</li>
            <li> Her legs feel soft.</li>
            <li> and you didnt need to go over the same place so much.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers have already done a good job of outlining the general pros and cons of epilating versus other methods of hair removal, so I will keep my review brief.</li>
            <li> It took a long time the first time I used it and my legs looked like I had some sort of rash or allergic reaction when I was done.</li>
            <li> I do have to admit that this baby is LOUD -- sort of like shaving with a gas-powered lawnmower.</li>
            <li> So far, I am a fan.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so loud</li>
            <li> I had the old model in Europe</li>
            <li> They feel so soft from doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not putting this anywhere near my face or underarms....</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> overall, a cute, innocent-looking pink and white device.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll still be using a razor for the really sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I am just overly sensitive</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and stopped using the cap because I find life to be far easier without it.</li>
            <li> now I feel no pain and in the sensitive areas of my body I feel an itch or tickle.</li>
            <li> Then I realized I wasn&#x27;t moving the item fast enough.  </li>
            <li> so it hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far.</li>
            <li> hair is soft since i wax over 10 years</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs, underarms and my upper bikini line without problem, although the instructions state that is is really supposed to be used solely on legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit loud.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this worked for the money.</li>
            <li> and my skin is quite sensitive</li>
            <li> Although the product works, it&#x27;s not meant for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The direction you&#x27;re supposed to go will come to you naturally.</li>
            <li> with the epilator i get longer lasting, MUCH smoother results.</li>
            <li> It is kinda loud, though.</li>
            <li> so I talked my 17 year old son into trying it on a spot on his leg (</li>
            <li> and that is a plus when you are busy with working over 12 hours a day.</li>
            <li> Today I still use cream depilatories on my legs that is formulated for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It might take some getting use to since that area is sensitive</li>
            <li> Simple and efficient, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Painless for me that was used to wax.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Again, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve had no problem with in-grown hairs or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am 5ft 6 in tall with really long and pretty hefty legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you want to use this product I suggest you think twice if you mind pain and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But in the end I will do it again, because yet again, I&#x27;m soft and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my old epliady either - another plus.</li>
            <li> I have not used this item in sensitive areas however for legs, stomach, bikini line and arms</li>
            <li> and I have straight corse Asian hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to send the whole thing back</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t surprised by the noise level since I&#x27;ve had an epilator before</li>
            <li> I have seen professional laser removal systems for about $800, and I couldn&#x27;t do that, either.  </li>
            <li> (even though the box of the old one said that I could use it for underarms and bikini as opposed to this one).</li>
            <li> checked the head of the old one I bought 9 years ago (Europe made) and has no rust on it, even when I used it for 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just WOW.</li>
            <li> My armpits are the softest they have ever been since I was like, 6 years old.</li>
            <li> How loud is it?</li>
            <li> After retrying the process a day or so later I still got similar results although no QUITE as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you are not prone to this problem then I think this product is definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> and then you can use the epilator again and get better results since they are few and u will definitely see the direction they grow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice gadget that I wish the company could have given a small cleaning brush with it as most other epilators do, even though I use the brush that came with my other epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to go back over areas more than a few</li>
            <li> You have to go over the same area a few times to get all of the hair, but that is the case with most any hair removal device or treatment.</li>
            <li> I liked waxing because the hair took at least 2 weeks to grow back</li>
            <li> I thought it would be okay because I would only have to endure the pain a few times as the hairs would be pulled from the root.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of spending so much money on waxing, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> So i have only barely used this, its pretty intimidating.</li>
            <li> Definitely have to exfoliate a lot, had quite a few ingrown hairs, but hoping that will get better with time</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful for all body hair (careful not to get scalp hair).</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I use it a few more times I will try to come back here &amp; update the review.</li>
            <li> And, I never had thick, abundant, or coarse hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> , my poor Satinelle gave out on me recently, but 20 years was a good run.</li>
            <li> I used my sisters $100 epilator and and this one was just as good if not better!!!!</li>
            <li> and sometimes I realized it doesn&#x27;t do a good job with thin hair...but still recommend!</li>
            <li> so be sure to go slow.</li>
            <li> It is almost like they are providing false advertising which, to be honest, irks me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it three stars because if you are willing to spend more time during and between using the epilator to save money on buying a more expensive alternative than I would suggest this product, but I think I will be purchasing a quality one later down the road.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest just paying the extra money to have a professional wax you as they can get it done extremely quick and with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> Epilaiton is so painful that I need to be in hot water to open up the pores and have the hair slip out more easily.</li>
            <li> Hurts the first few times, but supposed to hurt less the more it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice little gadget.</li>
            <li> Love this epilator and it&#x27;s ability to pluck small hairs!</li>
            <li> &quot; Overall, I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied, I will use the product a few more times and give an update, but if I&#x27;m not entirely happy with this product I will definitely take advantage of the 45 day full money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t skip your legs in the shower and it will be clean, painless sailing as long as you&#x27;re patient for your first few uses, use it as directed, and don&#x27;t try it on overly sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t skip your legs in the shower and it will be clean, painless sailing as long as you&#x27;re patient for your first few uses, use it as directed, and don&#x27;t try it on overly sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I  am very satisfied with my new epilator, I really love it, it is not as painful as other epilators.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wide flat area, and this way the rotating of the tweezing disks assisted in smooth forward movement of the epilator.</li>
            <li> Had some concerns at first because of my dry skin, but the exfoliating cream should be used with this.  </li>
            <li> This particular epilator seems to have about 15 sets of tweezers, which is a small area, really, so it is very time consuming and it does not get all the hairs the first time</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference with the hair coming in as far as less often and softer so easy to pluck</li>
            <li> but I controlled by going in small areas and zapping it off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, but expected it to last much longer.</li>
            <li> but first of all, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair on a single roll/swipe.</li>
            <li> In addition to grabbing his hairs completely, it did leave his skin red and slightly bumpy the next day, which I was surprised about because his skin is a lot more durable than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you go slow it leaves you very clean with just a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My least favorite part is cleaning it, but If you want it to work properly every time you have to clean it at lest every 4 uses, but that applies to any other epilator on the market.</li>
            <li> I am as pale as pale can be, so my hair shows even under my skin, this hurt the first 10 seconds then was fine!</li>
            <li> This little machines is pretty noisy so be ready to crank up the volume on anything you may be listening to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO, waste of materials, no at all evironmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> More comfortable than waxing, lasts longer, less expensive and very convenient.</li>
            <li> I have only used the 1st settings because it already seemed very fast and the couldn&#x27;t imagine how the second one felt like.</li>
            <li> Although the package says it is for legs only, I use it on my legs, underarms and down there (the top and side part only, I still use wax on the sentitive part).</li>
            <li> It last years until you have to buy a new one!</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator i have ever purchased, and I will tell you right now that I don&#x27;t have any regrets with the money I have spent on this.</li>
            <li> cord is pretty long,which is good and bad.  </li>
            <li> My understanding is that the more regularly you use it the less the hairs grow back.</li>
            <li> Even though I was terrified, it hurt less than I was expecting, and felt similar to a constant static or electric shock on my legs.</li>
            <li> My previous epilators (from a different brand) were only able to run after charging it.</li>
            <li> I know that the first time takes longer than most, but after using it for a half hour on a small section of my leg, my skin became irritated and there was still hair there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased that the description states: &amp;#34;Cordless epilator gives you soft, smooth skin head-to-toe,&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s not cordless at all.</li>
            <li> it just takes a number of passes to get all the hairs, I try going in different directions if it doesn&#x27;t get them up after the first two initial passes.</li>
            <li> Similar to the older I have.</li>
            <li> less messier than wax and quick .</li>
            <li> Using Aloe after it during those first few times really helps.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to pay a higher price for a male version when you can find either one that operates with the same power.</li>
            <li> It is a bit uncomfortable at first, as it starts grabbing hair, but as you progress it gets better.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I would either shave or tweeze the hairs on my leg one strand at a time, which not only took forever, but for some reason, seemed to hurt more.  </li>
            <li> Discomfort for first time users especially if you have coarser hair, but definitely does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use it anywhere besides my legs because I can barely stand that pain, but it&#x27;s perfect for people who hate shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li> If I barely skim my face and under my chin with the epilator on low speed, gently, gently I remove that shadow of hair without any irritation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets better though, once you get it on a schedule the hairs come in more fine and in less density making the experience much easier and less painful.</li>
            <li> My main issue was that it caused an enormous amount of ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend getting a wax first and then using this epilator once the hairs start growing back.  </li>
            <li> I had a LOT of hair break off, not actually be ripped out, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> After epilating the same spots as the first time, I decided to give the skin on my chest a break and see if any hair grew back.</li>
            <li> have used several different kinds of epilators through the years--including the first Epilady, which was an instrument of torture whipped up by the Marquis de Sade, I think--</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t totally used to the product the first time, so I went over everything a second time in hopes to capture hairs</li>
            <li> in which I like more because my other one was rechargeable and the charge didn&#x27;t last as long as I wished.</li>
            <li> and there is this cool little attatchment which prevents ripping at your skin etc</li>
            <li> and I have consistently noticed that 1/2 of the leg that I used the epilator on has limited hair re-growth!</li>
            <li> I highly re comes it especially for this price.!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to everyone, even you men who want to get rid of your back hair!  </li>
            <li> my hair now comes thin and its super easy and fast to pass the epilator and for two weeks/week and a half (for my armpits)</li>
            <li> High tension skin only.</li>
            <li> I could clearly see that the waxed areas still had dark roots but those epilated areas were white and clean.</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator, and previously all I&#x27;ve ever done for hair removal is shave.</li>
            <li> so far I have the same gret product but new.</li>
            <li> Even with the adapter on and using the slow speed you would need to have an incredibly high pain tolerance to do any significant area in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> smooth and painless compared to a previous type used for several years.</li>
            <li> If done correctly you can minimize the pain (tighten up the skin and only lightly contact it with the epilator), and hurts way less than waxing.</li>
            <li> , it did hurt a little when i was doing my underarms, and especially since im right handed, i couldnt do my right underarm properly, and it did hurt</li>
            <li> As you continue to epilate once a week it gets less painful and you get better at being more consistent with the hair you&#x27;re pulling out.</li>
            <li> you might want to do this on a weekend until your skin gets used to it as well, because I had some pretty bad redness and soreness the first time that lasted for the better part of a day.</li>
            <li> It is small and light weight however its size does not interfere with its ability to remove hair.  </li>
            <li> You control the use  and speed (I rarely ever use the second setting), the first couple times I would do small sections at a time and take breaks in between</li>
            <li> The long cable is really helpful for my case.</li>
            <li> I would go as long as I thought I could get away with going before shaving, but it didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> It was smooth on the small patch I used it on</li>
            <li> Would take much too long - for that</li>
            <li> I just wish epilators in general weren&#x27;t so loud.</li>
            <li> wow this thing hurts and barely worked.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to continue because of how long it was taking and how much pain</li>
            <li> Works good more painful than waxing but not as messy</li>
            <li> First of all, I expected pain from reading reviews.</li>
            <li> I put some lotion on and by the next morning the skin looked normal again.</li>
            <li> I even took off that dumb cap, as I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s only there for psychological reasons...</li>
            <li> Knowing it could end result in minimal shaving, I was willing to suck it up.</li>
            <li> The good thing is, those few hairs that were not removed from the roots-you can definitely see them grow in a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few after doing my full lower leg, and it did frustrate me to no end because it looked noticeable (to me, anyway)</li>
            <li> but after a few uses its not bad.  </li>
            <li> I was shaving every single day and, no matter what, could always feel stubble in certain areas.</li>
            <li> and they are so red and have huge little bumps all over the surface.</li>
            <li> important: the Braun came with a carrying pouch, a little cleaning brush, and three different swappable heads.</li>
            <li> do wish that I had spent a little more money and bought one that was cordless as well.  </li>
            <li> I think cheap or expensive ones all are the same pretty much.</li>
            <li> I would be careful with this one: after less than two months of light usage, the power cord is starting to get temperamental - it needs to be folded in certain ways, otherwise the epilator stops running.</li>
            <li> I find that the pain is fairly easy to deal with, btu I do have to be careful to stretch the skin well with one hand while managing the epilator with the other.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only now noticing new hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I got used to it and actually honed in on it as that meant I was in a new place and</li>
            <li> I searched online for several days trying to find something new to try when I heard about epilators.</li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for a new method of hair removal, I would definitely recommend this product.wn hairs.</li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for a new method of hair removal, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This definitely compares to the new Phillips epilator for $100.</li>
            <li> The only reason I need a new one is because I dropped mine on the tile floor and it no longer pulls out my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually being lenient with this review on this product, mainly because I was not aware it was only intended for legs only by design, and I also did not know one needed to use these things shortly after a couple of days of exfoliation, and shortly after a shower to loosen the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried the No!No! before (HUGE waste of money, plus gross smelling!)</li>
            <li> It worked well, especially for it&#x27;s price, but I think $40 is way too much for something that won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> However the hair takes much longer to grow back compared to shaving, and it does appear to be growing back thinner.</li>
            <li> Overall, from someone who could shave twice a day and still have stubble, I love epilating because at least when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> When I went back and checked the advertisement I found a chart at the very end of ALL Philips products did show whether cord or cordless, facial or non, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had decent success on my upper lip, though I needed to get a few straggling hairs with manual tweezing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had another epilator prior to this that would take much longer to cover the same area.</li>
            <li> I have tried my wife&#x27;s epilation prior to purchasing my own...mainly because she would nag too much about her epilator being left unclean etc....</li>
            <li> I would remove the hairs and it seemed like the area was smooth, but a few days later (about 3 days)</li>
            <li> Now I only need one razor for my underarms and genital area and that will last me much longer than if I had to do my legs every night.</li>
            <li> Now I only need one razor for my underarms and genital area and that will last me much longer than if I had to do my legs every night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve personally found that this epilator works pretty well, so long as you take it slow and easy with plentiful breaks.</li>
            <li> The next day I took care of the ingrown hairs which is common, and used the epilator once more.</li>
            <li> A few more tries and I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this product because I was getting tired of shaving and the hairs growing back thicker.</li>
            <li> My hair grows back much more slowly and thinner now.</li>
            <li> Maybe it hurts more for thick coarse hair?</li>
            <li> Just take it slow and easy.</li>
            <li> Slow and easy.</li>
            <li> Go slow, have a strong drink, pat your skin where it hurts, put on some music, and chill</li>
            <li> This gadget costs less than a single leg wax, has lasted two years, and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> That area was sensitive, but not as sensitive as the high edge of the triangle of hair, in the center.</li>
            <li> The only thing I want to say is that it&#x27;s very loud.</li>
            <li> The knee area, around the sides, and on the back of the knee are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> But it is still a lifesaver for my upper legs (which are very sensitive &amp; prone to razor burn) and my bikini area</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is so loud!</li>
            <li> As a first time user, I can&#x27;t compare this epilator with other brands.</li>
            <li> It hurts at first, but then I just got excited that I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave every other day, and no more pain.  </li>
            <li> I have taken to epilating my once every 2-2.5 weeks which is a major improvement from shaving every couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have not used it on my upper lip which everyone says is so painful yet because I really don&#x27;t have that problem, but on your chin it is is just wonderful and just a little pinch.  </li>
            <li> more and more often the same product.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> The hair usually grows back the next day but this took more than a week.</li>
            <li> The first few times I epilated my armpits they became very irritated but this only lasted overnight.</li>
            <li> The epilating rotating wheel is not sharp and you will not cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> I use mine all over, from the face (light peach fuzz above the lip and on the chin), underarms, and all the way down to the private bits.</li>
            <li> This is a decent little epilator for the price, though I really wish it came with a cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I like that it is corded, not rechargeable, and the cord is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to be right next to an outlet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as other epilators in the market (I can see a couple of roots that get trimmed down to the skin rather than pulled out), but it certainly gets the job done.</li>
            <li> it can also get small hairs and after using it my skin is soft and clean, the other feature is it is so fast</li>
            <li> I cannot shave because it leaves super painful bumps, and nicks, that have left permanent scars on my legs, no matter what kind of &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; formula shaving cream I tried.</li>
            <li> I did a small area on my tummy, which didn&#x27;t hurt and it did a great job balding the spot.&lt;br /&gt;However thick corse hair!</li>
            <li> It has a decent long cord.</li>
            <li> I am still excited to use it in the next few days.</li>
            <li> Seems to pull a bit more due to speed of product - I have tried a few  this was to replace the one that took a walk..</li>
            <li> She has coarser hair, whereas mine is a mix of thick and fine.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, I say try it, but if you have fine hair</li>
            <li> Plenty of little tweezers that rarely brake the hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my under arm hair and despite the little bit of pain, the results were so worth it.</li>
            <li> So I will continue using this for pubic and armpit hair (nice long lasting results on the pubic area, somewhat less long lasting on armpits)</li>
            <li> I clean it by holding an old toothbrush up to it while it&#x27;s rotating on slow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First things first: Holy cow, I must have really sensitive skin because there were moments when my skin actually bled.</li>
            <li> only good thing I can say about the Philips vs the Braun is that this epilator is far less painful, but that being said, it is only because it doesn&#x27;t actually pick up most of the hair.  </li>
            <li> I was a little red after but not bad.</li>
            <li> While I still have to shave 1-2 times/week, it is significantly less than every single day and smooth as satin for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> It pretty much just grabs those short little jerks causing the pain but not actually removing the hair.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a man who also bought this for his first epilation session, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other epilators, but it hurts less than waxing and tattoos.  </li>
            <li> Never used a more expensive one, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine they could work much better than this.</li>
            <li> Using it on my legs is not too painful and I feel it is a great alternative to shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> It works great, painful but tolerable.</li>
            <li> Not so painful on the arms and legs, if you&#x27;re experienced with the sensation of having been waxed.</li>
            <li> Great for peach fuzz on face, not as painful as legs</li>
            <li> This product is useless as a hair removal device but amazing as a torture device.</li>
            <li> Works great but a bit painful</li>
            <li> At least my underarms will be hair free</li>
            <li> this review toward epilating in general.</li>
            <li> At least my underarms are smooth for a month plus.  </li>
            <li> It was painful to use at first, but you kind of get the feel of it.</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair so not sure how it would work on darker, hairier women.</li>
            <li> The Phillips HP6401 is small enough to fit in the pam of my hand.  </li>
            <li> I would rather spend five minutes everyday for smooth legs than have to spend all day long every week to epilate.</li>
            <li> It is scary at the first use, with the sound and the pain.</li>
            <li> It´s supper comfortable to carry and small enough to store it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I normally purchased much more expensive epilators (Emjois), and I was nervous to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> (even though the directions clearly say to use on legs only.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried it first during a cold Minnesota winter, so</li>
            <li> So far the girls have only used it on their legs.</li>
            <li> Minimal pain and gets most of the job done in only a few passes.</li>
            <li> My legs seem to only be sensitive along the shin, and I don&#x27;t shave my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it was relatively painless for an epilator.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to the lasting results on my legs since this epilator is actually made specifically for legs but definitely will not use it on my legs anymore.</li>
            <li> and I barely see any growth.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that its a bit loud.</li>
            <li> If you can bare the pain, go ahead.</li>
            <li> I only have to use this every 6 weeks or so, which beats every week by far.</li>
            <li> o.o</li>
            <li> It works and doesn&#x27;t hurt that much as was expected.</li>
            <li> they all work the same way as far as the mechanism itself.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend use in sensitive areas, such as under arm.</li>
            <li> will definitely use this on my lower legs and again on my pits &amp;#34;gasp&amp;#34;  Even when sober.  </li>
            <li> Works well on Mom&#x27;s sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> This item barely works my legs</li>
            <li> It works fast, minimal pain (compared to waxing), and it worked on underarms as well as bikini area.</li>
            <li> but it barely gets the stubbles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I considered starting to make appointment for professional waxing again, but the cost per event was just not going to be feasible.</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> if anything, I have far fewer ingrown hairs than when I shaved regularly.    </li>
            <li> My old epilator, a rechargeable cordless model, started losing its charge after only two years.</li>
            <li> So far my wife loves her Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I had barely any leg hair.</li>
            <li> I barely used it once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> Enough time has not yet elapsed to see a marked difference</li>
            <li> It takes several passes to completely remove the hair.</li>
            <li> It seriously missed about half the hair no matter how many passes and attempts to stand the hair up straight</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s loud enough for someone to askyou what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it is not painful---or at least not painful for someone used to waxing.</li>
            <li> My first was a $25.00 one (it&#x27;s blue and pink, can&#x27;t remember the name.)</li>
            <li> The more you anticipate the pain and hesitate, it makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I did have to go over some areas a few times, but it&#x27;s worth it to not have to shave.</li>
            <li> I also tried it in my hand and because the hair was much more thin</li>
            <li> Be sure the epilator is at 90degrees to your skin, otherwise you might get broken</li>
            <li> it seems to work on thicker hair better than thin hair.</li>
            <li> Plus, because it leaves so many broken off hairs</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is true, but you can experiment with it.</li>
            <li> like epilators over waxing because it&#x27;s not as messy/sticky, but this one almost isn&#x27;t worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my ancient Emjoi, but I&#x27;m afraid it just isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> Hairs were more often broken than pulled.  </li>
            <li> I just try to go over the hair slowly and try not to go over an area too many times - this will also cause some minor irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kind of lame, that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small and sweet</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a pretty long time to epilate my legs (probably about 20 mins) because this is not the most expensive product out there.</li>
            <li> So u may have to shave or use another method on top of this to get rid of those thin hair</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a nice expensive Epilator</li>
            <li> This little tool banged them right out</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this little beauty and the price was right</li>
            <li> After my first round, I had a little bit of redness that went away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> after I was wearing skinny jeans, I took them off to find my legs all red and a little bit tender to the touch like mild razor burn.</li>
            <li> I went nice and slow up and down my legs to see if that helped the machine take the hairs from the root and</li>
            <li> The first time will really hurt, but after that it only takes about half a minute to get used to it (minus the more sensitive areas like behind the knee).  </li>
            <li> Have it face up toward you for your first stroke, then turn it and go down your legs.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use my own tweezers or just go get waxed, it would be faster and most likely less painful.</li>
            <li> This is a decent basic model, but definitely seems like something worth putting a little extra money into.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something a bit less messy (and I liked the idea of not waiting until hair is long to remove).  </li>
            <li> I thought it was just my delicate dry skin causing me to get so many ingrown hairs before.</li>
            <li> although this device is a bit painful and might not be everyones favorite thing to use but its efficient and quick.</li>
            <li> I mean, nothing is going to get you smooth like a razor blade.</li>
            <li> It doesnt get my legs silky smooth, but i no longer have to worry about my legs appearing hairy and no more razor bumps!</li>
            <li> So I kept shaving my right armpit for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The thick ones get plucked right, but the fine ones just get broken off, so the hair grows back funny.</li>
            <li> and it did hurt less than the first time, but</li>
            <li> Well, I am a redhead and it&#x27;s hard to tell if this thing is working because I have fine blonde hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> Had to do it every three or four days at first due to hairs being in various stages of growth</li>
            <li> I bought this particular one because it has the same number of 4 and 5 ratings as more expensive models.</li>
            <li> A little uncomfortable for the first couple of times but with some alcohol OR pain reliever in the system this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> and I saw one at a store not long ago and off to Amazon I go!!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t epilated before and shaving irritates the crab out of you then buy this epilator at least for first timers it does a decent job.</li>
            <li> It worked fairly decent, but didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> For those who are not used to it ,well it&#x27;s a little bit painful, but the result is awesome in some months</li>
            <li> but this is on a whole other level of pain in MY opinion.</li>
            <li> The Remington model was not and it was hard to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> after all, what girl wants to hear something like this from other girls every time she changes for gym class: &amp;#34;Eeeew...</li>
            <li> Even though it looked smooth it felt bumpy, so I am not sure if it is actually pulling the hair out from as deep as it should.</li>
            <li> First, let me give a little background history on my experiences with hair removal in general.</li>
            <li> I found that if I went in fast little spurts the initial sting was nothing, and after a few minutes your zipping along in your own little world.  </li>
            <li> I also think (or at least I like to think) that I have a pretty high tolerance to pain.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations because of all the good reviews I read, but was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Because those little metal graspers move very fast and screech.  </li>
            <li> I tried waxing but that takes so long, you have to wait for your hair to grow back in, and you have to take a shower and clean up the mess you made.</li>
            <li> Charger comes with American plug so you will need to get yourself a local plug adaptor if you live outside the States.</li>
            <li> And for those who are brave enough to venture to their underarms: This will be tear-inducing painful.</li>
            <li> It seems to be less painful (almost no pain) and seems to do a better job of getting the hair at the root instead of breaking the hair and leaving the root, AND it gets more hairs per pass</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have a light</li>
            <li> little unit which is so easy to use is unbelievably fast  for its small size!</li>
            <li> Only complaint about this product is that it has to be plugged in - can&#x27;t move to different locations as easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it one star because the description is misleading, it states that this is a total body hair removal system, but the directions in the package clearly state that it should only be used on the legs.</li>
            <li> I clearly wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything with Nair, but that was only my personal experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that the more I use it, the less and less my hair is starting to grow back.</li>
            <li> I bought another epilator (much more expensive), and it did not work nearly as well</li>
            <li> Sooo... the last time I had my legs professionally waxed, it felt like my skin was being ripped off like some medieval torture technique.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see this as a big problem, as the same thing used to happen with my old electric razor.</li>
            <li> Package arrived before expected, first time I have ever used an epillator, and dont know how Ive lived this long without one.</li>
            <li> If you naturally have finer body hair, that starting pain threshold will be respectively lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs did feel the tiniest bit stubbly afterwards, possibly from some hairs being broken instead of pulled, but it was better than my electric razor can do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hairs were getting pulled out like magic, and smooth-looking skin was left behind.</li>
            <li> However, I found more of the hair was broken above the skin line rather than being pulled.  </li>
            <li> I still think it&#x27;s worth using, especially at this price point, shaving to me always feels like a hassle and a waste of water.</li>
            <li> This product does not work NEAR as well, and after the first 2 uses has a small crack in the head cover surrounding the tweezing discs.</li>
            <li> Really cuts down on any body odor, deodorant goes on so smooth and no more razor burn!  </li>
            <li> And this is because there were multiple hair follicles in those particular hair canals (3-4 hair follicles in a single canal)</li>
            <li> First time it can hurt a little..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little painfull at first</li>
            <li> First time I used the epilator it hurt a lot,but then I got used to it, it hurts a little bit</li>
            <li> Hello, little friend ;))))</li>
            <li> I was a little weary at first to buy this based on reviews.</li>
            <li> Have you ever had little drops of hot oil splatter on you while you&#x27;re cooking?</li>
            <li> I use it exactly how the instructions directed me to, but I saw a little to no results.</li>
            <li> Does it hurt a little at first?  </li>
            <li> the first time it hurts a little</li>
            <li> The second time, I got smart and used it just as my hairs were coming in, soooooo much better the second time around, less pain, less hair, less effort.  </li>
            <li> I attempted the hair removal creams next, I had more success with the Veet Sensitive Formula with Aloe, than I did the Nair, which I tried before the Veet, and it left second degree burns on the backs of both my legs, plus it smelled really bad.</li>
            <li> i ordered this so i wouldn&#x27;t have to shave everyday especially with summer right around the corner and after reading everyone&#x27;s reviews i went ahead and ordered it</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t say it hurts less than waxing, especially the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> After the first use it took a week and a half, maybe almost two weeks, for my underarm hair to start growing back.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want super long hairs when you epilate, so shave a few days beforehand.  </li>
            <li> I learned right away, that this little tool could be used as a form of torture treatment!</li>
            <li> I am a person who really is afraid of pain, but this eplilator is totally fine for me!!</li>
            <li> Figured it would be painful but wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for just how much some of the more sensitive spots would hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that I had to go over the same area several times before it was smooth</li>
            <li> It is definitely more painful for underarm, but it gets better after few trials.</li>
            <li> The plug in has not been an issue for me, as there is a long cord, and it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one took too much time to achieve below average results.</li>
            <li> I have another one that I considered seeing if I could have it professionally maintenanced; I&#x27;ve had it a long time and felt that it wasn&#x27;t pulling the hairs out as efficiently as it used to.  </li>
            <li> It says for use only on the legs, but it barely works on my legs.</li>
            <li> For extra sensitive areas (such as the knees), I turned up the speed and moved the device back &amp; forth faster.  </li>
            <li> after you use it once, the second time you barely feel anything.</li>
            <li> its not heavy and the power source has a long cable to don&#x27;t stop never</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised to find that they have come a long way.</li>
            <li> Apparently when they say that it&#x27;s only for legs there is a  reason, my fault anyway</li>
            <li> AS LONG AS YOU CAN SIT NEAR AN OUTLET.</li>
            <li> The first few times will hurt.</li>
            <li> but I was in pain the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower first, and then dried off and used the epilator.</li>
            <li> Lost its effectiveness after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> If you have never epilated or waxed before - it will hurt the first few times you use it.  </li>
            <li> , the first few times I hurts a bit in some areas.</li>
            <li> While at first time you may feel pains when using this on somewhere with heavy hairs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a wollybear and want to start using one, you might want to wax first... or take a few shots of whiskey.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use lidocaine and it took me a few nights to remove my first bunch of hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be prepared for some pain the first few uses though if you aren&#x27;t used to having your hairs pulled out at the roots.</li>
            <li> I did have a few ingrown hairs the first time but haven&#x27;t had any since then.</li>
            <li> Hurts like a tattoo first few uses (i would know, im covered in art).</li>
            <li> +Take some NSAIDs and/or glass of wine the first few times.  </li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks if I can give this product a higher score...or</li>
            <li> I suggest y&#x27;all to do it really slowly because if u go fast it will miss out many hairs so go slowly until it removes all the hair.</li>
            <li> Go slowly and the pull of the hair is not bad.</li>
            <li> A little loud (as other online reviews warned me of prior to purchase), but works well and was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, but be very careful when using on your upper lip.</li>
            <li> Shower and spend a little extra time with wash cloth and HOT water on legs.</li>
            <li> I know you want to get it all done, but seeing how you (and your skin reacts) to the first little introduction is crucial.</li>
            <li> But anyway, when I first epilated my underarms, it did hurt and my skin got a little red..</li>
            <li> i may try other ones but for a beginner as myself this is a decent one.</li>
            <li> I toughed through it and did a few 1 inch sections on each leg, some on the thigh where I have baby fine hair and some on the lower leg where I have super thick, dark hair that grows three hairs</li>
            <li> If it does feel uncomfortable, a little trick is to run it over the skin faster than recommended because it creates a kind of sensation that you really get used to and then can slow down and pluck more hairs without initial sting.</li>
            <li> It still hurts more than my legs, but not as badly as when I first epilated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still hurts more than my legs, but not as badly as when I first epilated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have not shave/wax your leg for a while and let the hair grow, it would be pretty painful when you use this since it would have to catch more hair each time when you have hair almost everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder than my previous epilator, but I really like that the head is detachable and washable.  </li>
            <li> Now i just do epilation once a week or less and the hair that grows after that is much softer and tinier than if you shave.</li>
            <li> felt much softer against the skin with less noise.  </li>
            <li> now i understand why some of the previous reviews stated that it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as some epilators: it doesn&#x27;t pluck out all the hair, so</li>
            <li> Apparently epilating can keep hairs from coming back until about 2 weeks later!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to let hair get as long as when you wax, but get the same benefits of longer without stubble and a natural tapered hair (not blunt and whisker-y) when it does grow in.</li>
            <li> I use this one as my quick, secondary one.</li>
            <li> Actually it only hurts the first few times, but then you get used to it.   </li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that it feels like your skin is being cut off the first few times of use.  </li>
            <li> : Its been a few months since I first used this, and after the initial period of returning to my nether region to de-pube it, I \\&quot;let things go\\&quot; for a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hurts quite a bit for the few several uses, and I&#x27;m pretty tolerant of pain.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever purchased and used, and after the initial horrifying experience of getting used to the way it feels, I&#x27;m overall pretty pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I got a few ingrown hairs and red spots on my legs at first, but I dealt with them and kept epilating...</li>
            <li> But if I want to wair for every follicle to grow back in, I&#x27;m gonna have to wait for my underarm to be thick and full of hair again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it on both speeds, going over the areas both slowly and quickly with the epilator facing either way, guard on and off, and still misses hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh and if you wonder if it hurts, it does a little the first few times but you get used to it fast.</li>
            <li> The gears are plastic and wear down fast with any degree of moderate use.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t even complete a single leg before giving up in pain.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a single wax job, and far lower maintenance than shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I cannot compare the effectiveness of this particular device to other devices, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It is painful the first time, which does get better the next time.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on I was a little terrified but ran it across my should and left it perfectly clear with minimal pain.  </li>
            <li> but my boyfriend tried using it and ended up crying......:) not good for extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my 2 biggest problems with it are the fact that you can only use it on dry skin which results in very dry skin and that i cant really use it anywhere but my legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone has different types of hair and I happen to have semi-fine, straight black hairs (medium dispersal) on my legs.  </li>
            <li> However, if you do this every week or so (depends on how fast your hair grow), you would only need to deal with the new-grow hair, so less dense hair you would have.</li>
            <li> This epilator is very noisy compared to Braun wet &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> It removes the hair super fast so you don&#x27;t spend useless time.</li>
            <li> In addition, the surface of the discs is irritating the skin so much that after epilating my underarm, for example, it would get extremely red.&lt;br /&gt;The same model from 10 years ago was fantastic, but everything nowadays gets more and more weak and artificial, so we can buy</li>
            <li> on the same area that I managed to get done again, I can&#x27;t really tell you if it hurts less the second time around.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Fine Hair: 75% removed 25% broken ;</li>
            <li> just like the one i was looking, it works perfectly fine and doesnt leave hairs behind, the people who is looking something that doesnt hurt let me tell you that it doesnt exists but is a pain you can handle.</li>
            <li> Once you get to the initial pain of ripping hairs it works better with thick slightly longer hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also I live in a small studio apartment with a very tiny bathroom that doesn&#x27;t leave me, someone with long legs, much room TO shave.</li>
            <li> Also I live in a small studio apartment with a very tiny bathroom that doesn&#x27;t leave me, someone with long legs, much room TO shave.</li>
            <li> They look tons better and the hair has definitely grown back less thick</li>
            <li> It is ok, just difficult to use if the hairs are not very long.  </li>
            <li> It does hurt a little (I&#x27;m used to waxing so it didn&#x27;t hurt me much)</li>
            <li> For what this little machine should do it&#x27;s doing it very well.</li>
            <li> a little pulling, just dont go fast on legs</li>
            <li> so I think that&#x27;s the reason it didn&#x27;t hurt so much and just felt little pinches instead.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t care as long as it come with the major stuff (bought it from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the old one was large and clumsy to handle.</li>
            <li> I have both thick hair in certain areas and soft hair in others.</li>
            <li> Of course all other methods are a little less comfortable than straight up shaving, but the rough stubble and constant upkeep of shaving was something I outgrew in college.</li>
            <li> Not really worth it for everyday use, but if you are going somewhere special and don&#x27;t want to worry about stubble/shaving I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Laser removal is too expensive (and not an option since most of my leg hairs are too light) and shaving is useless, as I have the distinct impression that those persistent little hairs immediately start growing</li>
            <li> It is a bit painful, but if you&#x27;re careful, and don&#x27;t try to mow through too much, too quickly, it&#x27;s not as bad as the youtube videos of guys freaking out at the first touch of these things appear.</li>
            <li> First it takes too long, second it is painful, and third you really don&#x27;t get that sleekness you get from a fresh razor.</li>
            <li> I lightly touched the epilator to my skin and then forced my self to hold it and drag it across my skin.</li>
            <li> Most areas grow back slowly and a few not at all.</li>
            <li> also say that it works better if the hair is trimmed down and is not over at least 1/4 inch long.</li>
            <li> It was hard getting the right angle to pull hairs out, and I imagine around ankles and knee caps</li>
            <li> The size this epilator is large enough to work a bigger area than my last epilator but still small enough to work with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this little epilator thinking that it might be a waste of money at $30, but at the same time, a good investment if it turned out to even be slightly better than how my legs react to shaving (painful coarse hair, red spots and ingrown hairs in less than a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other expensive brands but so far this is better.</li>
            <li> and i use it on the thick hair on my arms and the light blonde hairs on my tummy and other places where i feel self concious</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blade surface is too narrow and it is much less effective than my previous which was a half-inch wide.</li>
            <li> even newly shaved, you could still somewhat see the dark roots.</li>
            <li> When I shave the back of my neck with a blade, I get the same blotches that occur facially but leaving it alone for a month or two, using a good skin lightening soap like Kojie San, and going to the barbers and discontinuing using a razor to get my hair shaped up, helps me maintain a clear neck without ugly dark spots</li>
            <li> I am very pale (despite living in Florida) and have dark body hair, so this development is a huge relief and lets me go longer between epilating.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going a week and a half without looking unduly stubbly, lately, and I&#x27;m hoping to be able to go two weeks before too very long.    </li>
            <li> consuming product, that has very little positive results.</li>
            <li> After probably at least ten years of waxing, I started seriously considering forking over money for electrolysis because I no longer wanted to make the time to complete the waxing process (heat the wax for an hour or more, perform the awkward waxing, clean all the drips and strings, etc) and paying $30-50 a month for waxing just wasn&#x27;t financially reasonable anymore.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and super pale skin</li>
            <li> As someone with a high pain tolerance who has only ever shaved for hair removal, there was no way for me to prepare for the amount of pain this little torture device inflicts.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have medium hair thickness and growth and think of myself as someone with a high pain tolerance (I have several tattoos and have given birth, so what&#x27;s a little epilating?)&lt;br</li>
            <li> , word of advice, make sure to go slowly (or at least not as fast as I usually go) when epilating in order for the tweezers to firmly grasp your hairs and pull from the root.  </li>
            <li> The epilator has 2 speeds, the lower one for hard areas, such as your shins, and the higher one for softer ares, such as arm pits or thighs).</li>
            <li> I got it mainly to reduce skin irritation that I got from shaving and to save a little money by not waxing.  </li>
            <li> Although it is less powerful, I like it because it is lighter than my previous Emoij one.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I spent a little over 2 hours using it the first time.</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cause extreme pain unless you use it on sensitive parts.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of it</li>
            <li> I would not recommend either of them for your sensitive regions due to the pain.  </li>
            <li> This item came partially opened and on further inspection it was apparent it was used as there was hair still all over it!</li>
            <li> I really wish I hadn&#x27;t have &amp; my lower legs would be like my thighs, having hardly any hair at all coming in &amp; when it does you can barely feel it or see it.</li>
            <li> I have only tried it on my legs, arms and even my face which it a little hard due to its size so it is better to get a smaller unit made for the face and smaller areas for that.</li>
            <li> The long lasting results is a little far fetched and it hurts like no other, but it does remove the hair..</li>
            <li> : Be VERY careful when using this anywhere near your pubic hair.</li>
            <li> Therefore, there was no guaranty of previous use or the condition of new.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new Emjoi to replace it since I know that it will be a quality product based on previous experiences.</li>
            <li> Hurts a little when you first start but got used to it after a while, did the entire leg (just above the knee all the way down) and the results last for weeks!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally wax and found the epilator to be much more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> BTW, the cord is really long, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a turn-off if you are looking at this one, versus a cordless, more expensive epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since that was such a small thing I didn&#x27;t really care.  </li>
            <li> so I started with small sections of my leg and worked my way up to doing the whole leg at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s my first epilator, I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money on it, so I made my decision and bought this one, that wasn&#x27;t expensive at all.</li>
            <li> my hair is coarse and grows incredibly fast - i was shaving everyday, and then waxing once a week, and would still have stubble!</li>
            <li> I use it on my arm pits too and again the same problem, it misses hairs even though it they are long enough</li>
            <li> I always try to use it while my hair is still short, but long enough for it to grab the hairs.</li>
            <li> so it could &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; it out as different hairs grew long enough gradually.</li>
            <li> This means if you epilate regularly for long enough, you may see a reduction in the number of hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a first use, I noticed quite a number of hairs did not come out, but were merely broken near the skin, leaving some stubble.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick but it can only grab one or two.</li>
            <li> If you have some thick hairs that are attached pretty well to your body, expect this to YANK them painfully several times before pulling them out.  </li>
            <li> I was careful not to press down too much.  </li>
            <li> My dream epilator would have 72 tweezers (or close - the little single barrel ones take way too long), be CORDED (because the rechargable batteries do not work nearly long enough/ produce enough power), and be durable enough to last a reasonable amount of time without breaking.</li>
            <li> And you may have to use it several days in a row at first, but as the growth of the hair slows and becomes less course, you will have to use this less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I previously had another epilator which was also an electric shaver - shame this one isnt too as there are some regions you dont dare go near with an epilator!</li>
            <li> but it does heat up a little and your hand feels funny due to</li>
            <li> first it was kinda hard to use just because i&#x27;m not familiar,&lt;br /&gt;buat</li>
            <li> I mean that I had to go over spots a few times, at a certain speed, at a certain angle,</li>
            <li> complaint is that after a few uses, my triceps were covered in something much like shaving bumps - not a very attractive look - and it took almost two months after I stopped using the epilator for most of these bumps to go away (still have some).  </li>
            <li> I love it made my hairs grow in thinner, its a little painful but its worth the pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterward, my legs were covered in little red bumps and my skin was really irritated (as I expected).</li>
            <li> so you can see your skin clearly, has fewer and longer blades, and just covers less area in the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement for the one that shorted out after 8 months and after less than 2 months it has already developed a short in the cord.</li>
            <li> It left my super thin hair.</li>
            <li> The third time going over everything was nearly painless and the hairs they were able to grab didn&#x27;t hurt as bad getting yanked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Painful as can be but a similar result to waxing, probably even better because no messy, sticky wax to deal with</li>
            <li> , you could see her dark armpit hair shadow every time she hoisted her arms to do the YMCA, in spite of the fact that it was clear she&#x27;d just shaved.</li>
            <li> Washable head, small size, two speeds that are perfectly fast</li>
            <li> and my hair has thinned out so fast that I went from shaving everyday sometimes twice a day to  using the satinelle twice in a month !</li>
            <li> So I wax since I was 13, and it pretty much sucks.</li>
            <li> When this fails on my I shall invest in a more expensive, advanced epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> at least the first time).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> At first my wife complained that it hurt to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a female in my late 20&#x27;s, with dark brown hair, and I shave my legs (full) armpits and forearms.</li>
            <li> have yet to see the long term results, but I&#x27;m surprised at how well it worked compared to some of the reviews other people gave regarding pain and time</li>
            <li> But for newbies like me, as long as you exfoliate regularly, it shouldn’t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to reach the areas I need.</li>
            <li> I waited too long to send it back</li>
            <li> I intended on using it on my legs too but that took too long for me to keep it up, and I was left with a bunch of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Now it works have the time so it takes twice as long to finish same area.</li>
            <li> I expected it to hurt like hell, but this epilator barely removes any hair.</li>
            <li> Hurts a lot and doesn&#x27;t get hairs that are too long or too short.</li>
            <li> this one comes with a cord which is long enough.</li>
            <li> The power cord is not quite long enough to use without some form of extension cord, even though the manual advises against using extension cords.</li>
            <li> I am just hoping that it will last as long  as my Braun epilator that served me for 18 years.</li>
            <li> The only downside is having to keep it plugged for it to work, but otherwise that&#x27;s a minor inconvenience compared to the work it does.</li>
            <li> I am still left with long hairs and took me forever just to do one section.</li>
            <li> i think its cuz i need to wait another day for those hairs to be long enough?</li>
            <li> While it catches the majority of the hair, any too short or too long will remain.</li>
            <li> and I hope it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is not rechargeable and has to be plugged in to use but the cord is long enough to reach.  </li>
            <li> so I dont know how long the smoothness will last</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It hurts a lot and doesnt even pull hairs even after using it on same area for long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should wait until the hair is long enough to pluck, otherwise the epilator won&#x27;t catch the hairs.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough that you could probably just plug it in and use it over the sink (if you&#x27;re plucking underarm hair)</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to reach any where.</li>
            <li> I prefer a corded version because re-chargeable batteries don&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> For the armpit I don&#x27;t recommend it, because as the surface is not as flat as the legs</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not loud enough to wake up your neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have the hairs to long on the epilator will just break the hair which would be the same as shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product takes quite a few passes to get the job done, but that&#x27;s probably normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never epilated before, and have only waxed my legs with those pre-waxed strips once or twice that always end up messy and irritating the skin more than pulling out any hair.</li>
            <li> my pubic hair is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> The pain was the wort when I first start on an area and the hair was still thick</li>
            <li> I used the first- lowest setting and slowly as I could moved it up each body part.</li>
            <li> You have to go pretty slow to get everything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard stories about particularly stubborn hairs causing a tiny bit of bleeding (no more than a pin prick) but it&#x27;s yet to happen to</li>
            <li> This is a little painful, because it is pulling the hairs out by the root, but this works great on my chin and lip area.</li>
            <li> After the first few times, you only have to use it about once every week or week and a half.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I was excited at the outcome enough the first time, to endure the necessary pain until the nerves got numb, but this time I gave up after less than three minutes!</li>
            <li> What really matters, is how hard you press the unit to the skin, and even then, it only affected how well it removed the hair and did not give the nicks or cuts that a shaver would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After about 20 mintues on each leg (at full growth) there is minimal regrowth after over two weeks, this coming from a person who usually has to shave every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve made a few reminders for myself and wanted to share with all of the new epilator users: 1.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Tired of doing the same area multiple times and still see certain patch of hair standing intact!</li>
            <li> The epilator did pull hairs out, but missed a lot and also wouldn&#x27;t pull them out at the roots on occasion, probably making the sensation more painful because it was just tugging on the hair and was failing to completely extract.</li>
            <li> The most painful part was the shins, which was completely unexpected since I thought it would have been the softer areas.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear everything (have to pull out the razor), but after using it 1-2 times a week for a while, I see less hair and have smoother skin</li>
            <li> I totally disagree because epliating on dry skin hurts like</li>
            <li> Because of the slight curve, it fits naturally in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> I have another epilator that is about 10 years old and this is far better and less painful.  </li>
            <li> Takes a bit longer than shaving, but requires less frequent matience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Far less than shaving.</li>
            <li> FAR less than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is quiet and pulls those facial hairs out with minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li> so I put one leg on the toilet lid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now committed to my lower legs and will not go back to shaving at all, (middle aged now</li>
            <li> But after the 3rd or fourth time, the pain was minimal.</li>
            <li> Jan 7, 2015: I previously had a Braun epilator and compared to that, the plastic on the inside of this epilator seemed &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34; The product also gave off a strong, nasty odor of some kind.</li>
            <li> I get waxed regularly, but for some reason the upper arm and shoulder hairs grow back fast, so I bought this thing to clean up in between sessions (shaving causes rough stubble, which is almost as bad as hairy monkey arms...).  </li>
            <li> Did not remove lot of hairs in a single pass, requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li> I used to think it was plucking hair, but based on the speed of regrowth and the fact that my legs STILL feel prickly after every single use, I&#x27;ve determined that it&#x27;s actually breaking the hairs rather than pulling them out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grab every single hair, but you could tweeze if necessary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I could have gotten all the hairs out in one session, but my arm was starting to go numb after holding it up for so long.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s been a while since you&#x27;ve done this, or you&#x27;re new to it, the little wheel/tweezers spin intimidatingly fast, even on slow, so just a test spot here</li>
            <li> You only have hair to loose.</li>
            <li> The first time was super painful</li>
            <li> But for legs - my hair on legs is very thin and not much, it just creates many bumps.</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not perfect, I still have a few whispy hairs left after use (are they too short/thin?), but I gleaned that repeated use of this device over time will ultimately be my solution.</li>
            <li> The single head of rotating coils cover a small area, so it takes much longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you go fast on the areas, you will have to go over, I suggest you to go slowly to be sure and always do it after the shower, it will be less painful.</li>
            <li> so I bought another one and the same thing happened, except it only took about a month and a half for the same problems to surface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kick myself every time I let my leg hair all grow back in due to sheer laziness</li>
            <li> She said hair grows in 3 different waves, and she encouraged me to come back two other times.</li>
            <li> During the summer I regularly shave daily or every other.</li>
            <li> Some people compared it to bee stings or other frightening things, but a way better description is just like getting a tattoo.</li>
            <li> an American male of half Middle-Eastern - half Slavic blood, I have been blessed with thick black hair that grows out of most parts of my body...and now that I am entering my geriatric years, hair has been growing on parts of my body where hair does not belong.</li>
            <li> , I kept having to go back over the same areas and the areas that are rounded, like the front of your leg, you have to be very careful or you will damage your skin.  </li>
            <li> The level of pain would obviously depend on your tolerance level, but its not that bad... like a little quick sting that quickly passes.</li>
            <li> The other great thing is that there&#x27;s no chance of cutting yourself -- I&#x27;m a bit clumsy, so this is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> There were only two instances where I saw a little bit of bleeding (2 red open pores).</li>
            <li> The little bit of pain is totally tolerable though, if it only was actually pulling out the hair .</li>
            <li> Not the little red bumps from using the device, those clear up by morning, these are just rough bumps all over the legs.  </li>
            <li> Since having my late epilator I have not used a razor for my legs and underarms, that is why it didn&#x27;t hurt when using this one (the very first time using my previous epilator</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s better than an electric razor and the hair stays away longer than a conventional shave, it&#x27;s still not perfect.</li>
            <li> If you take a warm bath and use this afterwards, it shouldn&#x27;t hurt too bad.</li>
            <li> So I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that bad.</li>
            <li> If you tweeze anything else you probably won&#x27;t find using this product too painful but as a hairy woman I also don&#x27;t find it to be particularly effective.</li>
            <li> It is kind of painful, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> When a female friend informed me that most women prefer their men without any chest or abdomen hair, I was both shocked and a tiny bit offended.</li>
            <li> the more times you use it-after 4/5 times its more uncomfortable than painful.</li>
            <li> Lasts much longer at least a week &amp; there are now areas that I see the hair no longer growing in at.</li>
            <li> one would say this isn&#x27;t painful, to some extent, but it can be effective.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a chainsaw (sorry, neighbors), but it yanks out your hairs waaay faster than you ever could with a pair of tweezers, and your legs are silk smooth for days.</li>
            <li> I like this better than shaving because i dont have to use cream or end up cutting myself but</li>
            <li> Both feel crazy smooth!</li>
            <li> (and with many breaks and hesitations around the ankle) the pain starts to become numb.</li>
            <li> The epilator has two settings, and they both sound really scary.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, for my stupid hairy legs it might be a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Whoever came up with this invention is very sadistic to say the least.</li>
            <li> Using sea breeze will clear this up after a few days, though.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most painful method and there really is no benefit.</li>
            <li> Has long duration (years)</li>
            <li> that is obvious and to be expected.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to go over and over and over a spot for it to pick up all the hairs, and therefore it takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also the hair has to be fairly long for in order for the head to grab it.</li>
            <li> Did you know your armpit hairs are, like, an inch long?</li>
            <li> i have been fighting my hairy legs for way to long</li>
            <li> I made it through, and it didn&#x27;t take too long.</li>
            <li> The cord is decently long</li>
            <li> , cord is long so i can use it all over the place.</li>
            <li> cord is around five feet long, give or take a bit,</li>
            <li> It takes me probably twice as long to do my legs with this thing as compared to the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> device is corded so that it works for as long as you need it to work.</li>
            <li> I like knowing that I can plug it in and it works for as long as I need to use it.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and pain.</li>
            <li> It needs to be plugged in to use, long cord though.</li>
            <li> I need to shave it perhaps once a year, but then the hairs are long.  </li>
            <li> TIME CONSUMING (three times as long as waxing)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> , it has a long cord</li>
            <li> I like that it does work and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of strays, and that it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time to get the hair gone.</li>
            <li> I waited too long and now can no longer return it.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I felt absolutely no pain at all.  </li>
            <li> and it got tangled in the sheet and was on for my entire 15 minute shower, so it was jammed and over heated.</li>
            <li> I find that areas of hair on my leg do grow in either a lot thinner, slower, or almost not at all for a long time after using this.  </li>
            <li> I like that the wire to plug in a long</li>
            <li> - too weak&lt;br /&gt;-takes too long</li>
            <li> and I do not know why it took me so long to purchase it..  </li>
            <li> You have to let it grow too long for it to catch.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I was using razors and tweezers for so long, when I could have just been using this!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs was quite long</li>
            <li> it takes a long time to do that.  </li>
            <li> It will save money in the long run from my hair stylist doing the waxing that feels like she is pulling a layer of skin off.  </li>
            <li> but in the long run this is cheaper than buying razors every couple of weeks and getting shaving cream and its also a cheaper alternitive to wax</li>
            <li> and I found if I stretched out the skin as recommended in the instructions it made a difference.</li>
            <li> It works as expected and I would definitely recommend others to buy this one</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator purchases, and I spent a LOT of time reading reviews.</li>
            <li> If the hair is too long it&#x27;ll break instead of being pulled out.</li>
            <li> This shipped in earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> and I wish i wouldve bought it long ago.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known these things existed a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Your legs come out soft after a few hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord on this one is fairly long, but it tethers you to an outlet.  </li>
            <li> I did not want from medium to \\&quot;high-traffic\\&quot; skin areas-- no sensitive skin areas.  </li>
            <li> I have never waxed my legs before and thought I would try this since it would be cheaper in the long run.</li>
            <li> I wished I would&#x27;ve tried epilation a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> was LONG.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it for minor touch ups.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a veteran waxer, so there&#x27;s not much discomfort for me.</li>
            <li> Staying in one spot too long caused the pain.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using this for the long term effects of lessening the amount of hair that grows.  </li>
            <li> the legs, I thought it took a long time, and it didn&#x27;t take everything off.</li>
            <li> The long power cord is a plus.</li>
            <li> so I was not surprised.  </li>
            <li> I nearly screamed my head off when it plucked a few legs strands.</li>
            <li> Keep your skin stretched and move the epilator against the way the hair grows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore as long as I have this baby.</li>
            <li> I had used an ancient version of  this device in the early  &#x27;80s called The Epilady - not comfortable at all.</li>
            <li> I am curious to see how long it takes for the hair to grow back in</li>
            <li> If you just start by touching the skin a few times, and then slowly work your way through for a few seconds at a time, it&#x27;s not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do, however, have an extremely high threshold for pain, so I quickly got over the initial shock of the painful feeling of having every strand of hair pulled out of my arms.  </li>
            <li> He will instantly turn his frown upside down and then offer to give you a back</li>
            <li> i did see a slight increase in ingrown hairs but nothing too major.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this epilator was not as painful as other brands I have tried!</li>
            <li> And if something needs replacing on it or completely, I wont have to spend half a pay check on!</li>
            <li> That helps if you want to try a new area (like the underarms, thighs, etc) because you&#x27;re just pulling out the root and a little of extra hair which makes you feel less pain.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Just be ready, they are super unsightly and painful.</li>
            <li> It hurts much less than waxing; it&#x27;s a kind of prickly pain, and the vibration of the machine helps numb</li>
            <li> found it less painful than waxing and more like a quick sting (as others noted) on sensitive areas like behind my knees.</li>
            <li> It does however last longer than shaving and less hair does grow back.</li>
            <li> The electrolysis I did years ago left my upper lip scarred but removed the black ones.</li>
            <li> It only got off half the hair and a lot came back in grown.</li>
            <li> It seems like about a third to a half if the hairs on my calves have grown back ingrown</li>
            <li> It seems to snap the hair in half instead which means I have to go over the same are multiple times.</li>
            <li> I mean, really...</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it is very loud.</li>
            <li> the one positive aspect of being middle age is that hair production does slow down.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old epilator that had just plain worn out.</li>
            <li> does get the thin hair if you angle it just right.</li>
            <li> first time that I used was a little bit irritation but after nothing of that just a little bit pain!</li>
            <li> I tried a few times thinking my hair was not long enough even though it says hair doesnt have to be longer then 1/4 of an inch.  </li>
            <li> Epilating hurts me especially badly when I put off doing it for several weeks or if my skin is cold, but it always hurts more at first then gets better.</li>
            <li> If the idea of tiny little tweezers yanking out your body hair at the same time, don&#x27;t look at the head for too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use, but I was only able to get half of one of my legs completed because I did a really terrible job of half-shaving the other day and</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-Took a long time to remove every single hair</li>
            <li> Too long is more painful and too tiny doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile and have found it fairly similar to other epilators.</li>
            <li> The other thing that bothered me was that you can only use it when it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> I usually do it while watching a tv show, and it isn&#x27;t unexpected to spend 30-40 minutes on my legs, just up to my knee!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t, and I ended up with little red bumps and larger hair follicle holes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple years now (pretty late at reviewing), but I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I am no longer using this epilator (and probably won&#x27;t buy another) due to the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-it</li>
            <li> I see this one has the same amount of stars as the other one I purchased</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this item originally due to mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had an epilator before, I always used it on my armpits and my other very private area.</li>
            <li> The pain that this epilator causes totally eclipses that pain and all other pains.</li>
            <li> I only use on legs and underarms (cant speak for other areas).</li>
            <li> I did get little red bumps on my legs about ten minutes after epilating, but they went away within an hour, and I think putting on lotion helped.</li>
            <li> Little hairs are just starting to grow back</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for a corded epilator that would last longer due to not losing charge over time.</li>
            <li> and I think this is due the entire hair being pulled out.</li>
            <li> Afterward I had tiny little red bumps where the hair was removed, but they didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I bought it earlier in other country.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous to use it initially as I anticipated unbearable pain</li>
            <li> the second use quite faster and not &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; hurting as the other says on their review</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this and several other ones.</li>
            <li> The other ones died before I finished shaving &amp; then it was HOURS until it was recharged enough to continue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you are hairy and they are thick and dark, this might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;To be able to use this, your hair needs to be at least 0.3 CM(as I remember)</li>
            <li> Facial hair is more painful to remove, especially upper lip hair, than other hair.  </li>
            <li> considering it has a very very long wire.</li>
            <li> Although it does have to be plugged into the wall, the cord is very long</li>
            <li> Oh, I debated getting an epilator for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It was tolerable for a while, however, because it does not get every hair on the first pass, I found myself going over the same spot multiple times, which caused the skin to get very sensitive, and eventually became too painful to do over that single spot anymore.</li>
            <li> (cord is only for charging), but I have read so many bad reviews about inside batteries dying after just some time of using it that I did not want cordless one.</li>
            <li> I did apply a body moisturizing cream, immediately afterwards and that helped the dry areas.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, i did think it was pretty painful</li>
            <li> and you need to be dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with everyone that its painful and causes ingrown hairs, but that most likely has to do with your level of pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I recommend using epilator after bath but on dry</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty painful for first timers.</li>
            <li> Much more efficient than nair, or shaving, and far less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> The first, I admit, was pretty painful.  </li>
            <li> I think part of the problem was that my legs were reeaaaaallly dry.</li>
            <li> others have stated, hair/skin needs to be dry, and you have to let your hair grow out some between epilations</li>
            <li> The hairlessness doesn&#x27;t seem to last that much longer, and I got tired of infected follicles.</li>
            <li> For the last few years I have been nagged with hair growth on my chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> The efficiency cap which coming in set is absolutely useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the epilator itself is much lighter than my old one which was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> It had decent reviews, and I didn&#x27;t think the noise level that some people complained about would be a problem.</li>
            <li> with my thick and thin hairs i use different settings and strokes and it works really well for me despite giving me red bumpy rashes but my skin is prone to getting those even when i shave so its just natural</li>
            <li> My legs are never smooth after epilating because there are always some smaller hairs / stubble from breakage or just different growth cycle.</li>
            <li> It leaves a lot behind that simply can&#x27;t be caught with the auto tweezers but what it does rip out hurts so much</li>
            <li> I have been wanting an epilator for a long time and I finally broke down and got this one.</li>
            <li> (Though I only used it on my armpits, not sure with the other sensitive parts)</li>
            <li> barely feel the little tweaks as it pulls out hairs -</li>
            <li> Although it does not really remove a lot of hair or the short hairs, so I am not certain if it is my technique on epilating or the epilator itself.</li>
            <li> It took me three times to remove every single hair from my legs.  </li>
            <li> It removed every single piece of hair</li>
            <li> but this was something else--I felt every single hair that it was yanking out.</li>
            <li> It broke off almost every single hair.  </li>
            <li> It does not get every hair on a single pass.</li>
            <li> It does, indeed, what it says; very efficient tweezers that can pick up the small hairs of less than 1 mm.</li>
            <li> this is so much easier and less messy; not to mention faster!</li>
            <li> At least shaving is typically painless and the razor cuts the hair off the first time.</li>
            <li> I usually take care of my skin, so maybe that&#x27;s why it wasn&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough on this one to stretch from an electrical outlet to the bathtub or sink to not cause a mess.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, my pain tolerance is above average.</li>
            <li> I used one once about 5 yrs ago for roughly 10 seconds and never touched it again due to the sheer pain.  </li>
            <li> I have dark leg hair (I&#x27;m Italian)</li>
            <li> Coming back the second time, the skin was still very sore and made it difficult to use this product again.</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m writing this review though is because in the past 2 months, the cord has been failing and now every time I epilate, it stops frequently</li>
            <li> (Note: I have coarse, dark</li>
            <li> like my old Revlon and small cleaning brush</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thin since I&#x27;ve done it for a while.</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t know what to expect but was willing to give it a try since I&#x27;m tired of shaving.  </li>
            <li> expected that a 30+ dollar product that even had a plug in power source would last for quiet a bit longer than just a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally have to go over areas a few times (female, not very hairy).</li>
            <li> This is a skill and is frustrating at first, just like shaving your legs was</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worse in your head ;)</li>
            <li> It does look nice but still disappointed...</li>
            <li> Owned 2 of these, both stopped working when the cord connection to the epilator started getting loose.</li>
            <li> I did have to make multiple passes, but that doesn&#x27;t make your skin raw like multiple applications of wax will</li>
            <li> Works less than half as well as my old Philips corded model with ceramic tweezers.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you trim your leg hair if needed or will seriously hurt worse.</li>
            <li> Men,  you can do you chest hair, back hair, but do not do it down under you</li>
            <li> it broke down and it seems the cord has a short.</li>
            <li> It will take another review later down the line to check that part out.  </li>
            <li> It felt like tiny bee stings all up and down my leg.</li>
            <li> and it arrived two days earlier than expected!!</li>
            <li> I only going 4 stars because the head is much bigger than the actual working area of the device and that made it awkward in tighter places and its very directional.</li>
            <li> Key is to remember not to press hard but barely let it touch the skin.</li>
            <li> was very nervous about the pain when I first tried it out, but it turned out to be not too bad.</li>
            <li> I even had to wait a day or two and go back over again, but over time, it will be less time</li>
            <li> A week later I had half ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kinda nervous about using it again, but I&#x27;ll just hope that it hurts less next time!</li>
            <li> Definately yes, hair grow back thinner and less</li>
            <li> I need only less time to finish things.</li>
            <li> It really hurt the first time I used it, but my hair came back finer and lighter, so with each use it&#x27;s a lot less painful.</li>
            <li> Plus, there has definitely been less regrowth for me</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get all those thick dark hairs like I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> It catches the shorter, finer hairs previous epilators missed that still left me needing to shave to be</li>
            <li> Then you will feel less pain after use this for several times.</li>
            <li> needed one for my wife as she had a previous version (from 1995) that was starting to give up .</li>
            <li> It worked for a month and a half and then the cord got a short in it.</li>
            <li> It pulls even the tiny hair and it does not hurt nor pinch my skin like others I previously owned.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have ADD like me and actually take the time to get all the hair in one go, you will probably have to do it less</li>
            <li> Did my legs and bikini, i would recommend doing this at night as it left small red dots that dissappeared by morning.</li>
            <li> , the slight sting was totally manageable.</li>
            <li> In the past I have paid big bucks for facial waxes.  </li>
            <li> I could only finish half of one leg-</li>
            <li> inevitably popping up in less than a day.</li>
            <li> An ex previously remarked that &amp;#34;it looks like there&#x27;s a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; on the same day I shaved, and shaving irritated my underarms, so I made the switch.  </li>
            <li> On the up-side, the cord is long enough that I can use it a few feet away from any outlet.</li>
            <li> Typical standard Epilator.</li>
            <li> If it means shaving less often, that is definitely a plus and also the fact that you don&#x27;t have to us shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Shave less but doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs even after going over areas several times.</li>
            <li> Since its pulling the hair from the root your hair grows back in less time just like waxing.</li>
            <li> However, I know that after repeated use, the amount of hair that grows back will be less than it was before I</li>
            <li> But each of these sessions were only a few minutes long.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that the pain was a lot less after the initial epilation.  </li>
            <li> but this one does the job it is smaller than my previous model</li>
            <li> If possible would give it less than an one star rating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only negative (which would have been apparent to me</li>
            <li> Those hairs are coming back in that spot over time, but there are a LOT fewer (less?) of them than before.  </li>
            <li> Though it was louder than I thought it would be but not loud enough to wake up my brother after closing the bathroom door (though he is a heavy sleeper).</li>
            <li> I have dark, a bit thick, and straight hair.</li>
            <li> little painful at first but well worth the process.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li> It does take a couple of tries to get all the hair ( not to mention its hard to get used to it pulling out the hair) and can cause irritation to the area for the first few uses.  </li>
            <li> My hair grows too fast and thick after shaving, so shaving my legs every other day is not an option for me ( who has time for that anyway?! )</li>
            <li> Kinda painful the first few runs (but no more than waxing) ° Requires an outlet to plug in the cord (not a big deal and so worth it!)  </li>
            <li> but w hair removal at least once the hair is removed it stops hurting completely!</li>
            <li> a lot of people think that its similar to waxing because the they both pluck the hair from the root, but thats not necessarily true.</li>
            <li> The cord is very long, thin, and flexible, so it is very manageable.</li>
            <li> Its louder than I thought, slight scary noise, but the end result is smooth legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks, so the irritation is still going down, but it has made such a change for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this method will ever become painless because come on, it is a rotating blade of a bunch of tweezers plucking out every single hair, but the pain does become insignificant after a while!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably not holding the skin tight enough.    </li>
            <li> OMG ,,, this one crunched down hard and actually ate a piece of skin leaving a huge bruise behind.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how bad it would be, given the mixed reviews--the first pass was rather startling.  </li>
            <li> works fine, just a little uncomfortable to use..</li>
            <li> little backstory:&lt;br /&gt;I, like probably every other woman, have been on the hunt for a hair removal method that actually works, and keeps the hair away for a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, I usually shave under my arms every day because my hair doesn&#x27;t only grow back fast, but it is very dark and thick.</li>
            <li> (shhh...!), on the lower setting and hope it will work without fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I found is that this tiny little machine makes a big, loud noise, but really a small price to pay for the work</li>
            <li> The fact that I had to go over the same spots due to not lifting hair (and still having no success)</li>
            <li> Laser hair removal only killed the black hairs that had grown back but</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try it on my underarms or any other sensitive areas as I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work on the courser hairs.  </li>
            <li> After pregnancy I was left with long grey hairs of varying thicknesses as well as a few black ones under my chin and along my jawline.</li>
            <li> No problems, have been using similar products for years, so no pain or maybe just use to the little sting of having the hairs pulled out from the root.</li>
            <li> It feels like tiny little bee stings all over your skin.  </li>
            <li> After using it several times though it has gotten a little easier to use.</li>
            <li> I did a lot a research about the process and finally decided to go with this little beauty.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a little red afterwards for about 30-40mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> PATIENT, everyone is going to use it a little bit differently.</li>
            <li> (from what little hair this item actually did pull out)</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just see if this will last as long as the trusty little Epilady, which will now be gratefully retired!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t hard to get each area completely clear</li>
            <li> The first few times you use it on your legs you will feel it, but after a few times you get used to it &amp; it smarts less &amp; less.</li>
            <li> When I first used the epilator on my legs it was a little painful at first</li>
            <li> I still shave regularly (every other day or so), but this does help my legs get less scratchy between shaves.  </li>
            <li> I did about half my stomach and just tried various other spots to see if it would do anything.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient when compared to waxing since you it hardly takes few minutes and can be done at home.</li>
            <li> it breaks hairs constantly and hardly ever actually pulls the roots out.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t buy this off of amazon, I snagged it at the Meijer down the street from my house on clearance at $27.99!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t truthfully say it&#x27;s painless, but it&#x27;s not that bad either.  </li>
            <li> It hurts, I&#x27;ve used it many times and it hurts so bad</li>
            <li> Hurts really bad and doesn&#x27;t pull out all of the hair, more breaks it than anything.</li>
            <li> I feel that it hurt so bad because I had so many hairs being pulled at once.</li>
            <li> huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly used to plucking and that doesn&#x27;t hurt me, but this sucker hurt bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more time-intensive and painful alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li> But for people who are used to waxing, you won&#x27;t find it any more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> I used to do the wax for my face, an comparing to this Phillips eplilator，wax is more painful.</li>
            <li> I can say that it wasn&#x27;t THAT painful and that I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> It was soooooo painful to use this product, and there were so many blood spots after using it on my legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epilating in general is painful but this epilator seemed to hurt more than ones I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> This is a lot slower and more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> I had never used an epilation device before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how painful the hair removal process would be.</li>
            <li> I do not like doing the underarms, but I grin and bear it as that is the most painful to do.  </li>
            <li> Doing my legs isn&#x27;t my favorite sensation, but I would no longer characterize it as painful.  </li>
            <li> Was a bit more painful</li>
            <li> so it was definitely more painful.</li>
            <li> This one was probably one of the most painful ones I used.  </li>
            <li> (since I have never epilated before and wasn&#x27;t sure how painful it would be).</li>
            <li> I used one of these before but this one seemed more painful to use.</li>
            <li> it can get more painful, so I just use it for the legs.</li>
            <li> or it will be more painful.</li>
            <li> Peach fuzz or random short strays, ehhh not so much.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I spent forever doing my legs</li>
            <li> Not much of pain and it plucks well.</li>
            <li> It hurts, as epilators are expected to.</li>
            <li> It would have helped me save a lot of time I had spent scouring the internet for tips.&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell, but that&#x27;s to be expected from an epilator.  </li>
            <li> I have waxed a few times, and this is a different type of pain.</li>
            <li> Next time I might try them on the chicken wings I get from the supermarket because the supermarket doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good enough job waxing my chicken, comparing to this Epilator</li>
            <li> I did and it left my face irritated for a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need to go over the same place for few times to remove.</li>
            <li> I am curious though, if it&#x27;s going to cause ingrown  hair.</li>
            <li> I used it again a few days later, and finished my legs.  </li>
            <li> Spent forever trying to get it to work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> It arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> It is rechargeable, and for some wierd and unknown reason it doesn&#x27;t charge up anymore.</li>
            <li> I know it can be harder when you travel as you may not always find an outlet source</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> CAREFUL:</li>
            <li> Of course it hurts, but that&#x27;s to be expected when you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your skin, and it does get easier over time.</li>
            <li> I had the same one for years and never had trouble with it.</li>
            <li> It pulls but not very well.</li>
            <li> and I run it over the same area a few times to ensure that I have gotten all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> but i expected that.</li>
            <li> It took about three tries before I got use to it.  </li>
            <li> I expected a wax-quality hair-removal experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> But I think I&#x27;ve built up a mental tolerance to the pain</li>
            <li> i dont know how this is possibly a product that anybody uses, ever, unless you are a masochist or have dead nerves.</li>
            <li> Not really intended for bikini area, might need to do something else here.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use that pink colored thingy on it, cuz it doesn&#x27;t improve taking out all the hair by the root.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a few, no ingrown hairs, but I also seem to have a problem with it grabbing all of the hair, I end up needing to go over several times and even then I may not have gotten it all.</li>
            <li> Granted, it does pull the hairs, but only a few at a time.</li>
            <li> I use it on partial growth on arms and legs after waxing..</li>
            <li> not really a sissy when it comes to pain</li>
            <li> The head breaks off constantly, even when I go to store it, and now won&#x27;t stay on firmly.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected it, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not as expected and advertised.</li>
            <li> I thought I would keep trying over the next few days</li>
            <li> and it makes it harder to use for armpits.</li>
            <li> My legs had a few red spots but they were gone by morning.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it would be possible to add that feature, but it&#x27;s a bit messy.  </li>
            <li> a 1 star review!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves too much hair behind.</li>
            <li> So that is expected.</li>
            <li> and you have to go over the same spot a few times.</li>
            <li> it came even before the expected date and it was exacly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> After using it for two weeks her legs are all bumpy and rough.  </li>
            <li> So be careful if you get</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I had some trouble cleaning it</li>
            <li> On my legs, the pain is really minimal.  </li>
            <li> Each stroke will not remove every hair; rather, you will need to go over the area a few times, which is personally how I would prefer it anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am not real hairy..</li>
            <li> And the hair grows back in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> a lot of growing out, then I shaved, then used this a few days later.</li>
            <li> Traumatized, I followed up a few weeks later by using a home-kit (from Walmart), which worked</li>
            <li> My plan is to use it every 3 days or so to grab the few hairs that start to grow back.  </li>
            <li> And when I did there was only a few hairs.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t coming all back like when shaving so every few days</li>
            <li> I use a rough lufa in the shower to exfoliate now because I read that if you don&#x27;t you may end up with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last a few years, as my Brown one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impatient and often have to go back to areas I missed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very hairy</li>
            <li> After one round with the baby I can definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li> But I am a big wuss when it comes to pain, I do have a couple tattoos as well, but after a few days of thinking, I decided, &amp;#34;what the hell.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money, please don&#x27;t buy and regret it like I did.</li>
            <li> careful if you use this on your underarms.</li>
            <li> I shave and have stubble a few hours later!</li>
            <li> and I expected it to hurt but was not prepared for this.</li>
            <li> It looked like I had shaved only a few days ago.</li>
            <li> This did not work as well as i expected.  </li>
            <li> All of your hair isn&#x27;t always in the same direction, this is why I&#x27;m guessing a lot of folks complain about missing patches?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curious person!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a curious person!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really waxed either</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to everyone who doesn&#x27;t have that much hair to remove and is tired of waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and tried a few times on different days to see if I just needed practice but to no avail.  </li>
            <li> functional and as expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to push onto the skin.</li>
            <li> I also tried using it on the legs where it had a harder time grabbing onto them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also louder than I expected.</li>
            <li> and I had red bumps on my leg for a few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few days since that third go over with this product, and everything feels even softer!!!</li>
            <li> but I never have a completely hairless armpit without having a few tiny hairs left behind.</li>
            <li> But the individual product description did NOT accurately describe and gave no reference to a chart at the end of all Philips Epilator ads.  </li>
            <li> Bring the tool close to an area of your skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive and just test it out slowly.</li>
            <li> The underarms hurt a little bit and were slightly irritated, but it didn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> After 10 minutes I managed to pull out only half of my hair in a little 3 inch long patch.</li>
            <li> A few of the lowest pores bled slightly, but nothing major.</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts very badly the first couple of times and my chest got rather irritated the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> It does not clean well, the tweezers are flat.</li>
            <li> lot of other reviewers said it hurts, and it does, but I thought the pain was totally manageable, and I&#x27;m terrified of just a little shot or blood work.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s hard, or taxing, and it&#x27;s no less time consuming than this, but it cuts costs.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s hard, or taxing, and it&#x27;s no less time consuming than this, but it cuts costs.</li>
            <li> Good but very Painful.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty decent pain tolerance and having thick, stubble hair after years of shaving getting ripped out by the root, PHEW!!!!</li>
            <li> She had an allergy on her legs and the Phillip satinelle didn&#x27;t shave the hair like the old one she usually use!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this over shaving, the hairs on my legs have become very thin, and I don&#x27;t need to epilate them as much anymore.</li>
            <li> The test area on my arm is red and bumpy (very typical for my skin; I expect it to fade), but my legs aren&#x27;t at all.</li>
            <li> The first time I epilated, I pulled it slowly up my leg and OUCH!!  </li>
            <li> But over time the hair will be less &amp; less &amp; it will grow back in longer &amp; longer periods of time.</li>
            <li> It was actually a relaxing experience once I got used to the sensation, and since it&#x27;s supposed to hurt less and less every time, I expect I&#x27;ll get faster.</li>
            <li> But less and less will grow back each time and what does is thinner.</li>
            <li> It is far less painful than waxing and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all except a tiny bit on the back of my calves where I am sensitive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in August and it was working fine until this past week when the power would shut off at random intervals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud, which can be kinda awkward to use when you live in a dorm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d use this if I was a woman, since the hairs have to be at least a certain length for this to grab it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I spent nearly five hours doing it because I had to keep stopping because of how badly it hurt.</li>
            <li> In the long run I think it will be worth it, but actually using it takes a while and is a bit painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no doubt that it is uncomfortable to use this product, especially the first few times you use it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I wanted a full body one and didn&#x27;t understand that this was only for legs, or at least that is what it says in the manual.</li>
            <li> The pain is pretty bad the first few times, but eventually it gets less for some reason.</li>
            <li> She is not happy with this new model!</li>
            <li> What I neglected to mention when I first reviewed this thing is that when you start with it, it hurts like tiny demons stabbing your nether region.</li>
            <li> What I neglected to mention when I first reviewed this thing is that when you start with it, it hurts like tiny demons stabbing your nether region.</li>
            <li> Hair doesn&#x27;t have to be long, maybe try this a week or so after your last shave for the least discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> My only complaint is having to go over each section several times to get all the hair, which may misery be typical of all epilators, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> It was very manageable as I started in a small area, went slow, and expanded outward.</li>
            <li> Eliminates hair for long periods of time and grows back slowly and sparse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little painful the first few times, and you&#x27;ll have to go over areas a bit at first, but once you&#x27;ve used the product for two weeks or so, it works so well with maintenance and keeping unwanted hair away.</li>
            <li> less messier than waxing with the same results and little pain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using this anywhere other than legs, especially not on super sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using this anywhere other than legs, especially not on super sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> And as someone who gets ingrown hairs from waxing constantly, I find that as long as I dry exfoliate with a brush, I have hardly any ingrowns now!</li>
            <li> Not to say it doesn&#x27;t hurt, I mean you ARE ripping hair out from the root, but the pain doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> It is very long and thin, so I had no trouble at all reaching an outlet and still having a comfy spot to sit with my leg</li>
            <li> I just have a slight problem with the loose connection of the cord</li>
            <li> Feels like tiny little angry bees, but I can control when they sting me and if it becomes too much, just lift up the machine and it is immediate relief.</li>
            <li> ( that is the time more or less starts going bad or make noises) .</li>
            <li> BUT waxing is not for me so with more use the less painful the depilating process.</li>
            <li> It is also much more painful to use than my previous Veet one ever was.</li>
            <li> Painful and the hair grows back quickly still.</li>
            <li> One and a half weeks later, I started Round 2 of epilation.  </li>
            <li> so just shaving wasnt working for me, waxing was so messy, and this hurt way less then the last time I got lasered.</li>
            <li> There is some slight discomfort, but it can be minimized  by holding any loose skin around knees or other areas taught .</li>
            <li> Yes, it does pinch a little in certain spots, like around your ankles, knee, and behind the knee.</li>
            <li> This is really painful, much more painful than waxing, but if you are as cheap as me, you will survive.  </li>
            <li> however, that is a negative about epilation in general.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with pulling, pinching or any other issues I read others had.</li>
            <li> I did one leg Friday &amp; the other Saturday.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s a hassle to shave every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> It appeared harmless enough; small, compact, and feminine.</li>
            <li> The other % is cuted.</li>
            <li> She swears by them so that&#x27;s why I purchased one since I was fed up with shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> Also, I was not interested in a wet/dry model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because if a $100 epilator didn&#x27;t work, why would a $25 one work...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comment here if you would like any other tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the epilator itself is extremely well made.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected... pull out hair from the root!</li>
            <li> Used to shave every other to every day.</li>
            <li> Now maybe every other week use this gadget</li>
            <li> i try other company before like broun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never waxed anything other than my eyebrows, and those don&#x27;t hurt me at all</li>
            <li> Before that I had to shave my legs almost every other day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other epilators, but this one seems to work</li>
            <li> Although I will say that it feels slightly uncomfortable at first.</li>
            <li> I bought a similar product in the past</li>
            <li> It is noisy compared with the other I had</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]] and was somewhat disappointed that it breaks more hairs that it pulls (which is the point of an epilator, otherwise, might as well shave).</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know how the other epilators feel, like the cordless ones that you can use in the shower</li>
            <li> and i also bought 2 other as a gift for my friends and they like it as well</li>
            <li> Pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> So now its back with me, now past the 40 days, un-returnable,</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> The only con that I can think of is that it is small.</li>
            <li> Some of the other ones look like they have been ripped/broken off.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kinda scary if its your first time.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m prone to them on other parts of my body anyway</li>
            <li> no gentle at all !</li>
            <li> I had an other Epilator that lasted about two years</li>
            <li> I expected it to hurt, but this is excruciating!</li>
            <li> Going over the same small area of skin for minutes still does not remove the hair.</li>
            <li> The epilator works and perhaps if you can manage to get past the initial excruciating pain, it lessens?  </li>
            <li> Since I do nothing different that I haven&#x27;t done repeatedly for the past two years</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and removes hair with minimal pain!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I do like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Functionally, it works like any other epilator (I have a remington one) and also works best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the other thing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly a gorilla</li>
            <li> and then you going numb is absolutely true.</li>
            <li> In other words it stops working</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on other areas of my body yet</li>
            <li> One other thing I am noticing with this epilator is that the hairs have already started to become finer and softer.</li>
            <li> And &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; cheaper than other Epilator .</li>
            <li> Proof she and alot of other women are NUTS.</li>
            <li> the other night browsing Amazon, I came across an &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used this item maybe once a month every other month or so.</li>
            <li> Using this epilator anywhere other than your legs?</li>
            <li> [No more shaving creme, using extra body wash or buying razors as often.</li>
            <li> [No more shaving creme, using extra body wash or buying razors as often.</li>
            <li> first time, I was forced to do it in small shifts: A few strokes on the legs, then a break.</li>
            <li> Additionally, longer hairs can break instead of coming out by the root, and then you are left with a hair too small for the device to pick up.</li>
            <li> I looked at a ton of other epilators before buying this one.</li>
            <li> If waxing hurts like a bitch, this one is like...not waxing.. doesn&#x27;t even come close, since you can control and only go on small areas if it does</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> (got here before any of the other items we ordered).    </li>
            <li> I have fairly thin soft hair on my legs, even after letting it grow for a few days (same amount of time as my underarms)</li>
            <li> and I tried other brands  </li>
            <li> To small to actually pluck anything, but can still cause pain.</li>
            <li> other note</li>
            <li> I have not used on other areas of the body.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it on other parts of the body unless you can stand it.</li>
            <li> i just didn&#x27;t like the fact that it breaks the hair more than it pulls them out. :(</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts 7 years as the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before, so I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Usually 2-4 hairs left</li>
            <li> I felt the little hairs coming out, but it wasn&#x27;t really painful at all- more like just an indication that yep- another hair just disappeared.</li>
            <li> This feels like many little extremely painful pinches on the skin, I prefer waxing over this.</li>
            <li> Barely gets half the hair, the only thing worse than using this thing once is using it again.</li>
            <li> only really works well on legs...too painful for me to use on the bikini area with any regularity and just flat out</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, not too painful and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one gripe with this model is that I always have to repeatedly go over areas to get them completely clear, so as a result epilating is a much longer (and painful) process than shaving.</li>
            <li> Its difficult to pull out short but visible hair so need to wait for the hair to grow a considerable length before it can be pulled out&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can even look closely and see the tiny hairs broken off at the skin, too short to be picked up by the epilator.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back again in a few days for round #2.</li>
            <li> I was tired of shaving my legs and two days later the hair starts to grow back.</li>
            <li> but my hair being detangled after a few weeks is much more painful.  </li>
            <li> But sooner than expected (less than one year?)</li>
            <li> And my underarm hair grows so fast I have to shave everyday, and even still it leaves behind a shadow.  </li>
            <li> Out of all those options the most hated is shaving, somehow I always end up nicking myself or dealing with constant in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> After starting on level 1, I quickly decided to switch to level 2, and found it to be less painful.  </li>
            <li> Either way, it was fast enough for me to be chicken before trying it.</li>
            <li> If you want less pain, go little by little, back and forth, inch by inch.  </li>
            <li> I would describe the feeling as an unpleasant nettling sensation that occasionally veers into the territory of bee sting-painful in sensitive areas like the inner thighs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white female with dark hair and some of hair is thin and it gets all of it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using disposable razors but I am sick of buying more razors every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I previously had a small epilator that ran on batteries and wanted a bigger one that was also rechargeable or could be plugged in.  </li>
            <li> , one of them mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush, which is a small shortcoming, but I had a brush from my previous epilator that I&#x27;m using now with this one, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> It does the job with much less pinching than some other models, and is quieter than some other models.</li>
            <li> It took me a very long time to really do my body after a very painful experience doing just one leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be worth it though, since it has the benefits of waxing (slow to grow back in, less hair over time), without the mess and ongoing expense.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been spending a fortune on waxing and this does an even better, less painful job in less time at home.  </li>
            <li> but I thought it would be a little quiter than expected.</li>
            <li> Stings a little bit, but not a real problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do use it in an empty bathtub or over a towel, because you will shed lots of little hairs.</li>
            <li> I have really dark and thick Asian underarm hairs and find it so tiring to pluck every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised with all the reviews that say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s painful to use this particular epilator&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Also the input for the adapter is 110-250V which works also in Europe or other places, not like my previous one.</li>
            <li> I actually tried to push it hard against my skin to test if it will hurt or get a bit of my skin</li>
            <li> It works ok I&#x27;m not excited by outcome or hugely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to this I need money back</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because I purchased this product hoping to remove the hairs in my more &amp;#34;private region&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t keep the epilator at a hard 90 degrees, I either pressed too hard or not hard enough, and I made it hard on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The epilator area is a little small, I wish it were bigger.</li>
            <li> I have very dark, very thick underarm hair, that is emphasized by my white as white can get skin.  </li>
            <li> It hurt really bad the first time as this was my first epilator even though I&#x27;ve been waxing my armpits previous to using the epilator and my armpit hair was fairly thin (due to the waxing).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this isnt a bad intro to epilators esp the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> first I thought it would hurt like something out of this world to use an epilator, but it wasn’t too bad actually!</li>
            <li> , accurate but painful device....</li>
            <li> As a devotee of waxing, I expect that this too will become less painful over time, and if you can delude yourself into pretending that you are just using an electric razor, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator &amp; I was shocked by how efficient this was, especially since it&#x27;s one of the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> That said, epilators are pretty painful - especially over bony areas.</li>
            <li> So I moved up to the quintessential delicate area of the upper lip.</li>
            <li> now it is uncomfortable the first few times you use it.</li>
            <li> I have dark course hair and need to shave my legs every day.</li>
            <li> Takes at least 3 xs longer for hair to grow back though.</li>
            <li> I have dark course hair and sometimes two growing from one follicle.</li>
            <li> not useful ,</li>
            <li> If you have waxed in the past it is more painful than waxing.  </li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> It is very efficient at removing hair and not as expensive as some.  </li>
            <li> Many things that people find painful I usually don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Use your imagination, it&#x27;s not a fun time.</li>
            <li> The only thing that sucks is it has to stay plugged in at all times.</li>
            <li> that was my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> at least they gave me my money back</li>
            <li> When I returned it with this complaint I was just sent the very same product.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty painful rash area that&#x27;s been red for about five hours now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely not worth it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I have probably an average tolerance for pain...</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> but I have dark hair on my legs and even after shaving, if I&#x27;m &amp;#34;winter white&amp;#34; when you can see them under the shin.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator because it seems that this one gives you the least pain (according to numerous reviews).</li>
            <li> so not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and I have dark underarms.</li>
            <li> I would actually really like it except there are still random hairs on my legs</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here is my verdict: the result is not worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> continue to use it on my legs only as a &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; to shaving, so that it removes at least some hair</li>
            <li> Did not pull any hairs out, I had to use over and over with no success.</li>
            <li> I looked epilators up for quite a while before settling on this one and was convinced this would be the way i could remove my pesky dark underarm hairs</li>
            <li> - it sucks at &amp;#34;epilating&amp;#34; despite following the directions and whatnot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no worth to buy.that&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is  that it needs to be rolled really slow on the leg.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator, because my old one (Remington) got the power plug broken</li>
            <li> again.the discomfort becomes minimal after a few uses.</li>
            <li> rips yur skin to bits not safe, not sure why mom wanted it, she complained, she still wants the nono</li>
            <li> I still run it slowly over my legs multiple times and then grab my razor.</li>
            <li> if you have really thin and soft hair, I think it breaks them a lot.</li>
            <li> It plucks but also just &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; so some of the hairs still grow back thick.</li>
            <li> I have coarse thick hair</li>
            <li> While I LOVED the results, it was tedious, messy, and awkward.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin, so any form of hair removal comes with ingrown hairs, bumps, burns, or worse.</li>
            <li> As soon as you touch the machine to the skin it pinches and annoying, however as  you keep it on , it becomes more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the areas I regularly epilate seem to have slowly lost some hair, and the hair that remains is finer and lighter.  </li>
            <li> Give it a few tries before giving up.    </li>
            <li> you try to use it in places with thick coarse hair, expect some pain and some bleeding.  </li>
            <li> BUT you have to stick with it or it will come back just as thick.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive areas hurt even worse.</li>
            <li> with a device that is heavy or awkward.)&lt;br /&gt;- Minimal Pain</li>
            <li> Works if your hair is soft and thin</li>
            <li> flaws were more annoying that I anticipated:</li>
            <li> +Hold the epilator in one hand and hold the skin tight in the other.  </li>
            <li> Works really well but very painful at first</li>
            <li> Surprisingly less painful on the scrotum then above the hot</li>
            <li> Epilating keeps me hairless for at least a week and a half and not only that</li>
            <li> but since that one time all I have to do is go over it all once every two and a half weeks (takes maybe 10 minutes) and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all anymore because it&#x27;s growing back so slow</li>
            <li> the re-growth of the hair down over time&lt;</li>
            <li> Hoping that my deceased relatives weren’t somehow witnessing this from Heaven - I laid down in the bath tub, took a swig of whiskey, kissed my rosary beads, bit down on a piece of leather, and went for it.</li>
            <li> As of now it turns off and on when i hold it facing down.  </li>
            <li> down to about level with the beginning of the crease for labia and genitals.</li>
            <li> one of them breaks down</li>
            <li> Besides my Remington could be used w/wo cord, so that was convenient when it&#x27;s battery started dying down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll break down the pros and cons:  </li>
            <li> I went online instead and thought to purchase one to replace it since the prices had come down some.  </li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind is that waxing and ALL of these hair-pluckers say you should trim your hairs way down to 1/8\\&quot; or so before using it.</li>
            <li> the Braun beats the Phillips hands down.</li>
            <li> When that device started wearing down (as i hear epilators tend to do)</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s get down to the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it down south yet.</li>
            <li> Be careful!!</li>
            <li> but you get used to it- just like every other aspect of grooming!</li>
            <li> i mean, this is the only epilator i&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> For me, if just felt as if someone was dragging a comb with sharp teeth across my skin (not to the point of pain, just a little irritation.</li>
            <li> (I mean, I still can&#x27;t shave my legs without nicking the back of my ankle or my knee).  </li>
            <li> I have the European version (Norellco) and love it, but I&#x27;m very disappointed in this Philips one.</li>
            <li> Worse, the &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; (with the turning/rolling parts) comes off very easily and this morning one of the tiny prongs that holds the cap onto the base broke so now</li>
            <li> I use to hate shaving, due to the fact that my hair would grow right back in no time.</li>
            <li> I dint feel much pain while epilating as I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> People talked about it hurting less than other devices, but HOLY HANNAH, from a first-time user standpoint, IT HURTS!</li>
            <li> I originally got this epilator just for my bikini line because I get bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> so if you can make it through the first round it wont be nearly as bad the next time!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine had an electric shaver (many years ago) and I used to see how awful and dark her armpits used to be, and I always thought it was the same thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that hard to do once you do it a few times, and if you have to go 4-7 times over it, what&#x27;s the big deal?</li>
            <li> Still, not a major complaint.</li>
            <li> I was scared it would really hurt because of the reviews, but it actually wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> the less I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Took 4 hours to finish both legs, and it just ripped half of the hairs instead of pulling them from the root.</li>
            <li> Emagine Epilator for Men, Black]]  </li>
            <li> After epilating/waxing for years, the hair grows thinner, finer, and less dense and therefore hurts less as time goes on.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s less of a concern to me.</li>
            <li> In time, you get used to the slight pain during the hair removal</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even finish half of one leg.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ll need to replace it soon though because it works less and less every time.</li>
            <li> In the time it would have taken me to shave from ankle to hip, I removed half of the hair off one half of one leg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read somewhere that the least painful time to do it is just after your period, when you body has more tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> The pain is so much less and the irritation is much less as well.</li>
            <li> my previous conair.  </li>
            <li> On close inspection, I realised it missed maybe half the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is quieter than my previous one.</li>
            <li> In less than a half hour, I&#x27;ve done both my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> I read it hurts less than waxing.</li>
            <li> review is based on using it less than a handful of time</li>
            <li> And take an aspirin before the shower so it hurts less.</li>
            <li> so you have to use it less though the hair doesnt grow in lighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and eventually the hair is less and less.</li>
            <li> : Try it on the back of your hand or on the surface of no hair to test it in case you are afraid to directly use it on skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim less than 48 hours ago after reading an article.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend as much time and money on waxing, and for people who are afraid of getting the rough stubble from shaving.  </li>
            <li> It hurts less.</li>
            <li> It does the jobs half the time.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less and finer.</li>
            <li> I do feel like I have less and less hairs over time.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for a while, but after owning it for less than 4 months, the connection to the power cord has become faulty.</li>
            <li> Previously I tried using my frieds one of these of another brand</li>
            <li> so I gave it another try and with less dense hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my previous one for 13 years and forgot it on our vacation.</li>
            <li> I have black, somewhat coarse/heavy leg hair.</li>
            <li> black, course hair.</li>
            <li> the price just fluctuates unpredictably at times.</li>
            <li> With my previous epilators it took between 2 or 3 passes to remove hair from an area.  </li>
            <li> I used it once about a week and a half ago.</li>
            <li> Yes it hurts but less than laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> even with the less hair growth.</li>
            <li> you can see that less hair is growing.</li>
            <li> If you are a shaver, it will hurt, but be patient, with time you will learn to tolerate it and it will hurt less because the hair will grow weaker and weaker.</li>
            <li> so there was less to rip out.</li>
            <li> Shaving takes care of hair for maybe a day and a half.</li>
            <li> It went from a bear skin rug to a slightly balding bear skin rug...</li>
            <li> I feel like it hurt less than waxing</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it starts hurting less and less</li>
            <li> As I said, this product has led to less skin irritation, saved me money, and is still working after a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> half and hour</li>
            <li> the less it hurts.  </li>
            <li> just so I can shave less.</li>
            <li> When I had purchased this item, I had hoped 1) it would work well, and 2) that it would hurt less than Nair or wax treatments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than my previous epilators were (by nearly half the price)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for about half an hour, I decided to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my wife&#x27;s Braun, I would slightly bleed at times, but this one there was no blood.  </li>
            <li> less pain felt.</li>
            <li> Keeping up with it is a lot less excruciating, but it is going well.</li>
            <li> black and from the Caribbean</li>
            <li> this one has a chord but it does not work nearly half as well.....</li>
            <li> though I have a wax warmer, I don&#x27;t see myself waxing since this tool is a lot quicker and less time-consuming.</li>
            <li> With this, it hurts for a longer time and it doesn&#x27;t work half as well.</li>
            <li> While it may seem slightly thinner/lighter hair growth in the areas</li>
            <li> holy cow it hurts!</li>
            <li> The product gets no points deducted for that, I just wanted to mention it because I was expecting it to hurt less.  </li>
            <li> the less it hurts.  </li>
            <li> The most painful was the bikini area because I have thick hair there</li>
            <li> I had the epilator on setting number 2 and it hurt me less than setting number 1, which is slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the less it hurts.</li>
            <li> Now my hair grow in finer and less than before.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to replace a previous one from another brand.  </li>
            <li> it hurts less.</li>
            <li> After two years and a half I noticed a brown spot in the plastic disks in the head.  </li>
            <li> It hurt much LESS.</li>
            <li> It did not work well at all and actually hurt to use because it pulled the hair out (and not very good at that!)</li>
            <li> I have been a home wax enthusiast for years and was looking for a less set up, less sticky mess way to deal with my body hair.  </li>
            <li> less mess and lower cost.</li>
            <li> but it does give lasting results that make the little annoying things be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -it becomes less painful, in fact it&#x27;s not painful at all anymore.</li>
            <li> less well you pull the skin tight.  </li>
            <li> The efficiency cap really makes a difference in pain level and the curves like knees and bikini line, but it still leaves behind a few hairs in the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> , hair grows sideways under skin, not worth the trouble, do not buy if you don&#x27;t want to tweeze ingrown hairs for hours</li>
            <li> Although I felt like a plucked chicken the first time I used it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore--</li>
            <li> Was afraid of at first</li>
            <li> The first 2-4 times hurt like crazy.</li>
            <li> after trying a few different things I&#x27;m pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> It gave me crazy ingrowns the first time.</li>
            <li> bought this brand specifically because the product description said it was &amp;#34;ideal for delicate skin&amp;#34; but that is clearly not the case.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to endure the mess of wax or razor rash.  </li>
            <li> I gave it three tries and could take no more.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it at first</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait till my leg hair grow that long cause they are thick and dark.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> brings down parlour visits for hair removal to minimal !!!</li>
            <li> I bled a little when using, also I noticed if you rub the areas with a alcohol on a rag, then epilate while it&#x27;s kinda tingly, it hurts less.</li>
            <li> Bought this a little less than 8 months ago, and sang its praises until yesterday when it started to cut out on me.</li>
            <li> It costs less than getting your legs waxed and it does the job just as well with a little practice.  </li>
            <li> but, after you use regulary it becomes less paintfull, its doesnt take the little hairs</li>
            <li> For my experience, it is not so painful mainly because of the smaller number of tweezers.</li>
            <li> And after using it s few times, it hurts less and less each time.</li>
            <li> strength has irritated my leg skin quite a few times and I&#x27;ve used it less than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li> It had trouble picking up the hairs even as pressed down onto my skin and ran over the area 4-5 times.</li>
            <li> but it works well for the sides if you pull your skin tight and use the protector.</li>
            <li> your lips kinda feel all tight like your spider hole...</li>
            <li> There was a learning curve to using this product, holding the skin tight, and figuring out the angle to glide over my leg.  </li>
            <li> so far:&lt;br /&gt;I was a little afraid at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little too chicken to use it on the downstairs, I fear it will hurt too much!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that my leg hairs were less dense than usual, due to the intermittent at-home waxing,</li>
            <li> , I mean do you realize how long your hair is under the surface of your skin?</li>
            <li> I have been waxing since as long as I can remember and lately have been sick of it, someone recomended me to try epilator and ordered this one ( since its the cheapest ) as quickly as I could.</li>
            <li> But, I think the results will be worth it, since it seems to get less painful over time (I&#x27;ve had it less than a week and used it on my legs three times already, since I couldn&#x27;t deal with the pain of doing it all at once)</li>
            <li> it is super painful</li>
            <li> Too pain,and not clean</li>
            <li> : It depends on the areas you want to epilate but whether its the arms, legs, underarms or back, they all have one thing in common the hair will not magically put it self in neat pile.</li>
            <li> I have very thick black hair and did little patches at a time until I thinned my hair out enough to tolerate it.  </li>
            <li> The noise is loud and it&#x27;s quite scary at first but after the initial scare, it&#x27;s really not that bad!</li>
            <li> the only think bad is it seems not to get ALL the hair, but it still works and last long</li>
            <li> it just felt like a little pinch.</li>
            <li> Some of the bumps had little pustules on them as if infected.  </li>
            <li> It feels like little metal things &amp;#34;hitting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Epilating is not fun!</li>
            <li> Just do a little at a time to begin with.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over two months now and have used it about 4x since I got it.</li>
            <li> Thus, the little blood.  </li>
            <li> Basically, we&#x27;re talking a bunch of little tweezers plucking at once to remove hair from you body.  </li>
            <li> This machine maybe little bit it works just as well as any fancy-shamancy</li>
            <li> I had the little purple \\&quot;efficiency\\&quot; head on it.</li>
            <li> For as inexpensive as this little number is I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> It hurts a little because it seemingly removes the hair by the roots.  </li>
            <li> its wired, a little bit uneasy.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> but I have these pesky little hairs that pop up and drive me nuts.</li>
            <li> Of course there is a little bit of discomfort</li>
            <li> It hurts a little bit, but if you&#x27;re used to waxing, this won&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> It still stings a little</li>
            <li> Not severely, just little dots of blood.</li>
            <li> and I think I cried a little</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> I used this little beauty on my face and couldn&#x27;t believe the smoothness of the skin immediately afterwards.</li>
            <li> However, if you cannot deal with a little pain, I would suggest to stay away-</li>
            <li> It stings like little rubber bands popping your skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to just do little parts of my legs at a time while I get used to the feeling...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t hurt its just a little sting that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> if u can&#x27;t take a little sting</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, little, powerhouse.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to bleed a little too, so I would advise to use with caution</li>
            <li> Picture is a little deceiving.</li>
            <li> This is the most painful form of hair removal ever!</li>
            <li> This is the most painful thing ever!  </li>
            <li> I was a little scared to try this because I thought it would hurt like h-e-double hockey sticks.  </li>
            <li> Hey it&#x27;s gonna give u a little pain - no pain no gain.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my legs and it works....feels like little bees stinging...</li>
            <li> this little bastard has changed my life</li>
            <li> It works, but I have to say, if you&#x27;ve got thick hairs with deep roots like me, it is quite painful the first time.</li>
            <li> It didnt hurt at all on my arms just a little tingling  </li>
            <li> For little jobs of hair around the chin area where you don&#x27;t want to wax.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little hesitant to make another hair remover purchase.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m a little nervous about the safety features of this unit.</li>
            <li> At least not more painful than you doing it manually, but for sure it&#x27;s way faster.</li>
            <li> Now on use two I already feel little to no pain.</li>
            <li> I did this little by little, just like one eats soup:</li>
            <li> like i thought it would, and in the little spots it did work</li>
            <li> and she did her legs and underarms with no problems in a little over an hour.  </li>
            <li> And the device did pull my skin a little</li>
            <li> It hurts a little-</li>
            <li> And it is a little bit noisily.</li>
            <li> This pinches a little</li>
            <li> There was allot of pain with little result.</li>
            <li> It does hurt a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noise, but does the job.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little adjusting to the pain, but eventually your legs get used to it.  </li>
            <li> ; that way you can get a little closer to the skin.</li>
            <li> It took just about 10 minutes per leg and anihileted all the little hairs (peach fuzz) as well.</li>
            <li> I am really pale with black leg hair</li>
            <li> leg hair is jet black and my skin is pale.</li>
            <li> If you are the one who have thick body hairs and don&#x27;t come off easily, this is painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little painful at first, but i got some numbing cream at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, and it helped alot!</li>
            <li> it seemed to more or less cut the hairs very painfully...</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my other very expensive epilator by emjoi which only lasted a year or two until recently</li>
            <li> I got used to it a little after a few times but it made my face break out.</li>
            <li> I ran out of this for a few days and noticed a little irritation.</li>
            <li> It hurts, but it will enchant you for a short while because you want to feel tough.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re tough enough to use it on their bikini line, but neither of us are tough enough for the armpits yet.</li>
            <li> I have very average hairs on my legs and thicker hairs on my armpits and pubic area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little painful but only on areas that are sensitive.</li>
            <li> For a very long time i was trying to find a simple epilator, that wouldn&#x27;t have all those ridiculously over-priced and absolutely unnecessary and useless in my opinion gadgets and features, such as wet epilating, ice attachments, lights, dual blades, and so on and so forth.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, only it sometimes will not work if the chord is bent or twisted.</li>
            <li> I only use it on my legs since it&#x27;s far to painful to attempt on my underarms or bikini area.</li>
            <li> It is terribly painful, and it only breaks hair rather than clear it.</li>
            <li> The one painful time has been SO worth it..</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product so I could remove hair that I didn&#x27;t want, and I was tired of shaving and wasting money on razors all the time.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;stubs\\&quot; and \\&quot;prickles\\&quot; on the skin after a few days</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on my husband again in a few months.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my back and tummy where there is thin hair</li>
            <li> it broke after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> After trying it for nearly a month, my legs looked worse than ever and left me with lots of ingrown hair (sorry for TMI).</li>
            <li> After a few passes with this thing and you will be hairless and might be crying in a corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it also broke after a few months.  </li>
            <li> impatient, so I used it the day I got it rather than doing any prep work--</li>
            <li> I was punching the wall, clapping my hands, yelling, and stomping my feet every time the epilator hit a heavy patch of hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe after a few sessions, things will feel smoother?</li>
            <li> (now I let my hair grow a few days for this) and</li>
            <li> Kinda like a tattoo after a few minutes your body kinda just gets used to the pain.</li>
            <li> Even on the days I shaved, within a few hours I had stubble.</li>
            <li> After giving up because of the pain, I decided to get this baby out again for another round.</li>
            <li> so I recommend going over your legs again in a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator as something to help me deal with some embarrassing, heavy hair on my face.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and i thought this would be my saving grace, instead i wasted $30 on a piece of trash.</li>
            <li> I exfoliated my legs every day and tried again after a few weeks but it still gave me stubbly legs.</li>
            <li> that I had missed a few.</li>
            <li> you need to, shave some parts of your legs, wait a few days and then epilate.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t follow the directions and exfoliate my skin, a few days before using it.  </li>
            <li> and I go over it a few times.</li>
            <li> , I was shaving twice/day and within a few hrs I had cactus legs.  </li>
            <li> you may see hairs still within a few days</li>
            <li> I would have to go through it a few times.</li>
            <li> but I totally do not enjoy using it</li>
            <li> If that happens, and you don&#x27;t want to go to a doctor to have it lanced, apply Apple Cider Vinegar to a cotton round and leave it on there.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather pay $100 dollars for something I use rather than waste $27 for something I probably will not and cannot use again.</li>
            <li> just a few minutes</li>
            <li> it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Does the trick but if you have a lot of hair in one spot you will need to go over a few time which stings like a mother</li>
            <li> She even completely dried the skin and exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product as directed by the manufactures instructions...</li>
            <li> It does take a few passes to get all of the hair.</li>
            <li> Messy, hair ends up everywear as it pulls the hair</li>
            <li> I need to go back and get those broken hairs...  </li>
            <li> Also, exfoliate everyday-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not going to buy this product again, waste of money.</li>
            <li> I kept looking for a few months</li>
            <li> I can go a few weeks at a time without needing to use it again, and that&#x27;s even for the thicker hair (ie groin and pits area).</li>
            <li> It will turn red for a bit from irritating your skin with the pulling</li>
            <li> She had bought a few that were shavers and Epilator</li>
            <li> You get used to it after going over your leg a few times.  </li>
            <li> I did as the instructions suggested and exfoliated for a few days before.</li>
            <li> Used a few times and then it broke.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a few ingrown hairs on my legs</li>
            <li> and I saw a few stars</li>
            <li> every few min</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy this because I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this item for a few months now and have never had to use a razor or wax again.</li>
            <li> It works well for thin hair and for short hair.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to use it everyday rather than</li>
            <li> Also noticed a lot of red bumps where thicker hairs were removed, or just pulled on, and broken instead of being removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that its bag is missing on the box.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> but it pulled out so few hairs.i returned it.</li>
            <li> and it broke within a few uses.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> However, I can not use it on my pits or bikini line without crying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the epilator a few times now.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over each area a few times for maximum effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have used this a few times now</li>
            <li> There is a few hair breaks during but nothing another servicing couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> There are few errant hairs remaining</li>
            <li> $30 wasted on a gift to the wife that is now a brick discharging in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> but after using it for a few weeks I don&#x27;t feel any pain at all.</li>
            <li> It works well on legs and gets all the hairs after a few times going over the areas.  </li>
            <li> That soon subsided and I had no residual pain or discomfort after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Both the items are missing from the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> but you have to force yourself to go over it a few times until it gets pulled out</li>
            <li> A few seconds into it,</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of hers which include the Braun and an Emjoi...</li>
            <li> I have had the product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I had a few at the beginning, which I plucked with some tweezers, problem never happened again.</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t of wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and sensitive skin, this is the only thing I have found that gets rid of those disgusting chin hairs completely without breaking me out.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I have to epilate a bit every day for a few days until I&#x27;ve pulled all of them out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dead, it won&#x27;t turn on regardless if it is plugged in or not.</li>
            <li> I can see how it would take a few times to get all the hairs as some do break and the machine does not get the shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> and I am going to try again on the hairs it missed in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of shaving daily and couldn&#x27;t afford waxing.</li>
            <li> (It took several passes to remove coarser hair.)&lt;br /&gt;- Broken Hairs (Some of the hairs were broken and not removed from the root at all, especially when using on areas with&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer use veet hair removing cream because it&#x27;s so messy.</li>
            <li> It’s been a few months since I bought it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wax anymore because it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> However, after epilating a few times it doesn&#x27;t hurt all.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter a few times and it did not work.  </li>
            <li> My legs are not nearly as smooth as waxing or shaving.  </li>
            <li> I forged ahead, and became immune to the pain after a few swipes on my leg.  </li>
            <li> This epilator works BUT it leaves behind hair and u have to keep going back</li>
            <li> Maybe a few centimeters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To harsh for my wife.</li>
            <li> Does what it should but am not brave enough to use for all those undesired hairs</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner but the packaging was missing the cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts but it hasn&#x27;t broken off any hairs which could cause ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I had for years a Braun epilady, but died two month ago, I seached for few weeks reading reviews</li>
            <li> It does skip a few hairs</li>
            <li> How messy will it get?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning to do your arms and legs, I suggest you epilate in the bathtub because it will get messy.</li>
            <li> That is really the only place I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge problem, just a pain and a hassle</li>
            <li> The product description was not accurate.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a high pain tolerance, but it was much less painful than I expected.</li>
            <li> When I say rough, I mean the blades leave your skin feeling sandy.  </li>
            <li> In less than 6 months, it longer works!</li>
            <li> no time and will hatt much less!</li>
            <li> I do keep a pack of razors on hand for emergencies when I just don&#x27;t have time to epilate, but I&#x27;ve used one pack in the past year and a half.    </li>
            <li> If you have waxed in the past it will also hurt less.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I have subjected myself to typical methods of hair removal i.e. (cream depilatories, waxing, and of course shaving).</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this, so I thought why not, I&#x27;ll give it a chance if it means less shaving!</li>
            <li> I will admit, that the first time you use it, it is a little painful.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all dark and stupid looking and no matter how much you drag a razor over it, it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> Its much easier and not as expensive as you might think!</li>
            <li> if anyone trying for the first time its little bit painful but bearable.</li>
            <li> She did say that it was a little painful at first but got used to it.</li>
            <li> No more mess at home with the wax and saving money from going to the salon.  </li>
            <li> It works but yes it is a little painful at first until you get use to it.  </li>
            <li> Although the first time I used it, it was a little bit painful but don&#x27;t let that stop you as I can&#x27;t pain as well as others.</li>
            <li> It is a bit painful; however, the more you use it, the less painful it becomes and the results last for a while.</li>
            <li> just plain doesn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of hair growing up again is changed, I mean that the hair which grow again are less thicker and less dense hair growth is seen.</li>
            <li> I got one a few months ago - not very effective</li>
            <li> It is a bit painful at first and take a few times to get used to it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this epilator is not good at grabbing all the hairs.</li>
            <li> but I find it difficult to think about using it again waxing is just better faster and less painful.</li>
            <li> The plucked hairs were very difficult to target and the cut hairs simply grew back.</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t mean shave every day, but if you know your going to get down and dirty, epilate a day or two before, and then shave the day before or on the day (if you really wanted to).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it very painful, maybe because I&#x27;m used to waxing which is more painful, messier, and more expensive.</li>
            <li> It does work less painfully than the others and seems to be somewhat &amp;#34;closer&amp;#34; and much faster .</li>
            <li> I started on a leg because I thought it would be less painful there even though I really bought it for my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> but it does make the whole process less painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the more expensive ones would be any less painful, but you are pulling your hair out</li>
            <li> First time using it, it hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> For me it seems to hurt pretty bad</li>
            <li> :I tried to do it without waxing first, as I have been a shaver for years- bad idea.</li>
            <li> for the pain, that will probably be pretty bad for people who have never had their legs waxed or used an epilator before.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it hurt… but not as bad as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the first time either; I treated it with aloe gel.</li>
            <li> It stings at first, but after a couple minutes its not quite as bad.</li>
            <li> It really, really is unpleasant if you just use this straight from shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty painful</li>
            <li> Painful during first session since I&#x27;ve never epilated before</li>
            <li> Painful at first but after doing 1/2 a leg, you get use to the pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was painful at the first time</li>
            <li> Cons: it is fairly painful when you first start uses.</li>
            <li> Horribly painful the first time.</li>
            <li> but I will admit that at first it was a bit painful.</li>
            <li> Painful at first</li>
            <li> It is painful the first two times you use it</li>
            <li> back!Yes, its quite painful at first.</li>
            <li> Get through the first painful uses</li>
            <li> Yes at first it is a bit painful on legs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful at first, but you eventually you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be pretty painful.</li>
            <li> It feels like getting shocked and the armpits where the most painful for me personally.  </li>
            <li> I will not lie, it is painful at first, but over time it becomes easier to tolerate.  </li>
            <li> Using this epilator is a bit painful; when I used it for the first time it felt like my legs were on fire for a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Its my first time using an epilator and was painful at the beginning</li>
            <li> This was my first epliator and it was PAINFUL</li>
            <li> Start with a small patch of hair, if you like it continue, if not stop and give yourself a few minute break and start again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely none!&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY skeptical of even trying this.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and wanted a solution to shaving because I have dark stubble within 24hrs of each shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a woman with dark, thick leg hairs is quite embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I am mostly disappointed by it lasting only a month and a half before just not turning on at all.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product, I was a little disappointed because it seemed to break the hair off at skin-level.  </li>
            <li> It hurt terribly the first time and the pain has only lessened slightly.</li>
            <li> It hurt terribly the first time and the pain has only lessened slightly.</li>
            <li> A little painful but no worse than waxing.</li>
            <li> I ended up with a raw chin with the whiskers still there.  </li>
            <li> After awhile the area I was working on would became numb but as soon as I moved to a new area the pain process started all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My shower is cramped, and the rest of the bathroom is very tight.</li>
            <li> My shower is cramped, and the rest of the bathroom is very tight.</li>
            <li> but it definitely brought back the painful relationship I had with my vintage Epilady.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more uncomfortable than actually painful, in my opinion.    </li>
            <li> I had to wait at least a week and a half before I could get all the ingrowns out.</li>
            <li> It was a quick annoying prickly pain.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product over tattoos a little bit of ink seemed like it faded after I used the epilator!</li>
            <li> It gave me the worst ingrown hairs I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life but regular exfoliation as well as using an alpha hydroxy lotion every day durikng the first few months solved the issue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was my first epilator, and I used it only on my chest, and it proved to be extremely painful.</li>
            <li> Unless its already noticeably long like that weird guy with the mole hair who works at the Chinese buffet in town here for some poorly thought out reason.  </li>
            <li> it has to be plugged into an outlet and it doesn&#x27;t come with a little brush so its hard to get the hair out of the head.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it is still painful in some areas, and takes a while to get it done on a large area like legs, but any epilator would.</li>
            <li> After reading negative reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have waxed them before, but thought this would take care of that problem, at least a little.</li>
            <li> The hair grow slower and the epilation process is way faster and with very little pain.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever tried to pluck your stash, just imagine that feeling one very little hair...</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions you will have very little discomfort.</li>
            <li> I took very little time to get the hang of and works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Cord breaks/stops powering device in a matter of months despite very little use.</li>
            <li> It says to only use on completely dry skin, but it doesn&#x27;t mention you&#x27;ll sweat to profusely that it&#x27;s completely impossible.</li>
            <li> Because of my bad experience with the emjoi brand, I decided to try a much cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t as painful as everybody said it was.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a bit painful on areas that had longer hair (my arms), but not too much discomfort on my legs.  </li>
            <li> but it was way to painful for me to really find out.</li>
            <li> Although painful, the results are very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> It is painful, but not that much.</li>
            <li> It is small and compact.  </li>
            <li> That seems a bit shady :-/</li>
            <li> (no more shaving)&lt;br /&gt;-Slows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing if you have never pulled your hair from the root in the past, you will feel it.  </li>
            <li> no more shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> Not sure how everyone is saying this doesn&#x27;t hurt...</li>
            <li> Not sure what it did except remind me to keep the angle close to 90 degrees.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the hair is being cut off instead of pulled, but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> and it was pointless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lasered my legs but still get some occasional random hairs</li>
            <li> Do not press it into your skin - Work in small circles moving the epilator in a circular motion</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed at the brevity of the encounter, so I promptly moved on to my armpits.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s alright and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all because I store it in a small, zippered cosmetic bag/purse you can buy anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would try this again</li>
            <li> but no more so than waxing.</li>
            <li> I usually have to shave every day in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I hate seeing stubble after shaving and am willing to put up with the pain for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> to leave you&#x27;re hair small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> but when this one wears out ill definitely be upgrading</li>
            <li> This removed some hair but not most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various hair removal techniques in the past: shaving, waxing, bleaching (arm hair, when I was an insecure teenager), threading (eyebrows), etc.</li>
            <li> Continue shaving or waxing there like usual.</li>
            <li> I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it on your face, but I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> It is small.</li>
            <li> A bit small</li>
            <li> and I usually watch a tv show or something while I&#x27;m doing it.</li>
            <li> Im not really sure</li>
            <li> i usually shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Week on power to small of head</li>
            <li> It felt like small rubber bands hitting my face.</li>
            <li> I think the only really scary thing for me is turning this thing on.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get past the pain.</li>
            <li> It even gets the small hair.</li>
            <li> but then again I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it will do it then either.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a few days and used it again, it worked!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time!</li>
            <li> This epilator might me small</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pick out the really small hairs</li>
            <li> and I did notice at least a few breaking off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magic solution to never shaving again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an epilator before and had been told to take it in small sections.  </li>
            <li> It is small &amp; work well.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she&#x27;s owned two or three epilators in the past.</li>
            <li> This unit is small and portable.  </li>
            <li> I had to move it in small circular motions.</li>
            <li> This one replaced my small battery powered epilator.  </li>
            <li> Not awesome for unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> It was small and the cheapest one</li>
            <li> trick is to always go against the hair growth, so, usually on hands the epilator goes side-to-side, on thighs it goes diagnally.</li>
            <li> Nothing shady.</li>
            <li> so I am not really sure what to expect, this was one of the highest rated ones.</li>
            <li> But the connection between the cord and the epiliator has broken even after careful storage and use.  </li>
            <li> but sorry it only lasted a month.</li>
            <li> It fits well in my hand, and I have small hands.</li>
            <li> It can cause small cuts here and there.</li>
            <li> The price as also doubled in the past two months.     </li>
            <li> However one issue though is there is nowhere for the extracted hair to go aside from all over :-/</li>
            <li> worst thing i ever bought in my entire life, it caused me so much pain!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why this happened.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this product is even made.</li>
            <li> the directions specify, I exfoliate before I use this (though usually just a couple minutes before, not the couple days the instructions recommend).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Emjoi and Epilady epilators in the past and when my Emjoi died, I decided to try Philips HP6401</li>
            <li> I usually go to the wax salon</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the price since they are usually over $50.00.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not really satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Not cute.</li>
            <li> It was already midnight before I could bring myself to do it only to find myself feeling silly over nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very painful the first time, but that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> I found the process far less painful than nicking my legs with a razor.</li>
            <li> it gets far less painful</li>
            <li> For some reason it&#x27;s also less painful to use this epilator than my previous one from a different brand.</li>
            <li> : I didnt use it after shower, I used it minutes after I received the package cuz I am very impatient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful in the beginning, I have to be honest, but once you get used to it is not that bad.</li>
            <li> The pain factor is severely reduced from angry wasps to nothing more than some annoying skeeters that can&#x27;t quite bite you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say not very good</li>
            <li> a high pain tolerance- got a 5 hour tattoo that was about as painful, no joke.</li>
            <li> Only for legs and arms, very painful if you use in some sensitive area.</li>
            <li> Compared to other epilators I&#x27;ve seen, this one is simply okay--borderline bad.</li>
            <li> I usually wax and ingrowns are common here and</li>
            <li> At least not more me.</li>
            <li> am very ( :-( ) hairy for a woman.</li>
            <li> : I am a very heary girl :(</li>
            <li> My epilator was broken down, so I bought this one.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and dark on my legs and blond and thin on my arms and it works well on my arms and my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to get used to, at first, since it is painful.  </li>
            <li> The results were disastrous (no better than simply shaving), so I did a little homework and decided to try this device.</li>
            <li> Very painful it doesn&#x27;t take the hair  with the first pass you have to go over a few times  did not remove hair effectively&lt;</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was tired of the sticky mess that waxing always leaves me with.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s an alright product-It does the job, but could be less painful.</li>
            <li> I actually found using it on my chin to be less painful than using it on my legs.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I also noted how one of the reviewers mentioned that the procedure is less painful with this device, and now after a 1-month use, I can confirm it as well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much less painful the second time around.</li>
            <li> My knee didn&#x27;t care about the epilation at all, just the vibrations on my kneecap was hard, again for that reflexive spasm.</li>
            <li> so you hardly notice (</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s working because i can feel the pain of my hair being ripped out, unless it&#x27;s just pulling it really hard and tearing it.  </li>
            <li> Knees and creases are hard to work, you need to take your time.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever have to do my thighs now, maybe once every 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> for the efficacy, it&#x27;s hard to tell just from looking at my legs</li>
            <li> It was also hard to use around the knee.</li>
            <li> The legs are bearable, but I can hardly stand it on my underarms or bikini line.</li>
            <li> Did well on the courser hair of my bikini area and armpits, although the elasticity of the skin in those areas made this hard to use.</li>
            <li> it might be hard to reach hairs there too.  </li>
            <li> I work hard all the time pushing my body to the limit and don&#x27;t shed a tear when injured</li>
            <li> Now I hardly notice it.</li>
            <li> It hardly grabbed any hair.</li>
            <li> I just use that and a little aloe lotion when I&#x27;m done, and I haven&#x27;t broken out yet.  </li>
            <li> It was a little bit painful in the begining as I haven&#x27;t done it in a while, but after the 2nd minute it was a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Smoothness lasts at least 2-3 weeks&lt;</li>
            <li> It is probably different for others, but for me, it hurt like crazy.  </li>
            <li> its the awful chain-saw-like sound it makes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bang for buck, but in the end it still sucks for me.</li>
            <li> Has been working for 6 months at least.</li>
            <li> problem I have is that I got crazy red bumps for almost a week in any area</li>
            <li> After using it for at least three times, the hair is gone.  </li>
            <li> Designed for legs (at least that&#x27;s what it saids).</li>
            <li> it was scary to get used to (the noise is alarming).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be surprised that it&#x27;s painful-</li>
            <li> the most painful areas, in case, armpits and pubic area (even if it isn&#x27;t painful to you), you should try with powder.</li>
            <li> But at least I can use this hair removal device on every hair on my body,unlike the pricey,cordless one that burns the hair off.</li>
            <li> It does yank that sucker out all the way to the root</li>
            <li> At least for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using waxing strips for years because shaving sucks.</li>
            <li> Another common concern that I have heard of is ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> It sucks</li>
            <li> They just disappear and I have not had to worry about them for at least 10 days to two weeks after using it.  </li>
            <li> it say bye bye to those nasty underarms  and say hello to light n hairless Beaty</li>
            <li> It sucks.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved my legs in at least a month</li>
            <li> Not effective at hair removal.</li>
            <li> I had to shave the next day or my skin would break out and itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> Sucks amazon won&#x27;t let me returned it</li>
            <li> And you won&#x27;t have to shave for at least a week at a time.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re clumsy like me and accidentally cut your knees or ankles).  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how painful it was.</li>
            <li> I had one complaint</li>
            <li> That should just be common sense, but I know someone will try it.</li>
            <li> That should just be common sense, but I know someone will try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the hairs have to be at least around 4mm for this thing to pick them up.  </li>
            <li> Yanked all those suckers out by the root.</li>
            <li> I can go at least a week with nothing noticable.</li>
            <li> So to continue on, after an uncomfortable amount if stinging (not really pain)</li>
            <li> Waxing hurts, but at least after two seconds of pain you see immediate results.</li>
            <li> My lips went numb as well like I had that feeling of spider hole face where you can&#x27;t open your mouth and</li>
            <li> It leaves some small hairs behind, but not many.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to address all the negative comments.</li>
            <li> Not at all painful unless you are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I had to completely stop using it when I was shocked from turning it on.</li>
            <li> I just wanted people to know what to expect, at least based on my experiences.</li>
            <li> it is loud and it is painful, you soon get used to it though.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving because my hair grows too fast</li>
            <li> I put the epilator slowly on stray hairs just to see if it pulled out the hair or cut it (as some reviewers claimed).</li>
            <li> The epilator gets hung up on skin that is too thick or something like that and the plastic gears inside get stripped out.    </li>
            <li> It gets the hair off, but you have to go slow.</li>
            <li> for my thick leg hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too slow</li>
            <li> So, go slowly, one area at a time.</li>
            <li> It sat on my counter for about a month before I forced myself to try it.</li>
            <li> When shaving, you would need to go over slowly to get the hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt when the hair is not to Thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and when I use this the hair grows in softer and thinner.</li>
            <li> This is what I had done, and now I just have to epilate every day for 5-10 minutes to remove the hair that is slowly growing in.</li>
            <li> It works slowly, and it does hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have always had really thick hair on my legs and it has already thinned them out in 3 uses.</li>
            <li> It seems to break hair even when I go slow</li>
            <li> (Note: I did have ingrown hairs from the waxing, which I have been slowly working on.</li>
            <li> hate shaving; I was ready to shell out a lot of money on laser hair removal&lt;</li>
            <li> Because I was going so slow ittook me</li>
            <li> do they work on thick hair</li>
            <li> if you have thick hair</li>
            <li> Plus I follow up with a hair growth inhibitor lotion (I use Nisim Kalo or GiGi Slow Grow lotion).</li>
            <li> both my leg and bikini area don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little less painful than others and is compact but needs a cord wich is a down.</li>
            <li> It is very painful and the skin gets irritated with red dots lasting weeks to go away.</li>
            <li> yeah, the first 2 or 3 times was terrible, I actually got the cheapest epilator because after reading some reviews I was afraid I was going to try it and then dump it half way through.</li>
            <li> and all my hair, from the neck down, is gone!!!</li>
            <li> Today I noticed that I have some bumps, ingrown hairs already and not very happy about that.</li>
            <li> I have these annoying hairs growing on the front of my neck, back of neck, and shoulders, among other areas.  </li>
            <li> no more stubble ever!</li>
            <li> But i have been using it about 1 time a week for the past month!</li>
            <li> I have been using every week now and no more trips to the salon!</li>
            <li> I mean for the amount of pain this thing puts you through it</li>
            <li> I mean this hurts quite a bit</li>
            <li> Yes it does hurt, no matter where you use it (i mean, it is plucking hair out), its just a matter of getting used to.</li>
            <li> The first 3-4 days were uncomfortable (the 3rd being the worst)</li>
            <li> having hairs there is NOT SEXY!  </li>
            <li> This item is not safe!</li>
            <li> The epilator is about as painful or maybe slightly less painful than threading, and definitely more painful than any of the other methods I listed.</li>
            <li> It is quite painful and pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> At first, I was afraid of cutting myself but after I used it all the fear is gone.</li>
            <li> bought this mainly for my underarms because I really hate shaving them.</li>
            <li> and he even said it wasn&#x27;t hurting that bad, so maybe hair length is a major variable.</li>
            <li> so maybe i just hate epilating, but i only did half of one leg</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painful and barely removes hair.</li>
            <li> The only really unpleasant part of using this was when I went &amp;#34;down under&amp;#34; with it.</li>
            <li> It doesnot remove small and thin hair.</li>
            <li> The previous epilator died, and we got his as the replacement and she loves it !!!</li>
            <li> Any hair that isn&#x27;t extremely fine and thin is going to hurt terribly.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s very painful.</li>
            <li> It was very painful for me at first since I had never waxed or epilated before.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push the device against the skin too hard or your skin will be red and painful (learn from experience)</li>
            <li> Seriously, I still have the darn thing</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s like night and day.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> 40 day manufacturer return is ridiculous as well.</li>
            <li> While it is slightly painful in the beginning, after a few tries the hairs are a lot was easier to remove and its almost painless.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> is ridiculously priced.</li>
            <li> Seriously if you&#x27;re debating buying this, do it.</li>
            <li> The pain was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I hate to give it one star because it does as advertised, however, this is the most painful grooming device on the planet.</li>
            <li> But seriously?</li>
            <li> Ha, but seriously it did hurt.</li>
            <li> This was actually the least painful epilator I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a subtle difference from epilating in conjunction with the use of a glycolic peel on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I seriously used the epilator for an hour.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather do it myself than pay ridiculous amounts of money somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The shin was the worst part... holy cow that&#x27;s sensitive!</li>
            <li> After awhile, on my calves, I didn&#x27;t have to keep it taut because it wasn&#x27;t as painful (granted it took 3 or 4 tries, but it does hurt less!)</li>
            <li> It will take several passes and is very painful, but that is what I expected from an Epilator</li>
            <li> after a couple attempts to endure the pain, I conceded that shaving isn&#x27;t really all that bad!</li>
            <li> however the efficiency of this epilator is very poor compared to my previous philips epilator.</li>
            <li> I mean, it does because you&#x27;re pulling out hairs, but it&#x27;s at least manageable, tolerable pain!</li>
            <li> but it is a little difficult because of the size.</li>
            <li> I was a little gun shy with it and didn&#x27;t press as close as I SHOULD have</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little difficult to pull the skin taught.</li>
            <li> The process is even less painful than with my previous epilator</li>
            <li> But once you actually start using it, it&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds.</li>
            <li> It didnt hurt nearly as bad the second time, and barley hurts at all now after 4 times!</li>
            <li> This is bad, especially if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs and cysts.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that was just an assumption because it was stinging so bad, but my skin was so red and bumpy afterwards that I couldn&#x27;t help but</li>
            <li> So bad that even now not having used it for almost two months and daily exfoliation</li>
            <li> If you are a male with acne and bad hyper pigmentation (blemishes) and wonder why it&#x27;s not clearing up, your razor is the issue and you should switch to one of these.</li>
            <li> but after I retried it a couple minutes later it wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> There was a bad rash that lasted several days.</li>
            <li> This next time around it will not hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> If you move it quickly enough, the pain isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I epilated a second time, the pain wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> I suffer from really bad facial hair</li>
            <li> It was  extremely painful and I stilll had facial hair remaining.</li>
            <li> Painful but removes hair instantly!</li>
            <li> It does work well, but the only problem is painful,really painful...</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts but not as painful as the Braun.</li>
            <li> Completely useless and waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> somehow painful, but you will like it after that, use a lot of oil or cream when you shave your private area.</li>
            <li> the effect is not good.</li>
            <li> This thing is quite painful, but it definitely removes my leg hairs.</li>
            <li> but I bought it for facial use-VERY PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> I use to wax, but it gets messy and expensive.</li>
            <li> If I was militant about my legs (which I don&#x27;t have to be since I&#x27;ve stopped shaving, because the hair&#x27;s lighter, at least), I would use this every two-and-a-half to three weeks, approximately.  </li>
            <li> not good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning, though- bikini area works but extremely painful, same for underarms.</li>
            <li> Does it work, get easier/less painful with time, and last a while?  </li>
            <li> This is not a good alternative to shaving your face, as you will bleed from every follicle.</li>
            <li> and before you think me a horrible person, I only tired it on him because my husband threatened me with bodily harm if I got close to him with it</li>
            <li> I knew that it was going to be painful by reading multiple reviews</li>
            <li> and I have make several (sometimes painful) passes to remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> Not good</li>
            <li> This was not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i have thick and thin combo hair all over my body</li>
            <li> It is noisy and a little painful depending on your pain tolerance but not unbearable and in my opinion hurts less then if you nick yourself shaving.</li>
            <li> Much less painful then waxing, almost feels like a bunch of little tingles everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I get carried away and &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; other areas, too, and yes, it&#x27;s a little painful, but not any worse than waxing.  </li>
            <li> But, after a few times it does get less painful (or I just got used to it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those ladies who is \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with coarse leg hair, and truth be told, I&#x27;m really sick of it.  </li>
            <li> It is much less painful than my previous one!</li>
            <li> After seeing the less than desirable results of two very painful epilating sessions, I decided not to use this product a third time.</li>
            <li> I tried other methods of hair removal with disappointing results.  </li>
            <li> Granted, I&#x27;m doing small patches at a time because the hair there isn&#x27;t as dark as my calves (in some areas, anyway), but the pain isn&#x27;t as bad once you get used to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming that if you&#x27;re a person who has hair, you understand that yanking your hair out is not a pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> Hair removal is never pleasant.</li>
            <li> After trying epilators a few years back I had given up as they were very painful, ater trying this one</li>
            <li> I am not sure of usage, but so far its very painful for me, infact I didn&#x27;t feel much pain while wax, but this machine is horrible and can&#x27;t say if I am going to continue with this.</li>
            <li> After using this regularly for 5 months, it just stopped working :(.</li>
            <li> Yeah, sometimes I did get frustrated, but I just remembered the results I got and kept going, no matter how long it took me to finish.</li>
            <li> It stopped working properly :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now making a weird noise and not gripping hairs anymore, maybe because of all the impacts caused when the head falls off.</li>
            <li> (Dumb) I will just say OMG.  </li>
            <li> No more expensive waxing for my wife.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if my expectations were unrealistic, but it took me a million passes to get rid of all the hair in a small area in my leg while hurting all the time.</li>
            <li> When I finally turned it off, I was somewhat disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Remember to go slow!</li>
            <li> Only order if ur tough!!!</li>
            <li> It felt as if how you feel when you scratch dry skin--not painful perse, but kinda itchy and irritable).</li>
            <li> Since I am not new to epilators, I knew it would be slightly painful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near as painful on the face with epilating compared to threading!</li>
            <li> It was at least 10 times less painful than those waxing strips and did not leave a trace of a hair on my underarm.  </li>
            <li> Figuring out how to angle it to catch those tough stubborn hairs .</li>
            <li> If you can handle this thing, you&#x27;re one tough feller.</li>
            <li> It is very loud and for me, very painful, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator is very delicate.</li>
            <li> he has very thick hair</li>
            <li> Being a newbie, I started-out very slowly.  </li>
            <li> I dont have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I mean, by lunch time i&#x27;ve got a 5-oclock shadow!</li>
            <li> I mean, your ripping hair out of the root!</li>
            <li> Still, there have been some pinches of my wrinkled skin (if you know what I mean!)</li>
            <li> Like you mean it!  </li>
            <li> use it about ones every 2 or 3 weeks, no more razors for me!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with the product at all!!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and was having issues nicking myself with shaving, so, a little desperately, I tried this.</li>
            <li> friend told me about her epilator (Braun Silk 7681) and how the pain is really not that bad.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as painful as I expected.</li>
            <li> The process itself is extremely painful but that was expected.</li>
            <li> and it really is not too painful.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as painful as I expected.</li>
            <li> Worked well and was as painful as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> the only reason I haven&#x27;t gotten rid of it is because I hate the thought of wasting all that money.</li>
            <li> Like,  worse than a tattoo pain?  </li>
            <li> Yeaaaaa.......  Not the product for me,  but maybe for someone with really thin hair.</li>
            <li> However, for me this product has become almost worthless because I do not want red zit like bumps all over me for days</li>
            <li> on my thin hairs it seems to break some and pull some.</li>
            <li> I would plug it in and it would turn on and off as I used and got progressively worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of shaving and trying to lighten up the skin.</li>
            <li> The pain was way worse than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;However, once you get used to it, it won&#x27;t be a matter.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> and yes, it is frustrating, but the results are amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;+it&#x27;s approximately the size of a deck of cards&lt;</li>
            <li> Also, I was tired of the expense and the inconvenience of making salon appointments.  </li>
            <li> wife used it as directed and what ended up occurring is broken hair instead of the device pulling the hair out and also did not get</li>
            <li> My hairs are still thin</li>
            <li> (but worse) from this as well.</li>
            <li> I did notice some redness and broken hairs after I was done, but I chalk this up to my inexperience in using the device.  </li>
            <li> Using the epilator felt like being tickled and I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> I think I won&#x27;t use it again, it&#x27;s too frustrating.</li>
            <li> I decreased the rating from 5 starts to 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Nickle allergies are not uncommon, so it would help if Philips listed the \\&quot;Contains Nickle\\&quot; warning in the product description.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my wife got tired of me using her blades to shave my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will totally use this again because I like pain and hate hair.</li>
            <li> I am tired of shaving every couple of days and this was my solution.  </li>
            <li> so it may be worse if you have lots of hair.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> It does leave behind some baby hairs</li>
            <li> The clip that holds the head on was broken when I opened it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used worse.  </li>
            <li> not great.</li>
            <li> Beyond that, this thing does the job without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> i bought it for my aunt because she got tired of women razors</li>
            <li> I am not extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I used to give myself brazilian waxes, this hurt much worse.</li>
            <li> also caution that anyone with auto-immune disorders or poor circulation do not use their epilator.</li>
            <li> I do have rather thin hair, so</li>
            <li> they work on thin hair</li>
            <li> Dissapointed with the skin irritating head.</li>
            <li> I bought it again,because  I broken it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen broken hairs, just a lot of hair gone.  </li>
            <li> and I would say I&#x27;m addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Bought this epilator about two weeks ago to replace my recently broken emjoi emagine.</li>
            <li> but I do want this poor model.</li>
            <li> With that said, after a few minutes of using it, you get either used to or numb to the pain.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair in my legs and it removed all of them, including hair in my knee.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the hair was broken off rather than pulled at the root.</li>
            <li> and you can see the broken hair.</li>
            <li> Plus over time the hair starts to thin out.</li>
            <li> it works, not a great thing but works</li>
            <li> This, in my opinion, is frankly devious and borders on false advertising.  </li>
            <li> --it was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even go on and do my other leg.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to painful to be using every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading other reviews, I was a nervous about how painful this would be, because I&#x27;m a Grade A wimp.</li>
            <li> I read it could be used on the face and that is not true, very very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Seriously ouch!</li>
            <li> Seriously inflicts pain!</li>
            <li> and I was seriously scared of the pain!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Because my underarms stay dark even after shaving, I was hoping this would help, but it still hurts so bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I gave it two tries on my legs but was utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Personally, I hate shaving and waxing in the summertime is too long of a wait in between each wax.</li>
            <li> I hated it so badly this was my first ever Amazon return!</li>
            <li> The previous epilator I used was not as painful as this one.</li>
            <li> I thought everyone was just being dramatic but this thing hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> This helps with getting the hair by the root out and can be less painful than if you didn&#x27;t do this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less painful.</li>
            <li> BUT, it gets less painful with time.</li>
            <li> After continued use, you it will get easier and less painful.  </li>
            <li> I hope this becomes less painful over time.  </li>
            <li> I hear from others that it gets easier and less painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;#1, this is still a painful way of removing hair, less so than waxing</li>
            <li> and i hear it gets less painful.</li>
            <li> I figured it would be faster, therefore less painful...</li>
            <li> Legs are the least painful areas to epilate, at least for me, followed by underarms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them breaking other than my stupidity!</li>
            <li> I was definitely disappointed with the amount of hair removable - based on the other reviews, I thought it was going to remove everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this one, I&#x27;ve had other epilators before, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to want to harm hairs, or maybe it&#x27;s shortsighted</li>
            <li> Then I came across this little bad boy, Philips satinelle.</li>
            <li> , it is a little painful, but the results lasted a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a little painful</li>
            <li> To start with it is little painful.</li>
            <li> It was painful - like little pricks or stings - but bearable.</li>
            <li> It can be a little painful</li>
            <li> Decided to use it on my little hairs on my face...not bad...less painful than waxing.  </li>
            <li> I checked out a few youtube videos and Amazon reviews and some people had mentioned that it is extremely painful.</li>
            <li> I would literally have to shave everyday but would get bad razor burn</li>
            <li> Once you use it a few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> you want to know how painful it is take some tweezers and pull a few hairs from wherever you plan to use it.  </li>
            <li> I now have a painful finger and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was not worth it :(</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst thing I have ever bought in my life.</li>
            <li> There are two speed settings on this thing \\&quot;for thin hairs and difficult to reach</li>
            <li> I also would imagine that it would be very painful to use over entire areas of skin that were covered in hair.</li>
            <li> I do not use it often because it is too painful, not easy to get used to that pain.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that shaving is faster and easier and less chafing than this costly thing.  </li>
            <li> Not too bad, but definitely a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> this is a bad thing , I am totally shocked you would sell such a awful thing , very sorry I bought such a thing , if your advertising of the product  was true  , no one on earth would by it, worst thing ,ever bought in my life.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve become tired of all of the nasty mess caused by wax and the hassle of having to wait for my hair to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a little disappointed in how it seems to shear off some of my chin whiskers and not yank &#x27;em out, but then, it says it&#x27;s for legs anyway.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried my underarms or other areas yet (too afraid with how painful those would be) and I just started my thighs.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if its supposed to hurt as bad as this did.</li>
            <li> This is just as painful to use if not more.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes your skin becomes kinda numb and at that point your just focused on getting all the hairs!</li>
            <li> But I killed it :(  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> It was so painful that I never got past my ankle.  </li>
            <li> I feel very dumb for having done this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you take it slow, the pain really isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Big mistake, worst ingrowns ever after I use the epilator!</li>
            <li> , I must say that I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Underarms were difficult-</li>
            <li> Hurts worse than getting a tattoo!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s incredibly slow about it, which makes it incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> and then you get bored with it and try something else.</li>
            <li> painful if moving slowly</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t going to feel guilty.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t take all the hair out.</li>
            <li> It is definitely uncomfortable, but not intolerable.</li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heart &amp; tares my legs up, but works well on bikini area.</li>
            <li> He uses a regular electric razor and it leaves stubble which is awful when that arm goes around you!!</li>
            <li> I ended up with a nasty cyst after using this in the private area.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am returning this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a million angry squirrels are trying to tear my face off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I failed to realize it does not have the battery availability.</li>
            <li> but it kept me from removing the hairs and if you want to try to get all the hair to be removed its easier to just not have it attached, I know I was skeptical using without the guard because i feared that it would pinch my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do that.  </li>
            <li> and it was extremely difficult to endure.</li>
            <li> Not for the faint at heart</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and is uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it sorry.</li>
            <li> (But I could be wrong)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of shaving, I say go for it!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry and for the price</li>
            <li> It was useless.  </li>
            <li> I suggest you to buy an expensive one</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I missed the return by date, this is not what I thought it was at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was not like the hairs were being licked off by kittens.</li>
            <li> It was expensive but it served its purpose well.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Like, insane amounts of hurts (especially in the underarms)</li>
            <li> so I must be doing something wrong, because the rest of the reviews say the pain is endurable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the box was ripped and the epilator had hair in it.</li>
            <li> Sorry,  I&#x27;m not going to sugar coat it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately 6 months its the cord seems to be damaged.</li>
            <li> This model can&#x27;t be used unplug,it will make some difficult  with the electric wire.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who works out a lot and body hair is just really uncomfortable</li>
            <li> That was me being silly).  </li>
            <li> So when I was bored</li>
            <li> Sounds scary, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it fails on me.</li>
            <li> the product is useless.</li>
            <li> I just tried it and while it isn&#x27;t excruciating, it&#x27;s definitely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to use it for my armpits at all because it hurt without getting any visible results.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it was day time</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the expensive epilator.</li>
            <li> I tried it multiple times all with horrible results</li>
            <li> What am I doing wrong?</li>
            <li> After my lower leg sugaring fail, I decided to order the Philips Satinelle epilator based on reviews and price.  </li>
            <li> I think there is a 45 day trial period, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the least painful epilators I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> so I was sad when it died and had to replace it.  </li>
            <li> and this is the least painful.  </li>
            <li> My husband freaked out wondering how I got all these horrible red bumps on my legs...</li>
            <li> It was ridiculously painful and ridiculous to use.</li>
            <li> I still hate epilating my legs- too painful, and takes too long.</li>
            <li> however my hair is very thin</li>
            <li> it is now just very frustrating to use</li>
            <li> Seriously!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much less painful than plucking eyebrows!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still painful on some areas, like my face, but still less painful than wax.</li>
            <li> A little painful, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> my leg!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took forever (like a half hour just to do my calves and ankles) and was very painful.</li>
            <li> You have to move very slowly in order for it to work, and it is just so painful.</li>
            <li> it is painful, I mean, it is!</li>
            <li> The water (and soap) stung my underarms quite painfully (I&#x27;d say worse than the epilating).</li>
            <li> I have hated shaving everyday</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend crazy money on the expensive kinds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made me realize that my other epilator was doing a horrible job.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I have very thick grotesque hair on my legs and have been desperately searching for a solution to shaving!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as cruel as waxing but with the addition of a furious &amp; relentless attack of little needle like pinchers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> The bad reviews tell me if there&#x27;s something genuinely wrong with the product or if people are just whining about insignificant things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not treated it badly or been careless with it.</li>
            <li> This fiendish device makes Iraq and Afghanistan look like Disneyland in comparison.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing product.</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs like crazy</li>
            <li> This product is cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> But that area goes numb..</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s numb</li>
            <li> also dries the skin out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m to chicken to even try again.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the item, it works well, but its painful to use.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to let anyone touch my face for fear of them feeling the stubble on my face.</li>
            <li> and it hurts like crazy</li>
            <li> I am totally unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> It caused crazy hair bump.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe the sensation as being like getting a zap from a doorknob on a cold winter day after walking across a carpet.</li>
            <li> Afraid to buy again.</li>
            <li> It worked well because I think it would hurt like crazy if you did everything at once.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using something to numb the pits and bikini area before epilating and also do it when you get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Horrible waste of money</li>
            <li> I wrote waxing since it didn&#x27;t work, but hurry like crazy.</li>
            <li> I thought she was crazy for buying it.</li>
            <li> The leg stung like crazy, and I&#x27;m sitting here typing this with one hairy leg.  </li>
            <li> Everything came in my package except for the cleaning brush, which was disappointing.</li>
            <li> Like, I am afraid my neighbors were wondering what on earth I was doing.</li>
            <li> It hurt like crazy.</li>
            <li> That was a disappointing, I was washing it once a week and letting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would have rather felt the pain of a broken arm or a sprung ankle than the annoying pain I felt using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the thin cord is annoying, it gets all entangled.</li>
            <li> it stinks but doesn&#x27;t hurt!&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive for piece of junk!</li>
            <li> it takes very little time to take away all of the hair and doesnt hurt terribly.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m kinda mad.</li>
            <li> For areas that self-waxing is too difficult, this zips over and plucks everything out!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one broke the day I bought it :(</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already broken!!</li>
            <li> Depending in your hormones it can take up to a month until you have to wax again, unfortunately to me 2 weeks is my limit!</li>
            <li> and I am so mad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return it. :(</li>
            <li> That day at work I was very uncomfortable because my armpits were on fire all night.</li>
            <li> It looks very scary, as well.</li>
            <li> , I think this is very unfair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to get every hair on your legs</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s basically impossible to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> It is horrible, hurts terribly, and DOES NOT work properly.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m also use to waxing, plucking and threading so the pain isn&#x27;t as bad for me.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> the regrowth is just as bad as shaving.  </li>
            <li> I tried the epilator on my arm just to see if it felt as bad</li>
            <li> Afterwards tho, the pain wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li> , I always had embarrassingly bad razor burn on my under arms.</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t pay attention on bad reviews.</li>
            <li> and I been it hurts but not that bad .</li>
            <li> In my opinion it hurt really bad in that area, but I do use it on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Amazon is getting bad.</li>
            <li> hurts really bad and not all the hair were removed.</li>
            <li> After reading all the &amp;#34;oh it hurts so bad and nonsense&amp;#34; I was scared to death to put it on my skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too bad as things loosen up.</li>
            <li> cuz I saw some reviews ppl saying it hurts really bad</li>
            <li> MECHANICS:&lt;br /&gt;You have to have it plugged in while using it, it isn&#x27;t wireless which isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> but my friend told me it wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> Even if it sometimes does, its still not that bad.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not as bad as you may think.</li>
            <li> Oh my gawd, hurt so bad</li>
            <li> u use it the pulling sensation is not so bad - u get used to it.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend tried to use it on his chest and he couldn&#x27;t finish because it hurt so bad, but I did my legs, arms, and underarms</li>
            <li> but if you follow the directions its not to bad.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to the metal and broke out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I got a bad one.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad, but if it gets too bad, all it takes for relief is to lift the epilator away.</li>
            <li> But it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Probably because it hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> I do not think that it hurts too bad.</li>
            <li> Bikini isn&#x27;t so bad, definately not your face.</li>
            <li> Bikini isn&#x27;t so bad, definately not your face.</li>
            <li> so shaving is really bad for me.</li>
            <li> or you will get bad razor burn.</li>
            <li> After all, millions of women have used this on their legs--how bad could it be?  </li>
            <li> This thing hurt so bad</li>
            <li> but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> It hurts really bad</li>
            <li> The pain wasn&#x27;t honestly as bad as I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> Yes it is painful but not as bad as everyone acts like it is.</li>
            <li> I found the process to be quite painful even though I followed all the directions to the letter.</li>
            <li> Though painful, it is something which can be handled.</li>
            <li> The waxing process was so painful</li>
            <li> It is so painful</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t attempted the bikini line-underarm was painful</li>
            <li> On my chest hair it was extremely painful.</li>
            <li> I heard horror stories of how painful epilators were.</li>
            <li> but it was still just as painful.</li>
            <li> Was it painful?</li>
            <li> It broke off a lot of the hairs and was so painful.</li>
            <li> It is painful</li>
            <li> But so painful and it even peeled my skin off.</li>
            <li> It is painful, but tolerable.</li>
            <li> I can feel it, but it&#x27;s just not what I would call a painful experience.</li>
            <li> it is extremely painful, even on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it was painful... but not like any pain I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
            <li> The bikini area was ridiculously painful and it is easier to use tweezers to pull each hair one by one</li>
            <li> I do not find it painful at all because I am so used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of waxing and plucking.  </li>
            <li> This thing is so painful I have no idea how anyone could use this.</li>
            <li> it is so PAINFUL  </li>
            <li> Epilating sounded painful, and truth be told, it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly it&#x27;s painful</li>
            <li> I knew it was going to be painful</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, pulls leg hair, soooo painful.  </li>
            <li> Although, I will say that was one of the painful areas to do (for me), as well as pubic area.</li>
            <li> Anyways, these things are extremely painful</li>
            <li> Really ugly marks.</li>
            <li> My mother thinks it is painful</li>
            <li> The in growns were painful as well.</li>
            <li> So, basically waxing is painful, but quicker and epilating is a slower process in order to remove all of the hair in the area.</li>
            <li> It is painful but not intolerable.  </li>
            <li> works like it should,  you just need to know that it is extremely painful.  </li>
            <li> This one gets the job done and it isn&#x27;t as painful as another brand</li>
            <li> PAINFUL (moreso than just waxing)&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> What hair it does remove is painful and it doesn&#x27;t remove even 50%.  </li>
            <li> It was quite painful</li>

            <li> OW! Not easy to use, has to be at the perfect angle to remove hair. It&#x27;s a more time-intensive and painful alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Phillips epilator for over 15 years and they are the best!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with pulling, pinching or any other issues I read others had. I feel this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> Works as it says, but the only downside is that I wish it was cordless!</li>
            <li> Love it. No problems, have been using similar products for years, so no pain or maybe just use to the little sting of having the hairs pulled out from the root. Enjoy the smooth feel and well worth it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE&lt;br /&gt;Way less messier than waxing with the same results and little pain.</li>
            <li> Clip hair, unaccustomed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased that the description states: &amp;#34;Cordless epilator gives you soft, smooth skin head-to-toe,&amp;#34; when it&#x27;s not cordless at all. It MUST be plugged into the cord to operate. Overall, it works okay, but ensure your hair is long enough for the epilator to grip and you are using it in a well-lit room.</li>
            <li> I love it made my hairs grow in thinner, its a little painful but its worth the pain. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good machine and easy to use with good results</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic!  My daughter borrowed mine, and loved it so much, I had to buy her one, so I could have mine back.  Then a week later, my daughter-in-law borrowed it, with the same results.  So far, I have purchased 3 of these.  I will admit, that the first time you use it, it is a little painful.  Not too bad, but definitely a little uncomfortable.  This is because you are pulling out hairs from the root, and these roots have been established for some time.  After the first couple of times, it is much better.  After the first few times, you only have to use it about once every week or week and a half.  The other positive is that when your hair does start growing back in a week later, it is very fine and light colored, not dark and coarse.  So far the girls have only used it on their legs. I was brave enough to use it on my armpits, where I have even better results.  Armpits are a very tender area when you are pulling hairs, so the first couple of times, it might bring a few tears to your eyes, but it is soooooo worth it!!!  I can use it on my armpits, and a week later, they are still smooth as can be.  I told the girls they have to try it.  This epilator is the best thing ever!!!</li>
            <li> All girls should buy it</li>
            <li> Se recibio el pedido muy bien en Venezuela</li>
            <li> This has been my first epilator, so I have nothing to compare it to. Yes it is painful but not as bad as everyone acts like it is. My main problem with it is that is doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs. I spent forever doing my legs and I didn&#x27;t even get all of them. So I don&#x27;t really even use it anymore. I&#x27;ll probably just buy a more expensive one, or go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> Have had it quite a while now and it still works pretty well. You have to go over quite a bit but I think that happens with most epilators.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an old epilator that had just plain worn out. Love it! It is quiet and pulls those facial hairs out with minimal discomfort. Much easier than manual plucking. I love a smooth face!</li>
            <li> It is small and compact.  Does the job quickly.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that the priced increased $5.00 while in my cart ... I guess to make up for the $5.00 coupon that was clipped. That seems a bit shady :-/</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product so I could remove hair that I didn&#x27;t want, and I was tired of shaving and wasting money on razors all the time.  This epilator does its job, I&#x27;ll tell you that.  It removes all the hairs straight from the root.  Here are  pros/cons and my first impressions, overall, I like this thing, but nothing is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Removes hair from the root (no more shaving)&lt;br /&gt;-Slows the re-growth of the hair down over time&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your skin nice and smooth&lt;br /&gt;-No more \\&quot;stubs\\&quot; and \\&quot;prickles\\&quot; on the skin after a few days&lt;br /&gt;-Smoothness lasts at least 2-3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive and easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It hurts A LOT!  (It&#x27;s different for others, i&#x27;m sure)&lt;br /&gt;-Skin got irritated afterwards&lt;br /&gt;-Took a long time to remove every single hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s that.  My first problem with this thing, and the obvious thing, is that this plucks out all of your hairs, so this is no painless experience.  It is probably different for others, but for me, it hurt like crazy.  I&#x27;m guessing if you have never pulled your hair from the root in the past, you will feel it.  I could feel the hairs being ripped out, and honestly, I started shaking and sweating from the pain.  I think it was worth it though, because in the long run, no more shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing requires time and patience.  It does NOT do its job just buy going over once.  It took me three times to remove every single hair from my legs.  I even had to wait a day or two and go back over again, but over time, it will be less time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that I got redness afterwards.  This appeared normal, so all I did was but some aloe lotion on and took and ice pack and rubbed it up against my skin.  It really helped.  After about 12 hours, the redness was all gone, so I think that redness afterwards is probably normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product and will continue using it.  It took time to adapt, so don&#x27;t give up on it too early, give it some time.</li>
            <li> really great for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.She felt lot of problem with waxing process.But now she is very happy about usage of this product.It reduced lot of hair growth.She is happy about wearing 3/4 pants now.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe this would be a better alternative to waxing. Wrong. This is just as painful to use if not more. I was using product on stomach, but couldn&#x27;t finish even the part where I wanted hair removed.  The product serves its purpose, it plucks hair, but its just not for me.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than the epilator I previously owned but I couldn&#x27;t afford another $75 epilator, SO I decided to give this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;It works JUST AS QUICKLY, just AS GOOD, I actually PREFER not having to charge it, I just plug it up and go.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy. I just rinse the head after I use it (THE HEAD CLICKS OFF).&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have a better grip on shorter hair because it doesn&#x27;t have the double tweezing pieces.&lt;br /&gt;I love this epilator and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product. I think it&#x27;s really worth the investment. It does hurt in the beginning but after the 2nd time you use it, it gets better! :D I&#x27;m totally in love with this product! :)</li>
            <li> Works less than half as well as my old Philips corded model with ceramic tweezers.  These tweezers are die cut stamped metal and some don&#x27;t align well when they come together.  I regret having bought and plan to replace it.</li>
            <li> All Hair Removers like this *of course it will hurt some* If they say it&#x27;s painless they are lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Epilator works fine, but will most it only can grab hairs that are a certain length.&lt;br /&gt;I looked at others that pull the same length of hair, there is no reason to pay more for an Epilator if they are the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good buy and it works well.</li>
            <li> The previous epilator I used was not as painful as this one. Overall it&#x27;s an alright product-It does the job, but could be less painful.</li>
            <li> Not bad. The first few times will hurt. You just have to rip the band aid off and do it quickly. The more you anticipate the pain and hesitate, it makes it worse. Now it really doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It&#x27;s pretty time consuming. Shaving gets done way quicker. On my shins I get a lot of ingrown hairs now. I should probably buy a good exfoliator. Overall, I still like it. I like the amount of time I can go in between of using it.</li>
            <li> Loved it until it died.  I even bought a new one, but it died too.</li>
            <li> After doing the whole shaving thing this is surely a better alternative. At first it hurt a lot! but after a while and after using it for 1-2months it didn&#x27;t hurt. Hair grown thinner and don&#x27;t use it as often. At first there was still a stubble but just keeping at it, over time there isn&#x27;t anymore stubble. Dedication and determination...oh and a tolerance for pain. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is so loud! also it&#x27;s big but doesn&#x27;t pull out as much hair at a time as i wish it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None the less I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The scariest part isn&#x27;t the pain- its the awful chain-saw-like sound it makes. But once you actually start using it, it&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds. I do have to go over the same area a few times, but overall I am happy with is.</li>
            <li> Not a solid brand, but what do you expect for that price. I guess you get what you pay for. I use this one as my quick, secondary one. I love my solid and sturdy Emjoi red one. My old Braun one was good, it had a light and was solid, but eventually the motor wore out.</li>
            <li> For me, it works well for underarms. Not much of pain and it plucks well. But for legs - my hair on legs is very thin and not much, it just creates many bumps. I think it cuts hair rather than plucking. It makes ingrown hair a lot. I think this is only good for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It gets most of the hairs under my armpits, but sometimes it leaves some. It&#x27;s alright though because I can easily take the remaining few hairs with a tweezer, but I&#x27;d prefer not to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy clean up !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick and the pain decreases over time since you get used to it :)</li>
            <li> Am happy with product...</li>
            <li> Note to those women who tend to get ingrowns on their legs. Do NOT buy epliltor. I had the worst experience with epilator. This is my first and will be my last epilator! I tend to get ingrowns on my legs when I shave. So I thought I&#x27;d try a different method! Big mistake, worst ingrowns ever after I use the epilator! Returning it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inefficient. It hurts, as epilators are expected to. It&#x27;s bang for buck, but in the end it still sucks for me. I would go back and buy an emjoi or something if I could.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my girlfriend. Works great on thin hair, but not so great on thick hair. Does it&#x27;s job, not too painful and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not friendly to use on your privates.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator &amp; I was shocked by how efficient this was, especially since it&#x27;s one of the cheaper ones. I did one leg Friday &amp; the other Saturday. Still smooth Wednesday. Now, it does hurt. Not horribly, but like little pricks with a needle. I used it on my boyfriend&#x27;s arm &amp; he said it felt like a light tattoo needle. I thought for sure it was scratching my skin, but it was just the pain of several hairs being pulled out at the root. Legs were slightly red the next day, but that&#x27;s about it. I hate shaving because my hair grows too fast &amp; it&#x27;s a hassle to shave every day or every other day. I put it on the slowest setting because I find that it works better. I did have to go over some areas a few times, but it&#x27;s worth it to not have to shave. WARNING: USING THIS ON YOUR UNDERARMS HURTS!!! MEGA PAIN &amp; MY SKIN WAS SORE THE NEXT DAY. I WASN&#x27;T BRAVE ENOUGH TO TRY MY BIKINI AREA AFTER THAT. Great product otherwise &amp; I&#x27;ll epilate for life. So much cheaper than waxing.</li>
            <li> I love it, works really well, and take off from the root. I would totally recommend for a friend, totally compensates the price. Has long duration (years) so in long time it&#x27;s more cheap than using wax, and is totally convenient</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was feeling very optimistic about using it. I found the process to be quite painful even though I followed all the directions to the letter. Also, for all the pain I endured, I didn&#x27;t feel like it worked all that well. Oddly enough I convinced my husband to let me use it on him and the hair came out as promised, but not on me. I think that the hair has to be much longer than the instructions call for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record... I did try several times and still had the same results... it now sits in the box in my closet... the only reason I haven&#x27;t gotten rid of it is because I hate the thought of wasting all that money. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it on my husband again in a few months.</li>
            <li> This is actually my first epilator so I am still getting used to it. I have a really low pain threshold, which isn’t too helpful either &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it would hurt like something out of this world to use an epilator, but it wasn’t too bad actually! My first time it took me two hours, second time 1 hr and so on. The more you use it, the more you’re legs are desensitised to the pain, hence the quicker you can use it. Now to describe the pain associated with this product. It’s basically that feeling where someone is pulling out your hair, but many at a time. The back of my calves and near the ankles hurt more than the other parts of my leg. I haven’t yet ventured out to use it anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After researching online, I found out that exfoliation is a must, so I exfoliated a day before wanting to use this epilator. But as I was just a beginner, I didn’t stick to the routine which lead to ingrown hair. But for newbies like me, as long as you exfoliate regularly, it shouldn’t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product would have been more ideal if it came with some instructions or tips which guide you through what to do before and after epilation. It would have helped me save a lot of time I had spent scouring the internet for tips.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing which put me off is the noise it made. It sounded like a saw, so I always put my headphones on and listen to some upbeat music to help distract me a little &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was definitely not what I was expecting. I expected pain, pain and more pain! So I was extremely happy to find out this wasn’t the case! &#x3D;) Though painful, it is something which can be handled. Quite happy I bought this.</li>
            <li> Painful as can be but a similar result to waxing, probably even better because no messy, sticky wax to deal with</li>
            <li> great gift for the wife and the teenager daughter as well. they both love it so i am happy with the purchase. i do recommend to anyone looking for an epilator. never heard of one till my wife brought it up. great price too here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought it for facial hair, so far hasnt worked, ok on leg hair</li>
            <li> excellent product!!!!! brings down parlour visits for hair removal to minimal !!!thanks Philips...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she is comfortable and happy about it. Its value for money from my end and I surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This does work, but it is not for those with a low pain tolerance. If you&#x27;ve waxed or tweezed before, you will be fine. You do become used to it, and the results are worth it. I got it for my bikini line, and after suffering through, it&#x27;s still smooth after a week- and without the ingrown hairs that shaving leave. I&#x27;m a fan</li>
            <li> I got the one with the cored because I like it to always have a full strong charge. I only use it under my arms.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife recently and after many apprehensions, she decided to use it. And she loved it. In her own words, she didn&#x27;t know something so convenient existed - not as much pain as she had anticipated (and she has sensitive skin and waxing hurts so that was the expectation even here) despite the growth (of nearly two months!) and no red spots/rashes either. The pros: smooth skin, convenient, less pain, no redness/swelling; the cons: very time consuming as you have to epilate individual areas instead of removing hair from a large area the way waxing works - however, that is a negative about epilation in general. I (read my wife) am pretty satisfied with the purchase - good for beginners and great value for money!</li>
            <li> I love this product. If your not a big fan for hair, this is for you. I just received it today I tried it on my back and tummy where there is thin hair and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much it just felt like a little pinch. Well I&#x27;m also use to waxing, plucking and threading so the pain isn&#x27;t as bad for me. I highly re comes it especially for this price.!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for awhile and have found it fairly similar to other epilators. It removes hair about the same as others.  It is much much louder then some.</li>
            <li> The first time it  hurts a bit, but the more you use the more tolerable the pain is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everywhere is so much smoother looking! And I prefer it to shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> If you have course hair it will not rip it out from the roots. It will cause breakage on about half the hair and require more time than shaving or waxing</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that it is the one I was looking for. Seems to hurt a bit. I think, it is mainly designed for feet (my sister uses it not me). Has been working for 6 months at least.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be good as per the price..</li>
            <li> Hurts SO BADLY!!! If I wasn&#x27;t so stubborn, I would have stopped using this months ago. Cheaper than waxing but WAY more uncomfortable. I do it when I get out of the shower. Feels like being electrocuted. I think I have a high pain tolerance- got a 5 hour tattoo that was about as painful, no joke. Good luck! It DOES remove hair as promised!</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell, but that&#x27;s to be expected from an epilator.  Gave it one star cause it broke after a few uses.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have waxed a few times, and this is a different type of pain. Using it on my legs is not too painful and I feel it is a great alternative to shaving or waxing. The charging cord is very long and great for use in the bathroom. So far this product has worked just great. The price is right, and the pain is not bad enough to stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have been in two wars. This fiendish device makes Iraq and Afghanistan look like Disneyland in comparison.  I shaved and then waited for the hair to grow to the recommended length for epilation.  I cracked open the packaging for this thing and examined it. It appeared harmless enough; small, compact, and feminine. That all immediately changed once I plugged it in and turned it on.  It sounds exactly like how I imagined the maw to Hell itself sounding. It’s basically a hand-held wood chipper. I thought to myself “no ****ing way”.  But curiosity eventually got the best of me and I went for it. I almost blacked out from the pain; it was as if each hair follicle was being yanked directly out of my soul.  I should have ended it there and walked away, but I had to keep my eye on the prize of having a smooth groin area. Hoping that my deceased relatives weren’t somehow witnessing this from Heaven - I laid down in the bath tub, took a swig of whiskey, kissed my rosary beads, bit down on a piece of leather, and went for it. After a while, your brain eventually tells your body to **** off and you get used to the pain. If being smooth down there is worth intense pain to you, then I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Love it!! Haven&#x27;t had to shave my legs in a month!</li>
            <li> Took 4 hours to finish both legs, and it just ripped half of the hairs instead of pulling them from the root. Legs hurt so much for 3 days that rubbing them against the blanket hurt. I had to wear pants to bed. I am assuming the good reviews can&#x27;t be real. Lol needless to say, I returned it. Maybe if I tried another higher quality epilator, it would actually produce smooth legs to make it worth the pain and time, but I&#x27;m not even going to bother.</li>
            <li> After using this regularly for 5 months, it just stopped working :(. I like it very much, but expected it to last much longer. The other thing that bothered me was that you can only use it when it is plugged in. I was expecting battery powered epilator! Overall, I liked it, but I think this one can be improved.. I already ordered another epilator from a different brand. Hopefully this one lasts longer. Definitely would recommend epilators, just maybe not this one.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Saves time with the tweezers.  If you have never used an epilator, be aware that it pulls out the hair - so there is some mild discomfort, but it comes with a beginner&#x27;s guard to make it easier.</li>
            <li> I am mostly disappointed by it lasting only a month and a half before just not turning on at all. It worked well, especially for it&#x27;s price, but I think $40 is way too much for something that won&#x27;t last. I will just spend more next time.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! I would say that this epilator removes between 70%- 90% hair from the root. The other % is cuted. the amount relies on the lenght and the thickness of the hair. I use in my lower legs and found that great. I also tried it in my hand and because the hair was much more thin then more hair was cutted instead of removed. I any case, it is great. Before I used to use tweezers and took me forever. With this epilator takes as long as a razer but removing most of the hair from root. In another hand, I can say that the noise is kind of loud, so would no hear aniything else while you use it. Also, tha package for philips is too big for the epilator. SO, waste of materials, no at all evironmentally friendly. In adittion, the package came with any security plastic. Therefore, there was no guaranty of previous use or the condition of new. Theferore, I recomend to the manufacturer check the issues about packaging while the function is good enough. Even better than I excepeted for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it. Bought it about a year ago and use it as I need. For sure you need to get used to the feeling but it does the job well. And hair growes thinner and not as much.</li>
            <li> You ready for pain?  Like,  worse than a tattoo pain?  Like 45 min of pain?  Then not all of the hairs get pulled?  Yeaaaaa.......  Not the product for me,  but maybe for someone with really thin hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have very low tolerance for pain and always go for the most expensive product on the shelf. This time, I thought I will give this epilator a go. It really wasn&#x27;t as painful as everybody said it was.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply some oil (I use Sweet Almond Oil) before you epilate. Some people say you have to make sure your skin is complete oil free before epilating. I totally disagree because epliating on dry skin hurts like ****.&lt;br /&gt;2. Be sure the epilator is at 90degrees to your skin, otherwise you might get broken hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply some more oil after you epilate. You will not feel any pain after. It is pain free!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I did wrong:&lt;br /&gt;I used some Veet wax strips first so trim my underarm hoping to reduce pain during my epilation process. DO NOT DO THIS. The waxing process was so painful and I was still left with a lot of hair (now my 1 star review will go there). Then I used this epilator. Can you believe it? It was at least 10 times less painful than those waxing strips and did not leave a trace of a hair on my underarm.  I could clearly see that the waxed areas still had dark roots but those epilated areas were white and clean. Next time I might try them on the chicken wings I get from the supermarket because the supermarket doesn&#x27;t seem to do a good enough job waxing my chicken, comparing to this Epilator does my underarms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this type of shaver and personally, I do not like it at all.  The instructions said to use the plastic protector if it&#x27;s your first time using an epilator, so I did and it only pulled my hair and it didn&#x27;t even get all my hair, I kept having to go back over the same areas and the areas that are rounded, like the front of your leg, you have to be very careful or you will damage your skin.  It was also very loud.  It did not work well at all and actually hurt to use because it pulled the hair out (and not very good at that!)</li>
            <li> A bit noise but fast, I specificly bought it because it has a cord so that way it doesn&#x27;t run out of juice before I am done. The cord is long enough to reach the areas I need.</li>
            <li> it is good but it is noisy.</li>
            <li> This is terrible!! I threw mine away. It is painful!! Seriously ouch! It felt like it was taking of my skin too.  I just stick to waxing now.</li>
            <li> Do not use this on your face. I did and it left my face irritated for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used on my legs after but I still have to shave to get the smooth feel.</li>
            <li> I am a hairy guy.  I have these annoying hairs growing on the front of my neck, back of neck, and shoulders, among other areas.  I have been plucking them for years, and loved the idea of something automatic to save me time.  As far as this machine working for plucking hairs:  it works pretty good even though you have to run over an area several times to get all the hairs.  Sometimes I run over an area 5 or 6 times for that ONE last hair it hasn&#x27;t gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem I have is that I got crazy red bumps for almost a week in any area I used it on.  Some of the bumps had little pustules on them as if infected.  I believe my skin may be more sensitive than most, and I understand that not everyone experiences this problem.  However, for me this product has become almost worthless because I do not want red zit like bumps all over me for days after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not the most comfortable process in the world, but not unbearable.  It feels like little metal things &amp;#34;hitting&amp;#34; your skin if you hold it too close, but you kinda have to hold it close to get the hairs so......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even pulled the head off and soaked it in alcohol thinking that it may have some bacteria in it.  After retrying the process a day or so later I still got similar results although no QUITE as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you are not prone to this problem then I think this product is definitely worth it.  Otherwise steer clear.  I regularly use tweezers and many types of shavers on my body with zero problems.  I thought my skin was pretty well conditioned to this sort of thing.  Obviously not.</li>
            <li> Love this! Does a wonderful job! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It came without a guard but customer service sent one to me within a week. After using it on my legs they were silky smooth. A week later I had half ingrown hairs. :-/ Not fun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more time consuming and kind of painful, but SO worth it! My legs have never been this soft. This product takes quite a few passes to get the job done, but that&#x27;s probably normal. I&#x27;m definitely buying another one for my best friend!</li>
            <li> Good one ... My wife likes it !!!!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m new to this. My first epilator. I&#x27;ve read countless reviews and watched countless YouTube videos. With all the \\&quot;painful\\&quot; claims, I decided to still give it a try and am so glad I did! I wanted a starter epilator and this was a good choice. I normally wax or shave but I wanted something more convenient. Waxing is a hassle and shaving lasts 2 days max.    I started off with my arm hairs. It worked pretty well but I noticed it didn&#x27;t get all the hairs. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s because the hairs are too fine. So I got brave and tried epilating my armpit hairs. WOW!! I put the epilator slowly on stray hairs just to see if it pulled out the hair or cut it (as some reviewers claimed). It pulled it all the way from the root. I was so excited I did my whole armpit and after, the hairs that were left on the epilator showed the follicle attached. My armpit hair grew back finer too. So awesome.    Doing my armpits takes about 5 min to do. Takes about 5 min per leg and arm. Not too shabby and no skin gets pulled! I&#x27;m very happy and ask myself why I didn&#x27;t get to this sooner!</li>
            <li> It does its job really well. It is small and light weight however its size does not interfere with its ability to remove hair.  The best part is that the tweezers part comes off and can be washed cleaned.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it does the job.  This epilator must be plugged in when using I did not realize that, but better I supposed as my other rechargeable one quit working because the battery could not hold charge.  I like that it has 2 speeds, so when I can take more &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; I put it on high, and when I am in a wimpy mood I put it on low.</li>
            <li> OK but a wireless one would be better</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me, I guess I don;t have the right type of skin. After trying it for nearly a month, my legs looked worse than ever and left me with lots of ingrown hair (sorry for TMI). I knew this was a risk going in so I&#x27;m not complaining about the product itself. It works as it should, just not for me. Right now it&#x27;s sitting in my closet til I find someone who wants to try it.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because some of the reviews stated that it could be used on the face. It was  extremely painful and I stilll had facial hair remaining. Do not waste your money. I&#x27;m still looking for an inexpensive method that removes hair without scarring the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have ever bought and I bought it mainly for my underarms. It hurts a bit the first couple of times but you get used to it and it is totally worth it. Goodbye stubble!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty painful so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it all the time. I used it for a summer and I did really like the results. I found myself using it once every 1-3 weeks on my armpits. Not really worth it for everyday use, but if you are going somewhere special and don&#x27;t want to worry about stubble/shaving I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the guard thing broke right away, you dont need it but it&#x27;s nice to have.</li>
            <li> I have a very low pain tolerance, and this hurt a LOT. I exfoliated beforehand and moisturized afterwards, and my legs are feeling nice and smooth. There are a few stray hairs here and there, but nothing&#x27;s perfect! I&#x27;ll probably just tweeze them out myself later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinda nervous about using it again, but I&#x27;ll just hope that it hurts less next time!</li>
            <li> It removes the hair but causes in grown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem with in grown hairs but this product has doubled the amount compared to shaving and waxing, My friend who has never had an ingrown hair got a couple dozen on each leg. She normally waxes her legs. She used some sort of lotion for in grown hairs but still has scars months later.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, but be careful to use it correctly to avoid as much ingrown hairs as possible!</li>
            <li> If you tweeze anything else you probably won&#x27;t find using this product too painful but as a hairy woman I also don&#x27;t find it to be particularly effective.</li>
            <li> for one, yes it hurts. that is obvious and to be expected. it seems to work on thicker hair better than thin hair. on my thin hairs it seems to break some and pull some. i cannot use it on those areas any more because it is not accurate and i never get a smooth feel. on the thicker hairs, however, it is wonderful and hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I have used, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  Is there a better one out there?  I don&#x27;t know-but this one is decently priced and does the job.  Yes, it hurts.</li>
            <li> It works very well. I used to have an Emjoi Gently Silken and it seems to me that the Philps HP 6401 does a better of grabbing and pulling the hair out.</li>
            <li> I did not like this epilator. It&#x27;s blade surface is too narrow and it is much less effective than my previous which was a half-inch wide.</li>
            <li> Works great, 110Volt/220Volt. perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> Wow! Painful during first session since I&#x27;ve never epilated before and I was a hairy wookie (on purpose just to make this session effective). It is so painful but it is so, so worth it. I always get my face and eyebrows threaded, so I wanted pretty much the same method for my legs and all over. This epilator is perfect. I&#x27;ve used it on my face too and it totally replaces facial threading which saves me a ton of money!!! It&#x27;s nowhere near as painful on the face with epilating compared to threading! My sister is using this same epilator and she&#x27;s been using one for YEARS. She swears by them so that&#x27;s why I purchased one since I was fed up with shaving every other day. Apparently epilating can keep hairs from coming back until about 2 weeks later! If you&#x27;re lucky, you might not have to epilate again for a month! I love this device. It hurts like a mother on the first session but It was so rewarding knowing that after I finished up, I don&#x27;t have to worry about becoming a hairy Mary for about 2 weeks 😁 chuk de pathe (bring the roof down!) I am very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dating myself but I had the original Epilady back in the 80s (give or take).  I swore I would never use one again-it&#x27;s as cruel as waxing but with the addition of a furious &amp; relentless attack of little needle like pinchers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to yesterday when I opened the Philips and plugged it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Reasonable price and for me, no charging-extra long cord and can be used right out of the box.  Doing my legs really didn&#x27;t hurt.  I should preface this to say that I&#x27;m now 50 yr old and the one positive aspect of being middle age is that hair production does slow down.  And, I never had thick, abundant, or coarse hair to begin with. Also, I was not interested in a wet/dry model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Doesn&#x27;t leave perfectly smooth skin.  And, I had to go over a few areas from different angles to be effective. Appears to rip out hair at the skin surface rather than the root-My legs, although hair free, are not completely smooth like waxing or a close shave. My underarms are smoother than my legs but it definitely brought back the painful relationship I had with my vintage Epilady. I haven&#x27;t attempted the bikini line-underarm was painful enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works but there may be more effective (albeit a bit pricier) options. Works for my needs (talking into account the type of hair) and it&#x27;s better than constantly gashing my legs with  a razor.</li>
            <li> Tired of doing the same area multiple times and still see certain patch of hair standing intact! This was my first epilator and hopefully the last. Waxing is a much better option for me!</li>
            <li> Its my first time using an epilator and I am okay with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasons:&lt;br /&gt;a) The epilator head doesn&#x27;t pick up hair quickly; I need to glide over a particular area a couple of times to remove all the hair while keeping the movement very slow.&lt;br /&gt;b) Its difficult to pull out short but visible hair so need to wait for the hair to grow a considerable length before it can be pulled out&lt;br /&gt;c) Its good however when you don&#x27;t have much time to wax and is quite portable</li>
            <li> Not sure how everyone is saying this doesn&#x27;t hurt... it was so horrible I couldn&#x27;t finish a whole leg. I also had to keep going over the same spot multiple times. Epilating is not fun!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a great job lifting hair. I was expecting and am used to pain, so that wasn&#x27;t a suprise. The fact that I had to go over the same spots due to not lifting hair (and still having no success), I must say that I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> The first thing I&#x27;ll say is that this thing works. The second thing is that the amount of pain that you experience is based on the length, thickness, and consistency of hair you&#x27;re targeting. The longer the hair, the more times this gadget will pull, tug, and jump before finally pulling the hair. On my chest hair it was extremely painful. If our government were intelligent they would have used this thing at Guantanamo so they could just claim they were giving the terrorists makeovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, it does what it says it does. After a few passes with this thing and you will be hairless and might be crying in a corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair&lt;br /&gt;Corded so no worrying about batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Would be fitting if it were included in Dante&#x27;s Inferno.</li>
            <li> This has been a great epilator so far! I bought this one hoping it would be more durable than the Emjoi ones.  I had the [[ASIN:B003II4D2C Emjoi Divine Hair Remover, White/Pink]], it worked well - about the same as this Philips one.    Then I got [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]]  This one is probably my favorite because it is so much faster than the single barrel ones.  But it eventually broke within a year, so then I bought the men&#x27;s version: [[ASIN:B003H3G470 Emjoi AP-18MS Emagine Epilator for Men, Black]]  This one is pretty much the same, slightly different shape but it also broke after a few months.  So then I bought the Emagine Dual Emjoi again, and it broke again. So I finally ended up with this Philips that I have now. I feel like this one is well made and it seems to pick up slightly more hair and finer hairs. Even if I found another good one with a lot more tweezers, I will probably keep this Philips one around because its great for the areas that need something smaller and more precise.    My opinion on these is not based on pain.  Epilating and waxing hurt regardless of the method, I have tried just about every method myself over the years. When you get used to these methods of hair removal, they don&#x27;t hurt as much. Epilating hurts me especially badly when I put off doing it for several weeks or if my skin is cold, but it always hurts more at first then gets better. Just do a little at a time to begin with. After epilating/waxing for years, the hair grows thinner, finer, and less dense and therefore hurts less as time goes on. So if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;ve never found a way for shaving to work for you, then give epilating a try. Go slow, have a strong drink, pat your skin where it hurts, put on some music, and chill - you&#x27;ll get used to it.    All the Emjoi ones have broke on me for the same reason. The epilator gets hung up on skin that is too thick or something like that and the plastic gears inside get stripped out.    My dream epilator would have 72 tweezers (or close - the little single barrel ones take way too long), be CORDED (because the rechargable batteries do not work nearly long enough/ produce enough power), and be durable enough to last a reasonable amount of time without breaking. I don&#x27;t care about all the extra heads, massagers, lights, etc etc.  I never have a use for any of it.  I have not found an epilator that fully meets these standards.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be much more skin sensitive product but it turned out it is not.  bikini line is no no.</li>
            <li> It works great but it didn&#x27;t last very long.  As of now it turns off and on when i hold it facing down.  Really annoying even when it&#x27;s facing up it will turn off and on for no reason. I don&#x27;t think the construction is very solid.</li>
            <li> initially it hurts but over time because the hair doesnt grow back at the same time and you get used to it...it&#x27;s so much better. If you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs this might aggravate  that, just make sure you exfoliate the shit out of your skin.</li>
            <li> A little loud (as other online reviews warned me of prior to purchase), but works well and was shipped quickly. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I tried to like this, but I went back to sugaring instead. It mainly breaks my hairs instead of pulling them out by the root, and hurts a lot on top of it. I find it much more uncomfortable than waxing/sugaring, and it takes a lot longer as well. I have coarse but sparse hair, and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Way better than the $20 epilator I had before. I was debating whether to go back to shaving with that epilator because it missed so much. I&#x27;m glad I tried a step up because I am not going back to shaving now.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this item for me so I am writing the review hoping that someone will find this helpful.  Before we bought this epilator, I read so many reviews and compared different brands and style. I am very glad that I made the decision to get this one. First of all, this is very affordable compared to the other ones out there. But although it is cheaper, the quality is really good. Very simple to use. For my experience, it is not so painful mainly because of the smaller number of tweezers. It is just enough for me to bear the sting.  I have been using this for a little over two months now and have used it about 4x since I got it. There were only two instances where I saw a little bit of bleeding (2 red open pores). And this is because there were multiple hair follicles in those particular hair canals (3-4 hair follicles in a single canal) This has nothing to do with the epilator. Just imagine removing those hairs from the roots at the same time, of course there will be a big opened pore afterwards. Thus, the little blood.  Some hairs get cut and not pulled from the roots. But I guess this is true with any other epilators. It works perfectly if you use it on the opposite direction where your hair grows,  but, sometimes that is hard to do. The good thing is, those few hairs that were not removed from the roots-you can definitely see them grow in a few days and then you can use the epilator again and get better results since they are few and u will definitely see the direction they grow. Although the package says it is for legs only, I use it on my legs, underarms and down there (the top and side part only, I still use wax on the sentitive part). The product is very safe to use. I actually tried to push it hard against my skin to test if it will hurt or get a bit of my skin but it did not. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable but good quality basic epilator.</li>
            <li> Jan 7, 2015: I previously had a Braun epilator and compared to that, the plastic on the inside of this epilator seemed &amp;#34;cheap.&amp;#34; The product also gave off a strong, nasty odor of some kind. Still, I give it 5 stars because it is not meant to be pleasant-smelling or seem sturdy, it has to get the job done and that it does perfectly. Though it is to be used on legs, I used it on my face too with satisfactory results. I have coarse hair on my legs and it required many passes to completely remove the hair, but rarely the hair broke. I did not use the safety attachment and wish it had a brush instead. In the instructions, I found the risk of shock part scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, March 12, 2015: I have had the epilator for more than two months now and it is showing signs of wear. It is taking several passes to pull out the hair. I have used it a lot; however, it may still be a good choice for someone who uses it moderately, seeing as the price has dropped further since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Got this to use on facial hair and only found out it was ONLY for legs and armpits when it arrived. I waited too long to send it back so I put it in the Goodwill donation box. I wish that had been clarified on the product page.</li>
            <li> Awesome! It totally met my expectations! It does a great job! First time it can hurt a little.. But after that you will love it!</li>
            <li> Great little epilator...hair removal devise.  Basically, we&#x27;re talking a bunch of little tweezers plucking at once to remove hair from you body.  I can&#x27;t truthfully say it&#x27;s painless, but it&#x27;s not that bad either.  It&#x27;s quick and over before you know it.  And the skin is so smooth afterwards.  The hair that grows back is finer and shorter.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, but be very careful when using on your upper lip. I know it says not for use on face, but it does work fine there, but be careful not to overdue it.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator because it&#x27;s easy to use and very practical to carry when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product! Best product I have ever used, worth your money! But the machine is pretty loud, anyway this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This machine maybe little bit it works just as well as any fancy-shamancy $200 one.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product, I was a little disappointed because it seemed to break the hair off at skin-level.  But it was entirely my fault.  I basically ripped open the package and went for it.  The second time, I followed the instructions more fully and made sure my legs were clean and well-exfoliated, before I had applied any lotion to them.  Also, holding the skin taught helps a lot, too.  It works really well!  However, my legs have never had that &amp;#34;just shaved&amp;#34; smoothness since I started epilating.  I always feel like I have a tiny amount of stubble, even if my legs don&#x27;t look like they need a shave.  I used the guard for the first several times, but found that it helped me learn how to hold the machine, and by the third or fourth time using it, I was able to remove it and it worked even better.  For me (I have fine, blonde hair), a light, slow, motion works best.  Just try it a few different ways and see what works best for you and your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that it is uncomfortable to use this product, especially the first few times you use it.  It feels like tiny little bee stings all over your skin.  It&#x27;s ripping your hair out by the roots; it&#x27;s not going to be painless.  But it is something you grow accustomed to.  You sort of become numbed to the sensation.  After using it for a few weeks, I decided to get brave and try it on my underarms.  I knew what sort of sensation to expect, held the skin taught, and went for it.  It worked fantastically well!  My underarms have never felt so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quite like this product and would recommend it.  Just make sure to completely read and follow the instructions, and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Disappointing product. I bought it to use for my legs. It doesn&#x27;t do its job. It just breaks the hairs halfway and it doesn&#x27;t grab all hairs. Also, in order to use it you need to have the product plugged into an outlet. Cordless product would be much nicer than this one.</li>
            <li> Ingrown hairs like crazy, hair grows sideways under skin, not worth the trouble, do not buy if you don&#x27;t want to tweeze ingrown hairs for hours</li>
            <li> I either got a bum product, or this isn&#x27;t as good as all the other reviews say it is.  Mine doesn&#x27;t hurt--but that&#x27;s because it isn&#x27;t pulling hairs out really... maybe 5 or so hairs after 10 minutes of using.  I have an older Remington epilator, and the battery doesn&#x27;t stay charged anymore, have to keep it plugged in to use.  I wasn&#x27;t solving that issue buying this cheaper one that has to be plugged in, no battery to charge to begin with... but I figured I&#x27;d at least get a newer model that works better than my 6 year old one.  NOPE!  This was a complete waste of money.  I do not recommend this product in any way.  I don&#x27;t know if paying more would get better, but I do know this item just plain doesn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
            <li> I have had this epilator for months now and it has paid for itself many times over compared to what I used to pay for waxing.  I use it for my underarms, arms, and lower stomach.  Although I felt like a plucked chicken the first time I used it, it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore--but I was in pain the first few uses.  I intended on using it on my legs too but that took too long for me to keep it up, and I was left with a bunch of ingrown hairs so I&#x27;ll stick to waxing/shaving my legs for now.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I think it is a great product for the price. I like the fact that it has two speeds. It does hurt a little (I&#x27;m used to waxing so it didn&#x27;t hurt me much) but I believe that would come with using any epilator. This one isn&#x27;t cordless but that hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far. I would recommend using this product, especially if you&#x27;re a first time user as you can figure out if epilation is meant for you or not!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any paint. It is a perfect shape to handle it. In general,  good product.</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell !!&lt;br /&gt;I cant get through it. It&#x27;s ripping the hairs out of my groin. Surprisingly less painful on the scrotum then above the hot dog.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue try to see if my skin/hair get used to it.</li>
            <li> This epilator works great. It is very loud and for me, very painful, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Painful but removes hair instantly! It takes a while to get use to the pain but now it&#x27;s not that bad. Do not use this product over tattoos a little bit of ink seemed like it faded after I used the epilator! Be careful!! It keeps hair away for a good two weeks!</li>
            <li> Minimal pain and gets most of the job done in only a few passes.</li>
            <li> I have always gone the waxing route. It is quite painful and pretty expensive. I bought this epilator to give it a try. I checked out a few youtube videos and Amazon reviews and some people had mentioned that it is extremely painful. On the other hand, I was happy with the experience. It is kind of painful, no doubt about it. But for people who are used to waxing, you won&#x27;t find it any more painful than waxing. Do follow the instructions where they suggest epilation after a shower. I think that helps. The efficiency cap also helps to some extent. Some of the cons in my opinion - 1. Takes a lot of time to epilate 2. This did not come with a cleaning brush, so I had to make-do with something that I already had.  Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves legs smooth. Pulls out some hairs, but just cuts others. I found it worked best on the lower setting, held but not pressed against skin. Doesn&#x27;t pull out the fine or short hairs. Hairs do grow back thinner. Definitely prefer this to wax or a razor.</li>
            <li> not bad. I need to go over the same place for few times to remove.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re pulling your hair out by the roots, it&#x27;s just a slower means of waxing.  But if you already know what to expect, then it&#x27;s tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impatient, so I used it the day I got it rather than doing any prep work--I just exfoliated in the shower beforehand.  I wasn&#x27;t sure how bad it would be, given the mixed reviews--the first pass was rather startling.  I had to warm myself up to it (literally, I rubbed the area I was working on with a cloth to help open up the pores and desensitise my skin), but I was able to do all of both legs, as well as my underarms (the product states that it&#x27;s only intended to be used on legs, so don&#x27;t take that as any kind of validation).  My legs did feel the tiniest bit stubbly afterwards, possibly from some hairs being broken instead of pulled, but it was better than my electric razor can do.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been ten days and I&#x27;m only now noticing new hair growth.  It&#x27;s supposed to become easier as your skin gets used to it, and the hairs grow in finer, so I&#x27;m looking forward to my second go-around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I decide to continue epilating, I&#x27;ll probably invest in a wet/dry model, since the heat and lubrication seem like they&#x27;d make things smoother.  It also didn&#x27;t even occur to me that this would need to stay plugged in, so many things are cordless nowadays.  This is a decent basic model, but definitely seems like something worth putting a little extra money into.</li>
            <li> Did not like this.  Had to return it.</li>
            <li> It cuts hairs rather than pulling. Also does not get as much. I much much prefer the Emjoi Emagine Dual 72 tweezer.</li>
            <li> This was my first time epilating, so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to other epilators, but I have to say I&#x27;m not too impressed with the experience.  The pain I don&#x27;t find particularly disturbing, and my skin tolerates it well- not too many bumps or ingrown hairs.  However, the product itself is just not that effective.  It seems to break off a lot of the hairs instead of pulling them out.  I&#x27;ve tried many ways- different lengths of hair, different speeds and techniques, after showering, after exfoliating, all the tips I&#x27;ve been able to find, but it still just breaks most of the hairs off.  When I rub my hands over my legs it feels like the second or so day after shaving, very stubbly.  I can even look closely and see the tiny hairs broken off at the skin, too short to be picked up by the epilator.  Also, you have to go over and over and over a spot for it to pick up all the hairs, and therefore it takes a long time.  I usually do it while watching a tv show, and it isn&#x27;t unexpected to spend 30-40 minutes on my legs, just up to my knee!  And then still have stubble?  Sheesh, I could have just shaved in 5 minutes and be smooth.  Plus, because it leaves so many broken off hairs the regrowth is just as bad as shaving.  The only thing really positive I can say about this epilator is the regrowth does feel significantly softer than after shaving, though I don&#x27;t know why.  At any rate, I&#x27;m giving this to my mother whose not too concerned about smooth legs or missing a few hairs and I think I&#x27;m going to try a different epilator before I give up entirely on the technique.  If anyone has any suggestions or tips, please let me know!  I want to make this work!</li>
            <li> I bought this eplilator to remove the hair on my back. I have always shaven the hair off my back. I have never tried an epilator or waxing off the hair. I heard horror stories of how painful epilators were. I read the mixed reviews on this product and decided to give it a try. Holy **** did it hurt! It wasn&#x27;t an agonizing unbearable pain. It was a quick annoying prickly pain. I had to take several breaks to get the entire hair off my back. I was punching the wall, clapping my hands, yelling, and stomping my feet every time the epilator hit a heavy patch of hair. It took about 20 minutes to get all the hair off my back. Once I was finished, I noticed my back looked cleaner and felt smoother than when I would shave it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the epilator doing a good job removing the hair, it did great. As for the annoying pain I felt from getting the hair removed, it was awful. I don&#x27;t know if it was because of this particular epilator, since I never used another epilator before. I have a high threshold for pain. I would have rather felt the pain of a broken arm or a sprung ankle than the annoying pain I felt using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A gave the product 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t know if the pain I felt was from this particular product. However, I did like the results it left and I will try using it again. The product is well worth the price it sells for. I definitely suggest buying the product and giving it a try. Be warned though. It will hurt. I tried the epilator on my arm just to see if it felt as bad (I don&#x27;t shave my arms). Holy $h!t did it hurt there too.</li>
            <li> Hi! This is my very first epilator, and previously all I&#x27;ve ever done for hair removal is shave. Oh, I tweeze my eyebrows. Once I thought to tweeze around the bikini line and after an hour I hadn&#x27;t accomplished much and gave up. Never had the money to try waxing. My sister had very bad results with Nair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my husband bought me this on Amazon- it was inexpensive, but with good reviews for the most part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I have to say I&#x27;m amazed! I love this thing. I was very worried about pain, but it&#x27;s not bad at all for me. Near my ankles is most sensitive (I used it from knee down only so far). Feels like tiny little angry bees, but I can control when they sting me and if it becomes too much, just lift up the machine and it is immediate relief. I was dealing with reflexive urges to jerk away more than the pain itself. My knee didn&#x27;t care about the epilation at all, just the vibrations on my kneecap was hard, again for that reflexive spasm. Calf area was fine- I felt the little hairs coming out, but it wasn&#x27;t really painful at all- more like just an indication that yep- another hair just disappeared. I suggest starting higher on a shin, and working your way lower (my hair is also denser toward my ankle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The machine works very well, I think. I have no experience to compare to. The hairs were getting pulled out like magic, and smooth-looking skin was left behind. Yippee! It doesn&#x27;t FEEL like completely smooth hair-free skin, but it looks like it for sure. Maybe after a few sessions, things will feel smoother? Whatever, if I can have awesome-looking legs, I&#x27;m still in love with this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a shower first, and then dried off and used the epilator. I call this little thing amazing. I tried both speed settings- they don&#x27;t seem to matter much except one is faster so i had to make fewer passes. I had the little purple \\&quot;efficiency\\&quot; head on it. Not sure what it did except remind me to keep the angle close to 90 degrees. The cap slides off easily to rinse it. I did that, but I don&#x27;t think I needed to- hair blew loose just fine during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I wished it was battery-operated. I opened the box and immediately thought it needed to be plugged in to charge so I could use it later. Then I realized it doesn&#x27;t turn on at all unless it is plugged in. I was kind of bummed, until I unwrapped the cord. It is very long and thin, so I had no trouble at all reaching an outlet and still having a comfy spot to sit with my leg propped up. The cord got in my way only once, which is amazing since I switched hands and angles a LOT. I don&#x27;t consider the lack of a battery a con at all now that I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just turning on the epilator, it sounds intimidating, but I found that while I was using it, I didn&#x27;t notice sound at all, and it didn&#x27;t seem loud to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with a nice pouch to put everything in, but I&#x27;ll just make one :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;My legs initially did not have any redness or bumps after epilating, but that evening (epilated at about noon) after I was wearing skinny jeans, I took them off to find my legs all red and a little bit tender to the touch like mild razor burn. Sleeping mostly fixed it, and by midday again all was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the shower before epliating my legs, I shaved armpits and pubic area. Today I felt the hair has regrown enough to try epilating those areas. The directions say for legs only- but hair is hair and I&#x27;m going to use it where I want no hair to be, so there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms were difficult- you can&#x27;t really see what you are doing, even using a mirror. Having sweat glands there also meant that moving the epilator smoothly over the skin was not really possible because it kept sticking to the skin. I ended up removing the efficiency cap with it&#x27;s wide flat area, and this way the rotating of the tweezing disks assisted in smooth forward movement of the epilator. Much better. A few of the lowest pores bled slightly, but nothing major. Nothing hurt overmuch- not as much as the ankle area of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried my pubic region next. The hair is much denser there, and doesn&#x27;t grow quite as fast as my underarms. Still, it was easy to go slowly (left the efficiency cap off) and I tried to keep the skin taunt in one direction or another. I believe the flatter hairs here meant that some tugs of pain were the hair not quite being removed the first time. The edges, even in my leg crease were easy and pain was slight, but near the edges of the labia or \\&quot;lips\\&quot; the hairs are very fine and compact, and it was very tricky to go slowly. That area was sensitive, but not as sensitive as the high edge of the triangle of hair, in the center. I only epilated the main triangle, doing most of the visible hair- down to about level with the beginning of the crease for labia and genitals. The pores in my pubic area did bleed, mostly up high in the sides of the triangle. The hairs coming out were a LOT longer than what was actually showing above the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not shower beforehand this time, as I feel that the hot water, while it may open pores, also weakens the hair itself, making it more likely to break instead of come out. So I took my shower afterwards this time. The water (and soap) stung my underarms quite painfully (I&#x27;d say worse than the epilating). My pubic area didn&#x27;t care about water, soap, or scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m SO happy I finally purchased one of these!!</li>
            <li> It was good  but there&#x27;s one thing I don&#x27;t like is it has no Betery in side. Have to using it when it&#x27;s charging.  Only 3 star.</li>
            <li> Life saver! Best money spent yet.</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected. You have to understand that all epilators hurt, pretty much the same degree. To me the pain is not bad. I prefer the one with the cord instead of battery since the power is stronger. I had a battery one. The battery died quick. Overall I&#x27;m content with this one.</li>
            <li> For as inexpensive as this little number is I&#x27;m not going to complain. This thing works and does the job it just takes a number of passes to get all the hairs, I try going in different directions if it doesn&#x27;t get them up after the first two initial passes. It is noisy and a little painful depending on your pain tolerance but not unbearable and in my opinion hurts less then if you nick yourself shaving. You control the use  and speed (I rarely ever use the second setting), the first couple times I would do small sections at a time and take breaks in between but as you get used to the sensation it&#x27;s easier to just keep going once you&#x27;ve started. Overall for the price and as a beginner with epilation its a good investment hairs take significantly longer to grow back then they do withat shaving/creams overy time some wont come back at all. I do think I want something that covers a little more surface area (wider with maybe multiple heads) now that I&#x27;m used to epilating it&#x27;s just a matter of shelling out the $$ for a nicer one.</li>
            <li> Okay, it&#x27;s not perfect, I still have a few whispy hairs left after use (are they too short/thin?), but I gleaned that repeated use of this device over time will ultimately be my solution. I&#x27;ve looked pretty hairfree for over a month or two now, and it&#x27;s been with almost no care or effort on my part. With a razor, you have a perfect full blanket of stubble in 3 days or so and wonder if it&#x27;s worth it. It hurts like hell on places you&#x27;re not supposed to use it on. But effective. I&#x27;m not yet sure about longterm small marks on the skin, I&#x27;m older so it&#x27;s less of a concern to me. The first time I used it I thought I was going to jump out of my skin and was surprised at how much it hurt, and I&#x27;ve had regular electrology sessions for three years! I&#x27;ve decided I prefer waxing, but can&#x27;t afford full-body treatments all the time, being on a budget. After a use or two I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt anymore, until I try it on a new area (the instructions clearly state not to do this). I find it an effective longterm solution. No infected ingrown hairs yet (??) I like the device, it works, it&#x27;s pretty, convenient, made well, durable, and inexpensive. Definitely a cheaper solution than the others I&#x27;ve tried, and with regular but infrequent maintenance it does the job. I appreciate the review and the tip here that you could do a full shaving first, and then use this periodically as hair begins to grow in. It doesn&#x27;t get all hairs with each use, it&#x27;s more of a some here and there or most each time, but over time definitely works and lasts *much* longer, with quick repeated uses here and there maintaining a hairless look indefinitely. I recommend this device, have not tried the others.</li>
            <li> So much faster than waxing! Although I can&#x27;t say it hurts less than waxing, especially the first time you use it. I love that the hair, when it does return is much softer that the hair it took off. Facial hair is more painful to remove, especially upper lip hair, than other hair.  Follow the direction and it will do a good job for you.</li>
            <li> I have only used it on my underarms but couldn&#x27;t take the pain!! I started on low (now I let my hair grow a few days for this) and when I tried to roll it over the hair it felt like bee stings ...I tried for about 5mins to see if the pain would just be bearable but NO...so I tried taking a hot bath (soaking my body plus underarms) to soften the area but it was still just as painful. NOW I HAVE TONS OF TATTOOS so I use to pain but this is on a whole other level of pain in MY opinion.</li>
            <li> Man does it hurt. But it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Absolutely  loved it! Wish I bought more than one, so as to hang on to it for future need. Performance is wonderful. I used it for upper lips and it&#x27;s great at capturing even the tiniest bit of fuzz. Left me feeling totally smooth. I am curious though, if it&#x27;s going to cause ingrown  hair. If my opinion  changes, I will be back to update my review. But from what I have experienced this far, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 months now. It hurt really bad the first time as this was my first epilator even though I&#x27;ve been waxing my armpits previous to using the epilator and my armpit hair was fairly thin (due to the waxing). Honestly, I feel like waxing works better and hurts way less. From my experience with this particular epilator, it does not seem to pull the hair from the root. I feel like it simply cuts the hair. My armpit hair was thinner when it regrew after I waxed it but with the epilator, it grew back thicker, as if I had shaved it. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this and hoped it would end plucking and harsh chemical hair removers,  but it wasn&#x27;t meant to be. First, it&#x27;s very painful. More so than I anticipated for chin and upper lip areas. Also the hair has to be fairly long for in order for the head to grab it. If that did happen, regrowth happened just as quickly as with waxing and chemical remivers5. It also causes skin irritation.  Perhaps other users may gave better luck.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about 2 wks.  The first time I plugged it in and used it, I only made it up to my knees.  I used it again a few days later, and finished my legs.  The next time, I &amp;#34;trimmed&amp;#34; a bit higher.  So far, everything looks perfect for say, wearing a skirt in public but still feels pretty stubbly.  I don&#x27;t think the hair is being cut off instead of pulled, but I&#x27;m not sure.  I am continuing to go over the same areas every couple of days and since there isn&#x27;t much hair left, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I&#x27;d love to know if anyone else has experienced this, and if over time the legs are actually smooth.  Hopefully by the time we&#x27;re back to warm weather I will be 100% satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely happy with the purchase though.  I&#x27;ve used both speeds successfully.  The head is very efficient and works quickly, which minimizes pain.  It isn&#x27;t hard to get each area completely clear (I think my problem has to do w/ hair that grows in later).</li>
            <li> Hurts worse than getting a tattoo!</li>
            <li> For what this little machine should do it&#x27;s doing it very well. In time, you get used to the slight pain during the hair removal but the results are so much longer. I like that it has  faster speed, 20 minutes top and I&#x27;m done with my hair removal all over;gotta exfoliate a bit to avoid ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work, does NOT feel pleasant. Spent forever trying to get it to work and it was pointless. Got a full refund</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it as often but so far I like it. I use it primarily for my legs. Its louder than I thought, slight scary noise, but the end result is smooth legs. Hair grows in lighter and thinner than shaving so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> I used this epilator over a week ago and my hair still hasn&#x27;t grown back!!  It&#x27;s a little difficult to get used to, at first, since it is painful.  But it&#x27;s totally worth it!!!  When I shave, my hair grows back almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie, it&#x27;s not the most pleasant thing in the world to use. However the hair takes much longer to grow back compared to shaving, and it does appear to be growing back thinner. In the long run I think it will be worth it, but actually using it takes a while and is a bit painful.</li>
            <li> It does work well, but the only problem is painful,really painful...</li>
            <li> I am not sure of usage, but so far its very painful for me, infact I didn&#x27;t feel much pain while wax, but this machine is horrible and can&#x27;t say if I am going to continue with this.</li>
            <li> Painful at first but after doing 1/2 a leg, you get use to the pain. I used lidocane cream for my bikini area which made it tolerable. But a good product and now I am addicted. Great for your first one. UPDATE:: after a couple uses I&#x27;ll be looking for a stronger one before summer is up. It leaves hairs on the legs and isn&#x27;t strong enough for the bikini. It will work for now and is still a good first one, but not good if you are determined to use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I like it.</li>
            <li> It says painless in the description but I would beg to differ. I allowed my friend to try it and she thought differently.if you can&#x27;t handle waxing I would not recommend this device. But a lot less irritation than waxing and very smooth finish. Ps (this is only for legs)</li>
            <li> Does what it supposed to do, pull out hair. You definitely have to exfoliate after or before. I usually wax and ingrowns are common here and there but i felt like i had tons of ingrown hair after i used the epilator. I dont think its just this epilator that causes ingrowns, i think epilating in general causes ingrowns so make sure to exfoliate daily. Was it painful? Yes but if you wax regularly then its no different. After a few minutes your skin becomes kinda numb and at that point your just focused on getting all the hairs! Kinda like a tattoo after a few minutes your body kinda just gets used to the pain. This is a great alternative to waxing or shaving. Definitely saves you money and time. Gave it 3 stars because its kinda loud and i feel like it almost breaks the thicker hair. Its great on fine, fuzzy hair but not thicker coarser hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice; When I used it first time, feels bit hurt, but after a minutes I was getting use to it and doesn&#x27;t feel hurt anymore;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friend;</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted to try an epilator, so I ordered this one for her birthday.  She says that it works great and she likes it very much.  I read many reviews before choosing this one and chose it because of the good reviews and the price.</li>
            <li> The noise is loud and it&#x27;s quite scary at first but after the initial scare, it&#x27;s really not that bad! I now have no trouble epilating my underarms and have epilated all other parts of my body :) My best buy of the summer!</li>
            <li> It is a good product. The only drawback is  that it needs to be rolled really slow on the leg.</li>
            <li> As a first time user, I can&#x27;t compare this epilator with other brands. What I can say is that while it does hurt, if it means that I don&#x27;t have to shave for a month it&#x27;s definitely worth it. My biggest complaint is that I had to go over the same area several times before it was smooth and there was some bleeding on the most sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Excellent product  I&#x27;m not going to use razors anymore !</li>
            <li> This epilator works great!!!! But for 3 months tops. I bought my first one back in February and loved it. It was quick and easy, and it hurt way less than the dozens of other epilators I have bought. Then it stopped working. I would plug it in and it would turn on and off as I used and got progressively worse. I thought it was defective so I bought another one and the same thing happened, except it only took about a month and a half for the same problems to surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunteately, this is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it doesn&#x27;t work on my face. But it&#x27;s great for body hair removal.</li>
            <li> ouch, ouch, and ouch...BUT SOOOOOOOOOO worth it</li>
            <li> Only for legs and arms, very painful if you use in some sensitive area.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver for the hair under my chin.  It hurts a little because it seemingly removes the hair by the roots.  After using it for at least three times, the hair is gone.  I know that the hair may return at a later date, but I&#x27;m sure it will be slower returning.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Works very well and gets rid of fine and coarse hairs alike. Only thing is it&#x27;s not chargeable. If you want to use this product it has to be plugged in. However it&#x27;s still a great product and I recommend it!</li>
            <li> very fast shipping great product</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get enough of this product. I have always shaved my legs but over the years my leg hairs started growing faster and darker. I would literally have to shave everyday but would get bad razor burn so I couldn&#x27;t. Even on the days I shaved, within a few hours I had stubble. It was terrible and I hated it. I had never tried waxing but really wanted to and while looking up waxes, I came across epilators. I read up on it and decided to try the Braun silk epil or something like that. It cost me $100 at target. Needless to say, it didn&#x27;t work. It broke off a lot of the hairs and was so painful. I couldn&#x27;t even finish half of one leg. Then I came across this little bad boy, Philips satinelle. I was skeptical at first because if a $100 epilator didn&#x27;t work, why would a $25 one work...right? I decided to give it a try anyways and so happy that I did. It works! It definitely hurts but not as painful as the Braun. The pain was tolerable. I kept stopping to make sure it was pulling the hairs from the root and it was for sure. It took me a while to get every hair but it&#x27;s worth it. For the first time in yearssss my legs were silky smooth for more than a day. They stayed smooth for a whole week!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;ll probably never use a razor on my legs again.</li>
            <li> The most I can do with this devil is my underarms. I thought everyone was just being dramatic but this thing hurts like hell. Never again will I purchase an epillator.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend, and decided to give it a try. It doesn&#x27;t remove much hair, and you have to go over and over a spot several times to even get close to removing some hair. Compared to other epilators I&#x27;ve seen, this one is simply okay--borderline bad.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife couple of months ago and she is extremely happy about it so far and thankful..</li>
            <li> For the price of this epilator the quality is great! I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks but it absolutely does the job.</li>
            <li> This was my first ever epilator and it worked great for the first month. Now it works have the time so it takes twice as long to finish same area. It is a good size and easy to use though. I feel like I&#x27;ll need to replace it soon though because it works less and less every time.</li>
            <li> If I can throw it away breaking it into pieces, that might do it some justice. Completely useless and waste of money. Had to go buy a Braun to get anything done.</li>
            <li> Had to buy it when moving to the US from Europe (where I used Braun SilkEpil 3) and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;+ Washable head, small size, two speeds that are perfectly fast&lt;br /&gt;- no pochette, no cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who only used razor: it hurts? Yes. Is it worth suffering for smooth legs: Definately yes, hair grow back thinner and less crowded.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t live without it and for the price, it is heaven.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt that much, but it also doesn&#x27;t get all the hair.  In the time it would have taken me to shave from ankle to hip, I removed half of the hair off one half of one leg. Maybe I need practice with it, but I had higher hopes for it.</li>
            <li> This is the best the first time I use it was scary but after my skin get use to , now I will never shave again besti thing ever , and fast shipment !</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use an epilator! It works great!!!! I love it!!! No pain at all! It arrived faster than expected. 5 starts!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I used a couple different epilator before finding this one. It&#x27;s actually the cheapest, and yet the best of all the epilators I&#x27;ve ever used. I feel no pain and I am done in no time with this one. Can&#x27;t recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator before and was dreading the pain. It is painful but you get used to it- just like every other aspect of grooming! I like how the product is small and nifty and does a good job.</li>
            <li> OK - Maybe I&#x27;m a wimp - but OUCH!!!  Lordy.... If you have a high pain tolerance - knock yourself out. It certainly pulls the hairs out - but I think I&#x27;ll just go back to shaving....  ;-)</li>
            <li> It hurts, I can stand the pain. Just makes ingrown hairs. The hairs are too fine to break the skin. So I&#x27;m taking a break from it. I&#x27;ll shave til winter, use it again. Or maybe switch off. It has made a big difference in only three uses.</li>
            <li> Its a great product but at first i thought it is good to use it down there and arm pits but when i read the directions i found out its not for that but its good for legs but takes too long..</li>
            <li> Did not work well, had to go over areas way too many times and still did not remove any hair!</li>
            <li> It gets the hair off, but you have to go slow. The long lasting results is a little far fetched and it hurts like no other, but it does remove the hair..</li>
            <li> I use this one time and its been about a week and hair has not grown back if you do get this and u use it make shore you use it a day or two be for u go out because it would leave red bumps after using it . I use this on my shoulders the only why I can explain how this feels on my arms it feels like im getting a tattoo</li>
            <li> This is a great no-frills epilator at the price point. It does the job, (even more efficiently if the guard is removed), and it was only about $25. That said, epilators are pretty painful - especially over bony areas. You will also likely have to go over the area multiple times to remove all the hair.</li>
            <li> It works...but it&#x27;s incredibly slow about it, which makes it incredibly painful. Yeah, I only have to use it about once ever two weeks, but it takes half an hour to do a nice job. Lol...and Tylenol afterward.</li>
            <li> As good as your going to get just just short of actually shaving.</li>
            <li> a waste of money a teriible product does nothing it says it does  want my money back  very disapointed</li>
            <li> First time using an epilator. My husband walked in on me while I was using it for the first time and saw how giddy I was so he left me be with my new favorite gadget! Personally, I hate shaving and waxing in the summertime is too long of a wait in between each wax. I&#x27;ve lasered my legs but still get some occasional random hairs and this thing plucked them right out with such speed! It&#x27;s a little painful but only on areas that are sensitive. Trust me, the joy you get with seeing all your hair disappear makes the discomfort worth it.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator I it isn&#x27;t as painful as I expected. I like how easy it is to use and that the cord is long. The more you use it the easier and less pain you have.</li>
            <li> Works great and better than my old Braun shaving device</li>
            <li> Wife loves it thats all that matters</li>
            <li> Best way to remove unwanted hair. It removed all the hair off my legs and arms and left a smooth silky skin.  I wish I had found this product before. The best deal.</li>
            <li> So I let the hair under my arms grow out bc I&#x27;m tired of shaving and trying to lighten up the skin. Package arrived on time and I looked up many YouTube videos and wowsers I was scared. First time using it, it hurt so bad. It took a couple of pep talks to get thru the initial use. Afterwards tho, the pain wasn&#x27;t so bad. The noise and the speed of the tweezers is intimidating but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> After reading negative reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy this product. I am so glad I ignored them and bought it anyways! This is easy to use and clean. It does a fantastic job. It hurts no worse than tweezing. And after using it s few times, it hurts less and less each time. It does wonders on your face.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying an epilator, however, I have tried at home waxing. When I did try to wax, I was left with welt, redness, and bruising. Although epilating is more painful than you could imagine (it feels like being stabbed with a bunch of needles), it&#x27;s so much better than shaving! Hair comes in thinner and your legs are smooth for about a week. It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair, there is definitely a lot of breakage but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be able to figure out why in due time.  ***UPDATE*** I&#x27;ve changed my four star review to a five star. After giving up because of the pain, I decided to get this baby out again for another round. But this time I did more research!  Things that helped ease the pain for me: - Pull your skin taught! - Hold the epilator at a 90 degree angle - Do not press it into your skin - Work in small circles moving the epilator in a circular motion THIS IS THE KEY - Put on some music or a tv show to distract yourself  After finding these tricks, I was able to get through both legs. You won&#x27;t be able to get every hair so I recommend going over your legs again in a few days. The biggest reason why I changed my four star review to a five star review is because the hair grew in finer! Even the course hair! I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> it is eally hurt and will be blood</li>
            <li> Are you a real woman? Have you suffered through your own hymenal rupture, birthed a child or suffered the stinging agony of being rejected by a man? Have you reflected with rue upon a dinner party you ruined through your own juvenile, drunken antics? Then you are ready for this product. It hurts, but it will enchant you for a short while because you want to feel tough. Actually it only hurts the first few times, but then you get used to it.   I was excited to try a new method of hair removal. I don&#x27;t know what my beef is with shaving. I mean, nothing is going to get you smooth like a razor blade. I also thread my eyebrows. You might say I enjoy maximizing my hair removal repertoire, as in my mind this equates with maximizing my womanliness.  Your first time: So upon tibial touchdown, I felt an electrifying jolt of pain - much like that of a thousand hairs being torn from their follicles all at once. Enchanted, I continued to wave this magical device over my lower limbs, waiting to see if the pain might be any different if I kept on going, or if it was just going to continue on. It continued on. Soon, however, after several passes, my leg began to feel silky. Not shaved-silky mind you, but more than silky enough. I realized that meant I was done. I was pretty disappointed at the brevity of the encounter, so I promptly moved on to my armpits.  The armpits were really fun to do. Did you know your armpit hairs are, like, an inch long? You will, once you use this product! Wow. This thing worked perfectly on my armpits. Better than the legs, and the legs were pretty good.  I tentatively moved to the crotch area, but I&#x27;d just gotten out of the damn shower and I was too moist for there to be any traction. (Do not try this.) Later, I gave it a shot. Ouchhhhh. It results in a very smooth bikini area, no question. In fact, this product works better on stouter hair.  So I moved up to the quintessential delicate area of the upper lip. Like the slap of a burning hot rubber band,my &#x27;stache was GONE. It took several passes, ostensibly because I was a first-timer and my lip hair was unaccustomed to such insult. But you gotta grow up sometime, lip hair. Might as well be today. Still, again, it was not as sleek as a razor by any means.  Easily one of the most exciting things about using this product is the sheer volume of hair that comes out of the thing, much like a lawn mower. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it. And not only the hair comes out, mind you. Oh no. You get the entire hair bulb.  I had this friend in high school you know - beautiful girl - and her prom dress was strapless. But she was a full-blooded Italian lass and heaven help her, you could see her dark armpit hair shadow every time she hoisted her arms to do the YMCA, in spite of the fact that it was clear she&#x27;d just shaved. This could have done her a world of good.  So I will continue using this for pubic and armpit hair (nice long lasting results on the pubic area, somewhat less long lasting on armpits) but I won&#x27;t be using anything but a razor for legs or stache. First it takes too long, second it is painful, and third you really don&#x27;t get that sleekness you get from a fresh razor. Still, Recommended highly for how great a job it does on coarse hair. If you have coarse hair all over, this might be a great solution for you.  Protip: after epilating, always disinfect. You will get pimples if you do not. Personally I recommend purel even for the pubic area. It burns of course, but you just ripped out the hair on your vagina. What do you care? Also there is a special sphere of heaven for women who can address those stout hairs on the labia area just above the clitoris with an epilator. I can do it. So can you.  Actually, I don&#x27;t recommend this any longer. The hairlessness doesn&#x27;t seem to last that much longer, and I got tired of infected follicles. I did disinfect the rotating portion of the device regularly, after each use. But the bacteria must hide in all those cracks and crevices. I have returned to shaving. The results are instant, they don&#x27;t result in pimples, and the effect is, overall, silkier.  But heck, give it a try. Much like other aspects of passage into womanhood, first it hurts, then you get used to it, then you sort of like it, and then you get bored with it and try something else.</li>
            <li> Quick &amp; easy. I don&#x27;t need to shave as much anymore &amp; easy to clean. My skin is smoother &amp; has a better appearance. It is like a large tweezer, so if u can&#x27;t stand the pain of tweeting or waxing, then stick to the razor. Beauty is pain.</li>
            <li> I expected more to be truly honest. I&#x27;ll be completely transparent for a moment, my hair grows fast, and with that fast growing hair are in-grown hairs which the epilator cant really grab. I found myself scheduling when to use it so I would not just get the hairs above the skin but give time for the hairs under the skin to come through. Im a college student, so let me just say, I can spend my time doing more productive things. Overall, it didn&#x27;t really work for me and it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain. BACK TO SHAVING!</li>
            <li> The hairs on my legs grow slower when I use the epilator! Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is cutting the hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull it.</li>
            <li> Good price do what it&#x27;s made to do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Philips epilator for probably a year now since I purchased it.  It is going strong.  Love it more then the original rotating spring epilady that I used for probably over 15 years before it gave up the ghost.  Wasn&#x27;t sure I would like the new tweezers design over the rotating spring, but it works great and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I got the European version of the Satinelle (Remington) back home in Europe, which is perfect, so when I came to the U.S on vacation I decided to get this one, but I&#x27;m not at all satisfied because sometimes it cuts your hairs instead of pulling them</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my other very expensive epilator by emjoi which only lasted a year or two until recently it starts to make this awful squeaky noise and the tweezers in it doesn&#x27;t turn. It is rechargeable, and for some wierd and unknown reason it doesn&#x27;t charge up anymore. It only works with the cord. Because of my bad experience with the emjoi brand, I decided to try a much cheaper brand. I am so glad I did. My emjoi cost me close to 100 bucks, as this one which works way better only cost my around $30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little unit which is so easy to use is unbelievably fast  for its small size! Even though it has two speeds, I only use the first one since it is fast enough already. I don&#x27;t have much need for the second speed yet. I love this one more than my other because it is shaped kind of flat, not fat or chunky like my other epilator, and also very lightweight. Easy to use. I love the size of it most of all which makes it so handy and compact..very simple and easy to travel with. I only wish it came with a travel/storage pouch but that&#x27;s alright and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all because I store it in a small, zippered cosmetic bag/purse you can buy anywhere. It&#x27;s such a nice gadget that I wish the company could have given a small cleaning brush with it as most other epilators do, even though I use the brush that came with my other epilator. This unit only comes with a power cord that is quite long, which is great. It is not rechargeable so you have to use it with the cord plugged in which I like more because my other one was rechargeable and the charge didn&#x27;t last as long as I wished. Maybe about 40 minutes and sometimes you do need extra time. I recommend a corded epilator. I know it can be harder when you travel as you may not always find an outlet source but I still think it is better since you can give yourself as much time as you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well, very fast as I said and seems to get the job done in a shorter time period as I did not expect. It does pull out all the hair by the root like waxing. It can be used for the legs, arms, bikini line, underarms, anywhere really. I have only tried it on my legs, arms and even my face which it a little hard due to its size so it is better to get a smaller unit made for the face and smaller areas for that. All epilators, or I should say &amp;#34;Epilation&amp;#34; DOES hurt, maybe even A WHOLE LOT for some, but only in the beginning like your first and/or second attempts. As you epilate more and more, the pain DOES get less and less each time until one day you don&#x27;t feel any pain at all. Believe me as I have been epilating for years. They do cause ingrown hairs, so as they say, it is more wise to exfoliate in a warm shower beforehand. You can use any exfoliating sponge, mits or soap you can get anywhere. For the redness like bumps on the skin after epilation, use some good creams and the redness will go away. All in all, I highly recommend this epilator for the money. I think cheap or expensive ones all are the same pretty much. I&#x27;m glad this one works so well and is great for what I paid. It is great for both men and women. Have fun epilating and enjoy smooth skin! Much better and easier than messy waxing. Faster too!</li>
            <li> i ordered three (3) of this and gave this as gifts to my sisters in the Philippines.&lt;br /&gt;Before I mailed them in my country, I tried one on my legs and its okay.  Only thing is u have to plug it if u will use it.  Battery will not charge.</li>
            <li> Hurts at first but gets easier later on</li>
            <li> its wired, a little bit uneasy.&lt;br /&gt;and painful if moving slowly</li>
            <li> I got this epilator, because my old one (Remington) got the power plug broken and I thought they do not sell same power plugs, but they do, so now I have two epilators in case one of them breaks down I am not left hairy while shopping for a new one!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am very satisfied with this Philips epilator. I did a lot of research online before I decided to buy it and I think I made the right choice. My personal preferences were:&lt;br /&gt;1. It has to be usable with and without cord or just with cord. This device comes with a pretty long cord.&lt;br /&gt;I know that a lot of newer models come cordless (cord is only for charging), but I have read so many bad reviews about inside batteries dying after just some time of using it that I did not want cordless one. What&#x27;s the use of it if your battery dies and you cannot use it with cord? Besides my Remington could be used w/wo cord, so that was convenient when it&#x27;s battery started dying down and it still is when fully used on cord.&lt;br /&gt;2. I do not care if it can be used in the shower or have all sorts of extra fancy parts that also comes with appropriate amount of extra $$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this device is really good for the money. The only downside it is pretty loud, my old one is not as loud, but it is pretty bearable.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of pain, I think they all inflict some sort of pain, but I am very used to it now anyway, so it is not a big deal for me anyway. I&#x27;ve read somewhere that the least painful time to do it is just after your period, when you body has more tolerance for pain. Not sure if this is true, but you can experiment with it.</li>
            <li> I never bought an epilator before,so did not know how it is going to be.I read some good reviews about it,so i bought.But so painful and it even peeled my skin off.I am looking for some pain free stuff</li>
            <li> epilator working great! for me it is the best decision to remove hair. for such price - i love it!</li>
            <li> i like it so much. really help me a lot. I need only less time to finish things. definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and i read a bunch of reviews before i purchased this one. why did i get this one? The price . it was inexpensive and if i didn&#x27;t like it i wasn&#x27;t going to feel guilty. It is painful, but tolerable. It takes me about two hours to finish my legs. i still shave afterwards for the smooth finish . My hair grows thinner each time and i don&#x27;t have to epilate often. Once every month. so far so good. i may try other ones but for a beginner as myself this is a decent one.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a conair epilator I had died. This one wasn&#x27;t as good at catching my fine hair. I&#x27;d have to go back over areas more than a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like epilators over waxing because it&#x27;s not as messy/sticky, but this one almost isn&#x27;t worth the trouble. It was good for getting majority of my fine hair (I have very fine hair on my legs) but still left quite a few for plucking with tweezers or just plain shaving (which defeats the purpose for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it on both speeds, going over the areas both slowly and quickly with the epilator facing either way, guard on and off, and still misses hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the up side, it does seem to work under my arms on THICKER hair very well. (I cleaned it and tried it on my upper lip which also has fine hairs and it misses a lot of hairs there as well). At least my underarms will be hair free heh.</li>
            <li> This epilator is very good and fast, I&#x27;ve had more expensive models but this one in my opinion is equally as good. Shipment was really fast and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Does its job very well.</li>
            <li> It hurts, I&#x27;ve used it many times and it hurts so bad I cannot get a good finish. Keep in mind, I have had Laser hair removal on my pubic regions, I have waxed, I have a large tattoo on my rib cage. This thing leaves stubble. However, it is an awesome tool to motivate the boyfriend to do anything I ask...</li>
            <li> Though it was a rechargeable. But other that that it works great.</li>
            <li> I used to either shave or use sugaring wax. I prefer this method. I was surprised that it is not painful---or at least not painful for someone used to waxing. I can feel it, but it&#x27;s just not what I would call a painful experience. It&#x27;s not as aggressive a method as waxing so I did have to go over a few areas again, but it also started to work more efficiently for me as I got used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator as something to help me deal with some embarrassing, heavy hair on my face. When I received it and read the instructions, it said that the product is designed to be used only on the legs. Not face, not underarms, only the legs. I wish I&#x27;d known this, I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my time.</li>
            <li> Wow at first .. ouch.. but honestly I think it&#x27;s just because you have no idea what it&#x27;s gonna feel like.. but the following times I used this thing.. really not painful at all! I use it on my legs and underarms and am very pleased.. haven&#x27;t been brave enough to try anywhere else! I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> works great so far I wish I could use it without the cable tho</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!!! Every woman should have one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REMEMBER! ( MOST IMPORTANT TIP EVER!!!): WAX FIRST!! I can&#x27;t say this enough. My friends have bought these and then they use it straight from shaving and it BURNS LIKE FIRE!! ...but if you wax your skin first and let the hair grow back in its natural 3 cycle, then it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all and the maintenance is a BREEZE!! I use mine about once a week and just watch some comedy or listen to music and I&#x27;m hair free from the neck down and it is SO NICE not to have to pay for it. No stubble, no wax, and its FREE! I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY!! WAX FIRST!! It really, really is unpleasant if you just use this straight from shaving. I&#x27;ve done it. I hate it. I kick myself every time I let my leg hair all grow back in due to sheer laziness and then I have to epilate at full hair growth. IT HURTS! I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. And ESPECIALLY not for your first use of this. You will never want to use it again! But if you WAX FIRST... legs, armpits, brazilian, upper lip... whatever it is ( I do all of those with this), then when the hair grows back in slowly, slender and shorter, there is almost zero pain and after a few months of weekly maintenance, you will be as happy as I am!! Seriously!! I PROMISE!! I love this thing! (and I really really really really HATE stubble... like stubble is the Bain of my existence! eww gross its gross).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK!! WAX FIRST!!!</li>
            <li> I will just say I returned it.</li>
            <li> Did what it is suppose to do. But, i would recommend to try Epilator with more tweets it will be faster.    NOT PAINFUL # HAPPY</li>
            <li> My first epilator. In the description it says it&#x27;s only for legs but I specifically use it for my underarms and I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it. Easy to use and clean. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected. It&#x27;s effective, though not painless.</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job, but maybe epilators are not for me. still, i do like to have it if I can get over the pain it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Works perfect and doesn&#x27;t hurt too much.</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but it still hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> Does not pull by root so hair grows out stubbly. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like how soft my skin feels after using this product. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t take all the hair out.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  It wont work unless its plugged in, and then you have to dance around a cord.  it is extremely painful, even on the lowest setting.  i have been fighting my hairy legs for way to long and i thought this would be my saving grace, instead i wasted $30 on a piece of trash.</li>
            <li> I did not expect this to work, but it is fantastic. I found the process far less painful than nicking my legs with a razor. In fact, not painful at all, (but I have been conditioned by waxing.) More comfortable than waxing, lasts longer, less expensive and very convenient.</li>
            <li> It takes a time or two to get used to this, but it gets better each time you use it.  Start at your knees, not your ankles, as the ankle area is more tender.  You don&#x27;t have to let hair get as long as when you wax, but get the same benefits of longer without stubble and a natural tapered hair (not blunt and whisker-y) when it does grow in.</li>
            <li> well, it works well especially with legs.&lt;br /&gt;but if you are considering about bikini line, you&#x27;d better watch out.&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this to take care of my bikini line but um.&lt;br /&gt;it hurts. The pain was way worse than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;However, once you get used to it, it won&#x27;t be a matter.&lt;br /&gt;Also quite reasonable price, get it!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t turn on, looked brand new though so it&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault. I&#x27;m not sure if I would try this again</li>
            <li> If you have a decent tolerance to pain, get one.  It will save you hundreds of dollars a year NOT waxing your legs.  I use it on my face sometimes, but it hurts a lot.  I can do my armpits and legs no problem!!!</li>
            <li> There are many contradictory reviews about epilators. Here is yet another review hope it helps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waxed before, used too regularly, but got out of the habit. I have been using disposable razors but I am sick of buying more razors every few weeks. Many reviews said the epilator was like waxing in terms of discomfort. This is true. For me, since I know what to expect with waxing the discomfort wasn&#x27;t shocking. My legs seem to only be sensitive along the shin, and I don&#x27;t shave my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL: Do not wipe the pulled out hairs with a terry cloth towel. The tweezers will grab the towel and twist them into the roller head. I managed to get the towel out, but it was tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my regimen (repeated only once a month wooo!): Take 2 ibuprofen before I get into the shower. Shower and spend a little extra time with wash cloth and HOT water on legs. Rub them vigorously. Get out and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is nice and long on this unit so I put one leg on the toilet lid. I do the shins first while they are still hot, but dry. Then my calves. I wipe off all the pulled out hairs and douse my legs with witch hazel. Using this, I have never gotten a &amp;#34;after epilator&amp;#34; burn or ingrown hairs with this. It cools and numbs and is also anti septic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend witch hazel after epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comment here if you would like any other tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Favs about Epilator:&lt;br /&gt;*1 time per month&lt;br /&gt;*Less time than rasors&lt;br /&gt;*No more buying disposables or cream&lt;br /&gt;*Hair gets finer and finer every regrowth (just like waxing)&lt;br /&gt;*The corded kind will never loose charge</li>
            <li> Very good product and deliver service.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks you.</li>
            <li> It is definitely uncomfortable, but not intolerable. The first few times it worked liked a charm. Lost its effectiveness after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use after a nice hot shower. The pain is so much less and the irritation is much less as well.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t turn on when I opened it and tried to use it. It seems like no body tested it before sending it out. It looks like a cheap quality product. Have to return it to get replacement.</li>
            <li> My mom warned me about her adventure with the original EpiLady, and I listened. I threw caution to the wind and bought this guy. Now, I have a pretty good pain tolerance, but this was different. Yes, it was painful... but not like any pain I&#x27;ve ever felt. It felt like needles sticking into the skin (I don&#x27;t have tattoos, so I&#x27;m not sure if this is the best thing to compare it to... but it&#x27;s what I imagine it feels like). The shin was the worst part... holy cow that&#x27;s sensitive! I made it through, and it didn&#x27;t take too long. All of the hair was not grabbed, as some was too short. I&#x27;ll go back again in a few days for round #2. I did epilate my underarms... I have waxed them before, but thought this would take care of that problem, at least a little. The underarm was not bad, honestly. It took some maneuvering to get my skin taut, but I figured it out :)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any complaints so far... and I&#x27;ll edit this later, if need be. BTW, the cord is really long, so it shouldn&#x27;t be a turn-off if you are looking at this one, versus a cordless, more expensive epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I will say, you should follow the instructions and do this at night. I didn&#x27;t, and I ended up with little red bumps and larger hair follicle holes (I have no clue what the actual name is, lol). Next time I will do this at night, but I had just received it in the mail and lack impulse control.</li>
            <li> OUCH...guess no matter how u do it..pulling hair is a pain.  Otherwise...product is as described.  High quality design.</li>
            <li> First epilator I&#x27;ve tried since the 80s, so I really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with. It takes me quite a while to do my legs with this, but it lasts much longer than shaving. Of course it hurts, but that&#x27;s to be expected when you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your skin, and it does get easier over time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great item for removing hairs! It&#x27;s was painful at the first time but then as i&#x27;m using it often, I feel less pain now Much better and simple then waxing!</li>
            <li> The best epilator brand and model I ever tried in my life. My mom bought it several years ago with a regular use and it still works perfectly. It removes the hair super fast so you don&#x27;t spend useless time. The cheapest hair removing method I know. I am not hairy by nature but with this epilator I am fine for 3 entire weeks!</li>
            <li> It hurts a LOT!! But I suppose that is the case with all the epilators.. Taking a hot bath and then using does help, reducing the pain just a notch. Does the work well. Did not remove lot of hairs in a single pass, requires multiple passes.</li>
            <li> Fits very easily in the hand and works great at what it&#x27;s intended for. The cord is very long, thin, and flexible, so it is very manageable.</li>
            <li> This Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator is as the French say, Parfait. A neat little design which enables easy storage and most importantly does a good job.</li>
            <li> Love this Epliator...I was leery because I know they can hurt but I have these pesky little hairs that pop up and drive me nuts. This little tool banged them right out and it didn&#x27;t even hurt:) Its a MUST!</li>
            <li> although noise level was mentioned In did not find it unusually noisy.  This epilator works better&lt;br /&gt;than my previous conair.  the price was also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> If you are the one who have thick body hairs and don&#x27;t come off easily, this is painful. But, it is worth it and more efficient than shaving with knife or using pin.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not the actual product&#x27;s fault; just my skin..But regardless, I returned it because it kept giving me stubbly legs..I grew out my leg hair so it would work properly but it didn&#x27;t leave smooth skin like the other reviews said. Instead I really wanted to go and shave because my legs felt so prickly.I exfoliated my legs every day and tried again after a few weeks but it still gave me stubbly legs. I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;m very prone to ingrown hair and epilators are just not for me so back to Amazon it went. Surprisingly they accepted it even though it was used..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very jealous of people who can use epilators but I guess it&#x27;s back to razors for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sick of shaving for months now and I&#x27;ve never wanted to try waxing because the pain and I have sensitive skin. I was looking up epilating and wanted to try this one out because of the reviews. I made a great choice. Yes, it does hurt in the beginning and yes, it is frustrating, but the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made a few reminders for myself and wanted to share with all of the new epilator users: 1. Remember to go slow! I know you want to get it all done, but seeing how you (and your skin reacts) to the first little introduction is crucial. Start with a small patch of hair, if you like it continue, if not stop and give yourself a few minute break and start again. 2. Keep the skin taut. This helps with getting the hair by the root out and can be less painful than if you didn&#x27;t do this. After awhile, on my calves, I didn&#x27;t have to keep it taut because it wasn&#x27;t as painful (granted it took 3 or 4 tries, but it does hurt less!) 3. If you get ingrown hairs after, it&#x27;s okay! I&#x27;ve gotten quite a few after doing my full lower leg, and it did frustrate me to no end because it looked noticeable (to me, anyway) that I had missed a few. You didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s okay, breathe and just let the hairs grow back by themselves. 4. Sometimes it doesn&#x27;t get the tiny stubbly hairs, so you&#x27;ll need to let it grow out some. I&#x27;m still learning which is a good length, but experiment from time to time. Too long is more painful and too tiny doesn&#x27;t do anything.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried my underarms or other areas yet (too afraid with how painful those would be) and I just started my thighs. Granted, I&#x27;m doing small patches at a time because the hair there isn&#x27;t as dark as my calves (in some areas, anyway), but the pain isn&#x27;t as bad once you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;If you need to, shave some parts of your legs, wait a few days and then epilate. That helps if you want to try a new area (like the underarms, thighs, etc) because you&#x27;re just pulling out the root and a little of extra hair which makes you feel less pain.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know a lot of professionals have said that this epilator doesn&#x27;t get some hairs, while that is true, I&#x27;ve noticed since my hair grows in many directions, that you need to keep the epilator at a 90 degree angle on your leg and just follow the way the hair grows. It&#x27;s not that hard to do once you do it a few times, and if you have to go 4-7 times over it, what&#x27;s the big deal? Yeah, sometimes I did get frustrated, but I just remembered the results I got and kept going, no matter how long it took me to finish.</li>
            <li> This product is almost painless when I use it on my legs. However, it does not pull out some of the fine hairs, but it does clear the most of it. The long cable is really helpful for my case.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Similar to the older I have. I like it.</li>
            <li> Ok, so it hurt like HECK the first time I used it.  I managed to get both legs done but there was no way I could do my underarms.  Right after using it, my legs had red bumps from irritation (ie don&#x27;t do it right before you go out!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised my legs didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as if they had just been shaved.  On close inspection, I realised it missed maybe half the hairs.  After using it for 3 months, I still feel like it misses a lot of hair.  I end up having to use it once a week but still have stubbly areas.  Probably because some hairs grow slower?  Plus, and this is not aimed at the actual epilator, but the process itself - you have to have stubbly legs in order to use it.  Ew! Also, it breaks some hairs at the skin rather than pulling them out.  The bikini area was ridiculously painful and it is easier to use tweezers to pull each hair one by one (although insanely time-consuming).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m not feeling that it&#x27;s a good substitute for shaving.  My legs are never hair-free because it either misses some, breaks some hairs off at the skin, or the hair is too short.</li>
            <li> This epilator works great for me. For some reason it&#x27;s also less painful to use this epilator than my previous one from a different brand. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean. Will most likely continue buying this one if my current one breaks.</li>
            <li> It does work on my armpit but doesn&#x27;t work for bikini line. It was so hurt when I used it :(</li>
            <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s the first epilator I&#x27;ve had so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else as far as discomfort level. Of course there is a little bit of discomfort but no more so than waxing. It really does a great job in getting a lot of hair in a single pass, and most areas only need the one pass. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Compact, easy to travel and works fine.&lt;br /&gt;A little painful at first but well worth the process.&lt;br /&gt;Less incidents of troublesome spots.</li>
            <li> I bought my Norelco (now Philips) Satinelle Epilator 20 years ago and have had great success and satisfaction with it. It actually worked so well that after about 10 years of use I no longer needed it for my legs at all! Getting older... I had problems with unwanted facial hair and I used it on my face for the last 10 years (not that it was advertised for this purpose). With epilators, you have to bear the initial pain until your hairs adapt to the process... then it becomes easy... more of a tingling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, my poor Satinelle gave out on me recently, but 20 years was a good run. Hoping the newer models have the same life span!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recomended!</li>
            <li> this is a perfect little epilatory machine, and being from philips means quality. The price is very good for such a powerful machine. I had the same one for years and never had trouble with it.</li>
            <li> I would be careful with this one: after less than two months of light usage, the power cord is starting to get temperamental - it needs to be folded in certain ways, otherwise the epilator stops running. This doesn&#x27;t bode well for its longevity.  Editing:  I would say that the power cord is not that big of a deal any more - I&#x27;ve used it with a different one and it has been working consistently. It does well on the armpits, though I can never seem to get all my leg hairs out. Still pretty good though.</li>
            <li> Love it, and people love what is does to my legs and hands. I also use it to clean my side burns.</li>
            <li> you get your moneys worth from this</li>
            <li> I first purchased a Satinelle several years ago when I saw it in a sale bin. I was very pleased with it.  When it came time to replace it - I thought I&#x27;d try a more expensive epilator. I was disappointed. I came back to this.  It does a good job of removing unwanted hair. It is also great in removing the occasional rogue facial hair. If you have never epilated or waxed before - it will hurt the first few times you use it.  The more you use it the discomfort will become less.</li>
            <li> THis works fine.  You kind of have to let you hairs grow out to see if it works.  It does the job for the price.</li>
            <li> Hurts a bit. I liked how it looked a day after I epilated. I bled a little when using, also I noticed if you rub the areas with a alcohol on a rag, then epilate while it&#x27;s kinda tingly, it hurts less. Causes some wicked ingrown hairs, though. Don&#x27;t push the device against the skin too hard or your skin will be red and painful (learn from experience)</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Was afraid of at first but now am used to it. It works! My facial hair around the lips is gone and what has grown back are very sparce and much lighter hairs and I only used it once so far. My understanding is that the more regularly you use it the less the hairs grow back. They are coming out by the roots after all, I am loving the change and the stress of having mustache hairs is gone!! I would by it again if necessary but the epilator itself is extremely well made. Thanks for this. :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! It removes my unwanted hair flawlessly with very little pain.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll let you guess what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than my own stupidity, this thing does a pretty good job of ripping the hairs out of my legs. First time was a bit of a bust, resulting in VERY red &amp; bumpy skin and not a ton of hair reduction. But it&#x27;s been getting better and better with continued use. And the noise when a hair is sucked up is very satisfying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months now. It is the second Philips epilator I&#x27;ve used. This one pulls the hairs out quite well and works anywhere on the body one wants to remove hair. It is quieter than my previous one. Considering the price I consider it a bargain and recommend it.</li>
            <li> It pulls but not very well.</li>
            <li> Works Great. I use it on facial hair. The pain isn&#x27;t as severe as I thought. But it does hurt when using it on my lip</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 1st time user of an epilator.  I didn&#x27;t follow the directions and exfoliate my skin, a few days before using it.  But I did use the guard cap the first time I used it.  It wasn&#x27;t very effective.  Sure, the hairs were shorter, but I had stubble. So, a week later I tried it without the guard cap and was pleased with the results.  It took a bit of work, because the hair on the back of my calves grow sideways, so I had to use a different angle on those areas. I was careful not to press down too much.  It was a bit painful on areas that had longer hair (my arms), but not too much discomfort on my legs.  I had no rash or sore skin.  I did apply a body moisturizing cream, immediately afterwards and that helped the dry areas.  It&#x27;s been a week since I used it and I have regrowth/stubble, but it is softer.  And that was after only 1 use.  I will continue to use it to see how effective it is at removing hair and softening regrowth.</li>
            <li> It works well but it hurts more than expected. I would recommend buying. As they say, pain is beauty. Clean finish.</li>
            <li> I will never use a razor again! no more stubble ever! now it is uncomfortable the first few times you use it. but as your hair grows back  in it&#x27;s finer and finer .so fine that you will have to look at your legs to know that you need to use it again.the discomfort becomes minimal after a few uses. iv&#x27;e had mine for about a year and it performs just as well as when  i started. it&#x27;s a great product. i would buy it again. great price also.</li>
            <li> i used it over a month its good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really nice, i like it  very much</li>
            <li> Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator is very delicate. You must go over the hair SEVERAL times before the desired result is accomplished. No noticeable hair is &amp;#34;plucked&amp;#34; with the first pass.</li>
            <li> This works great. I love not having to risk getting cuts or razor burn.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pick up the hair clean enough. And often misses hairs, even after going after the spot multiple times. Designed for legs (at least that&#x27;s what it saids). I use it on my arm pits too and again the same problem, it misses hairs even though it they are long enough and I go over it a few times. It&#x27;s acceptable for the price. And quite pleased about it.</li>
            <li> It works better then any other epilator I have ever had. The hair grow slower and the epilation process is way faster and with very little pain.</li>
            <li> Good! Very good for the price!&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for an epilator everywhere but apparently they don&#x27;t use this very much in the States.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and it works fine for me (I&#x27;ve only tryed two type of epilators in my life: this and a Braun one and they work the same).&lt;br /&gt;The best part about epilators is that you save so much money of waxing!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice but cheap epilator go for it!</li>
            <li> It is very painful to use this epilator, besides it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair. I thought I would have a very bold skin either the legs and under the arms, but the hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled 100%.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product. It is not that effective. The hair grows back really quick. Moreover you have to do again and again to remove the hair. It doesn&#x27;t come out in one go.</li>
            <li> This does the job!  Had some concerns at first because of my dry skin, but the exfoliating cream should be used with this.  Good product!</li>
            <li> GOod but painful.&lt;br /&gt;GOod but painful.&lt;br /&gt;GOod but painful.&lt;br /&gt;GOod but painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get some red dots after I use this.  but whatever.</li>
            <li> It works very well but not so good as my previous one (Braun). And there in no bag to carry it, what would be very practical.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I have used before. I chose to buy one because I have sensitive skin and my legs itch after shaving. I will admit, it does hurt a lot when you first use it. But, after a few times it does get less painful (or I just got used to it). After the first use, I definitely noticed a difference. My legs did not itch from the epilator and the hair grew back a lot slower. I love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Satinelle was delivered about an hour ago.  In less than a half hour, I&#x27;ve done both my legs and underarms.  It got every hair from my underarms, and it looks like I got everything off my legs and even my feet.  The underarms hurt a little bit and were slightly irritated, but it didn&#x27;t last long.  I must have a high pain tolerance, because so many people whine about it.  It looks like it pulled the hair with the roots attached, so I am hoping it will be much like having a wax and last a good while.  I&#x27;ve shaved for years and my hair is pretty coarse.  I usually have to shave every day in the summer.  Anyway, I&#x27;m very impressed.  And, it is clear why this little thing is the best seller in this category on Amazon.</li>
            <li> less messier than wax and quick .</li>
            <li> I have very thick grotesque hair on my legs and have been desperately searching for a solution to shaving! I mean, by lunch time i&#x27;ve got a 5-oclock shadow! My legs are that bad! I thought about doing laser treatment, home laser treatments, nair, 6-blade razors, the list goes on! nothing seemed to work! until i found this product! Its not the most expensive, which is awesome! And it mights not be the nicest one on the market, but it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT HUUUUUURRTTT BAADDDD the first time!! Holy cow! But i have been using it about 1 time a week for the past month! I&#x27;ve only had to shave my legs one time! In a whole month! 1 time!! its awesome! the epilator yanks all of the hair it can grab, so what grows back is thinner and more sparse. It didnt hurt nearly as bad the second time, and barley hurts at all now after 4 times! It doesnt get my legs silky smooth, but i no longer have to worry about my legs appearing hairy and no more razor bumps! this is a perfect solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with bad hair growth issues! This Phillips is nice for what you pay for. I have to make two or three passes for it to grab all of the hair, but thats ok, it still works! I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this.  Be forewarned lotionize yourself before shaving it&#x27;ll save you on some pain.  Men,  you can do you chest hair, back hair, but do not do it down under you are in a world of pain if you try.  Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn ya.</li>
            <li> this product works great, i have had it for over a month, its just a bit loud but i can live with it for that price</li>
            <li> Santinelle was the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever had. My first one lasted 10 years but got burnt in a trip to Europe since I forgot and plugged it in a 220v outlet... After that I decide to buy a Panasonic rechargeable epilator but hated it... It would die in the middle of the depilatory process and wouldn&#x27;t work while charging. So, I decide to buy the Santinelle again.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you I really enjoy it. It&#x27;s tiny and light. The power cord has a good size so it allows me to use it in the bath tub. It comes with a cap to use when epilating in the most sensitive areas but I usually prefer to use without this cap because it seems that the epilator works better without it... Just my impression...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it&#x27;s a nice product. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is the awesome product that i had purchase and this product is better than shaver... I love using this product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job removing facial hair. Hurts the first few times, but supposed to hurt less the more it&#x27;s used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting I have a mildly high tolerance for pain. This epilator is my first and I&#x27;m in LOVE with it. It gives me &#x27;movie star armpits&#x27; as I call them (stars never seem to have any fuzz or color under their arms!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my roommate try it out and she ended up buying the same model as we both find it does the job as well as we ever hoped it would.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and works perfect as I expected. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like it but I think I want one that you can use with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a couple years now (pretty late at reviewing), but I like it a lot! It is my first and only epilator. It&#x27;s not as powerful as other epilators in the market (I can see a couple of roots that get trimmed down to the skin rather than pulled out), but it certainly gets the job done. I hate seeing stubble after shaving and am willing to put up with the pain for a few seconds. I use this exclusively for my armpits. I have course but medium/sparse armpit hairs. If you have very thick and dense hairs, I would recommend going with a more powerful model. I used it for my legs once (I have thin hairs on my legs), but felt that it left my legs feeling bumpy rather than smooth. It&#x27;s great for first time users, but you always have to prepare yourself for some pain! It gets better with regular use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! Very pleased! It does a great job.</li>
            <li> Ouch! Not for the faint of heart &amp; tares my legs up, but works well on bikini area.</li>
            <li> Powerful and efficient. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> it can also get small hairs and after using it my skin is soft and clean, the other feature is it is so fast and i love it, i really dont expect more than these 2 features from my epilator.</li>
            <li> My first epilator, I&#x27;m not entirely sure what I was expecting in terms of pain but it&#x27;s not TOO terrible. I definitely recommend this over shaving, the hairs on my legs have become very thin, and I don&#x27;t need to epilate them as much anymore. Although there are always a few stray hairs by the time I&#x27;m done, it&#x27;s not too noticible to make any real difference.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It really hurt the first time I used it, but my hair came back finer and lighter, so with each use it&#x27;s a lot less painful. I have dark course hair and need to shave my legs every day. I haven&#x27;t shaved in weeks and you&#x27;d never know.</li>
            <li> After DECADES of plucking, waxing, and shaving, I have finally found my magic solution.  My husband cannot believe how smooth my legs are all the time now.  I use it about once/week  on my arms and my legs.  I do not find it painful at all because I am so used to the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; of waxing and plucking.  However, my teenager also tried it and ... well, let&#x27;s just say she is still shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is long and the epilator runs strong.  I will NEVER have to shave again!  I run it on high and I run it over the same area a few times to ensure that I have gotten all the hairs.  I have found that if you press hard, it will not pick up the hairs as much as if you just run it lightly over your legs/arms.  I wish I had discovered this years ago - at one point, I was shaving twice/day and within a few hrs I had cactus legs.  My hair is thick and dark on my legs and blond and thin on my arms and it works well on my arms and my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my all-time favorite product.  I highly recommend this to everyone, even you men who want to get rid of your back hair!  GO FOR IT.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT THANK YOU</li>
            <li> ouch! It hurts but I leave my legs smooth.</li>
            <li> cheap and great. whithout pain</li>
            <li> I am not a sissy. This thing is so painful I have no idea how anyone could use this. I experimented with speed, hair lengths and I even used prescription lidocaine. This is a torture device. Seriously inflicts pain!</li>
            <li> I previously had a small epilator that ran on batteries and wanted a bigger one that was also rechargeable or could be plugged in.  I only use an epilator on my underarms.  That is really the only place I hate shaving.  This one is fantastic!  The cord is decently long and I love the 2 different speeds. I do not use the efficiency cap.  I don&#x27;t think I would get all of the hairs using that.  The head is removable so you can wash it which is a huge plus.  My old one did not have that option.  I have seen recommendations that you should first shower to clean and warm up the area before using an epilator.  I never do that.  Actually, I tried that because my last one said to do that and it was awful!!  It hurt, caused ingrown hairs and didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair.  I always use this at the end of the night before getting in the shower.  It works extremely well.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem since doing it that way.  I do immediately get in the shower after and wash the area well.  Since I am not new to epilators, I knew it would be slightly painful.  Yes, it hurts.  Over time you get used to it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad.  The longer the hair is, the more it hurts too.  I always try to use it while my hair is still short, but long enough for it to grab the hairs.</li>
            <li> The power stopped working after about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> get waxed, this thing causes way to much pain and takes way too many passes to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> GET RID OF ALL THE HAIR! BWA HA HA HA! Ok so really now. This thing works quite well on hair that has some length to it. Peach fuzz or random short strays, ehhh not so much. I find it does it&#x27;s job excellently. It is an electric tweezer and as such pulls longer hairs out rather easily. Short hairs I&#x27;d recommend shaving afterwards or simply tweezing them by hand. More work you say? Probably. But longer results as well. Bear in mind you may see hairs still within a few days but those aren&#x27;t the hairs you just pulled; those are the peach fuzz hairs you couldn&#x27;t grab before with it. So after a few epilations It will keep a smooth appearance much longer. I do recommend combining it with shaving though if you want it to always keep a smooth feel too. That doesn&#x27;t mean shave every day, but if you know your going to get down and dirty, epilate a day or two before, and then shave the day before or on the day (if you really wanted to).</li>
            <li> Just as expected... pull out hair from the root! It hurts a little bit, but if you&#x27;re used to waxing, this won&#x27;t be an issue. I have been using every week now and no more trips to the salon! Great product!</li>
            <li> this is my first epilator and I think it&#x27;s great, cord is long so i can use it all over the place. it was scary to get used to (the noise is alarming). but its been great to use every few days rather than shaving. even if i forget the stubble is usually fine enough to ignore.  clean up is great and very simple and easy.  be ready to deal with ingrowns and exfoliate often.</li>
            <li> the epilator  works really well, it is a little painful, but the results lasted a couple of weeks. totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> Still working after about a year. Be ready for the pain! Takes at least 3 xs longer for hair to grow back though. Used to shave every other to every day. Now maybe every other week use this gadget</li>
            <li> This little thing does a great job!  I&#x27;ll break down the pros and cons:  Pros  ° Does an excellent job of grabbing and removing hair at the root, with next to no broken hairs ° Way easier than waxing ° Way less messy than waxing ° Way cheaper than waxing (in the long run, especially) ° Lets you de-hair pretty much any time and anywhere ° Super easy cleanup ° Very reasonable price ° Well built and looks like it will last  Cons  ° Kinda painful the first few runs (but no more than waxing) ° Requires an outlet to plug in the cord (not a big deal and so worth it!)  Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to family and friends.  No buyer&#x27;s remorse here!  :)</li>
            <li> I have always used epilators (24 years to be exact, started when I was 14) never once a razor and let me just day that this particular one did not the job. Sometimes my skin would get caught in it. I would have to go through it a few times. My hair is pretty thin since I&#x27;ve done it for a while. I would definitely not recommend it. I bought as an emergency while I shopped for another one,  wish I had returned it the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Had this for a couple of months now. I have dark course hair and sometimes two growing from one follicle. The first 2-4 times hurt like crazy. I&#x27;m sure because of quantity of hair and coarseness of it. Using Aloe after it during those first few times really helps. After that first rough week, it&#x27;s been much better. It still stings a little but I&#x27;ve definitely gotten used to it. Plus, there has definitely been less regrowth for me so there&#x27;s not as much hair to rip out and, it seems to me, the regrowth I do have is softer. I was shaving every single day and, no matter what, could always feel stubble in certain areas. While I still have to shave 1-2 times/week, it is significantly less than every single day and smooth as satin for 2-3 days. Exfoliating on a regular basis makes all the difference (2-3 times/week; I use coconut oil and sugar).  Overall, from someone who could shave twice a day and still have stubble, I love epilating because at least when I&#x27;m done it&#x27;s extremely smooth and, visually, no dark spots all over my legs from the hair still left in the follicle. Cord length on this model is awesome. It&#x27;s pretty loud but seems to be decent quality.</li>
            <li> After use, very good, shaved fairly clean, not too painful</li>
            <li> This definitely works, however the pain level, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a 9.  If you can handle it, go for it, me, not so much.</li>
            <li> It was painful to use at first, but you kind of get the feel of it. Figuring out how to angle it to catch those tough stubborn hairs . I&#x27;m sure how to replace or clean the head of this thing.</li>
            <li> Ok, it&#x27;s not perfect. No, you don&#x27;t get that perfect &amp;#34;I just shaved&amp;#34; as smoothness that makes you want to run your hands over your skin every time. But I have extremely sensitive skin, and no matter how many times I used a brand new blade, exfoliated, shaved with the grain, used sensitive skin shaving gel and deodorant, treated my post-shave skin with everything I was told to use, and whatever other advice I came across, I always had embarrassingly bad razor burn on my under arms. I would go as long as I thought I could get away with going before shaving, but it didn&#x27;t really help. Until this nifty thing. So I read the reviews, decided to ignore the &amp;#34;legs only&amp;#34; suggestion, and what a difference it has made. Razors would irritate my underarm so much that it would sting to put on deoderant. I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks, so the irritation is still going down, but it has made such a change for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, try to pull the skin taut. If you have trouble with the pain, you can try kind of bouncing it, always being sure to keep it perpendicular to your skin, that way you&#x27;re not getting too much pain in one area at a time. So, do a quick section, pick it up, do a section elsewhere, and so on. It may not be the most efficient method, but I was able to brave getting even around my bikini line in this way (obviously another sensitive area). For my legs, I still prefer the smooth feel of shaving, but I do get less irritation when I use this. Also, I&#x27;m much faster at shaving. So far, I&#x27;ve just been alternating and kind of doing whatever works out, which allows me to avoid shaving tricky areas like knees and ankles (where I typically tend to nick myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should maybe also mention that I suffer from chronic migraines, so the pain was relatively very manageable in my case. Obviously it will vary between individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary: If you have high pain tolerance and are willing to experiment a bit, this is worth adding to your arsenal of hair removal products, especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> did not do what it was suppose to do i am very very disappointed of this product don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Works great! Only hurts some the first couple of times you use it. I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now on my legs and arm pits. It doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore and I can go almost a week before needing to do it again. Love it!</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, only it sometimes will not work if the chord is bent or twisted.</li>
            <li> I think the machine itself is well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you are hairy and they are thick and dark, this might not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;To be able to use this, your hair needs to be at least 0.3 CM(as I remember) so it can grab them to pull out.&lt;br /&gt;But I can&#x27;t wait till my leg hair grow that long cause they are thick and dark.&lt;br /&gt;And it is so PAINFUL  for my thick leg hair and I have a high pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;It worked great for my fingers where the hairs are thinner and slow growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up giving it to my friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> i had old philips epilator so i decide to buy new one :) i try other company before like broun but i love philips epilators</li>
            <li> The last Epilator I used was a dollar store battery operated one. It worked fairly decent, but didn&#x27;t last long. I eventually got my hands on the original Epilator and fell in love!! But I killed it :(  It&#x27;s been several years and I saw one at a store not long ago and off to Amazon I go!! I came across this one, and read the reviews, the positives highly outweighed the negatives so I ordered it.  Obviously, you&#x27;re going to have those people who are going to fuss about anything, so I bypassed those. I&#x27;ve been holding off on shaving until this came in and it arrived two days earlier than expected!! Thank you Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the Epilator....I&#x27;m in love!! It removed every single piece of hair I ran it across!! Much less painful then waxing, almost feels like a bunch of little tingles everywhere.  My legs were soft as ever when I was done and no irritation, no itching afterwards like shaving causes me and not one bit of stubble!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is around five feet long, give or take a bit, so plenty of length. It&#x27;s has two speeds on it, one for finer hair and a faster setting for more coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hubby shaves his arms and legs because he is tattooed everywhere, so I encouraged him to try it next time he needs to shave. He uses a regular electric razor and it leaves stubble which is awful when that arm goes around you!! So looks like I&#x27;m off to add another to the cart for him!! Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Philips Satinelle!!!</li>
            <li> I expected it to hurt like hell, but this epilator barely removes any hair. It maybe removed 30% out of the 90-100% I was hoping for. Despite the low price tag, I was expecting much better results from a Philips brand product.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. I had high expectations because of all the good reviews I read, but was sadly disappointed. All it did was rip the hair out, but not entirely, it just broke the hairs off. So no matter how many times I went over the area it would not make my leg feel smooth, all it left was a prickly leg.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great, painful but tolerable.</li>
            <li> Excelente I recomen this! It&#x27;s a little painfull at first but it&#x27;s great after the second time you use it!&lt;br /&gt;Try to leave you&#x27;re hair small it&#x27;s less painful.</li>
            <li> Well, It works like it is supposed to.  The only problem I have is that it feels like your skin is being cut off the first few times of use.  Once you use it a few times, it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> When a female friend informed me that most women prefer their men without any chest or abdomen hair, I was both shocked and a tiny bit offended. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s true, but I don&#x27;t really like being so hairy anyway, so I went ahead and bought some Nair. The results were disastrous (no better than simply shaving), so I did a little homework and decided to try this device. Epilating sounded painful, and truth be told, it is. But it works, and the pain is almost exciting. After the first time, I only need a sweep maybe once a week or so to keep my torso almost completely hair-free. It almost encourages me to use the device regularly, as the longer you wait, the more it hurts (more hairs). Some hairs end up being cut rather than pulled, but most are definitely yanked clean out, as you can see the little follicle at the ends. Cleanup is a breeze: just remove the top and run it under hot, soapy water. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d use this if I was a woman, since the hairs have to be at least a certain length for this to grab it. It grabs some VERY short hairs, but tiny stubble would present a problem.</li>
            <li> Epillating is an adventure. This does exactly what it was intended to do, albeit somewhat loudly. It&#x27;s efficient and while it doesn&#x27;t alleviate the pain of pulling out your short and curlies, it is more efficient than plucking.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on amazon before buying an epilator.  I bought this one because it seemed to have high ratings for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked OK.  By OK I mean that I had to go over spots a few times, at a certain speed, at a certain angle, and then it worked.  I am no longer using this epilator (and probably won&#x27;t buy another) due to the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-it just took too long to be worth it&lt;br /&gt;-noisier than I wanted to deal with&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m one of those people that easily gets ingrown hair, so it just wasn&#x27;t working out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that I liked about this product:&lt;br /&gt;+it&#x27;s approximately the size of a deck of cards&lt;br /&gt;+it&#x27;s a plug in epilator, so you don&#x27;t have to deal with batteries (the cord is a good length as well)&lt;br /&gt;+it&#x27;s comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;+the price is pretty good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this info helps!</li>
            <li> It is light, handy and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought!</li>
            <li> it does the job it was ment to do. while the hair still comes back its worth it and something i would recomend</li>
            <li> I have another one that I considered seeing if I could have it professionally maintenanced; I&#x27;ve had it a long time and felt that it wasn&#x27;t pulling the hairs out as efficiently as it used to.  I went online instead and thought to purchase one to replace it since the prices had come down some.  I bought this one and it is loud.  It sounds and operates like a cheap instrument.  I think it gets hair out but I totally do not enjoy using it like I do the Braun.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I recommend. And shipping is also good.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and have never found anything that lets me remove hair and be comfortable afterwards. Not only is it super fast and easy, but I use it from the neck down and it feels like having baby smooth skin naturally for weeks!!! You can use it without even looking on larger areas like legs, while watching tv or just relaxing and you know you are hair free because you do not feel the mild pinching with hair being tweezed. My husband even noticed and asked if I was wearing makeup on my legs because my legs looked so smooth. Plus the best part, is it doesn&#x27;t leave dark marks under the skin(underarms and bikini). I am addicted to using this now, the feeling of having such smooth skin is awesome and its great to now have to use my razor. Thank you Philips for making such a great product for an affordable price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a five but I only attempted to use once it hurts a lot I thought I could use it in bikini and under arms but it hurts. If your use to that I could see it working great very powerful and fast I&#x27;ll try it again one day maybe after a couple drinks ouch</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my ancient Emjoi, but I&#x27;m afraid it just isn&#x27;t as good. It really doesn&#x27;t get all those thick dark hairs like I was hoping it would. It tends to break a lot of the hairs off instead of ripping them out from the roots. This is bad, especially if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown hairs and cysts. I ended up with a nasty cyst after using this in the private area. This never happened with my Emjoi. If you haven&#x27;t used an epilator before, just know that it hurts like hell, but, with the right one, it&#x27;s totally worth it. I use mine all over, from the face (light peach fuzz above the lip and on the chin), underarms, and all the way down to the private bits. If you do it right, you can get a Brazilian thing going. That&#x27;s IF you can handle the pain. Just make sure you wash the area you&#x27;re using this on beforehand. I use Witch Hazel afterward to soothe the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to be gross, but if you use this in your butt crack, make sure you ALWAYS keep it (the machine AND your butt crack) clean and dry or you could end up with a nasty cyst. If that happens, and you don&#x27;t want to go to a doctor to have it lanced, apply Apple Cider Vinegar to a cotton round and leave it on there. Make sure you change this out a couple times a day until it&#x27;s gone. Okay, TMI, but I can guarantee this WILL happen to some of you. It&#x27;s best to have a plan of action before happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I started epilating using the Braun Silk-Epil (series 5?), and this Philips one cannot compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips epilator is much more lightweight (in a cheapish way), has no light so you can see your skin clearly, has fewer and longer blades, and just covers less area in the same amount of time. It takes me probably twice as long to do my legs with this thing as compared to the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, the Braun Silk-Epil I used had 40 tweezers. This one has half as many. I find myself going over the same area a couple of times whereas the Braun was a once-over sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less important: the Braun came with a carrying pouch, a little cleaning brush, and three different swappable heads. The cord on the Braun is MUCH longer. The feel of the unit in your hand is also better with the Braun, which is a little rounder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun was purchased for about $30 more, so this Philips unit is still a good deal. Still, we&#x27;re doing this out of convenience, right? Next time I&#x27;d just make the splurge on the Braun unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how I feel about this product. It says for use only on the legs, but it barely works on my legs. Luckily my leg hair is very light and fine as is, but it feels like it&#x27;s just breaking the hair. I tried this product on my lady parts (even though it isn&#x27;t recommended in the instructions) and surprisingly it hurt far less than on my legs, and worked MUCH better. I&#x27;m planning on conning my fiancé into letting me try it on him, since his hair texture varies from mine. So far it&#x27;s not bad though, I guess.</li>
            <li> Does it job. Talk abt pain the first used.....However stuck with it and loving the result</li>
            <li> Okay so, I have ZERO tolerance for pain! Absolutely none!&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY skeptical of even trying this. I mean, your ripping hair out of the root! OW!&lt;br /&gt;Then I read it hurts less than waxing. I&#x27;ve done waxing before and after the 2nd or 3 rd time it didn&#x27;t bug me.&lt;br /&gt;This review is based on using it less than a handful of time and I will update this if my thoughts change which I kind of expect them to.&lt;br /&gt;They say do this after a hot shower/bath. That way the pores are open. And take an aspirin before the shower so it hurts less. I did neither of these. The pain is not bad enough for that in my opinion. It&#x27;s hurts yes but not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying this again with a shower first.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly it&#x27;s painful but it&#x27;s tolerable. Without a shower. From 1-10 pain is 6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:::&lt;br /&gt;So after trying a few different things I&#x27;m pretty disappointed I mean for the amount of pain this thing puts you through it doesn&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Shower/bath or whenever you feel like it, pain wise in my opinion makes zero difference! It hurts a lot!&lt;br /&gt;Actually I found if you use it over and over again on one area, which you will cause it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair out in a stroke out two. Actually your lucky if it ever does! But that area goes numb..&lt;br /&gt;Ive also found that shorter and finer hairs it pulls well, doesn&#x27;t grow back quick either. Depending on the area. I did a small area on my tummy, which didn&#x27;t hurt and it did a great job balding the spot.&lt;br /&gt;However thick corse hair! Oh my!  Go over and over and over and over it and it will not pluck it all! This is where I&#x27;m disappointed, it says it&#x27;s for you legs. And I can&#x27;t get it to pull like any hairs out! Absolutely ridiculous!&lt;br /&gt;It def works better on short fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still going to use it but I&#x27;m kinda mad. I mean this hurts quite a bit and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it should!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:: so after using it quite a bit I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend it. Shower or no shower... Aspirin or no aspirin. This thing hurts! Which, in my opinion would be okay if I wasn&#x27;t shaving to finish afterwards. I get chin hair, it&#x27;s not like man hair but enough that it bugs me. I&#x27;ll go over this spot several times, diff speeds, different angles and I still pluck most of the hair out..  I guess the positive thing is after several mins and umteen angles with this satan device, it&#x27;s numb and I don&#x27;t feel me plucking..</li>
            <li> Works really well but very painful at first</li>
            <li> oh the pain. but i expected that. it works decently. definitely have to go over areas more than once. k</li>
            <li> I had an Epilady from 1990&#x27;s sometime! Seriously, I still have the darn thing but it just doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore! I read the reviews on this little beauty and the price was right so I gave it a try. Well, I can say it works like it is supposed to and I am very happy with it. Let&#x27;s just see if this will last as long as the trusty little Epilady, which will now be gratefully retired! I certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised it didn&#x27;t hurt when I used it and loved that my leggs felt so smooth after i used it</li>
            <li> I like this lil epilator it&#x27;s painfully but does really good job. I suggest y&#x27;all to do it really slowly because if u go fast it will miss out many hairs so go slowly until it removes all the hair.</li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t give a product low stars based off the physical pain I experienced, something the product warns about, but I gotta give this a starred rating, in addition to this comment though I will talk about the performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First things first: Holy cow, I must have really sensitive skin because there were moments when my skin actually bled. Not severely, just little dots of blood. Ok, so I dealt with that because it says it&#x27;ll take some time to get used to. I also thought that maybe my hair needed to be longer, so I waited another two days to let that grow. I tried again, and the same thing! The epilator did pull hairs out, but missed a lot and also wouldn&#x27;t pull them out at the roots on occasion, probably making the sensation more painful because it was just tugging on the hair and was failing to completely extract. So I&#x27;d have to repeat the motion to go back over and get missed hairs. There were also times I swore it was just pinching me and wasn&#x27;t actually grabbing the hairs, but my skin. Perhaps that was just an assumption because it was stinging so bad, but my skin was so red and bumpy afterwards that I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to try it out on my boyfriend&#x27;s hairy legs, because his hair was longer and easier to work with. It grabbed all the hairs! It was smooth on the small patch I used it on and he even said it wasn&#x27;t hurting that bad, so maybe hair length is a major variable. I also don&#x27;t want to wait until my leg hair is as long as his just to see if it works better. No one would appreciate that look! In addition to grabbing his hairs completely, it did leave his skin red and slightly bumpy the next day, which I was surprised about because his skin is a lot more durable than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in a nutshell, the product DOES work but misses a lot of hairs, so motions and areas will have to be repeated and hit up again. Also, if you have really sensitive skin, I would imagine this things pain it displays isn&#x27;t worth the hassle or the outcomes. On an objective note, everyone is different. People have different skin, pain tolerance, and product experiences. So don&#x27;t take my comment as a determining factor. Just add it to your list of considerations.orth the hassle or the outcomes.

            <li> I got this to use on my chest and arm pit hair (I&#x27;m a male), and it does work great. It definitely hurts very badly the first couple of times and my chest got rather irritated the first time I used it. After using it several times though it has gotten a little easier to use.</li>
            <li> Cons: it is fairly painful when you first start uses. i did see a slight increase in ingrown hairs but nothing too major. also dries the skin out like crazy. only really works well on legs...too painful for me to use on the bikini area with any regularity and just flat out hasnt worked on underarm hair which is disappointing&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it works...well. removes all dark hair long enough to be removed and most light hairs. it gets far less painful the more times you use it-after 4/5 times its more uncomfortable than painful. also after 4/5 times the hair grows slower so you have to use it less though the hair doesnt grow in lighter.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this isnt a bad intro to epilators esp the cheap ones. i wasnt sure if i would like them and didnt want to waste money on a product i wasnt sure about but im pretty pleased for the price. my 2 biggest problems with it are the fact that you can only use it on dry skin which results in very dry skin and that i cant really use it anywhere but my legs. not a bad product but when this one wears out ill definitely be upgrading</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. This is my second epilator. I got my first one (an Epilady) from groupon and didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I think the epilday actually works a bit better. This wasn&#x27;t as effective as I would have liked for pulling out shorter hairs and I was constantly having to adjust the angle to make it effective. Don&#x27;t be surprised that it&#x27;s painful- I doubt there&#x27;s an epilator out there that isn&#x27;t...by design, it pulls out your hair for god&#x27;s sake. For the price, I thought it was worth it and I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product, looked and felt good in your hand. I plugged it up to charge for 4 hrs. Tried it. I worked for about 30 seconds and stopped. I thought maybe it was not charged all the way so I plugged it in again for 4 more hrs. It never came on again. I reread the instructions, thinking it was something I had done. NOT. I operated it as instructed. Will not buy this brand again on anything.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I love this hair remover. Very fast and quick with minimal pain. or I can say No Pain !</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator so i didn&#x27;t know what to expect but was willing to give it a try since I&#x27;m tired of shaving.  I must say that the first time it HURT!.  I was sweating and I think I cried a little but it did the job.  It took about three tries before I got use to it.  To me this is way better that shaving because I do have sensitive skin and I no longer have to deal with the horrible after shave itch on my legs or the nicks and cuts.  I have used it for a month once a week and I am happy with the results.  I do recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I would have a higher rating of the epilator were it not uncomfortably painful to use.</li>
            <li> love it. i thought i wouldn&#x27;t like the cord attached but its not bothersome. powerful and effective. glad i bought it</li>
            <li> I am new to the epilator experience. I did a lot a research about the process and finally decided to go with this little beauty. I have a high pain tolerance so this is not uncomfortable for me. I use it on my legs, underarms, and bikini line. I love it. I recommend exfoliating 2-3 times a week, depending on your skin and hair growth. I also recommend Tend Skin for the infected hairs and ingrown hairs. I use Tend Skin as directed and I have no issues with either the infected hair or ingrown hair. You have to go over the same area a few times to get all of the hair, but that is the case with most any hair removal device or treatment. I also would recommend that you shave the day before using this device. And you may have to use it several days in a row at first, but as the growth of the hair slows and becomes less course, you will have to use this less and less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is corded so that it works for as long as you need it to work. I have reviewed the cordless ones and most run about 40 minutes on a single charge. I like knowing that I can plug it in and it works for as long as I need to use it. The head comes off for cleaning.</li>
            <li> This Philips Satinelle Epilator gives me results as if I&#x27;d gotten a wax!! The very best epilator I&#x27;ve ever had. This is my third. I thought it was just my delicate dry skin causing me to get so many ingrown hairs before. I&#x27;m not having that problem now. It catches the shorter, finer hairs previous epilators missed that still left me needing to shave to be completely smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product if you have hair in unwanted places. It works great!</li>
            <li> I like it, it removes hair very quick, so soft. I even use it for my face. good quality for the price</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator but I remember my mom using one back in the day.  It seems to be doing it&#x27;s job.  I think sometimes it cuts the hair rather then pull it out, but for the most part it works.  So I&#x27;m happy with it for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it, it&#x27;s a Good value for the money!</li>
            <li> I am as pale as pale can be, so my hair shows even under my skin, this hurt the first 10 seconds then was fine! I love the results! I also get tiny bumps on my thighs from shaving, I&#x27;ve never NOT had them, I used this and they were gone two days later. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator. It works! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it on certain areas of the body because it rips hair out by the root, but I do my legs and underarms with it. I haven&#x27;t shaved in weeks, and I&#x27;m very happy about that. I also don&#x27;t need to use this as often as I shaved because the hair takes longer to grow back.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this based on various reviews.  It&#x27;s good for the price - a lot cheaper than others.  I was surprised that it was relatively painless for an epilator.  Waxing in the salon had more pain than this little gadget.  However, I found more of the hair was broken above the skin line rather than being pulled.  I ended up with a lot of ingrowns, but I most likely was not using it properly.  I decided for the price it was a good test into whether I wanted a more high end epilator and would go with it that method of hair removal.  However, I decided that epilating is not for me and rather shave the old fashioned way or shell out for the salon.</li>
            <li> It works, but it does hurt at first..... Only order if ur tough!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair removal. It pulls out even the roots. It kind of stings when you use it the first time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I was really impressed because it seemed like it had plucked every hair. My legs weren&#x27;t smooth, but I attributed that to regrowth that this epilator couldn&#x27;t yet reach. I figured that after using it a couple of times for a month or so, it would eventually catch all the hairs and I&#x27;d have smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two months now, and I&#x27;m disappointed with the product&#x27;s performance. I used to think it was plucking hair, but based on the speed of regrowth and the fact that my legs STILL feel prickly after every single use, I&#x27;ve determined that it&#x27;s actually breaking the hairs rather than pulling them out. I&#x27;ve tried using it at different angles and different speeds. I&#x27;ve tried before showering, after showering, the day after showering and after vigorous exfoliation -- it just doesn&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s supposed to. It does pluck some hairs, but it&#x27;s hard to tell just how many because it breaks all the other hairs, making it look like it did a good job. I wish I had smartened up and returned it sooner, but oh well -- you get what you pay for with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this but I wish it would be more accurate in getting more of the hairs out without having to go over the same spot three or four times. I use it on my underarms and arms and it has saved me tons of money on razor heads! If I use it on my legs, I can go a week in between shaving!</li>
            <li> It hurts a little at first, but once you get used to using this epilator it works great! Gets the job done!</li>
            <li> smooth and painless compared to a previous type used for several years. highly recommend to those seeking a reasonable priced&lt;br /&gt;quality product.</li>
            <li> Yeah. No. I have the ideal hair for this product, and I opted for waxing instead. It most definitely did not do a great job, and was more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> Had 1st epilady and Braun.  Prefer this much more.  Grabs more hairs than the epilady.  Had nicks from the Braun.  No nicks with Satinelle.  Thanks, Philips!</li>
            <li> Terrible, pulls and hurts! Thought it would work better than this, it doesn&#x27;t even pull the hairs out! Not a good product.</li>
            <li> somehow painful, but you will like it after that, use a lot of oil or cream when you shave your private area.</li>
            <li> Works OK... but, someone should make one of these with a briggs &amp; straton 4hp engine... I mean, really... it works, but they&#x27;re all kinda wimpy... if you&#x27;re using an epilator a lot... pay more and get a really good quality one... this one is OK for occasional use only... doesn&#x27;t always grab the hair... you have to go over several times...</li>
            <li> Exactly what parts of your body is this good for???</li>
            <li> Great product, catches even the shortest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it. It seems to have a lot more blades than the epilator that I&#x27;ve had previously. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is great! I used to do the wax for my face, an comparing to this Phillips eplilator，wax is more painful. I am a person who really is afraid of pain, but this eplilator is totally fine for me!! And now I can enjoy my hair-free legs!</li>
            <li> I used this on my arms and actually really really liked the results. I do notice some in growns and I don&#x27;t quite like the way the hair grows back but it does give lasting results that make the little annoying things be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I gave it two tries on my legs but was utterly disappointed. It gave me crazy ingrowns the first time. So bad that even now not having used it for almost two months and daily exfoliation I still cannot get rid of the ingrown. And just now I gave it a second go on my legs and they are so red and have huge little bumps all over the surface. My legs feel almost swollen and very agitated. I was really looking forward to the lasting results on my legs since this epilator is actually made specifically for legs but definitely will not use it on my legs anymore.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this product because I was getting tired of shaving and the hairs growing back thicker. I heard epilators help solve that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this brand specifically because the product description said it was &amp;#34;ideal for delicate skin&amp;#34; but that is clearly not the case. I took a shower to open up the pores and started epilating. I knew it was going to be painful (especially bc I have thicker leg hair) but this was something else--I felt every single hair that it was yanking out. It took me about an hour to do one leg because it hurt so much--and I was sweating because of it! By the time I finished, I had red bumps all over my leg and it felt really sensitive--it was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t even go on and do my other leg. Needless to say, I am returning this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend told me about her epilator (Braun Silk 7681) and how the pain is really not that bad. I told her that can&#x27;t be true because mine felt like torture. She let me try hers and true to her word, the Braun doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!! I mean, it does because you&#x27;re pulling out hairs, but it&#x27;s at least manageable, tolerable pain! I checked the price at it&#x27;s selling for $102 compared to the $27 or so I paid for the Philips epilator. Normally I&#x27;m stingy when purchasing products but I&#x27;d rather pay $100 dollars for something I use rather than waste $27 for something I probably will not and cannot use again. You&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> As someone with a high pain tolerance who has only ever shaved for hair removal, there was no way for me to prepare for the amount of pain this little torture device inflicts. You really have to grit your teeth and spread out your first few uses for how much you can handle at a time. Fortunately, it doesn&#x27;t take long to build a tolerance. There are some places the pain isn&#x27;t worth the result, like my upper thighs and pubes. Works well on calves and bikini line and is a miracle for armpits. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to get every hair on your legs so I use it first (remember to exfoliate first!!!!) then shave over what&#x27;s left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve used, and for the price I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Overall very good. Horribly painful the first time. 2 speeds to choose from. If you&#x27;re going to try emulation read up on it first. Gets easier every time. Only complaint about this product is that it has to be plugged in - can&#x27;t move to different locations as easily. Otherwise it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, rips the hair right out of you leg.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping that I could get silky smooth legs for the first time in my life and since it take me a long time to shave my legs just for them to have stubble even immediately after.  It did nothing except irritate my skin - all the hairs are still there, and my skin looks like I was dragged across a parking lot with no pants on.  AVOID!!!</li>
            <li> Ok. but pains a lot..!! Doesn&#x27;t remove hair entirely</li>
            <li> just so so。 the effect is not good.</li>
            <li> I brought this product based on looking at the reviews but when I received the item. It didn&#x27;t work well at all, I couldn&#x27;t even use it on my arms which is very fine hairs. Complete waste of time and pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator because I have been getting my legs waxed for awhile now and I like the length of time my legs remain hair-free compared to shaving.  Also, I was tired of the expense and the inconvenience of making salon appointments.  First, all the reviewers who said it HURTS are not lying. It really, really does at first, and in some spots, like the front of my legs, you just have to power through it.  I did both legs, and by the end, there were some places where it didn&#x27;t hurt at all.  My legs did have red bumps afterwards, but were gone the next day. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to give up shaving and stop paying for salon leg waxes.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator after using the Remington Smooth and Silky for over a year.  It just died so I figured I&#x27;d try another.  So far I like it.  It&#x27;s louder than my previous epilator, but I really like that the head is detachable and washable.  The Remington model was not and it was hard to keep clean.  It seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too course but it does not get all of my leg hair. It just tends to break the hairs rather than extracting them.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face since I seem to have racoon genetics which causes my beard to grow all the way up to my eyelids almost.  With this thing I can carve out a normal looking beard line.  It works great and yes it does feel like a million angry squirrels are trying to tear my face off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found you just have to relax completely while you&#x27;re doing it and then it doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt my skin though.  Sometimes a little red afterwards for about 30-40mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, makes my face look &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and it saves HUGE amounts of time over having to tweeze my racoon face off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recomended.</li>
            <li> After 1 month of usage it stopped working the way it initially did. I just recently ordered the Braun epilator, I will write a review once it&#x27;s been in  use for sometime.</li>
            <li> I seriously love it! This has really helped with the ingrown hairs I would get in my legs and inner thighs. It is a little painful but I learned if I pull at my skin as I epilate it, not only helps get all the hairs, but it doesn&#x27;t really hurt as much. I think it&#x27;s totally worth it. My legs are so smooth now and my hairs grow out so thin.</li>
            <li> Got it as posted. Gr8 product, great customer service from seller.</li>
            <li> Wonderful I love it..it doesn&#x27;t hurt.this my first shaver and I won&#x27;t go back to use the razor.i would recommend it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know what I was getting into when I bought this. I expected a wax-quality hair-removal experience. Although it&#x27;s better than an electric razor and the hair stays away longer than a conventional shave, it&#x27;s still not perfect. As you continue to epilate once a week it gets less painful and you get better at being more consistent with the hair you&#x27;re pulling out. I only use it on my legs since it&#x27;s far to painful to attempt on my underarms or bikini area.</li>
            <li> Its my first one so I have no comparison. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. So far so good. There are spots where some hairs are cut rather than pulled out. Overall... I still like it better than shaving</li>
            <li> This machine is supposed to yank your hairs out from the root, but instead it cuts them. I have the European version (Norellco) and love it, but I&#x27;m very disappointed in this Philips one.</li>
            <li> not useful ,No longer use，&lt;br /&gt;Too loud，I feel very afraid</li>
            <li> This removed some hair but not most. I ended up returning it, as I still had to shave and there didn&#x27;t seem to be much point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using products like these for many years now, when my old one stopped working I researched and decided to buy this one. Im very happy with it! If you are used to this type of product, this one is very good, and the fact that you can wash the head is a huge plus to help keep it clean!</li>
            <li> Fantastic device . Much better than my epilady speed</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, pulls leg hair, soooo painful.  Use nair, it stinks but doesn&#x27;t hurt!&lt;br /&gt;Too expensive for piece of junk!</li>
            <li> Great epilator! I&#x27;ve had it for some time now and it&#x27;s still going strong. I clean it by holding an old toothbrush up to it while it&#x27;s rotating on slow. I&#x27;ll dip the toothbrush in alcohol first and then turn it to high to get the excess off. The head is also removable so I can take it to the sink and fully immerse it in water and soap to clean it. Keeping the blades clean is the key to good epilation.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job of ripping out your air ;D</li>
            <li> It is still somewhat painful to use this, but so far this has the most effective result, satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wow this product really works, I can proudly say I have no more pubes :D!! Where they used to be feels like a baby&#x27;s ass, which is very convenient cuz that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll be shoving my junk from now on</li>
            <li> i loved is so much i bought 2 more for my daughters.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve bought it my entire life, and I would say it works pretty good. I have really dark and thick Asian underarm hairs and find it so tiring to pluck every day or every other day. I finally was on the search for one of these epilators that I&#x27;ve heard great things about and came across this one! Since I don&#x27;t like to shave either because it makes my hair grow even faster, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. And so far...spectacular results!!!! I can do both my underarms in 10 mins if I have a lot of hair and just a few minutes if I&#x27;m in need of a quick underarm cleaning haha. Really love this product and would recommend to anyone.... The first time I used it, i did think it was pretty painful but after that I was completely use to it and find its way better than plucking and shaving any day! I only have to do this like once a week sometimes not even because my hair doesn&#x27;t even grow much! Love it....</li>
            <li> This is a life saver , it&#x27;s something to adjust to die to the pain but it&#x27;s well worth it and my hair has thinned out so fast that I went from shaving everyday sometimes twice a day to  using the satinelle twice in a month ! I gave. It 4 stars because it only works plugged in I wish I could take it in the shower with me but other then that great purchase!</li>
            <li> I really love this. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to shave my legs again. Yes it hurts, but once you get used to it it&#x27;s way easier.</li>
            <li> I really liked this epilator. It was easier to use, more effective and  much less painful than another one that I tried by Remington (smooth and silky, wet/dry epilator). I could also tell that it was working correctly because I could see the roots on the hairs that I plucked out. However, it stopped working after about 20 minutes of use. I figured it might be a fluke, so I sent the device back to Amazon and ordered a replacement. The second one arrived, and stopped working after about 40 minutes of intermittent use. I&#x27;m certain that I followed the directions well.</li>
            <li> Ok, I love this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the first few times I hurts a bit in some areas. But I have only used once on my armpits and i still have seen hair for three weeks. Although, I will say that was one of the painful areas to do (for me), as well as pubic area. I still haven&#x27;t finished that area. My legs were not bad at all. I have seen hair for 2 weeks.. That&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most painful areas, in case, armpits and pubic area (even if it isn&#x27;t painful to you), you should try with powder. Any kind of powder, you put enough in those areas, and it will help the epilator runs more smoothly over that area and not irritate it as much. Just a tip that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I love smooth, hairless-ness.. And this epilator!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time about a month ago &amp; was very happy to see the hairs being pulled right from the root! Much better than shaving! Lasts much longer at least a week &amp; there are now areas that I see the hair no longer growing in at.I use this for my legs and arms :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of or seen an &#x27;epilator&#x27; so it sounded like it may be a solution for hair removal. I&#x27;m satisfied so far but it will only be in time that I know if this is an effective method for me to use. I&#x27;m hoping it will be because this may be a very cost effective &amp; easy way to be smooth &amp; hair free through all seasons. So far I&#x27;m pleased with the result but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t pay attention on bad reviews. This epilator works perfect..I started to use epilator about 10 years ago. That was different brand/Optima. A few months ago I bought Philips and I love it. Some people write about pain . You will feel pain with any epilator. After 2-3 time you will be ok. I don&amp;#34;t feel any pain, same like then you shave. And it takes about 10 min for both legs.</li>
            <li> it does not pull all the hair..it only cuts it when the hair is longer. When hair is shorter it does not pull it. it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am lucky because I purchased this last week and it was on sell for $30 and now I see it&#x27;s for $50? Wow. Anyways, I should be receiving my order next week. I am a African American male and I have used an epilator before but it was too lengthy and wasn&#x27;t really convenient. I see this one has the same amount of stars as the other one I purchased but I like the fact this one looks like it gets the job done faster plus it comes with a cord. The other one was battery operated and the batteries drained really quick. Anyways, these things are extremely painful so I recommend getting some lidocaine which can be found for cheap here on Amazon. It&#x27;s best to forgo razors. I have ice pick scars from the acne and razor bumps they cause plus they give me discoloration. Really ugly marks. When I shave the back of my neck with a blade, I get the same blotches that occur facially but leaving it alone for a month or two, using a good skin lightening soap like Kojie San, and going to the barbers and discontinuing using a razor to get my hair shaped up, helps me maintain a clear neck without ugly dark spots so I am assuming the same for my face. If you are a male with acne and bad hyper pigmentation (blemishes) and wonder why it&#x27;s not clearing up, your razor is the issue and you should switch to one of these. It really does not matter if it&#x27;s a version for females or male. This one looks unisex and it was cheap. I didn&#x27;t want to pay a higher price for a male version when you can find either one that operates with the same power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had salon treatments to remove unwanted facial and underam hair (threading, waxing) but always used a razor for my legs. I got this Epilator hoping that I would cut my cost with all those treatments. I was pleasantly surprised that this Epilator worked well with my underarms and not too well on my legs, considering that the box says that it is for use for the LEGS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only conclude that the reason for easier epilating on my underarms is because the hairs there are used to regular plucking (by way of threading or waxing) and my leg hairs are not. I applied baby powder before using the epilator and made sure the skin was stretched and taut. The pain is manageable but expect more pain in (again) the areas which are not used to regular plucking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this epilator for those who are regulars at waxing and threading. I got my Epilator for 29 dollars and, compared with waxing costs, I expect it to pay for itself after 4 uses. I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not as effective on all areas.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t know how freaking painful epilators are! Dayum! Try on after shave on those legs and you&#x27;ll join the legions of men who shave...you know in solidarity (&#x27;cause of the hurt it will put on you).</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Go a weeks between hair removal sessions. I epilated my armpits like a week ago and they look the same as the day I did them.&lt;br /&gt;-When your hair does grow back, it&#x27;s only a few hairs at a time and they are very light and fine so you hardly notice (unlike with shaving, when you definitely notice when it starts to grow back)&lt;br /&gt;-None of that five o&#x27;clock shadow nonsense. Like with shaving how there&#x27;s still hair under the skin that you can&#x27;t reach and it&#x27;s all dark and stupid looking and no matter how much you drag a razor over it, it&#x27;s still there. Not so with the epilator!&lt;br /&gt;-No stubble when the hair does grow back. No stubble ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It hurts the first time you use it (just use a numbing cream if you want)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;I considered getting a numbing cream because I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I&#x27;d never waxed anything other than my eyebrows, and those don&#x27;t hurt me at all but I had a feeling the epilator wouldn&#x27;t be so forgiving. Even the name sounds ominous. But I&#x27;m cheap and I was on a &amp;#34;beauty is pain and I&#x27;m willing to endure it&amp;#34; kick, so I ended up not buying the numbing cream and just powering through it with my left armpit. That hurt. So I kept shaving my right armpit for a few weeks. Eventually I bit the bullet and finished the right armpit. Again, it hurt. But I think I&#x27;ve built up a mental tolerance to the pain so it didn&#x27;t hurt as much. Kinda just powered through it again. I still recommend a numbing cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silver lining:&lt;br /&gt;After the first sessions, your hair grows back all nice and fine, so it doesn&#x27;t hurt me anymore AT ALL. Seriously, it&#x27;s like night and day. I&#x27;m blown away. My logic is that when the hair is course, you&#x27;re pulling a thicker thing out of the pore. But when it&#x27;s all fine, it&#x27;s like pulling a regular head hair out of your head. I dunno. It doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore and that&#x27;s all I care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to shaving:&lt;br /&gt;The epilator took about a minute topsand I could do it at 3am if I wanted. Whereas shaving is just a pain in the butt to me. I&#x27;d have to be in the shower (don&#x27;t have time to get in the shower just to shave my armpits) or get my armpit all damp, shaving gives me cuts, and I have to unclog the razor with water every so often. Big hassle in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A lifesaver it is. I use this mostly for my armpits but it works for my legs too. After using this multiple times, I do notice my hair reduce in volume and thickness. Removing pit hair also makes quite a difference on the bo and the amount of deodorant used. It does a quick job, it takes around 30 seconds to do each pit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other great things about this product would be the fact that the head is removal so you can wash it(love that) and the cord is super long. The color and design is also simple and nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s so cheap, get it girl.</li>
            <li> Great for underarms, it doesn&#x27;t get my leg hair though, probably because its too thin but perfect for thicker hair. It&#x27;ll yank all that right out! BE WARNED that it DOES HURT. Especially the first time, i only use it on my under arms but its worth it for me at least :)</li>
            <li> The product presents a good quality and it is exactly the same. It is a good alternative to women who cares about the beauty</li>
            <li> Well, I am a redhead and it&#x27;s hard to tell if this thing is working because I have fine blonde hair on my legs. It feels like it&#x27;s working because i can feel the pain of my hair being ripped out, unless it&#x27;s just pulling it really hard and tearing it.  I don&#x27;t have baby smooth legs after using it like I can get right after shaving. I have heard that this epilator works better with coarser hair so that may be my issue.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect,  as I&#x27;ve never owned/used an epilator. I&#x27;ve tried various hair removal techniques in the past: shaving, waxing, bleaching (arm hair, when I was an insecure teenager), threading (eyebrows), etc. The epilator is about as painful or maybe slightly less painful than threading, and definitely more painful than any of the other methods I listed. But, I think the results will be worth it, since it seems to get less painful over time (I&#x27;ve had it less than a week and used it on my legs three times already, since I couldn&#x27;t deal with the pain of doing it all at once) and since everyone says the hair grows back thinner or sometimes not at all. This is a pretty good device for the money. I just wish it had come with some sort of case for storage.</li>
            <li> It misses a lot. Hairs were more often broken than pulled.  It&#x27;s also much louder than you would expect a machine of that size to be.</li>
            <li> The first time was super painful I got used to it a little after a few times but it made my face break out. It was not worth it :(</li>
            <li> I find this product to be very painful to use. The skin on my legs got red and bumpy.  I would rather shave or wax after trying this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the Satinelle, this is practical and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone who wants to get rid of hair!</li>
            <li> Very good! I had one during almost 10 years so it was time to change it! I got this new one and of course works better than my old one... and hopefully I won&#x27;t to need to buy a new one for another 10 years! :))</li>
            <li> Does the trick but if you have a lot of hair in one spot you will need to go over a few time which stings like a mother f***er I will be taking another reviewers advice and try using baby powder to do my Hubby shoulders he has very thick hair and it didn&#x27;t pick up as well.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly fine for me. I don&#x27;t know what other epilators are like but this one is pain free. I love it. My mother thinks it is painful but maybe she has a low tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> The item even when following instructions does not work as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife used it as directed and what ended up occurring is broken hair instead of the device pulling the hair out and also did not get all the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also directed to prepare first time users to shave 2 to 3 days before using this item and also the shower with warm water to prepare the skin. She even completely dried the skin and exfoliated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product as directed by the manufactures instructions...the device took about 30 minutes per leg and still did not get all the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do use a product like this make sure to get a very natural and soothing lotion or aloe vera to help ease the discomfort and pain caused by these devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this product for my wife after she tried using it 3 times. I recommend looking elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review helped you please let me know. Thanks and happy shopping.</li>
            <li> This thing hurts like a SOB. I can&#x27;t stand to use it! I&#x27;m to chicken to even try again. Waste of my money :(</li>
            <li> In less than 6 months, it longer works! DO NOT BUY!!! I&#x27;ve owned an elpilator from a different manufacturer and that lasted me 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> I failed to realize it does not have the battery availability. But otherwise works just fine. Good item for the price</li>
            <li> I love this item!&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this item I waxed my armpits. I liked waxing because the hair took at least 2 weeks to grow back and it thinned out my hairs but my armpits were so sensitive and hurt for days after.&lt;br /&gt;The item is easy to put together, clean, and fast to use. At first, I was afraid of cutting myself but after I used it all the fear is gone. Yeah, of course it hurts but there are no lingering pains when I&#x27;m done. My hairs are still thin and I feel like the hairs take a while to grow to back.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my pubic area and it hurts like hell. I get that area waxed but with this item it&#x27;s too slow and I could feel each individual hair being pulled out.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to my friends and family</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product for the money. I had a very old Epilady and there have definately been improvements. It does take a few passes to get all of the hair. I like that you can remove the head for cleaning.</li>
            <li> To start with it is little painful. But worth buying and it is more suitable for legs. It is good.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price. The product comes with a guard which I tried to use at first but it kept me from removing the hairs and if you want to try to get all the hair to be removed its easier to just not have it attached, I know I was skeptical using without the guard because i feared that it would pinch my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t do that.  It does take a couple of tries to get all the hair ( not to mention its hard to get used to it pulling out the hair) and can cause irritation to the area for the first few uses.  I just try to go over the hair slowly and try not to go over an area too many times - this will also cause some minor irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Id also say that it works better if the hair is trimmed down and is not over at least 1/4 inch long. I noticed while using the product that if the hair is longer it will just pull the hair without removing it, or just break the hairs without removing the root, regardless - it is quite painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product on all parts of the body, legs, arms, and even sensitive skin (like underarm and bikini line) and it works just great, NOTE that it is very painful though and i would suggest for the sensitive areas to use a form of aftershave gel (my personal favorite is Bikini Zones aftershave GEL) and apply to the area to soothe irritation after using the epilator. Yes it does hurt, no matter where you use it (i mean, it is plucking hair out), its just a matter of getting used to. Try taking a warm/hot shower before using to make your pores open up a little more for a easier removal (make sure you are dry first though because this product is not water resistant).</li>
            <li> I love it and I been it hurts but not that bad .</li>
            <li> i mean, this is the only epilator i&#x27;ve ever used so maybe i just hate epilating, but i only did half of one leg and it was extremely difficult to endure. i dont know how this is possibly a product that anybody uses, ever, unless you are a masochist or have dead nerves.</li>
            <li> Since we are in the time where pubic hair is unwanted, we have to decide what method we want to use to keep our naughty bits smooth. The way I see it there are four options: Shaving (cheap and quick but stubble and ingrown hairs), depilatory creams (only moderately effective and can cause chemical burns to sensitive areas), waxing (various types with painful but effective results - works best with someone else doing the \\&quot;ripping\\&quot;) and epilators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one would say this isn&#x27;t painful, to some extent, but it can be effective. I find that the pain is fairly easy to deal with, btu I do have to be careful to stretch the skin well with one hand while managing the epilator with the other. Still, there have been some pinches of my wrinkled skin (if you know what I mean!) that bled a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot compare the effectiveness of this particular device to other devices, because this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used. I can say that it wasn&#x27;t THAT painful and that I was pleased with the results. For areas that self-waxing is too difficult, this zips over and plucks everything out! If I were a woman, or were to convince my wife to use it, I think she would have better results with this than with waxing. I&#x27;ll append this review if I can ever get her to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Its been a few months since I first used this, and after the initial period of returning to my nether region to de-pube it, I \\&quot;let things go\\&quot; for a while. Got it out yesterday and started to do another \\&quot;balding of the boys.\\&quot; WOW! Did I mention how much this hurt, the first time? Maybe I was excited at the outcome enough the first time, to endure the necessary pain until the nerves got numb, but this time I gave up after less than three minutes! One thing to keep in mind is that waxing and ALL of these hair-pluckers say you should trim your hairs way down to 1/8\\&quot; or so before using it. That keeps the \\&quot;area of plucking\\&quot; smaller and pulls the hairs straight out, rather than yanking clumps of hairs from halfway across your testicular sack. I paid the price in pain for not pre-trimming. What I neglected to mention when I first reviewed this thing is that when you start with it, it hurts like tiny demons stabbing your nether region. After about five minutes of use, though, I guess enough endorphins are released and the skin in the area becomes desensitized enough that it&#x27;s not so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I liked my initial results so much I proudly showed it off to my wife and offered for her to use it. She isn&#x27;t as excited by the \\&quot;smooth\\&quot; as I am, which means that _I_ get to be smooth while waiting on her to try it out. Seeing as she has had two children by C-section and two abdominal surgeries she ought to be able to deal with the initial pain easily, right?f hairs from halfway across your testicular sack.

            <li> hurts like owwwwiiieeeee but works well :) just wish the husband would sit still to try it out so he would not have to shave every day. :) LOL he would love that. I like I dont have to charge it..</li>
            <li> I am always in a pretty hairy situation--I shave my legs in the morning and by the time that I get home in the evening, I already have a shadow on my legs. Also, I usually shave under my arms every day because my hair doesn&#x27;t only grow back fast, but it is very dark and thick. To not make the story longer, I have used this on both of these areas and it&#x27;s been 5 days and I barely see any growth. And I know that as you continue to rip the hair out from the root, it stops growing less and less, which is great news for me!</li>
            <li> This works very well. After using this, all my hairs go away. While at first time you may feel pains when using this on somewhere with heavy hairs. Then you will feel less pain after use this for several times. I really recommend this epilator. By the way, remember to use some tender cream with no alcohol after using epilator.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me. I have been using it for several months now and I am very happy with it. My legs are smooth for about a week, which is a nice change. Before that I had to shave my legs almost every other day. It is a little noisy. Other than that very good. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This was a great first epilator for me, because it is inexpensive enough that I was willing to give it a try.  I haven&#x27;t tried other epilators, but this one seems to work okay.  I do have to do several passes with it before all the hair is removed. I like that it is corded, not rechargeable, and the cord is long enough that I don&#x27;t have to be right next to an outlet.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it, but the next time I buy an epilator, I&#x27;ll probably go for a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I got one a few months ago - not very effective so I purchased this one and boy what a great epilator.  Use it a couple of times and you are done for a while.  I was surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy Philips epilator. I am very satisfied,removes hair quickly and efficiently. Recommendations for this product.</li>
            <li> I got this product just a month ago for 29.99. How did it get so expensive?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product gets the job done, although you have to pass certain areas more than once before all the hairs get pulled out. Better than a tweezer.</li>
            <li> So I wax since I was 13, and it pretty much sucks. I had heard about this product but thought it wouldnt work, so it took me a while to purchase this. Keep in mind that I wax so the pain threashold is higher.  Pros  1. You will always be smooth 2. Its very quick, as fast as shaving 3. Easy to clean 4. Not very painful, just on armpits and bikini  Cons 1. Messy, hair ends up everywear as it pulls the hair and you need to be dry. You could do this is the tub, but you would need an  extesion cord. 2. Knees and creases are hard to work, you need to take your time. 3. Not really intended for bikini area, might need to do something else here.  Overall great product, I have not worn long pants since purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I received my epilator and it worked for only 3 minutes, then it didn&#x27;t  work again, i don&#x27;t not what happen but i need a solution inmediatly please.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator i have ever purchased, and I will tell you right now that I don&#x27;t have any regrets with the money I have spent on this. I don&#x27;t agree with everyone that its painful and causes ingrown hairs, but that most likely has to do with your level of pain tolerance. Although I will say that it feels slightly uncomfortable at first. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and am very pleased that I can withhold from shaving for up to a month! I would definitely encourage anyone to give this epilator a chance and overcome any fear you may have about it.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that its a bit loud. My first epilator machine and it  does take some getting used to, it does hurt a bit. BUT waxing is not for me so with more use the less painful the depilating process. Compact, electric cord operated. I thought it was rechargeable but its not. It needs to be plugged in to use, long cord though. I like it :)</li>
            <li> Make sure you trim your leg hair if needed or will seriously hurt worse. Of course it is still going to hurt since it is pulling the hair out by the roots. It works great for the darker coarser hair but it seems to pass over the fine blonde hairs. Overall, it works great.</li>
            <li> I was tired of shaving my legs and two days later the hair starts to grow back. When I first used the epilator on my legs it was a little painful at first but you get used to it afterwards. I used it on a Wednesday and a week later my legs are still smooth. I also used it on my underarm and it does work. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bring back the epilator! I love this little machine! It gets the job done! I have tried waxing, shaving, and tweezing. NOTHING works as well as this! I have been telling my friends to order it!</li>
            <li> My leg hair only grows sporadically.  I need to shave it perhaps once a year, but then the hairs are long.  I finally bit the bullet and ordered this.  It pulled out the hairs completely and painlessly.  Now if I can just remember where I put it next year when I need it, I won&#x27;t have to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Wow, takes some getting used to. But at least I can use this hair removal device on every hair on my body,unlike the pricey,cordless one that burns the hair off. (I sent that one back)This is much safer. And if something needs replacing on it or completely, I wont have to spend half a pay check on! Yes, it hurts, but so does tatooing. but w hair removal at least once the hair is removed it stops hurting completely! and eventually the hair is less and less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for several years now and it still works like day one! Who ever came up with this thing is a genius! Its the best invention ever!!! I used to spend so much money on waxing, not to mention time on DIY products, and the after tweezing! This thing paid for itself in just one use! Its easy, convenient, and always accessible.  The little tweezer blades holds the hair and pulls out from the root, which is always best as it causes the hair to grow back thinner. The level of pain would obviously depend on your tolerance level, but its not that bad... like a little quick sting that quickly passes. If you are used to waxing then this should be a walk in the park.  Its an excellent product! Don&#x27;t waste any more time looking.</li>
            <li> a very good product for a good price&lt;br /&gt;works well, i like it&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27; use it very often but when i do it is very nice&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
            <li> I used it for exactly 6 months and 20 days and it is giving me nerves. It stopped working properly :(</li>
            <li> rips yur skin to bits not safe, not sure why mom wanted it, she complained, she still wants the nono</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user of an epilator I think this is a good fit as it is not too rough. I don&#x27;t particularly like it though because I see that it breaks a lot of hairs instead of pulling them out completely. You must have a lot of patience. I like how there are two speed settings and the cleaning is easy. Good product and you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this item originally due to mixed reviews.  I have tried using this product on different areas before/after shaving.  Even with the adapter on and using the slow speed you would need to have an incredibly high pain tolerance to do any significant area in my opinion.  It was cheap, so I guess it&#x27;s the products one redeeming feature.</li>
            <li> If you have black stubborn hair on your legs like I do, and you can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal - this is the best option for you.&lt;br /&gt; I use to shave my legs every day and they would still prickly. Now i just do epilation once a week or less and the hair that grows after that is much softer and tinier than if you shave. First time I used the epilator it hurt a lot,but then I got used to it, it hurts a little bit but  absolutely tolerable</li>
            <li> This far from what I was expecting. I trusted the reviews and decided to make the purchase though. My leg hair is on the thicker side. On first use it did hurt. This didn&#x27;t surprise me though, I was expecting it.  But as the hair started to grow back (which it did in about 3 days, similar to shaving) parts of t grew back thinner but the rest grew back in grown. The in growns were painful as well. When my legs would get goosebumps, the ingrowns would feel horribly irritated as they tried to poke through the skin. I had to wait at least a week and a half before I could get all the ingrowns out. I did this through deep exfoliation and I had to shave twice within that time frame.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it a second time hoping for better results but it was the same deal.&lt;br /&gt;Both times I did everything I was advised to do to avoid ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re prone to ingrowns when you shave, you&#x27;ll probably get in growns (but worse) from this as well.</li>
            <li> So this is actually my second purchase of this epilator. I bought it a year ago and dropped it too many times when using it so it broke :(. But that was my fault! Darn butter fingers! All in all its a great epilator and you cant beat the price, so I bought it again. As far as epilation goes, I didn&#x27;t like using it on my calves. In my opinion it hurt really bad in that area, but I do use it on my thighs. I also use it for upper lip hair, underarms, arms, lower back and belly area. When I first started epilating, it hurt like a MothaF. BUT, it gets less painful with time. Don&#x27;t let that scare you away though. In all honesty, you just have to get through the pain the first time and you will be fine. If there is an area of your body that you just can&#x27;t handle epilating(for me, my calves! ouch.), then definitely do not force it. Continue shaving or waxing there like usual. If you take a warm bath and use this afterwards, it shouldn&#x27;t hurt too bad. Also! a lot of people think that its similar to waxing because the they both pluck the hair from the root, but thats not necessarily true. Waxing removes a section of hair all at once, whereas an epilator removes the hair one at a time from the root at a fast speed. So, basically waxing is painful, but quicker and epilating is a slower process in order to remove all of the hair in the area. Works like a charm and you cant beat the price! Hope this helped some of you make a decision :)</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to anyone. It&#x27;s painful and barely removes hair.</li>
            <li> This epilator works great.  I&#x27;ve never used one before, so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect.  It hurts at first, but then I just got excited that I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave every other day, and no more pain.  It&#x27;s really not bad.  I did notice some redness and broken hairs after I was done, but I chalk this up to my inexperience in using the device.  It&#x27;s been about a week since I used it, and my legs are still mostly smooth...I need to go back and get those broken hairs...  This was a great purchase.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> I hated this product. I throw the dam thing in the garbage. Cause we couldn&#x27;t find out how to send it back. I was looking for something  in the line of a Nos Nos not something that looks n sounds like it would cut the hell out of you.</li>
            <li> All excited to receive it, used it once, and the next rime I plugged it in it would not work.  Its being sent back as I write this.</li>
            <li> This item came partially opened and on further inspection it was apparent it was used as there was hair still all over it! Amazon is getting bad.</li>
            <li> It is sitting in my closet idle. No one wants to use it. If you can bare the pain, go ahead. Trust me its a torture. Nothing wrong with the item, it works well, but its painful to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate shaving.  This epilator is awful.  I had to go over the same spot multiple times and it still didn&#x27;t get all the hair.  I ended up having to shave the hair it missed. It is painful but not intolerable.  Since I&#x27;m having to shave anyway,  I elected to stop using my epilator.  At least shaving is typically painless and the razor cuts the hair off the first time.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous baby smooth skin after applying it. I don&#x27;t use that pink colored thingy on it, cuz it doesn&#x27;t improve taking out all the hair by the root. The machine y itself is efficient. I use the high speed mode for faster results. Also, I make sure that the length of the hair is good enough so the tweezers in this machine could pull those out nicely!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I never ever have to spend money on waxing again! Completely replaced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing: Try it on the back of your hand or on the surface of no hair to test it in case you are afraid to directly use it on skin. You&#x27;ll get used to it after using it the first time. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time and I love it and it&#x27;s a super plus because it&#x27;s Raul voltage so that was good for when I moved.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose well. I have thin, fine unwanted hair. Takes care of it!</li>
            <li> Works perfactly and removes hair without much pain. And good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t grow immediately like it may after shaving...&lt;br /&gt;The quality of hair growing up again is changed, I mean that the hair which grow again are less thicker and less dense hair growth is seen. All in all a good product.</li>
            <li> Good price, works well, perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> Clearly you need to build up a tolerance to using an epilator, I used one many years ago, different style, so I didn&#x27;t think much of it. This is a good entry level, says it&#x27;s for legs only on the package, so I&#x27;m not sure the description here should say it can be used anywhere else. If it&#x27;s been a while since you&#x27;ve done this, or you&#x27;re new to it, the little wheel/tweezers spin intimidatingly fast, even on slow, so just a test spot here and there will get you going. I&#x27;ve done a few, no ingrown hairs, but I also seem to have a problem with it grabbing all of the hair, I end up needing to go over several times and even then I may not have gotten it all. It does yank that sucker out all the way to the root, I mean do you realize how long your hair is under the surface of your skin? I skipped two days shaving and the hair I was getting looked like I had gone a whole winter. I don&#x27;t know if it helps, but I exfoliate first, use lots of nice cool lotion afterwards and I&#x27;m debating trying some of the numbing spray used for sunburns the next time I try it.</li>
            <li> does it job and better than the 50 dollar one my sister bought because it actually caught on my skin several times.&lt;br /&gt;cons-it has to be plugged into an outlet and it doesn&#x27;t come with a little brush so its hard to get the hair out of the head.</li>
            <li> works like it should,  you just need to know that it is extremely painful.  If you have waxed in the past it is more painful than waxing.  After continued use, you it will get easier and less painful.  Not for the faint at heart</li>
            <li> Hello, little friend ;)))) Where you&#x27;ve been all these years??? Yes!!!!! It works.... I&#x27;m thrilled about this beauty device and even feel a bit &amp;#34;stupid&amp;#34; for not giving it a try years ago.  A friend of mine had an electric shaver (many years ago) and I used to see how awful and dark her armpits used to be, and I always thought it was the same thing. Not at all, nothing to compare.  It is a bit uncomfortable at first, as it starts grabbing hair, but as you progress it gets better.  Nothing that you can&#x27;t tolerate, unless you are a real crybaby ;)</li>
            <li> It works ok I&#x27;m not excited by outcome or hugely disappointed. It does take a bit of time to finish the job. It does however last longer than shaving and less hair does grow back.</li>
            <li> works well,&lt;br /&gt;arrived fast&lt;br /&gt;very happy of the purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed one for my wife as she had a previous version (from 1995) that was starting to give up . So I read the reviews , which were very helpful ,ordered  it  , it arrived in a couple of days . My wife used it a couple of times and is happy with it. I tried it too on my arm and it hurts as it should....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I ever bought. It worked just as they say. Hurt like the dickens the first couple times, then no problem at all. However, it died after 7 months. Maybe I got a lemon, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it worked just as claimed. I love the epilator and won&#x27;t go back to shaving, ever! I have light blonde hair so not sure how it would work on darker, hairier women. I am trying a Braun next!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim less than 48 hours ago after reading an article. Until then I had no idea what an epilator was. Can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only clueless American who hadn&#x27;t heard of them. All I see are ads day-in and out for shaving blades. But this? THIS IS MAGIC. I used this little beauty on my face and couldn&#x27;t believe the smoothness of the skin immediately afterwards. So easy to use and IT DOESN&#x27;T HURT. I don&#x27;t know what kind of pain everyone else is or isn&#x27;t used to but my hair being detangled after a few weeks is much more painful.  Using the epilator felt like being tickled and I&#x27;m addicted. At least for my face. Going to try underarms next. I won&#x27;t use it for legs or arms though. Would take much too long - for that I&#x27;ll stick with Nair lotion - easiest to wipe on and off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American female with much facial hair and skin irritation from removing it. This epilator has been a true lifesaver for me. I had not been able to get rid of all of my facial hair at once without it growing back in days. I was afraid to let anyone touch my face for fear of them feeling the stubble on my face. I use the epilator daily.  I am forever grateful to this epilator because I can rub my hand over my face and my skin is completely smooth. No coarse hair and no bumps from irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do believe that the skin irritation would  have persisted, but I found another amazing product called Gly-luronic acid serum (makeup artists choice). I also use this daily. I ran out of this for a few days and noticed a little irritation. So I have to give credit where it&#x27;s due.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I will be forever loyal to these two products. If anyone is facing a similar issue I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I have ever owned or tried to use. My skin is not sensitive and I would say that I can tolerate a good amount of irritants before turning red on me and such, and also my level of pain tolerance is pretty good. It works on me but misses a lot of hairs so I have to go back multiple times. Doesn&#x27;t hurt much at all on legs, but I try to use this on my underarms too and it hurts like crazy but I just bear my way through it (although it does say in the package that this epilator is only intended to be used on the legs - which is probably why the last two times i tried to use it my skin started hurting afterwards). In the end, buy this if you are looking for a cheap epilator and you do not have sensitive skin. If your skin is irritated easily, just use this on your legs and you should be more than fine. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought a similar product in the past so I knew what to expect. The product is good, very easy to use and fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilalator with the hopes that I&#x27;s be able use this instead of paying for a wax every six weeks or so. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed with it. being African American, I do have coarser hair on my face and it doesn&#x27;t get the hair as well as I would like. Granted, it does pull the hairs, but only a few at a time. And I definitely don&#x27;t have time to stand in the mirror for an hour doing this. It misses a lot of hair and I&#x27;ve tried going in an upward, downward, and a circular motion. Definitely won&#x27;t serve the purpose originally intended</li>
            <li> It is very simple but it does what it is suppose to do. It is noisy compared with the other I had but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.It works well.</li>
            <li> This product does the job, however, after one use, it fell apart.  Maybe just a defective one, otherwise, it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> This thing works pretty well - but is kind of irritating.  Made me get itchy bumps around my knees.  I know you aren&#x27;t supposed to use it on your face, but I&#x27;m not sure why.  I do.  It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs.  I can deal with the bumps - can&#x27;t deal with the remaining hair!</li>
            <li> Good product, I used to have a broun brand but this product is much better because remove even very short hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.  The package came in on time and with all contents in present.  Since the instructions and most reviewers recommended, I took a quick warm shower and also exfoliated my legs to open up the pores and remove any dead skin so that my leg hairs would be easier to tweeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has different types of hair and I happen to have semi-fine, straight black hairs (medium dispersal) on my legs.  I also think (or at least I like to think) that I have a pretty high tolerance to pain.  Because of these factors, I didn&#x27;t feel any pain when epilating.  It actually kinda tickled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product four stars because, after having this product for about a month now, I noticed that you have to wait for leg hairs to grow a certain length before you can epilate again because if its too short the tweezers on the epilator often times won&#x27;t be able to grasp the shorter hairs.  My hair starts to have some growth about 1 1/2-2 weeks after waxing/epilating.  Other than that, it gets the job done pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, word of advice, make sure to go slowly (or at least not as fast as I usually go) when epilating in order for the tweezers to firmly grasp your hairs and pull from the root.  I&#x27;ve been going too fast and the hairs just end up breaking and I would have to go back again and do the area again.  So, go slowly, one area at a time. Also, exfoliate everyday- otherwise you might have more ingrown hairs.  And nobody wants ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to spend as much time and money on waxing, and for people who are afraid of getting the rough stubble from shaving.  Just be patient when epilating and remember to exfoliate.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I&#x27;ve only sugar waxed my legs and I&#x27;ve never shaved them.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, It had been good. Unfortunately this one broke the day I bought it :(</li>
            <li> Bought it after reading so many reviews about it. I am happy with my purchase.. I use it on partial growth on arms and legs after waxing.. Saves the time and effort..</li>
            <li> rI love this product it works great. I have used it on my face. It does remove the hair from ths root</li>
            <li> It works but it doesnt really shave all the hair Have to go through it many times.</li>
            <li> I love this, I can&#x27;t see up close to tweeze because my glasses with bi focal lenses just don&#x27;t work that way. This is a little painful, because it is pulling the hairs out by the root, but this works great on my chin and lip area.</li>
            <li> Epilators are painful at first use, but once you get used to it,they are awesome. This one gets the job done and it isn&#x27;t as painful as another brand I used- which was much more expensive. I only have to use this every 6 weeks or so, which beats every week by far. I would highly recommend the product. However, if you cannot deal with a little pain, I would suggest to stay away- it is pulling your hair out.</li>
            <li> I like this epilator; it works well.  I don&#x27;t really know if it is any better than another brand I used but it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an epilator before and I read a LOT of reviews on different models. It was between this one, and a $75 one, so ultimately I went with this one based on the price and over 300 positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this device.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really a sissy when it comes to pain and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin. But I prefer WAXING to this devil&#x27;s device. It hurts less. and honestly, once you put a wax strip on, you kind of don&#x27;t have a choice but to rip it off lol. This device... well.... I&#x27;d hover just above my skin and go nope. Aint happening. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so the most intimate body part this thing touched was my leg!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took forever (like a half hour just to do my calves and ankles) and was very painful. it broke more hair than it pulled out leaving stubble. and to top it off, it&#x27;s LOUD LOUD LOUD! scared my dog! lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wax my bikini area at home, no problem, using this thing on leg? it hurt MORE THAN THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So those are the four reasons I returned this devil device.&lt;br /&gt;Here they are in list form:&lt;br /&gt;1) LOUD&lt;br /&gt;2) PAINFUL (moreso than just waxing)&lt;br /&gt;3) TIME CONSUMING (three times as long as waxing)&lt;br /&gt;4) BREAKS HAIRS (unlike waxing, this breaks off some of the hair instead of ripping it out, leaving stubble anyway.)</li>
            <li> This thing hurt more than anticipated and then I also had a run with some ingrown hairs. Suppose to get better with more use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best product in the market but it does its job. It arrived pretty fast too so im satisfied!</li>
            <li> This is my 1st experience using a device like this...I&#x27;m not fond of the ingrown hairs when they start regrowing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and is uncomfortable to use.  What hair it does remove is painful and it doesn&#x27;t remove even 50%.  Used it about 6 times over 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> works amazing for under arm and bikini.doesn&#x27;t work well for fine hair,which is arm and legs!i&#x27;m happy with the product and i don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving my under arm and bikini hair anymore.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. It takes several passes to get everything, but it works well...if you can stand the pain.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had an epilator before, I always used it on my armpits and my other very private area. It was quite painful but I kept using it because I didn&#x27;t know any better about epilators since it was my first. Then I ended up moving to my boyfriends apartment and I lost my epilator. I decided to go on amazon and order an epilator so I picked this one since it had great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;LET ME TELL YOU....&lt;br /&gt;girllllllll my skin has never felt this amazing. No irritation, quick, easy, and pain free.&lt;br /&gt;It made me realize that my other epilator was doing a horrible job.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up! I recommend this to everybody</li>
            <li> I had tried the [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]] and was somewhat disappointed that it breaks more hairs that it pulls (which is the point of an epilator, otherwise, might as well shave). This one does a better job, but because it is smaller, it takes more time to do the job, and it doesn&#x27;t get all the difficult areas. I will keep it, but might go looking for a better one sometime in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update: this product is actually terrible. The head breaks off constantly, even when I go to store it, and now won&#x27;t stay on firmly. It doesn&#x27;t pull all the hairs and as stated before, it doesn&#x27;t get into all areas. It&#x27;s now making a weird noise and not gripping hairs anymore, maybe because of all the impacts caused when the head falls off. And the thin cord is annoying, it gets all entangled. I&#x27;m now going to try the [[ASIN:B001EAYZEW Emjoi Soft Caress Epilator - 36 Gold Plated Hypoallergenic Tweezers (Rechargeable)]]. Will let you know how that one works!</li>
            <li> Not the best ever, but for the price, he do the job ! I wanted it just for holidays because I forgot one, and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> There are two things to know: 1.- it is painful, I mean, it is! this was my first time using an epilator after years of shaving, so yeah, the first 2 or 3 times was terrible, I actually got the cheapest epilator because after reading some reviews I was afraid I was going to try it and then dump it half way through. But trust me, it gets better! my hair now comes thin and its super easy and fast to pass the epilator and for two weeks/week and a half (for my armpits) I don&#x27;t have to worry about it! I&#x27;m buying one for my mom so she can try it.&lt;br /&gt;No. 2 I have no clue why people give bad reviews just because it is painful, I don&#x27;t know how the other epilators feel, like the cordless ones that you can use in the shower (I wanna try those too) but this as a first epilator is amazing, is little bit noisy, like a shaving machine, but it is quite practical, small, it has a long cord so comes in handy, its super easy to clean and I&#x27;m quite glad i&#x27;m not paying for wax at the salon or shaving every day before yoga class! :)</li>
            <li> Fast response, fast shipping, high quality!</li>
            <li> It was not expensive, but it does everything good! Just all that I was needed! I use this regularly. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my legs and it took 2 weeks before I needed to use it again. It stings like little rubber bands popping your skin. After a little while you may get use to it and are able to take the guard off (which I did). After all that, I wash the area and apply baby oil and lotion.</li>
            <li> This is more painful than waxing. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. However, you are going to feel pain. Also, it&#x27;s kind of loud. Not terribly but I thought it would be a little quiter than expected. It has a decent long cord. It has a good grip as well. Bottom line if you can handle that much pain do it if not use something else.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using waxing strips for years because shaving sucks. This is way better than waxing. I&#x27;m so impressed with how efficient this little thing is. I didn&#x27;t find it very painful, maybe because I&#x27;m used to waxing which is more painful, messier, and more expensive. I wish I knew about this epilator invention years ago. I&#x27;m very pleased with this nifty contraption.</li>
            <li> Great value for money. This works perfectly (it&#x27;s the second I have and it lasts years), and there is simply no reason to spend more money on the more advanced models. I really love this product.</li>
            <li> i am impressed on how well it gets all the hair......even rhe very fine, thin hair! i suggest to anyone looking for one.......this is it! Great price, and a great little worker!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on comments that I would be able to use it on other places, but the instructions explicitly say for legs only, and I don&#x27;t need that so I&#x27;m returning it.  I&#x27;ll buy something more specific to my needs.</li>
            <li> I really like these epilators. Works very well</li>
            <li> hurts really bad and not all the hair were removed. just good for leg only.</li>
            <li> It is work well. I love it and i also bought 2 other as a gift for my friends and they like it as well</li>
            <li> Best epilator I&#x27;ve found. Yeah, it is still painful in some areas, and takes a while to get it done on a large area like legs, but any epilator would. I like that it does work and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of strays, and that it lasts so long.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for over a year now. It removes hair with a lot of ease. It is very convenient when compared to waxing since you it hardly takes few minutes and can be done at home. It also removes tiny hair from the roots.</li>
            <li> This epilator does work. It just doesn&#x27;t last very long. Mine lasted maybe 9 months before it stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fine with the pain, so that doesn&#x27;t figure into my review. I think you could buy a little bit better epilator and have it last longer.</li>
            <li> fast on time  i like it</li>
            <li> Works great! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Works great. Hurts a lot and doesn&#x27;t get hairs that are too long or too short.</li>
            <li> I order this in mid April.  It worked great until the beginning of July.  Now it will not start.  I&#x27;d recommend spending a little bit more for an epilator that will work longer than 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Hurts really bad and doesn&#x27;t pull out all of the hair, more breaks it than anything. I&#x27;ve never had this many ingrown hairs either. I have a really high pain tolerance and can barely stand to run this thing over my legs.</li>
            <li> Ouch, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> i looked up on internet for epilators. this one had good reviews and was cheaper too. so i decided to go ahead with this. this one comes with a cord which is long enough. it also works well. it plucks lesser hair per rotation but i guess that is a feature i will have to live with. over all worth the money.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t&amp;#34;t do the job. Not worth buying. I regret having purchased it. It doesn&#x27;t work not even with fine hair.</li>
            <li> You give me  membership card I don&#x27;t need this. I don&#x27;t like it sorry. It&#x27;s hard to this I need money back</li>
            <li> It worked okay for a beginner&#x27;s tool I guess.  But I only bought it 6 months ago and didn&#x27;t even use it more than once a week and it&#x27;s already broken!! It won&#x27;t start at all.</li>
            <li> Just broke hairs! You get what you pay for! Spend the money and get a better one! I hated it!</li>
            <li> Works ok. It is chargeable. It is small. It is convenient to bring. It is easy to use. I like it.</li>
            <li> Love this epilator.  I have used others but this is really comfortable.  I&#x27;m not going to say it doesn&#x27;t hurt because you still are ripping hairs out your skin, but it&#x27;s bearable.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am glad i ordered it!</li>
            <li> Oucccchhhhh!!! I guess it works but it was way to painful for me to really find out. I&#x27;ll have to go back to waxing</li>
            <li> This epilator may be small but it sure is mighty!  I had epilators before but none that were this compact and still retained their hair removing powers.  I definitely recommend this to the epilator novice especially because this thing removes everything!  Yes you may have to go over certain areas multiple times but it&#x27;s not bad at all.  I&#x27;m really impressed by this little thing.</li>
            <li> This product is good and delivered on time</li>
            <li> Its very nice.easy to use...it does more work in less time.its amazing...I like it..Its useful for facial hair n also for arms n legs.due to this item I have to get rid from waxin chip chip..</li>
            <li> It was very painful.  I tried it several times and couldn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the &amp;#34;oh it hurts so bad and nonsense&amp;#34; I was scared to death to put it on my skin.  Those people are true wuzzes.  This is so incredibly easy and painless I cannot imagine how anyone can say it hurts like heck.  No way and my skin felt like a babies butt when done....  I wish I had went this route as a kid and not endured shaving all those years..  This is gonna be my BEST FRIEND I&#x27;ll tell you FOR SURE!  Try it you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Nothing particular fancy about it but I like it. A bit small but it does its job fine. I always had a basic model of Braun, which works much better, but had to find something with american cord.</li>
            <li> The previous epilator died, and we got his as the replacement and she loves it !!!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I can&#x27;t say I am impressed with it. I have very fine blonde hair and it takes a long time to get the hair gone. Might work better for someone with more corse hair.</li>
            <li> It works great, as it should, leaving my legs smooth. But it hurts! I guess I should have expected it, but I didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t ever wax and my hair is rather coarse so it really stings and I tend to just do little parts of my legs at a time while I get used to the feeling...</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for my underarms. It does the jobs half the time.  I have to go in many different directions to get the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud. It was very painful for me at first since I had never waxed or epilated before. I got used to it though.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, sort of. Not as good as I expected but definitely better than some. Never had issues with &amp;#34;pinching&amp;#34; or any pain.</li>
            <li> I having been using this for about a month. I had not used an epilator since the original epilady in the early &#x27;90s. Thus is a huge improvement over that torture device. I have psoriasis and was having issues nicking myself with shaving, so, a little desperately, I tried this. It stung quite a bit the first time and took a long time (like an hour) to do both legs. But, while to stay smooth I have to shave daily, with this, it is just weekly and the subsequent uses have gone much faster. I do have to go over each section several times, but it gets the job fine and the pain had subsided substantially. I used it on my arm pits as well. Worked great and I could go almost two weeks before doing it again. My only complaint is having to go over each section several times to get all the hair, which may misery be typical of all epilators, I don&#x27;t know. Definitely worth the $30.</li>
            <li> It worked for a month and a half and then the cord got a short in it. Pretty much useless. I waited too long and now can no longer return it. Save your money!</li>
            <li> This really does remove unwanted hair. I have noticed when the hair grows back it&#x27;s less and finer. Just be prepared for the pain.</li>
            <li> Day 1:  First of all, I would like to point out that the photo of the woman using the epilator as if it is a cordless tool is misleading.  This particular model must be plugged in for usage.  This is my very first epilator.  In the past, I would either shave or tweeze the hairs on my leg one strand at a time, which not only took forever, but for some reason, seemed to hurt more.  I initially ran the epilator on my arms, and oh my goodness, I wasn’t quite prepared for the pain, as I was used to running an electric shaver on my arms during the summertime, and that was absolutely painless.  I do, however, have an extremely high threshold for pain, so I quickly got over the initial shock of the painful feeling of having every strand of hair pulled out of my arms.  Next came my legs, and again, the initial pain takes getting used to.  Also, you do have to go over each section more than once in order to remove all the hairs.  But 20 minutes later and tingling throughout my hand, my arms and legs are smoother than they would be after a shave!  Note:  If you are trying the epilator for the first time, it is best to try it over the winter season when shaving your legs isn’t a must!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2:  One and a half weeks later, I started Round 2 of epilation.  Oddly enough, I felt absolutely no pain at all.  I do prefer epilation to shaving my arms and legs, as it leaves my skin much smoother and I don’t feel a 5 o’clock shadow coming back to my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  this particular epilator is awesome and inexpensive.  It is a little inconvenient that you have to plug it in when in use, but the tweezer heads are good about gripping even the shorter finer hairs.  The Phillips HP6401 is small enough to fit in the pam of my hand.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> After looking at the product reviews I was sure that this product would seem reasonable but just after a dozen or so uses it decided to stop working. I kept it in a drawer safe from any moisture and mis-handling but after plugging it in yesterday it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I thought there may have been some hairs causing it to jam but after inspection the problem seemed to lie in the main compartment where the electrical systems are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected that a 30+ dollar product that even had a plug in power source would last for quiet a bit longer than just a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not going to buy this product again, waste of money.</li>
            <li> This thing is quite painful, but it definitely removes my leg hairs. Luckily this type of hair removal seems to last a while so I only have to do it once a month. I do feel like I have less and less hairs over time.</li>
            <li> ....which delayed the process of getting the thing for 3 days. Not everyone has the luxury of being able to take a day off and wait for the UPS to deliver a $30 package when its convenient for them. Not a huge problem, just a pain and a hassle I don&#x27;t fell I should be dealing with having paid for a Prime membership and all.</li>
            <li> OK yes this can be uncomfortable to use at 1st but after a few uses its not bad.  To me it was well worth the discomfort.  I use to have to shave daily, now I run the Satinelle over my legs maybe once a week.  If you can work through the discomfort you will be happy with the results!</li>
            <li> Not as expected and advertised. Not work. Does not remove hair from the root.  Do not waste your money. I am totally unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Finally I found the epilator that doesn&#x27;t make me suffer and gets the work done perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> ...But whatever. It works just fine. Sometimes though, you can find these at Ross or TJMax for $15. I kept looking for a few months but I couldn&#x27;t hold out any longer so I just bought this one. It&#x27;s fine. Nothing amazing but if you can&#x27;t find it anywhere else then this is probably your best option.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the results of the epilator and have had no issues with it. The description lies about the pain. It&#x27;s hurts quite a bit for the few several uses, and I&#x27;m pretty tolerant of pain. It does go away the minute you are done ripping hair out, so it&#x27;s quite brief. Over time the more you use it it&#x27;s not too bad as things loosen up. I can go a few weeks at a time without needing to use it again, and that&#x27;s even for the thicker hair (ie groin and pits area). I definitely recommend this product and it&#x27;s well work sticking through the initial pain to get great results.</li>
            <li> It caused crazy hair bump. It hurts but after a while u get used to the pain, the first two uses u will love it but then comes the hair bump. Maybe it&#x27;s different on skin tones or texture. I&#x27;m African American so idk if that will make a difference</li>
            <li> I have hated shaving everyday so I wanted to try something longer lasting. My lower legs are kinda coarse, but my thighs and body are fine. I was so ready for this to be my &amp;#34;aha! Alas!&amp;#34; solution... But no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me explain. I quit shaving a couple days before trying to use it. My hair should have been long enough the first time I tried, but it didn&#x27;t pull out much. I thought I would keep trying over the next few days so it could &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; it out as different hairs grew long enough gradually. By the 3rd day trying (5th day no shaving) I finally gave up. My legs weren&#x27;t getting smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it does sting. Go grab a pair of tweezers and pluck out a couple hairs from your legs. Same deal with the epilator. It will turn red for a bit from irritating your skin with the pulling but it goes away after an hour. The little bit of pain is totally tolerable though, if it only was actually pulling out the hair . The lack of efficiency makes it annoying. It would take 4 to 5 strokes just to get most of the fine hair, but it wouldn&#x27;t get all of it. Coarse lower legs were a joke. After 10 minutes I managed to pull out only half of my hair in a little 3 inch long patch. It. Was. Ridiculous. All that stinging and it was just tugging the hair not pulling it out. I slammed it on my counter, grabbed some lotion and a razor, and had both legs smooth in 5 minutes. I would rather spend five minutes everyday for smooth legs than have to spend all day long every week to epilate. I don&#x27;t have that kind of time to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 40 day manufacturer return is ridiculous as well. Make sure if you send it back to use insured postage (an extra 5 bucks). I forgot to add insurance on it, and even though they recieved it, they refused to refund me because it had to be insured to be accepted. So now its back with me, now past the 40 days, un-returnable, and I&#x27;m stuck with the piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Works like a  charm very happy with this product. She had bought a few that were shavers and Epilator but they don&#x27;t work as good as this one.</li>
            <li> It is very good, very comfortable. The price is nice. Thank you for you produkt. I love it. Thank you.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful and easy I used to have other similar but the results was not the same..... I recommended it.</li>
            <li> This epilator is small and cute and portable. also it is very fast: today I epilated both of my legs in 30 minutes. My Braun epilator took hours.&lt;br /&gt;It does not take all the hair and it also breaks them, but in my opinion every epilator does the same.&lt;br /&gt;This epilator won&#x27;t give the smooth and silky skin that you want, but it will give your legs hairless look.&lt;br /&gt;I also epilate my armpits with it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I&#x27;m happy with this one. For more prise you&#x27;ll get only extra heads, expect no miracles with epilators in general.</li>
            <li> bought this because mine broke. Very reliable. Mine only broke because I somehow left it on my bed and accidentally switched it on and it got tangled in the sheet and was on for my entire 15 minute shower, so it was jammed and over heated. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with them breaking other than my stupidity!</li>
            <li> I own Braun Silk and epil epilator for a long time and I saw this and the reviews were good on it. But when I received the product it is very cheap looking, it doesn&#x27;t come with anything extra, has only one head and it makes it harder to use for armpits. My legs aren&#x27;t as smooth and I have started to get a lot of ingrown hair which isn&#x27;t good looking with the bumps.</li>
            <li> great product.  love it</li>
            <li> I bought an emjoy for more than double the price on QVC. I bought this one for my daughter but I decided to try it and it worked a lot better than the emjoy. It was faster and felt smoother when I was done. I threw out the emjoy and kept the Philips for myself. Of course I ordered another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> OMG I just got these today and I&#x27;m already Inlove with it !!! Works really good leave ur legs smooth and sexy 😀 at first I was sacred to get it cuz I saw some reviews ppl saying it hurts really bad but it doesn&#x27;t hurt its just a little sting that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s not painful at all if u can&#x27;t take a little sting these is not for you !!! Shaving overall is not for you !!! Because there&#x27;s nothing painful about it !!! Js</li>
            <li> I needed an upgrade and love this! It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; like the one I had before... although i was used to it. it doesn&#x27;t leave bumps and removes all (most) of the hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use... &amp; worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Great! I would by it again.</li>
            <li> As of today it stopped working properly. I think it is something about the cable. It just won&#x27;t stay on. It turns on and off all the time.</li>
            <li> I first heard of epilators from a friend of mine who would rave about hers! After feeling how smooth her legs (and arms) were I decided I had to give it a try. I browsed online and saw that the price on this one was decent so I decided to give it a go. When the box arrived it was packaged nicely and had all necessary materials. I took it out and tried it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  MECHANICS:&lt;br /&gt;You have to have it plugged in while using it, it isn&#x27;t wireless which isn&#x27;t too bad considering it has a very very long wire. How this works is that it is basically like a bunch of tweezers that rotate and squeeze together at the top to grab your hair and pull it out.  The epilator has 2 speeds, the lower one for hard areas, such as your shins, and the higher one for softer ares, such as arm pits or thighs). Mechanically it functions well. This little machines is pretty noisy so be ready to crank up the volume on anything you may be listening to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  EFFECTIVENESS:&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing I was a bit worried about the pain but my friend told me it wasn&#x27;t that bad but I will admit that at first it was a bit painful. However, now that I have had some practice and getting used to it, the pain really isn&#x27;t noticeable. I do get some red, splotchy bumps on my legs afterwards but it&#x27;s nothing that a bit of lotion and 10 min of letting it fade won&#x27;t get rid of. Another common concern that I have heard of is ingrown hairs. I have noticed some more on my legs but I exfoliate with a puff in the shower and so far so good. I have taken to epilating my once every 2-2.5 weeks which is a major improvement from shaving every couple of days. It takes me about 10-20 min each time and I usually watch a tv show or something while I&#x27;m doing it. I also love the fact that I can&#x27;t accidentally cut myself with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this was a good purchase and it looks like it will hold up for awhile so it is worth the money. It saves me time and injury, it is easily transportable,not dangerous for children, and it is very effective!</li>
            <li> Best ever!  Lives up to its&#x27; reviews.  Buy this</li>
            <li> It sucks o.o My hair is pretty thick but it can only grab one or two. My arm hair is thinner and it cant grab any of them.  how did this product get any stars? A scam..?</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> I got it for my spouse and it&#x27;s actually very painful. It&#x27;s been in the shelf ever since and I don&#x27;t think she is going to use it ever again!</li>
            <li> Good purchase. Received very quick. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product worked well for a while, but after owning it for less than 4 months, the connection to the power cord has become faulty. Now I have to hold the cord at a very precise angle to get it to work, and even then it&#x27;s only intermittently functional. I know that the item is still under warranty, I guess now I&#x27;ll find out how easy it is to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> Male perspective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit it. I shave my legs. I received this as a gag for christmas. Sure, I&#x27;ll try it. My response? &amp;#34;WHY THE HELL AM I DOING THIS TO MYSELF?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it hurts. Sure, it lasts longer than shaving, but it comes at a price.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised! At first I thought it was going to hurt, but turns out that it didn&#x27;t. Even if it sometimes does, its still not that bad. Money well spent!</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use epilator. I like this epilator&#x27;s price. So I bought it.  But it is terrible! It didn&#x27;t work anything even before I removed my hair by using remove cream. so my hair was really short.  Can I refund this product?? Do not but this stuff.</li>
            <li> It pulls even the tiny hair and it does not hurt nor pinch my skin like others I previously owned.</li>
            <li> Very good. It works and doesn&#x27;t hurt that much as was expected.</li>
            <li> Love this thing, it&#x27;s my first time using an epilator and it&#x27;s great so far. Painful at first but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It does work very well at removing all the hair. The first time you use it it seems not to remove them completely all the way to the root. But from second time on, it removes everything! I really like it! I&#x27;m giving 4 stars just because I wish it had a faster speed.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy, little, powerhouse. It is corded and I love this. This is the first corded, real epilator I have ever had and I am happy with this for the price I paid for it. It is a great deal for those on a budget. I sometimes need to go back over the area, but I think this is my technique and not the grip of the head.</li>
            <li> i have other these 3 times already the first i loved it but i forgot it in my hotel so i had to order another one, the second one i got wasnt that good it hurted my arms really bad&amp;#62; I was reluctant to re order another one but i did anyways and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Received when quoted as promised.  Had an epiilator in the 80&#x27;s and it still hurts but pain gets less the more you use it.</li>
            <li> First of all, I think this product is awesome in theory. If you can capture the hair, it does an amazing job of making legs smooth for longer time. However, it took me Forever to get the hairs and I couldn&#x27;t even get most of them!!! I let the hairs grow out for days and I still could not get most of the hairs in one setting! I spent hours using this device and found it to be inefficient at removing most of my hairs. I think I won&#x27;t use it again, it&#x27;s too frustrating. I think it&#x27;s a lot better for fine hair, since it easily removed longer, finer hairs but not my short thick hairs. I am on a quest to find an epilator that works more efficiently.</li>
            <li> It is terribly painful, and it only breaks hair rather than clear it. The only con that I can think of is that it is small.</li>
            <li> I have to go over a couple of time and it doesn&#x27;t pull all the hairs out the roots but it does cut the hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I love my depilator. Inhas one before, same brand, and it was with me for years!!! Now was time to have a new one and so far I have the same gret product but new.</li>
            <li> Works well. I find that areas of hair on my leg do grow in either a lot thinner, slower, or almost not at all for a long time after using this.  Of course, it hurts. You get used to it after going over your leg a few times.  Hurts less well you pull the skin tight.  I like that the wire to plug in a long so you can sit comfortably.  Cleaning is easy.  I recommended this to a friend, they bought it, and now they love it as well. :)  They&#x27;re tough enough to use it on their bikini line, but neither of us are tough enough for the armpits yet.</li>
            <li> This epilator does what it&#x27;s supposed to - but it is literally like pulling out each of your hairs with a pair of tweezers. Although, to be fair, this is much faster. As a devotee of waxing, I expect that this too will become less painful over time, and if you can delude yourself into pretending that you are just using an electric razor, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> excellent product ... it&#x27;s functional, it really does the job...it removes body hair perfectly, . i thick that is definitely a good buy</li>
            <li> Excellent packaging! Timely shipping! The epilator is beautiful, and is exactly what I ordered. The picture was 100$ accurate in it&#x27;s depiction! Thank you for a wonderful product, and for packaging that withstood my brutal delivery man!! - Psssst! - and all my hair, from the neck down, is gone!!!</li>
            <li> Im not really sure if I&#x27;m just a whimp or what...but Its too painful for me. Ive never had one of these before so I&#x27;m not sure if its supposed to hurt as bad as this did.</li>
            <li> The device is easy to use. While it is slightly painful in the beginning, after a few tries the hairs are a lot was easier to remove and its almost painless.</li>
            <li> This thing is so cool. It sounds like a chainsaw (sorry, neighbors), but it yanks out your hairs waaay faster than you ever could with a pair of tweezers, and your legs are silk smooth for days.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. I bought it and then watched a bunch of YouTube videos and scared myself. It sat on my counter for about a month before I forced myself to try it. I did as the instructions suggested and exfoliated for a few days before. Yes, it does pinch a little in certain spots, like around your ankles, knee, and behind the knee. But it&#x27;s not as bad as you may think. My legs had a few red spots but they were gone by morning. My legs a super soft and its great. I have dark hair and super pale skin so just shaving wasnt working for me, waxing was so messy, and this hurt way less then the last time I got lasered. So happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> This epilator is great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to try an Epilator because I&#x27;m a pretty hairy individual and I hated shaving in the morning and literally having a 5:00 shadow on my legs by the end of the day. I tried waxing but that takes so long, you have to wait for your hair to grow back in, and you have to take a shower and clean up the mess you made. So I ended up just being hairy all the time because who wants to plan a &amp;#34;waxing my f-ing legs&amp;#34; night. Not to mention the time my boyfriend walked in right as I was ripping off the bikini strip, he was horrified.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator has been a huge improvement. I epilate maybe once a week, just to clean things up here and there. If you don&#x27;t have ADD like me and actually take the time to get all the hair in one go, you will probably have to do it less often.&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution: I had been waxing so switching to epilating wasn&#x27;t painful at all. If you&#x27;re a wollybear and want to start using one, you might want to wax first... or take a few shots of whiskey. Seriously. That&#x27;s how I used to wax my legs.&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I would get an epilator with more speeds or maybe more tweezing blades to make things go faster. For the price, this is a pretty nifty tool if you&#x27;re wolly like me.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised - its not battery operated..  I thought it was rechargable but its not, but overall a good product.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with it-- some areas need to be gone over a few times - but the results are impressive</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator. IT took awhile and have to read many reviews! I decided this will be the first I will purchase, mostly because of the decent price. So far so good. It is easy to use, easy to clean. Although it does not really remove a lot of hair or the short hairs, so I am not certain if it is my technique on epilating or the epilator itself.</li>
            <li> Discomfort for first time users especially if you have coarser hair, but definitely does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I wish I had never purchased this product. It was soooooo painful to use this product, and there were so many blood spots after using it on my legs. I can&#x27;t believe people even used it on their face or bikini areas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my wife. It got five stars just because her legs is are smooth as I like. However, this devices still make too much noise. So, if you got upset with pitch and continuous noise forgot it.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of any epilator. Before, I used to do get hot wax done on my legs. I have much hair growth on my legs.So after waxing, within 3 weeks hair will start to be very visible. How this epilator saved me is that, I can easily remove those new and medium long hair easily and with less pain. Thus have a clean leg for a longer duration. But using epilator on fully grown hair on my legs seemed very painful for me. So the strategy i use is get a waxing once in 4-5 months to get a thoroughly cleaned leg and follow it up with epilator every 2-3 weeks. This helps me save time money. I recommend using epilator after bath but on dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The user manual that comes with it says that epilator should only be used on legs. So I didnt use it on my hands.Wondering if anyone had prior experience using it on hands.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Philips Satinelle Epilator. The 1st one lasted me over 20 years! I think Philips was the 1st company to come out with Epilator units. (But I could be wrong) You are not going to have that smooth as silk feeling that you get with shaving when you first start using it.  But over time the hair will be less &amp; less &amp; it will grow back in longer &amp; longer periods of time. I hardly ever have to do my thighs now, maybe once every 3-4 months. But I&#x27;m still working on my calf (lower) legs more often - However-- that is because I&#x27;ve shaved my lower legs off &amp; on thru the years. I really wish I hadn&#x27;t have &amp; my lower legs would be like my thighs, having hardly any hair at all coming in &amp; when it does you can barely feel it or see it. I&#x27;m now committed to my lower legs and will not go back to shaving at all, (middle aged now &amp; it&#x27;s just not that important to me that they be silky-smooth all the time). Plus I know it won&#x27;t take long for them to be as smooth as my thighs feel if I just stick with it &amp; never shave again. I also use it in bikini area, YES it smarts, but just hold your skin taunt/tight &amp; there again, the nice thing is it doesn&#x27;t come back in like after shaving.  The first few times you use it on your legs you will feel it, but after a few times you get used to it &amp; it smarts less &amp; less. (And it&#x27;s not like unbearable pain or something, just smarts a tad) To get the best results wait for your hair to grow out quite a bit each time you use it. It does a better job at getting more hair. I see no need to spend a lot of money on an Epilator, from my research they all work the same way as far as the mechanism itself. I love my new Philips Epilator and would have given it 5 stars, but in the end it&#x27;s still not like shaving, but then again it doesn&#x27;t claim to be. It claims to remove hair over time which is what it does, it just takes time &amp; diligence to achieve that goal. If you&#x27;re tired of shaving, I say go for it! Also, and I can&#x27;t stress this enough!! -- ifyou have a daughter get her started on this &amp; make sure she never shaves - I so wish I would have never shaved when I was a teenager &amp; had begun with an epilator. It&#x27;s shaving that makes the hair come back so quickly &amp; so coarse. Before you ever shave the hair&#x27;s soft and an epilator would work perfectly for the rest of one&#x27;s life. (BTW, not recommended for under arms, shaving still fits the bill there.)</li>
            <li> Used a few times and then it broke. Won&#x27;t turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the fact you have to keep it plugged to keep using it. When shaving, you would need to go over slowly to get the hair but it&#x27;s pretty painful for first timers.I didn&#x27;t expect to bleed a little too, so I would advise to use with caution BUT it keeps u hairless longer</li>
            <li> I use this once a week and it works great, It does what an epilator is supposed to do and its compact enought to take along discretly on trips.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I received it in the mail today and couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  I like that it has two speeds and you can remove the plucker section to wash.  I like that it&#x27;s corded too.  I don&#x27;t think one battery charge would be enough to get the job done.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is there&#x27;s no catcher for the hairs.  I have no idea if it would be possible to add that feature, but it&#x27;s a bit messy.  I would recommend using it in the bathroom but you can always put a towel down somewhere more comfortable.  What I REALLY love are my smooth legs!  I&#x27;ve never had legs this smooth and I can&#x27;t stop touching them :-)  I hope this becomes less painful over time.  I will never use a razor again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a little more detail about epilating if you care to read:  This is my second time ever using an epilator and I was seriously scared of the pain!  Being a newbie, I started-out very slowly.  It took me about 3 hours to do both legs beneath the knees.  I hear from others that it gets easier and less painful the more you do it.  Definitely do not use it like a razor like I did the first time.  The first time I epilated, I pulled it slowly up my leg and OUCH!!  If you want less pain, go little by little, back and forth, inch by inch.  It also helped me to hold the skin taught where I was epilating - place your pointer finger and thumb and act as though you&#x27;re trying to stretch the skin.  It dulled the pain for me.  For extra sensitive areas (such as the knees), I turned up the speed and moved the device back &amp; forth faster.  This reduced tugging on stubborn hairs and made it feel more like a quick tweezer pluck.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done quickly.  I got this to replace my old epilator, I only wish that this one was cordless too.</li>
            <li> I like this product it is very good pain for if you never used 1 before like my self but it is worth it and you can use it on you legs arms and face even though it says just for legs</li>
            <li> Not bad. But it&#x27;s mostly for women.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality thing. Does its job like it&#x27;s supposed to. Easy to clean plus I like the design. Had a brown before and these are comparable. I would say this one does the job a lil quicker.</li>
            <li> It works great for me . I am happy to have it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever used an epilator and I honestly was afraid to use it from some of the reports about the pain of it.  HONESTLY, it is just a little sting and works so well at removing any stray facial hairs that you might have.  They just disappear and I have not had to worry about them for at least 10 days to two weeks after using it.  I JUST LOVE THIS and wanted to reassure you that it does work and is a great little epilator.  I have not used it on my upper lip which everyone says is so painful yet because I really don&#x27;t have that problem, but on your chin it is is just wonderful and just a little pinch.  after you use it once, the second time you barely feel anything. DON&#x27;T hesitate to try this. You won&#x27;t be sorry and for the price I find it just perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never epilated before, and have only waxed my legs with those pre-waxed strips once or twice that always end up messy and irritating the skin more than pulling out any hair. i usually shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My roommate in college had an epilator, and the thought of having smooth and non-hairy legs all the time was appealing in a college-setting, where I wore shorts around my room and would have random neighbors visit at all hours of the day and night. it would be nice to not have to quickly change into long sweat pants whenever we had a visitor. I had a 30$ giftcard to amazon, so my total cost for this ended up being 5$, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i received it I quickly tried it. I exfoliated my legs with a loufa. My leg hairs are somewhat fine, and they were about the ideal 3-4 mm length. I started the epilator on speed one, and was more scared by the sound than anything. I didn&#x27;t use purple head-piece/cap thing. It was useless.  I lightly touched the epilator to my skin and then forced my self to hold it and drag it across my skin. I was surprised at how painless it was. I don&#x27;t wax or epilate normally, so it&#x27;s not as if I became used to the pain. For me, if just felt as if someone was dragging a comb with sharp teeth across my skin (not to the point of pain, just a little irritation. It felt as if how you feel when you scratch dry skin--not painful perse, but kinda itchy and irritable). The skin around my knees was more sensitive. But even then, not so much pain as kind of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the efficacy, it&#x27;s hard to tell just from looking at my legs (my room lights are somewhat dim). most of the major visible hairs are gone off my legs. If i look at the white epilator itself, i can see the hairs that have come off. Many of them i can see the tips have the follicle/round black part on them, which mean that they have been successfully pulled off from the root. Some of the other ones look like they have been ripped/broken off. It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what percentage of my hairs were ripped vs. pulled out successfully. Additionally, my legs still feel very very sightly stubbly since the tiniest of hairs did not come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After i finished, i actually exfoliated my legs again with St. Ives apricot scrub, which is what I use on my face. I want to be sure that I don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs, which would be another good way to measure the effectiveness of the epilator. I will wait and see, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see the long term results, but I&#x27;m surprised at how well it worked compared to some of the reviews other people gave regarding pain and time (atleast for a first time user). I&#x27;d say it didn&#x27;t take 10 minutes per leg for me, but maybe 5 (just to stop and see where hair is left on my leg). It is pretty loud, but i feel like most epilators will be loud. don&#x27;t be intimidated by the sound. My skin also didn&#x27;t get too red or bumpy either. I usually take care of my skin, so maybe that&#x27;s why it wasn&#x27;t so sensitive. Because I&#x27;m a first time user, it&#x27;s possible that I didn&#x27;t get the full extent of pain because i didn&#x27;t hold it correctly, and I only used it on my legs. But given the circumstances, I&#x27;m happy with my $5 brand name epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for the past 15 years and I love this one. It is simple and effective.</li>
            <li> It doens&#x27;t work well as I thought. And sometimes it hurts myself. I suggest you to buy an expensive one</li>
            <li> It is scary at the first use, with the sound and the pain. If you have not shave/wax your leg for a while and let the hair grow, it would be pretty painful when you use this since it would have to catch more hair each time when you have hair almost everywhere. However, if you do this every week or so (depends on how fast your hair grow), you would only need to deal with the new-grow hair, so less dense hair you would have. You may find it miss some hair the first or even second passing, sometimes changing the direction would help to eventually remove it. I found it very effective with even shorter hair. I also use this for underarm, which is usually not suggested. It is definitely more painful for underarm, but it gets better after few trials. I like how clean it is compare to shaving, and it is much more convenient than using wax. No need to wait for the hair to grow until to effective length, and no mess at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I missed the return by date, this is not what I thought it was at all. Now I&#x27;m stuck with a $60 razor I have no use for.</li>
            <li> Got this to clean up some &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; and oh my, it works.  When I first turned it on I was a little terrified but ran it across my should and left it perfectly clear with minimal pain.  Gotta say after I finished laughing about it I was very impressed.  It&#x27;s loud and mean looking when you look at what is actually ripping the hair out of your body despite the happy colors.  Other than that it works very well with or without the shield and is effective. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Perfect for beginners...its not heavy and the power source has a long cable to don&#x27;t stop never</li>
            <li> I love it. You´re hairless in just minutes without struggling with warm wax in the summer heat. It´s supper comfortable to carry and small enough to store it anywhere.  Perfect for travelling abroad, too. You can plug it in pretty much in all countries since the input is from 100v to 240v .</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as the last one I had. It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> If I would have noticed the refund deadline, I would have returned it. But now its mine to keep. Doesn&#x27;t work well. I have to repeatedly run it over the same spot just to get one strand of hair. I have both thick hair in certain areas and soft hair in others. So in theory it should have worked on one or the other (ideally both), but it doesn&#x27;t really work with either types of hair. I still run it slowly over my legs multiple times and then grab my razor.</li>
            <li> Very convenient device. Simple in use</li>
            <li> I only gave it one star because it simply stopped working after about 6 uses!  Before that it worked OK.  It didn&#x27;t catch all of the hairs on my legs.</li>
            <li> Bought this a little less than 8 months ago, and sang its praises until yesterday when it started to cut out on me. Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> It is great but it does heat up a little and your hand feels funny due to all that vibration lol. Overall, it&#x27;s easy to use on the legs. I&#x27;d say not very good if you have really thin and soft hair, I think it breaks them a lot.</li>
            <li> Picture is a little deceiving. it&#x27;s not cordless. Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice little gadget. Because of the slight curve, it fits naturally in the palm of your hand. Also, it is pretty loud so it&#x27;s kinda scary if its your first time. Not so painful on the arms and legs, if you&#x27;re experienced with the sensation of having been waxed. I did a lot of research prior to my purchase and for the price range, this is considered the best. Highly recommended if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews but I thought this hurt not for me at all</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, and although it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I had hoped, I&#x27;m still happy with my purchase.  I still shave regularly (every other day or so), but this does help my legs get less scratchy between shaves.  Most of the hair on my arms and legs is very fine and blonde, so with these hairs it tends to just break a lot of them instead of pulling them out.  I find that it works a lot better on thicker hair (such as underarms or bikini area) and I&#x27;ve had better results with that.  I have noticed a few ingrown hairs on my legs and I didn&#x27;t have them before, but I&#x27;m prone to them on other parts of my body anyway so it doesn&#x27;t surprise me.  As far as pain goes, I think it depends a lot on where you plan to use it.  On my arms, legs, and underarms it was way better than I expected--just a little stinging but nothing unmanageable.  It hurts more on the face, the tummy, and especially the bikini area, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.  Besides, if it hurts, that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s working!  The cord is plenty long if you&#x27;re worried about that, but it does tend to tangle easily, and sometimes when I&#x27;m using it flickers on and off because the part where the cord plugs into the unit is loose or something.  And I threw away the cap because I sat on it and broke it (oops) but it doesn&#x27;t do much anyway.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase, even if it isn&#x27;t totally effective, and for the price compared to other epilators I think it does a good enough job.</li>
            <li> My hair grows back much more slowly and thinner now. This epilator works great and it&#x27;s a plus that it&#x27;s on the cheap end. I just wish epilators in general weren&#x27;t so loud.</li>
            <li> OH my Gosh does this thing Hurt LOL&lt;br /&gt;Apparently its meant for LEGS ONLY so its my fault but do NOT try to do your Chest with this it is Torture!&lt;br /&gt;The item itself is Great for Thin clumps of hair and it stays away for a good While. Doesn&#x27;t hurt when the hair is not to Thick.</li>
            <li> works fine, just a little uncomfortable to use..</li>
            <li> Works good more painful than waxing but not as messy</li>
            <li> Week on power to small of head</li>
            <li> First time using epilator and love it!! Good bye to razor blades and waxing!! Oh by the way, I tried without the safety cap and it didn&#x27;t cause any harm.</li>
            <li> Though the sensation is uncomfortable when I epilate my under arms, the epilator work very good and for the price I really recommend it</li>
            <li> I should start by saying I am a faired skinned Italian girl...nuff said. I have tried it all...electrolysis, waxing, laser hair removal, cream removers, cream dyes, shaving, plucking. Short of an upper lip, chin and jawline transplant I have done everything. The electrolysis I did years ago left my upper lip scarred but removed the black ones. Laser hair removal only killed the black hairs that had grown back but did nothing for the light hairs. After pregnancy I was left with long grey hairs of varying thicknesses as well as a few black ones under my chin and along my jawline. I tried all of the remedies above but never achieved smooth, hair-free results...UNTIL NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled this baby out of the package, read through the instructions and went for it. Was I scared? You bet my hairy chin I was. I tried it first with the safety cap and started along my jawline. I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt more. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it was not like the hairs were being licked off by kittens. It felt like small rubber bands hitting my face. But as I moved along I could handle it pretty well. I got brave and removed the cap and upped the speed. I moved to under my bottom lip and it felt like the rubber bands were getting bigger. Then I took a deep breath and headed for the upper lip. Tears began to form and I saw a few stars so I had to stop. Once I came to (kidding), I soldiered on. I decided to lower the speed and go in short bursts for this area. Yeah, I made it through. Yeah, it hurt. You just have to decide if the pain is worth the price of beauty. I was a little red after but not bad. I am curious to see how long it takes for the hair to grow back in and if they are finer. I will try to update the review. For now, I am as happy as a baby&#x27;s bottom...you know, smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you on the fence, try it. You only have hair to loose.</li>
            <li> Previously I tried using my frieds one of these of another brand and it was awesome. Sadly this one is simply ok, removes some hair, but doesn&#x27;t remove all.</li>
            <li> un modèle qui me convient, léger, pratique... efficace. Les douillettes peuvent ne pas l&#x27;apprécier, mais pas de souci de mon côté !</li>
            <li> Flimsy, cheap plastic, will break very easily.</li>
            <li> Never going back to razors even the best kind out there. No painful wax or messiness from it.Fits my wallet. If Im in a quick hurry, I just use my [[ASIN:B0018A32XS Panasonic ES2207P Ladies 3-Blade \\&quot;Close Curves\\&quot; Wet/Dry Shaver]](not razor) a leg shaver. Not only can use for legs but also great for my underarms and face.    Does what it does. And the most affordable reliable epilator for the legs out there.</li>
            <li> Love these device. Have smoother skin thanks to.</li>
            <li> I hated it so badly this was my first ever Amazon return! So terribly painful and it didn&#x27;t work very well at all. After passing over the area many, many times it still did not remove all the hair. Returned it and embarked on a more costly (but well worth it) laser hair removal experience. I say, just go for laser hair removal! Its much easier and not as expensive as you might think! Wish I had done it sooner. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> First of all, I expected pain from reading reviews. Secondly I know nothing is perfect. This particular epilator is nice for your legs. I had to do several passes, but I was going quickly to minimize the pain. You know the hairs are gone when you don&#x27;t feel pain any more. How nice. High tension skin only. I tried to use it on my under arms. That was a disaster. It pulled and pulled. I was bleeding not even halfway through. If it continues to do well on my legs, it will be well worth the price I pay on disposable razors.</li>
            <li> great for arms/ legs.  I like that it runs off a power cord - my last battery operated one died.  The cord is long enough on this one to stretch from an electrical outlet to the bathtub or sink to not cause a mess.  Very good &amp; highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had a very old epilator and my niece recommended this one to me. I am very glad I updated, this works much better!</li>
            <li> If you just want an epilator, this one is okay. It plucks but also just &amp;#34;shaves&amp;#34; so some of the hairs still grow back thick. You get what you pay for. If you are comparing this to the Panasonic epilator, I would go with the Panasonic epilator.</li>
            <li> I bought an Emjoi for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;It was a superior product.&lt;br /&gt;This may even be a 1 star review!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves too much hair behind.This is a ripoff!</li>
            <li> It stopped working after about 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;No burn, no misusing...&lt;br /&gt;It just suddenly stopped working without any reason...&lt;br /&gt;I should buy one more reliable.</li>
            <li> I love love this so much  I will say this it will hurt in the beginning but you will get used to it say bye bye to those nasty underarms  and say hello to light n hairless Beaty lol  I&#x27;m a really person  there&#x27;s Many different  ones  you just need to find the one you like but for the price this one works</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 7 months it has worked good but no longer stays on you need to shake it every few min it get it to turn on again.</li>
            <li> Very good epilator for the price. This is my 1st epilator and I&#x27;m very happy w/ this product.</li>
            <li> Tore up my face on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> It is vey nice quality and fast to remove unwanted hair</li>
            <li> pinches at first. Stick with it. I have never had smooth skin until using this. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove hair very well.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Hurts but works... the only think bad is it seems not to get ALL the hair, but it still works and last long</li>
            <li> Works well for me BUT it will not work if it&#x27;s not plugged into the outlet. I thought it was a cordless epilator. Anyone else having this problem?</li>
            <li> This is good on the leg but I bought it for facial use-VERY PAINFUL.</li>
            <li> My wife tried and liked it. It is a little less painful than others and is compact but needs a cord wich is a down. Overall, it&#x27;s a good epilator.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove most of the hairs from the root.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Emjoi epilators for 15 years. Their design and build quality has not changed (evolved) over the years. Emjoi is a decent product but the Philips is better. Better designed, the metal tweezers are machined to have closer tolerances resulting in a smother and more efficient (fewer passes) epilation. My bony knee caps were challenging with the Emjoi, requiring multiple passes. With the Philips I get the job done in a third of the time. The Philips has a 2 year warranty. Emjoi - 1 year.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this Epilator. It is painless and the hair becomes more sparse the more you use it. The last one I had was not as efficient as this one. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Hurt... yep.  But it literally tweezes the hair out.  So that is expected. I have another epilator that is about 10 years old and this is far better and less painful.  I would recommend this. Did my legs and bikini, i would recommend doing this at night as it left small red dots that dissappeared by morning. Only downfall is the head pops off easily if dropped.</li>
            <li> - too weak&lt;br /&gt;-takes too long</li>
            <li> My Italian heritage manifests itself with hairy upper arms, shoulders and back. I get waxed regularly, but for some reason the upper arm and shoulder hairs grow back fast, so I bought this thing to clean up in between sessions (shaving causes rough stubble, which is almost as bad as hairy monkey arms...).  The HP6401 works fine: if you&#x27;ve ever been waxed, the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; from this is no different. It really easy to use and if you go slow it leaves you very clean with just a couple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is that after a few uses, my triceps were covered in something much like shaving bumps - not a very attractive look - and it took almost two months after I stopped using the epilator for most of these bumps to go away (still have some).  It doesn&#x27;t look or feel like ingrown hairs, but something really got irritated. I tried lotions and potions post-treatment, but it made no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was worth a try, but I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
            <li> Good but very Painful.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended!  would buy again!!</li>
            <li> It sucks.  That is all.</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator before. After tirelessly reading the reviews and researching the specs, I chose to purchase the Philips. The cost seemed reasonable (the more expensive ones just seemed to come with more attachments, which I didn&#x27;t need), and the device was fairly straight-forward and seemed easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very nervous about the pain when I first tried it out, but it turned out to be not too bad. It was painful - like little pricks or stings - but bearable. I had to go over my legs multiple times to get all the hair, and I still didn&#x27;t get everything. I started on the first speed setting and after becoming more confident, moved to the second speed setting. I was definitely disappointed with the amount of hair removable - based on the other reviews, I thought it was going to remove everything.&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, my legs were covered in little red bumps and my skin was really irritated (as I expected). I put some lotion on and by the next morning the skin looked normal again. I tried it each day for the next couple of days - I felt the epilator tugging at missed hairs but again, it didn&#x27;t remove everything. I also couldn&#x27;t tell if the epilator was actually removing the hair or just breaking it as it pulled. My legs over the next couple of days definitely did not seem as smooth as they would have been right after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably continue to use this product, but I&#x27;m definitely disappointed with the hair removal.</li>
            <li> This item is rather flimsily made, very light. Also you must go over the hair several times before the desired effect is accomplished. No noticeable hair is  &amp;#34;plucked&amp;#34; with the first pass. I have a Braun which cost approx $30 more, and it is far superior.</li>
            <li> This product was bought as a hopeful substitute for a No! No! hair remover thing, since the No! No! is ridiculously priced. This thing viciously yanks out the hairs. Not good at all.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible rash after using another brand of epilator.  I tried other methods of hair removal with disappointing results.  Out of desperation, I decided to try this Philips epilator and I&#x27;m glad I did.  No rash!  I do use an alcohol free, fragrance free witch hazel afterwards and then for several nights and I think this helps.    Update: One time I did not use the \\&quot;Efficiency Cap\\&quot; and I developed redness and bumps.    Update 9 Months: The more I have used this epilator, the more my skin is breaking out in a rash.  I am allergic to nickle.  I called the company today and they told me the tweezers contain nickle.  I decreased the rating from 5 starts to 4 stars.  Nickle allergies are not uncommon, so it would help if Philips listed the \\&quot;Contains Nickle\\&quot; warning in the product description.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my wife got tired of me using her blades to shave my arms and legs.  It is a bit painful; however, the more you use it, the less painful it becomes and the results last for a while.</li>
            <li> This has 5 epilator heads and all the hair is taken with two strokes. It is noisy, but works just perfect. I would recommend it to everyone who wants an affordable epilator to do a wonderful job. I would also like to mention that the pain is comparatively lesser in this epilator. I have no complaints and for the cost I paid I am very happy.</li>
            <li> The product description was not accurate.  It is not battery operated and has to be plugged in to an electrical outlet.  When received the specific directions said it is not to be used on the face, while the advertising description implied it could be used on all body parts.  When I went back and checked the advertisement I found a chart at the very end of ALL Philips products did show whether cord or cordless, facial or non, etc.  But the individual product description did NOT accurately describe and gave no reference to a chart at the end of all Philips Epilator ads.  As a result, a person doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re getting unless they happen to know to read beyond the initial product description.</li>
            <li> no gentle at all !, accurate but painful device....&lt;br /&gt;i am a first time epliating and i was told by a review that it is good for sensitive skin and first time people... NOT ! SUPER FRICKING LIE</li>
            <li> It was a present for my wife, this is the one she wanted and it seems to me that works perfect! I would rather prefer something witout cord or rechargable and maybe not that noisy :-p</li>
            <li> Pretty good. But doesnt take out all of the hairs and you have to go over the same spot a few times. Overall was pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed it cut hair but didn&#x27;t remove. Huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was good at the beginning but now it seems try two three times to remove the hair in one area. I may need a new cartridge.</li>
            <li> Works brilliantly - needs US plug adapter for those who are outside the states.</li>
            <li> I had an other Epilator that lasted about two years and I loved it but this one is so much better its smaller not as bulky and u can run the top over water to get it clean  I would definitely repurchase this Epilator again</li>
            <li> Does really well to remove hairs from my legs. Would not recommend use in sensitive areas, such as under arm. I have thick hair and when I use this the hair grows in softer and thinner. Great product. I also enjoy the sensitivity guard. It really helps the epilator not hurt your skin while you epilate.</li>
            <li> This is the most painful form of hair removal ever! I expected it to hurt, but this is excruciating! You have to move very slowly in order for it to work, and it is just so painful. However, it did remove the hair.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail today and used it on my under arms and legs. Yes it does hurt, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that after a few uses I will get used to the pain. I am still excited to use it in the next few days. The only thing I&#x27;m concerned about is the ingrown hairs that I&#x27;ve read about from reading up about epilators. But anyway, when I first epilated my underarms, it did hurt and my skin got a little red..but I think it got red where I was holding the skin taut.. but I also noticed a red bump.. like a blood bump? But it wasn&#x27;t like it was all over. I think the only really scary thing for me is turning this thing on. The sound is pretty loud and it makes it sound super painful. It does hurt but it gets tolerable over time. But anyway. I think it does a great job and after I use it a few more times and get more comfortable with it, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see how great this little device is. My advice is if you&#x27;re looking to buy an epilator for the first time, this is a great choice!</li>
            <li> It really hurt when I used it on my lip at first but after I retried it a couple minutes later it wasn&#x27;t that bad. Eventually it doesn&#x27;t even hurt! You can use it on lady beards, mustaches, legs, feet, arms, legs, bikini waxing, armpits, your furry belly if that&#x27;s a problem. I wish I would&#x27;ve discovered this much earlier in my life! I recommend a corded one, buying batteries would be annoying. It&#x27;s super easy to remove the head part and clean it too! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I really enjoy this because I hate shaving. I hadn&#x27;t shaved my legs in at least a month so this is really nice if you&#x27;re not really sensitive :) Seriously if you&#x27;re debating buying this, do it. It is worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back. I don&#x27;t like using this as I get ingrown hairs EVERY TIME. I hope it is just me because the concept in great. This is easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> I have wookie legs and when I first bought this,  it hurt too much to bear using it.  So,  I  waxed instead. When the hair started  to grow back,  I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t all grow back at the same pace,  so I gave it another try and with less dense hair, the slight sting was totally manageable. I use it every couple of days.  It&#x27;s so easy to keep my legs smooth now and I don&#x27;t have to endure the mess of wax or razor rash.  I highly recommend this product. I was very reluctant to give it a try, but I am so glad I did.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  If you&#x27;re a wookie like me, and it&#x27;s your first try with an epilator, I do recommend starting with a wax first and then just using the epilator as needed to manage the regrowth. I&#x27;ve had this item for a few months now and have never had to use a razor or wax again.</li>
            <li> Overall its good. But haven&#x27;t reached my expectation. It works well for thin hair and for short hair. if anyone trying for the first time its little bit painful but bearable.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted this so I bought it for her. She says: &amp;#34;this thing is intimidating before you even manage to use it. It looks like a saw blade and sounds like one when it&#x27;s running as well. If you have sensitive skin, forget about using this. I have thick hair and wanted a solution to shaving because I have dark stubble within 24hrs of each shave. I managed to use it on most my calves without TOO much pain, but it took over an hour just to get 3/4 of my calves done. By that time, it had hurt for so long that I couldn&#x27;t take any more. I tried it out on my thighs and didn&#x27;t even bother to work on them yet- the skin on my thighs is much more sensitive and it hurt like HELL. definitely not bearable to get rid of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;overall, this thing does successfully remove hair as intended, but it&#x27;s more painful than waxing and a million times more time consuming. the price, however, is pretty nice. buy if you have a higher pain tolerance adn you&#x27;re willing to spend three hours removing your hair.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had known about this product for a while and I do not know why it took me so long to purchase it..  I&#x27;ve been waxing my self for years!  This is fabulous !!!</li>
            <li> I previously had another epilator which was also an electric shaver - shame this one isnt too as there are some regions you dont dare go near with an epilator! But for the price this does the job!</li>
            <li> This machine didn&#x27;t pull the hair from the root at all on my legs.  It broke off almost every single hair.  I went nice and slow up and down my legs to see if that helped the machine take the hairs from the root and nope, still didn&#x27;t work.  On to the next great idea...</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips HP640 Sanitelle Epilator because my cheap Tweezee broke after many years of fine service.  Although I thought this epilator was a bit pricey ($39.00),  I purchased it because other Philips products that I have bought in the past were very good.  However, this epilator does not perform.  It is bulky and does not extract fine hairs.  I find that I have to use it everyday rather than just once a month.  I&#x27;m going back to the $4.50 Tweezee.</li>
            <li> I bought this little epilator thinking that it might be a waste of money at $30, but at the same time, a good investment if it turned out to even be slightly better than how my legs react to shaving (painful coarse hair, red spots and ingrown hairs in less than a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been waxing for four years now, and have seen a significant decrease in hair density and growth. Lately I&#x27;ve become tired of all of the nasty mess caused by wax and the hassle of having to wait for my hair to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first recommendation is this: WAX YOUR LEGS BEFORE YOU USE THIS PRODUCT. This is what I had done, and now I just have to epilate every day for 5-10 minutes to remove the hair that is slowly growing in. I&#x27;ve had hairless legs, underarms, and most of my bikini line (this area in particular requires quite a bit of finesse) for the last three weeks and I could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My underarms certainly hurt quite a bit, but if you&#x27;re used to the pain of waxing your upper thighs or your bikini line, you should be fine with the pain. The legs on the other hand were almost painless, and the results are better than I could have ever imagined. It takes some getting used to at first (but the learning curve is not steep), and once you realize to keep the skin tight and hold the epilator at a 90 degree angle, you&#x27;ve pretty much become a pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who struggled through shaving for six years, and waxing for four, this option is cheaper, more effective, and less invasive than anything I have used before. And as someone who gets ingrown hairs from waxing constantly, I find that as long as I dry exfoliate with a brush, I have hardly any ingrowns now! Never going back :)</li>
            <li> I used to own a rechargeable Braun Silk-Epil unit. It was expensive but it served its purpose well. When it eventually died, i went back to waxing and shaving (alternately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have little time to spend on waxing and shaving because of two jobs, I decided to try this product, mainly because it&#x27;s more affordable than Braun and more popular brands. And voila! It serves its purpose very well too! It&#x27;s lightweight, and the size fits perfectly in my hand. I call it my newest best friend!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the epilator, are very usefull for all, i love because is electric and dont need batteries. Epilate very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved epilators as they are not as messy as wax and as a result a much faster experience. I don&#x27;t tolerate them on my bikini line or underarms but it&#x27;s a great, quick and mess free way to take care of the legs. I love this product. I&#x27;ve owned my previous one for 13 years and forgot it on our vacation. They last forever, easy to pack and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It helps me to get rid of my hair quickly. It is really useful and convenient.I recommend it strongly.You can&#x27;t miss it!!</li>
            <li> Hurts. No matter how many times I tried. I just couldn&#x27;t get past the pain. Sometimes they would pinch my skin even if I used the extra blocker piece. I&#x27;d rather use my own tweezers or just go get waxed, it would be faster and most likely less painful.</li>
            <li> Hey Everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and I bought this to remove hair from my shoulders. After having it for a week I&#x27;ve used it twice on the same area. Let me start off by saying that this thing definitely works. Much more efficient than nair, or shaving, and far less painful than waxing. There are two reasons that this epilator is 4/5 stars not 5/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1, this is still a painful way of removing hair, less so than waxing but it&#x27;s not an enjoyable experience. Perhaps it gets better the more you use it. #2 the plastic guard is pretty useless, and with it removed you need to use a fair bit of technique to remove hair without it really hurting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this is the cheapest epilator I&#x27;ve seen with good reviews and I can definitely say it works to remove the hair. If done correctly you can minimize the pain (tighten up the skin and only lightly contact it with the epilator), and hurts way less than waxing. If you&#x27;ve tried everything else like waxing, nair and shaving and you&#x27;re sick of not removing all the hair then I would certainly give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps!</li>
            <li> Very very painful! Pretty noisy as well&lt;br /&gt;But it works!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I need to try when my skin is warm after bath.</li>
            <li> Nah. I am not too impressed with this at this point, but I will continue to use it and see if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> I got this today. I debating about waxing or using an epilator.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend $100 on something I didn&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;so I ordered this. After reading reviews and tips I let my hair grow just a bit. I showered and exfoliated. I tried it on my pits first. (Dumb) I will just say OMG.  The pain was ridiculous.  I drank a significant amount of vodka before trying this so I was pretty brave.  (Which was my intent.)&lt;br /&gt;After a few swipes it got better... somewhat...  I used it on my knees and toes which (according to third parties) are pretty hairy. There it did not feel too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching closely I could literally see the hair getting pulled  away.  I could see how if you just ran this periodically over hairy areas the pain would not be as intense.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this on my lower legs and again on my pits &amp;#34;gasp&amp;#34;  Even when sober.  (Maybe)&lt;br /&gt;I do have a high tolerance for pain and I can torture myself when needed.&lt;br /&gt;#1 have a few good drinks before epolating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 take a hot shower and exfoliate&lt;br /&gt;#3 tell yourself that tomorrow is a new day and go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: pain is not permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will totally use this again because I like pain and hate hair.</li>
            <li> Was effective only for a month or so...</li>
            <li> It works perfectly! It even gets the small hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually being lenient with this review on this product, mainly because I was not aware it was only intended for legs only by design, and I also did not know one needed to use these things shortly after a couple of days of exfoliation, and shortly after a shower to loosen the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a first use, I noticed quite a number of hairs did not come out, but were merely broken near the skin, leaving some stubble. Also noticed a lot of red bumps where thicker hairs were removed, or just pulled on, and broken instead of being removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this product works best are areas where hair is thinner, at least that&#x27;s the performance I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish I&#x27;d gotten the more expansive models which are intended for body hair, rather than just legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this thing had rechargeable batteries. The power cord is not quite long enough to use without some form of extension cord, even though the manual advises against using extension cords. Kind of lame, that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time epilating body hair. It is a bit painful, but if you&#x27;re careful, and don&#x27;t try to mow through too much, too quickly, it&#x27;s not as bad as the youtube videos of guys freaking out at the first touch of these things appear. I&#x27;d describe the sensation as being like getting a zap from a doorknob on a cold winter day after walking across a carpet. Only it&#x27;s happening a lot until the hairs are gone. If you just start by touching the skin a few times, and then slowly work your way through for a few seconds at a time, it&#x27;s not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, the advantage of epilating over shaving is well worth the discomfort. Shaving results in a lot of irritation only a couple of days later. Epilating lasts much longer, with no irritation later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely get a more expensive model later on.</li>
            <li> I have 3 epilator and I bought this one on sale for 25 dollars so I thought I would give it a try. It&#x27;s not as good as silk epil epilator, it&#x27;s very weak and doesn&#x27;t get the hair out easily. I have coarse thick hair and it kinda breaks some just above the surface. It&#x27;s very flimsy and cheaply made. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I would buy a more expensive one next time because my legs still feel stubbly since it cannot get at the really short hairs.  I love epilating so far.  Warning to those who have never done it: The first time you will be mostly saying &amp;#34;Mommy!&amp;#34; or some such expletive the whole time.  I didn&#x27;t use lidocaine and it took me a few nights to remove my first bunch of hair.  My aunt suggested Tend Skin to help prevent  ingrown hairs.  Haven&#x27;t had too many.  My mom claims this one does not do fine hair well, but I don&#x27;t know that I have had so much problem with that.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife. It&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks but she likes it so far. Used it on her arms and it took a week for the hairs to grow back. The hairs weren&#x27;t even noticeable. She did say that it was a little painful at first but got used to it.</li>
            <li> Wish it too more hair off by the root. It sometimes cut the hair. Got used to the pain though.</li>
            <li> it came even before the expected date and it was exacly as advertised. thank you</li>
            <li> I got it to remove the fine hair on my arms. I&#x27;ve used one before but OMG ,,, this one crunched down hard and actually ate a piece of skin leaving a huge bruise behind. Sent it back to Amazon the next day</li>
            <li> Gets the job done! Seems sturdy</li>
            <li> The product does not work as described in the product description. Does not remove hair with efficiency shield on, without shield scratches/breaks skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife using the Braun 5270 Xelle Silk-Epil Epilator Model: 5395 and the Braun beats the Phillips hands down.</li>
            <li> Received my purchase in really good time, and in good order.  This is my first epilator, so was a tad nervous about using it after reading some of the reviews.  I gave it a 4 star, because it would be perfect if it was battery operated, not reliant on a cord.  Love the shape, easy to hold on to .  Love the color and design.  Very easy to assemble, use and clean.  The instructions would be better for some if they had a picture showing angle placement they are describing (sometimes a lot of words get in the way of the visual).  The &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; was not horrific :D  it is a shocker if your new at it, but it is more a slight/quick sting, then poof gone.  I found that if I went in fast little spurts the initial sting was nothing, and after a few minutes your zipping along in your own little world.  I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this, and will continue to use it regularly.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Does the job of getting rid of my hair, pain yea but I have a high pain threshold...I will never go back to waxing or shaving...this is it for me...great eplicator with the exception of it being plug in only, it does what it says on the tin...Just be prepared for pain...</li>
            <li> It woks great but a little tab broke that keeps the head on! I just taped it and it works fine!</li>
            <li> Needed a new one and this is thee very best one ive ever used.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do it pulls the hair out by the root ! Works great if you can get used to it, i have ;)</li>
            <li> works well for the price!</li>
            <li> Works well on Mom&#x27;s sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> Very affordable epilator that does the job well. It was initially painful, but I became accustomed to it over time. My armpits are now beautiful and don&#x27;t have a shadow.</li>
            <li> It hurts to use but the hair definitely goes away. My old one was quieter and the vibration much smoother. I also really miss the light on my previous one, which with time had slowed down and was not as effective as it once has been.</li>
            <li> Good for simple hair removal</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again.  It is entirely ineffective at hair removal.  Going over the same small area of skin for minutes still does not remove the hair.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK AT ALL. A MICKEY MOUSE!!!</li>
            <li> Its good. Works very well.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this product years ago.  It is very efficient at removing hair and not as expensive as some.  I am tired of shaving every couple of days and this was my solution.  For me it was not painful, and the subsequent times no pain!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s helpless</li>
            <li> This thing hurt like the dickens...very painful! I gave it three tries and could take no more. I absolutely do not recommend the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. My wife loves it. Recommend to others too.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time. I got this for a very low price with discount. The item is in great condition. It&#x27;s just that its bag is missing on the box.</li>
            <li> Started off great! But sooner than expected (less than one year?) it broke down and it seems the cord has a short. It constantly just stops. Can&#x27;t really use it anymore. Afraid to buy again.</li>
            <li> Seems to pull a bit more due to speed of product - I have tried a few  this was to replace the one that took a walk..This will do for now...Still don&#x27;t get why these seem to be a bit over priced... Just yet another thing women have to purchase to maintain. Hair&amp;#34;-)</li>
            <li> After using it for two weeks her legs are all bumpy and rough.  Not the little red bumps from using the device, those clear up by morning, these are just rough bumps all over the legs.  Trying to see if she can return it but Phillips wants her to pay for shipping, she might have to go see a dermatologist over this.</li>
            <li> all went perfect. Im happy and satisfied. Great service as usual.Thank you</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, but you may not like the results.  I would definately not use this on coarse hair,  I even had ingrown hair on my calfs afterwards.</li>
            <li> works great. but very painful. not the products fault just the design of ripping your hair out</li>
            <li> My legs never really feel smooth after using this but the results last a lot longer than shaving. It doesn&#x27;t get every hair so don&#x27;t expect smooth legs. It is painful the first two times you use it but then it doesn&#x27;t really hurt. Maybe the more expensive ones get more hair but then again I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work on my fine hairs and I read all the instructions and followed them to the &#x27;t&#x27;.  All it did was break off my hairs and I had stubbly legs.  I tried a few times thinking my hair was not long enough even though it says hair doesnt have to be longer then 1/4 of an inch.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It works great, the hair is gone...but when is comming back, it gets stuck and I got bumps on my legs. Maybe is just until my legs get used to?!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small and sweet and it works good. I like it :)</li>
            <li> useful product and nice packaging. It is far better than doing waxing by self. I felt this is making hair grow to get delayed. travel friendly.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but it is not for the feint of heart it hurts bad!</li>
            <li> A bit painful, I suppose it takes time getting used to. It works fine on more fine hairs, however, does not grab coarse hairs as well. I was a little disappointed because I purchased this product hoping to remove the hairs in my more &amp;#34;private region&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This epilator works great. It catches even tiny hairs easily and does the job much more quickly than my old epilator. I&#x27;ve had this for several months and don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. It only got off half the hair and a lot came back in grown. I&#x27;d rather stick with shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> This is the worst epilator that I have ever tried. It is not doing the only thing that is produced for: it would not catch almost any hair. Not to mention that for the bikini area wold not catch even one hair. In addition, the surface of the discs is irritating the skin so much that after epilating my underarm, for example, it would get extremely red.&lt;br /&gt;The same model from 10 years ago was fantastic, but everything nowadays gets more and more weak and artificial, so we can buy more and more often the same product.&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed with this product. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair as well as I&#x27;d hoped it would (repeated use required for one session), and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator. It hurts, but it works well. I&#x27;ve even had decent success on my upper lip, though I needed to get a few straggling hairs with manual tweezing.</li>
            <li> If you have the time to remove hair with this, then this is a good buy. It works slowly, and it does hurt. But you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Sorry I purchased it. A waste of money. Takes off fine hair. But forget that course facial hair that comes with age. You have to let it grow too long for it to catch. I will continue to pluck before letting it get to a 1/4 inch as they say. Not sure if it will do it then either. Most of the time it just breaks the hair on the fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Works really well but sure is loud...</li>
            <li> Pathetic.i kept using it on my legs but it pulled out so few hairs.i returned it.</li>
            <li> works but because it is not battery operated definitely more powerful - which for me means more pain&lt;br /&gt;does good job of cleaning up small hairs so I will keep using - don&#x27;t want to be bearded lady</li>
            <li> Just used this- it is awesome!!!  I personally did not feel much pain, but I did experience some redness/swelling afterward.  Can&#x27;t believe I was using razors and tweezers for so long, when I could have just been using this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is pretty long,which is good and bad.  Good in that you have more range, but bad in that It can get kind of tangled up if you aren&#x27;t careful.  I&#x27;ll probably end up finding a piece of cardboard or something similar to wrap it around to keep it organized.  It would be great if it were cordless, but for this price, I&#x27;m totally fine with it.</li>
            <li> Well it does plucks your hair, it really does. The first time I used it it wasn&#x27;t doing much first because I was scared of the pain and second because my hairs were too short I believe. I decided to give it a few days and used it again, it worked! Hurt but you get use to it. One thing I quite not like is that my skin is still kinda irritated on the next day whereas I thought it was going to be okay, but it&#x27;s not something so noticeable. My legs are hairless and look nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it on my armpits (ouch) hurt a little bit more but you get use to it as well. Overall I am happy with my purchase and hope to take advantage of it for a long time. Oh something to keep in mind, this thing is noisy!</li>
            <li> The good:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t cause extreme pain unless you use it on sensitive parts.&lt;br /&gt;The shape of it is pretty good.  I was able to get under my arms pretty well without having to contort, twist, or pull.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not cordless.&lt;br /&gt;I dropped it once and it broke.  So be careful if you get it.&lt;br /&gt;Even if I hadn&#x27;t dropped it, it was still going to break.  The gears are plastic and wear down fast with any degree of moderate use.</li>
            <li> it breaks hairs constantly and hardly ever actually pulls the roots out. i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my wife and she loves it, because she had one for more than 10 years and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a motorized row of tweezers. You do have to hold it at the correct angle for it to work well, so read the instructions and practice using the included pink/purple snap on guide. If you don&#x27;t learn to do it right, you will only break off hairs at the surface and end up with ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I found that I have the best outcome if I use it right after a shower (exfoliate the area to prevent clogged follicles) and use either an antiseptic spray or astringent like sea breeze on the area immediately (and for the next couple days.) The antiseptic/astringent is very important! If you are prone to clogged pores or body acne, plucking all of that hair is going to leave a lot of places for bacteria, dirt and oil to gunk up. You will look like you are covered in zits! Using sea breeze will clear this up after a few days, though.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever purchased and used, and after the initial horrifying experience of getting used to the way it feels, I&#x27;m overall pretty pleased with this product. Although it does have to be plugged into the wall, the cord is very long and I haven&#x27;t had a problem finding a spot to use it in. As a first time user, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. After about 20 mintues on each leg (at full growth) there is minimal regrowth after over two weeks, this coming from a person who usually has to shave every other day. The price is great compared to other models I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon and overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. I probably won&#x27;t use it anywhere besides my legs because I can barely stand that pain, but it&#x27;s perfect for people who hate shaving in the shower. The only downside is that I had some trouble cleaning it but overall I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of tattoos which is the process of many small needles piercing your skin repeatedly for hours at a time. The process of getting tattooed is very painful. The pain that this epilator causes totally eclipses that pain and all other pains. I will reevaluate my review once I have had the experience of passing a kidney stone but for now this thing reigns supreme. That being said. If you need to water board some one but your torture area has carpet this device would provide a great alternative!</li>
            <li> This is the most painful thing ever!  This is coming from someone who has tattoos and had a tumor in her leg.  It was ridiculously painful and ridiculous to use. 90 degrees, okay I get it, but damn!  It was terrible!  I will never buy anything like this again!</li>
            <li> Not effective at hair removal.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife beacause she has an older model since 2005 but this new one it was a total disaster she had to go to the doctor after she used for the first time this new one! She had an allergy on her legs and the Phillip satinelle didn&#x27;t shave the hair like the old one she usually use! She is not happy with this new model! Bad Choice!</li>
            <li> This works wonders!! I absolutely LOVE it! It can be a tad painful when the hair is longer.</li>
            <li> M loving it. It is really worth every single penny! It is easy to use and very handy.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I bought another epilator (much more expensive), and it did not work nearly as well and it broke within a few uses. This epilator is hard-working and durable. The efficiency cap really makes a difference in pain level and the curves like knees and bikini line, but it still leaves behind a few hairs in the hard to reach areas. I use to wax, but it gets messy and expensive. I have already recommended this product several times to friends, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to switch from waxing and shaving!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve have always had really thick hair on my legs and it has already thinned them out in 3 uses. I did have some ingrown hair after the second use but do not have any issues now. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator ever. I dint feel much pain while epilating as I have very thin hair. Though it misses some hair I love this. Needs two or more swipes sometimes to catch the missed hair.</li>
            <li> My leg hair used to grow really fast. I had to shave the next day or my skin would break out and itch like crazy. I bought this to try and clear up some of this. It&#x27;s worked! When you first use this it feels like you are burning your leg with a lighter. It hurts. I shaved, waited a day and then started using it every day for a week until the hair was gone. It worked well because I think it would hurt like crazy if you did everything at once. Now I need to epilate about every 3 days. (Its nowhere near the weeks that they promise.) It does take a lot more time than shaving, but your hair grows in softer, your skin is healthier, and your tan stays much longer.</li>
            <li> I like this epilator. It removes the hairs quite effectively. Just the noise level it makes is high. My toddler doesn&#x27;t like the noise.</li>
            <li> I love my new Epilator. It takes some getting used to but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  Shipping was fast, and i didn&#x27;t experience any problems from this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years! It last years until you have to buy a new one! Depending in your hormones it can take up to a month until you have to wax again, unfortunately to me 2 weeks is my limit! But I loved and can not live without !</li>
            <li> This item barely works my legs I got and I am so mad I wasted my money. Sucks amazon won&#x27;t let me returned it</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Item. It&#x27;s very effective.  I tested a little area, that I will continue later on tomorrow, on my legs, and it worked great.  I was also hesitant at first, but then decided to test that area and it really is effective.  It works quiet well I believe.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! I have been using it for the past 6 months.  Previously I had been spending a fortune on waxing and this does an even better, less painful job in less time at home.  The first few times were less comfortable but effective on my dark brown leg hair.  But each time I used it it was more and more comfortable.  I attribute this to the fact that the hair which had been jerked out by its roots was becoming finer and finer.  I now have areas where the hair is no longer growing back.  I use it once a week. I never would have been able to wax that frequently. If I am careful to keep my skin taught by raising my arm and using my other hand to increase the tautness I have been able to effectively use it under my arms.  This hair is not growing back much at all.  In the past I have paid big bucks for facial waxes.  If I barely skim my face and under my chin with the epilator on low speed, gently, gently I remove that shadow of hair without any irritation.  Now this hair is not growing back either.  I wish I had found this years ago.  Do realize that ingrown hairs will not be removed but they aren&#x27;t  with shaving or waxing either.</li>
            <li> The cord stopped working, luckily within the warranty period so Philiips sent me a new one. i don&#x27;t have high expectations for the rest of the unit&#x27;s lifespan.</li>
            <li> I use to hate shaving, due to the fact that my hair would grow right back in no time. In fact I would even skip shaving sometimes but after I started using this my hair takes longer for it to grow back!Yes, its quite painful at first. In fact I was quite terrified when I opened the package up and saw it! As I was using it I felt it pulling my hairs out. The pain is definatley worth it!And you&#x27;ll get use to it n no time and will hatt much less!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I absolutely recommend it! It works fast, minimal pain (compared to waxing), and it worked on underarms as well as bikini area. I have hair that is on the thicker coarser side, and I had no problem with it grabbing the hair. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it! If you are on the fence about purchasing an epilator you should try this one before you go and pay way more for something that will work the same.</li>
            <li> it really works under my arms! Though it quite hurts using it the first time, next time it becomes much better!</li>
            <li> Great working epilator. Easy to clean and works just like it is supposed to. :) I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> It is ok, just difficult to use if the hairs are not very long.  It really pulls when you try to get rid of some hair.&lt;br /&gt;I told my hubby I would use it on his neck hairs but he declined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This winter I will let my leg hairs grow and see how it works.</li>
            <li> I have used Emjoi for years. The last time I ordered from them, it was so noisy it sounded like it was put together with parts off the floor and I returned it. This one is also noisy, BUT I didn&#x27;t pay $90!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it works great! even at low speed it did a great job!!</li>
            <li> It was painful to use this razor.</li>
            <li> Love this easy to use and east to clean epilady. Nice alternative to waxing. Easy to grip and operate the on/off switch. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I was an alright product. I tried it on my armpit. It wasn&#x27;t hurt. But it just removed 90% of hair. I epilated several times but some hair couldn&#x27;t be removed. It left my super thin hair.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an epilator.  It was intimidating, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this mainly for my underarms because I really hate shaving them. For reference, I have medium hair thickness and growth and think of myself as someone with a high pain tolerance (I have several tattoos and have given birth, so what&#x27;s a little epilating?)&lt;br /&gt;Underarms hurt. But, it only took me 3 weeks to build the tolerance to do a whole session.  I would recommend shaving 2-3 days before you epilate and make sure your underarms are dry! That is super important, and kinda tough if you are a nervous sweater.&lt;br /&gt;Legs and bikini line were no problem at all and I love not having to shave.  I now do my underarms twice a week but legs and bikini only once a week and am super happy.  Hopefully as time goes on these sessions will become fewer and farther apart.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price, time needed, and pain involved I&#x27;d still do it again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wish I could love it but first of all, it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair on a single roll/swipe. You have to roll it several times to get all the hair. Second, I wish it didn&#x27;t hurt so much. For me, it hurt. A LOT. In my opinion, my pain tolerance is above average. Many things that people find painful I usually don&#x27;t mind. However, this was SO painful that I think I will stick to shaving.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! Waste of time! Hurts, doesn&#x27;t pull all the hairs, and gives you ingrown hairs even with exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Mixed review! Oh my gawd, hurt so bad I thought I would pass out!! I could only finish half of one leg- after a couple attempts to endure the pain, I conceded that shaving isn&#x27;t really all that bad! However, this was over 5 weeks ago and I have consistently noticed that 1/2 of the leg that I used the epilator on has limited hair re-growth! It would be fantastic if I could&#x27;ve endured the torture. The epilator works and perhaps if you can manage to get past the initial excruciating pain, it lessens?  In a nutshell, loved the results, loathed the process.</li>
            <li> After having breast cancer I was told to avoid using razors on my underarms. When I saw the Philips I decided to give it a try, I&#x27;m glad I did it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Hope it will last quite some time.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Will do the job (albeit painstakingly and time-consuming)&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;After under 10 uses the cord has to be held &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; otherwise it will not power the unit&lt;br /&gt;I experienced frequent ingrown hairs (even though I followed the directions) and patches the machine simply could not pick up.  In fairness I have very fine hair, so this may be the issue.</li>
            <li> This was thee worst thing I have ever bought.  It was so painful that I never got past my ankle.  It is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about one year now and have found it to work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*essy to clean&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s very easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;*has two levels of speed intensity  to choose from (which is great and good for some stubborn hairs! haha)&lt;br /&gt;* most importantly!! - it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a great difference in my skin it is much smoother and my husband also notices and conpliments me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well for legs, private areas and arms. - have not or wouldn&#x27;t dream of using it on underarms but to each your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I am now ordering a different brand as this one cannot be used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still use this one occasionally for sure! It&#x27;s just time consuming for my lifestyle because it has to be used on clean and dry skin but at the time I shower I am always in a hurry to rush out the door so I will need an alternative. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that great product for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a way to not have to shave my legs and pits every day.  I was a little scared to try this because I thought it would hurt like h-e-double hockey sticks.  On my legs, the pain is really minimal.  The armpits and bikini area are a different story.  I guess you aren&#x27;t a really women until you have epilated your armpits!  Although painful, the results are very pleasing.  Having smooth, stuble-free pits every day is something I wish I had done a long time ago.  Really cuts down on any body odor, deodorant goes on so smooth and no more razor burn!  I would recommend using something to numb the pits and bikini area before epilating and also do it when you get out of the shower.  I used dermaplast and it took the edge off a bit.  I also used this on my face to remove some peach fuzz that gets in the way of smooth makeup application and have been very happy with how smooth my face is now.  Feels like my 2 year olds skin!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Hey it&#x27;s gonna give u a little pain - no pain no gain.  I find this definitely reduces the need to shave.&lt;br /&gt;Once u use it the pulling sensation is not so bad - u get used to it.  I only use on legs and underarms (cant speak for other areas).</li>
            <li> i love that it is electric, its a bit loud but works good. much better than my battery operated emjoi.</li>
            <li> I used this epilator to remove hair from my upper lips, it pulled and cut my skin (and I still have a scar). Fairly good for arms, legs and underarms (it is recommended that you use an antiseptic lotion on your underarms every 2 hours for a day after using this product). The best that you can get at this price!</li>
            <li> I think it works pretty well with long hairs but it barely gets the stubbles.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really loud too.</li>
            <li> very disappointed. did not get the job done</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this epilator, I owned the Emjoi AP-96 OptiMini Epilator which was purchased thru Amazon two years ago. I loved my Emjoi and was disappointed it was no longer available. As a redhead with lots of peach fuzz on my cheeks, it did a great job on my face removing the hair quickly and with reasonable discomfort. But after two years, it was worn out. So after some research, I ordered this Philips model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I hate it.&lt;br /&gt;#1: Every time I use it on the peach fuzz, I wake up the next morning with pea-size lumps covering my cheeks that linger for days. Many times they fester into acne-type lesions. Since I do nothing different that I haven&#x27;t done repeatedly for the past two years, I can only blame the machine.&lt;br /&gt;#2: The single head of rotating coils cover a small area, so it takes much longer.&lt;br /&gt;#3: The noise is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trashing this one and going to look for something made by Emjoi. Hopefully, it will be more like my original.</li>
            <li> Not as described. Had to return.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, for the price paid, especially compared to what i could get in NZ for the same price</li>
            <li> Please splurge a bit more for a better epilator. It doesn&#x27;t work well...</li>
            <li> I hate to give it one star because it does as advertised, however, this is the most painful grooming device on the planet. I call it the white devil. The pain is right up there with electrocution. I toughed through it and did a few 1 inch sections on each leg, some on the thigh where I have baby fine hair and some on the lower leg where I have super thick, dark hair that grows three hairs our of one follicle in some places. The result was the same in all areas, smooth for a day or two, and then two weeks of intense itching and ingrow hairs. Yes, I exfoliated before and after. Some people love these things, but if you&#x27;re like be and shaving gives you ingrown hairs too, this will just do the same. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of shaving every other day just to keep my legs smooth, and this product works really well at keeping them smooth for much longer. Had to do it every three or four days at first due to hairs being in various stages of growth but once I&#x27;d gotten them on a bit of a schedule I can go for a week or more without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for some pain the first few uses though if you aren&#x27;t used to having your hairs pulled out at the roots. The first time I used it I spent nearly five hours doing it because I had to keep stopping because of how badly it hurt. Figured it would be painful but wasn&#x27;t quite prepared for just how much some of the more sensitive spots would hurt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets better though, once you get it on a schedule the hairs come in more fine and in less density making the experience much easier and less painful. If you have sensitive skin like I do you might want to do this on a weekend until your skin gets used to it as well, because I had some pretty bad redness and soreness the first time that lasted for the better part of a day. Really fun day at work the next day as my pants kept reminding me of it with every step! Took several uses for it to stop happening and a decent moisturizer can really help with it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this epilator. I only received it a few days ago and I already love it! As you probably guessed, it is not entirely pain free since it pulls the hair from the roots. However, I didn&#x27;t find it to be too much to handle. If you aren&#x27;t sure whether you can deal with the discomfort, try plucking a few hairs (with a tweezer) from the area where you plan on using the epilator. Using the machine is like plucking several hair at a time. Each stroke will not remove every hair; rather, you will need to go over the area a few times, which is personally how I would prefer it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can make the process easier on yourself by exfoliating the skin and taking a shower before using the epilatot. This will make the hair softer and reduce some of the discomfort. Afterwards, you may want to apply some aftershave or lotion. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest anything highly scented though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is gentle on the skin and it&#x27;s basically impossible to cut yourself. I accidentally went over an area where I already had a cut; the epilator did not cause any issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cord is nice and long, so you don&#x27;t have to sit right next to an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Great purchase!</li>
            <li> It is a useful product anyway.</li>
            <li> Very Painful but not quit as painful as waxing.  I actually found using it on my chin to be less painful than using it on my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts just worthless. As per my wife, its lot of pain when she try to operate it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed, a basic epilator that works well. I use it for armpits and knee-down zones. I didn&#x27;t need any attachments/embellishments to it such as different caps, lights, etc., I just needed something basic, and this one met my expectations. Before I bought it I read in the reviews, one of them mentioned that it doesn&#x27;t come with a brush, which is a small shortcoming, but I had a brush from my previous epilator that I&#x27;m using now with this one, so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal for me. Lastly, I also noted how one of the reviewers mentioned that the procedure is less painful with this device, and now after a 1-month use, I can confirm it as well. I don&#x27;t know how but it does make the whole process less painful. It&#x27;s a significant plus especially on such sensitive zones as armpits. I love it, and it works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> its a good product to use. handy, easy to carry any where and gives a very clean skin back after the epillating process. It looks similar to waxing and delays hair growth too.</li>
            <li> I use a hard wax to wax my own underarms, but trying to do my own legs takes forever.  I don&#x27;t want to shave, because the hair just grows back faster and darker, then.  This is really painful, much more painful than waxing, but if you are as cheap as me, you will survive.  The first time will really hurt, but after that it only takes about half a minute to get used to it (minus the more sensitive areas like behind the knee).  If I was militant about my legs (which I don&#x27;t have to be since I&#x27;ve stopped shaving, because the hair&#x27;s lighter, at least), I would use this every two-and-a-half to three weeks, approximately.  But I&#x27;m fine with using it once a month.  It is more time-consuming than shaving and getting waxed, but it is worth it to me.</li>
            <li> It turned good. Worth buying</li>
            <li> This is a great epilator, especially for the price. It&#x27;s super easy to clean, it works very well and it&#x27;s not too painful (although that depends on people&#x27;s sensibility).</li>
            <li> Works well, sometimes it breaks the hair instead of pulling it all the way. It&#x27;s very loud, which can be kinda awkward to use when you live in a dorm. Kinda painful, but you have to get used to it. I get some ingrown hairs when the hair regrows. It&#x27;s worth the price though, most of the hair takes weeks to grow back!</li>
            <li> it irritates the skin red bumps on my skin and it hurts like the devil.</li>
            <li> I love this item. Saves me the money of waxing every month. Will definitely recommend this item! (Though I only used it on my armpits, not sure with the other sensitive parts)</li>
            <li> After years of shaving I decided to start sugaring instead. While I LOVED the results, it was tedious, messy, and awkward. I considered starting to make appointment for professional waxing again, but the cost per event was just not going to be feasible. When I remembered having an original Epilady many years ago, I wondered how it had been improved over the years. I searched reviews, watched videos on youtube, and settled on this model. Honestly, I spent a little over 2 hours using it the first time. (Visual Warning!) I have black, somewhat coarse/heavy leg hair. The hair on my legs was quite long and I wasn&#x27;t sure what sort of disaster I was going to have on my hands, but this unit took care of it with no problem! I would equate the initial pain to being stung by wasps......many many angry wasps. But my determination took over and I continued, all the way up to my bikini line. Handy tip: Be VERY careful when using this anywhere near your pubic hair. Use your imagination, it&#x27;s not a fun time. But again, once all was said and done I was sooooooo smooth and soooo satisfied with the results. I didn&#x27;t have stubble 10 minutes later, in fact I didn&#x27;t see anything worth removing for a week! Something I remembered from being waxed years ago is your hair has its own growth cycle. Once you start epilating, try to stay on a regular schedule. I DID have the typical ingrown hairs at first, but it was easy to deal with and had no pimples, boils, infections, etc. A good exfoliating glove helps tremendously, use it while you&#x27;re in the shower before you use the epilator and it will help expose any hairs that may have started to grown under that thin top layer of skin. The pain factor is severely reduced from angry wasps to nothing more than some annoying skeeters that can&#x27;t quite bite you. I am looking forward to wearing shorts this summer and I might be brave enough to wear them in public for the first time in my life! For what I would have paid for two professional waxings, I bought this epilator instead and in my opinion, from a &#x27;hairy chick&#x27;, it is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and removes hair with minimal pain!</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed to remove those errant hairs on my chin and neck.  I did use it on my legs but it seemed to take longer than just shaving first then using this to supplement in between.  Very affordable.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this epilator. My hair grows too fast and thick after shaving, so shaving my legs every other day is not an option for me ( who has time for that anyway?! ) Epilating keeps me hairless for at least a week and a half and not only that but my leg hairs are really fine and soft. This epilator might me small but it is mighty and pretty fast which is crucial for getting the job done. Plenty of little tweezers that rarely brake the hairs. My least favorite part is cleaning it, but If you want it to work properly every time you have to clean it at lest every 4 uses, but that applies to any other epilator on the market. Oh and if you wonder if it hurts, it does a little the first few times but you get used to it fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  Have to go over the hair a million times, and it hurts so bad!</li>
            <li> Great little machine. Plucks out the finest of hairs and I found it mostly pain free. Charger comes with American plug so you will need to get yourself a local plug adaptor if you live outside the States.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this thing! I am a woman in my mid-50s who has never been able to find a descent way to remove hair from my legs. I have hairy legs with black, course hair. As a teen, it was just embarrassing...after all, what girl wants to hear something like this from other girls every time she changes for gym class: &amp;#34;Eeeew...Don&#x27;t you shave?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gadget came was delivered yesterday and today my legs are free of hair, and I&#x27;m not covered in hair-follicle stubble! I had no idea how happy that would make me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Philips, for creating such an effective product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal, but it works. My old one was 13 years old so I really needed a new one and at a very low cost. This one works ok, but it&#x27;s not what I expected. I was hoping for something that worked better than my 13 year old one. What I&#x27;ve noticed on this one is that instead of pulling the hair off it cuts some of them, so I can see hair coming out after the 2nd day al ready. I gave it a 3 star for the prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> tried a few and this is by far the best. easy to use , easy to clean , had about a year now and use 3x weekly.</li>
            <li> Great deal, works very well.</li>
            <li> Love this epilator and it&#x27;s ability to pluck small hairs!</li>
            <li> This is my second one I ordered one for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
            <li> Philips is the best make for epilators. The way it&#x27;s head is designed provides really smooth result very fast without pulling your machine back and fourth many times.</li>
            <li> I have only had the item for a couple of days and used it on facial hair.  I read on the page about it being for the &amp;#34;most sensitive areas&amp;#34; BUT in the paperwork for the epilator is states to ONLY USE IT ON LEGS. Not to be used in those sensitive areas.  So if you are using it elsewhere, you do so at your own risk.  It is almost like they are providing false advertising which, to be honest, irks me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my upper lip and it worked very well so far. Can&#x27;t stand getting to the middle under my nose as it really is &amp;#34;nippy&amp;#34; and a tad too sensitive, but figure with some use each day I will get it done!  I see that where I was able to use it the stubborn hairs are gone and the skin is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just worry that, because it warns not to use if you have a tendency to get ingrown hairs, that it might cause some sort of problem.  It will take another review later down the line to check that part out.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product removes hair great in not that much tie.  I would buy this again.  The only thing that sucks is it has to stay plugged in at all times.</li>
            <li> It is painful, but not that much. Easy to usd, easy to wash. Good looking with those flowers. You can bring it and use it any place in the world, there is not problems with the electricity input.</li>
            <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It works really well, and it is a very practical option.&lt;br /&gt;I paid $30 when I purchased it, so it was even better!</li>
            <li> Was a little scared to tried the underarm area, but finally tried and love it. Works well on the legs too</li>
            <li> I chose the Philips HP6401 because of its great reviews. It does, indeed, what it says; very efficient tweezers that can pick up the small hairs of less than 1 mm. I usually don&#x27;t go back and redo an area, since the results of the first epilation are good. I am used to an epilator, thus I don&#x27;t use the efficiency cap. As a matter of fact, I noticed that the epilation is more efficient without this cap. Although this Philips has only 21 tweezers discs, it removes the hair fast and without pain (I use it for underarms, and still no discomfort). This epilator is very noisy compared to Braun wet &amp; dry. Anyway, the noise doesn&#x27;t bother me as long as the epilator continues to perform great. [I have only used it 3 times, so I don&#x27;t really know if the epilation lasts &amp;#34;for weeks&amp;#34;.]</li>
            <li> I love this epilator it is so much better than shaving, and leaves smoother skin. It can be a little painful but you will get used to it. :)</li>
            <li> works great and arrived on time</li>
            <li> package received right away, product works great.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic epilator. It is easy to hold, has two speeds and is washable. This is a great feature. I plan to order a second for as a gift.</li>
            <li> It met all of my expectations, better than waxing, better than the No No.</li>
            <li> love this, but you need thick hairs for it to really work. i had done some later so my hairs were thinner, so this broke them more than pulled them. if you haven&#x27;t done laser and your hair is &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> love this product. the price just fluctuates unpredictably at times.</li>
            <li> it works well.  barely feel the little tweaks as it pulls out hairs - i don&#x27;t know why people complain that this type of hair removal hurts.  it&#x27;s much less painful than plucking eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Yeah. It hurts. Like, insane amounts of hurts (especially in the underarms) but wow is it effective. I will never go back to waxing- this is so much easier and less messy; not to mention faster! The pain is real though. My boyfriend tried to use it on his chest and he couldn&#x27;t finish because it hurt so bad, but I did my legs, arms, and underarms and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> This definitely has a lot of power. It works great for my arms but is a little much for my face. I will add that I&#x27;m new to emulating so it could be user error.</li>
            <li> It worked basically like I imagined. I can go almost a week before having to do it again. It can hurt, but I was expecting that of course. I had to drop a star off of the review because it does not get the hair on my knees good and I have to shave there and my upper thighs. Other than that, I do like it.</li>
            <li> this product did not meet my expectations</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this would hurt so very much. Wonderful product though. Works well</li>
            <li> Really like it. But the wire thag attaches is tempermenal so I&#x27;ll have to buy another kind again soon</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m grateful for Amazon and customer reviews for leading me to a great epilator. Even though I was terrified, it hurt less than I was expecting, and felt similar to a constant static or electric shock on my legs. It was very manageable as I started in a small area, went slow, and expanded outward. I like that I was in total control of the pace. I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy razor blades or worry about stubble inevitably popping up in less than a day. It was actually a relaxing experience once I got used to the sensation, and since it&#x27;s supposed to hurt less and less every time, I expect I&#x27;ll get faster. I did get little red bumps on my legs about ten minutes after epilating, but they went away within an hour, and I think putting on lotion helped.</li>
            <li> Get through the first painful uses and I love it. Yes at first it is a bit painful on legs but it last so long its ok. Great for peach fuzz on face, not as painful as legs and it gets easier, and I Love the results.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product because it&#x27;s a fast way to get a shaved look on my legs but there is a bit of pain. It isn&#x27;t as painful as I thought. I will be using this product often!</li>
            <li> First of all I read mostly all the reviews i could possibly read. I knew this device came with some pain, But I didnt know how much pain!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG this is the worst pain in my life. Especially if I have to continue to go over the same spot over and over again to get a clean hairless spot. I can not see myself doing this on a weekley bases. I will stick with Nair</li>
            <li> I love this thing! Works great, I just have to hold is at the right angle or it just pulls and breaks hair without pulling it out from the follicle. It does hurt, but it&#x27;s not unbearable. However, I can not use it on my pits or bikini line without crying. Those things are better waxed by a professional. Takes a bit longer than shaving, but requires less frequent matience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for several months and it&#x27;s still working great!</li>
            <li> These things hurt like hell, but they do keep the hair off for about 3 weeks longer than just shaving.  And you get used to the pulling after the first 10 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> i was looking to replace my old epilator (over 5 years old) and this one had some pretty good reviews, and was not expensive.  i don&#x27;t need anything fancy!  however, when attempting to use it i found it just did not remove hair effectively.  (note that i have been using epilators almost exclusively for about 10 years now and have had several, all of which worked great. so i know how they work and what sort of results they provide)  With my previous epilators it took between 2 or 3 passes to remove hair from an area.  with this epilator, it took more like 5 or 6 passes.  i did a whole leg (took me more than twice as long) before i gave up and went back to my old one.  that was my only complaint.  it looks fine, wasn&#x27;t unusually loud, had a nice long cord...but i bought it to remove hair.  it takes a long time to do that.  so i sent it back.</li>
            <li> will what can I say this 1 was order at same time as cream but never came in at least they gave me my money back</li>
            <li> Amazing! Ingrown hairs are beastly though! Just be ready, they are super unsightly and painful. And so amount of scrubbing with release them and they can kind of look like a cyst, but you&#x27;re smooth as a baby.</li>
            <li> My daughter said it hurts for a bit but works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really fast, but very loud. I&#x27;ve used it underarm, and arms. It does a pretty good job in removing the hair.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted it to be. Watch videos on youtube about how to do it and read the instructions that come with it, remember the longer the hair is the more it hurts, but too short and it won&#x27;t grasp the hairs. Make sure you have good lighting and you can see what you&#x27;re doing. Basically use it right and it is a great tool for hair removal. Love that it plugs in, so you don&#x27;t need batteries or anything.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Cheaper than a No No  by far.</li>
            <li> Hurts quite a bit but works ok though. I wouldnt say the pain is dreadful though</li>
            <li> easy to use and not very hurt</li>
            <li> It does its job fine,no complaints,didn&#x27;t know its not battery operated.. Would have preferred that...the wire kind of restricts movement.. And its a bit noisy...but still am happy with the purchase ..value for Money</li>
            <li> The Amazon description said nothing about it being for legs only.  I wanted it for facial hair.  When I returned it with this complaint I was just sent the very same product.  After reading reviews after I received the second one,  one reviewer said it could be used for facial hair but after trying it I disagree .  The product instructions say it is for &amp;#34;legs only&amp;#34;.  It was too rough for facial hair and it did not do a good job.</li>
            <li> incredible product. So easy to use, and great outcomes. Not very pain, and keep my skin so smoothy and soft.</li>
            <li> She looked at it Christmas morning and fell for it right off, we read the instruction sheet on the 26th and she used it for the first time, told me hands off this is mine, she loves it so far.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for,  would have given 5 stars if if had worked better on my face.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, love it. It is not painful at all, and it gets the job done pretty well. All in all, my warm recommendation!</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs and it works....feels like little bees stinging...but that is short lived.  Decided to use it on my little hairs on my face...not bad...less painful than waxing.  Glad I bought it and will use it.  It will save money in the long run from my hair stylist doing the waxing that feels like she is pulling a layer of skin off.  I am a woman...55 and I am not real hairy..so it may be worse if you have lots of hair.</li>
            <li> I am really pale with black leg hair and I was hoping that this would give me smooth legs without any noticeable hair.  It did not.  I wanted to try out an epilator without spending a lot of money so I purchased this one.  First problem was that it didn&#x27;t contain the head cleaning brush that it was supposed to .  Since that was such a small thing I didn&#x27;t really care.  Pain wise it hurt quite a bit at first but after a minute or two I didn&#x27;t feel it at all.  It removed some hair but not all and I had to go over areas multiple times.  My main issue was that it caused an enormous amount of ingrown hairs.  It seems like about a third to a half if the hairs on my calves have grown back ingrown and I am having to pluck them with tweezers to correct them.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is a bad thing , I am totally shocked you would sell such a awful thing , very sorry I bought such a thing , if your advertising of the product  was true  , no one on earth would by it, worst thing ,ever bought in my life.</li>
            <li> Product works fine. It is a bit painful at first and take a few times to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I used my sisters $100 epilator and and this one was just as good if not better!!!! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I should have used Philips epilators from the get go instead of using Braun, even though Braun don&#x27;t hurt as much so may be if you&#x27;re a beginner you better stick with a braun but philips does a better job faster and the result last longer.  GREAT price as well!!</li>
            <li> Works great so far. The process itself is extremely painful but that was expected. I used it once about a week and a half ago. Little hairs are just starting to grow back but I can tell its growing in lighter than before.</li>
            <li> This has a US power adapter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably my fault for not looking at the product description closely enough , but I had to return it as it is not compatible with Australian power sockets.</li>
            <li> Yes I am a guy and I have a hispanic background, so my pubic hair is pretty thick. I wanted to use this to shave some of the gross hairs on my stomach and chest, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. For me it seems to hurt pretty bad so I must be doing something wrong, because the rest of the reviews say the pain is endurable. When I first tried it, it was very loud and when I made a pass over my stomach that I had just shaven it hurt a lot. I thought it would be okay because I would only have to endure the pain a few times as the hairs would be pulled from the root. But it never seemed to actually remove the hair. I made 4 or 5 passes over the same area and the hairs were still there. Last thing to mention is that my skin looked like a tomato, it was so red. I&#x27;m definitely not recommending it and I&#x27;ll probably just give it away.</li>
            <li> I just received my epilator 2 days ago, so far I&#x27;m very satisfied. For the last few years I have been nagged with hair growth on my chin and upper lip. ( so embarrassing). I didn&#x27;t want to shave, out of fear that one day I&#x27;d look like Nene Leakes ( a man). So I used waxes and shaving powder for hair removal both of which were fairly ineffective. This epilator is a god send. It&#x27;s not nearly as painful as I thought it would be, very effective and arrived extremely quickly. I would definitely recommend this hair removal contraption.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the epilator a few times now.  The first, I admit, was pretty painful.  But who said it wouldn&#x27;t be?  It&#x27;s gotten better since.  I do really like my legs after the process.  And, I do get ingrown hairs.  Exfoliating with an exfoliating glove helps a lot.  And, when I&#x27;m epilating, I keep a tweezer next to me so I can &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; if need be.  I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  And for the price, I think it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re trying it out like I was.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator. I bought it specifically to target unwanted hair on my neck and chin. Yes it hurts but less than laser hair removal. It lasts longer than shaving and the hair is growing in thinner. It did take me a while to get the hang of it. Key is to remember not to press hard but barely let it touch the skin. Once I figured this out it gets the job done in no time.</li>
            <li> It works, but the problem is that I have to wait until the hair grows to a certain size, so I can remove them.</li>
            <li> works just like a charm and for such a good price. i cant complain really. although this device is a bit painful and might not be everyones favorite thing to use but its efficient and quick. and the more you use it the more you will get use to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first epilator, so I may be expecting too much, but i feel like it often doesn&#x27;t pull out from the root, rather snaps the hair.</li>
            <li> light, easy to use.  it really is ideal for legs.  doesn&#x27;t work so well for the upper lip, but seems fine for underarms too.</li>
            <li> This epilator was okay. It didn&#x27;t pick out the really small hairs so I returned it and invested in a better one.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have no idea how well this works. I&#x27;m giving it one star because the description is misleading, it states that this is a total body hair removal system, but the directions in the package clearly state that it should only be used on the legs. I called the Philips help line and they looked up information on this product and agreed, on legs only.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the box was ripped and the epilator had hair in it. Maybe they tried it before they shipped it out?! I am just hoping that it will last as long  as my Braun epilator that served me for 18 years.</li>
            <li> Loved it at first, but over time (3 months) at 3x/monthly usage, it&#x27;s slacking in efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;It went from 10 minutes (on legs) to 30 minutes...even with the less hair growth.</li>
            <li> I love the product but I feel like its fragile . I keep feeling like I&#x27;m going to break it. I don&#x27;t like how it&#x27;s only for the legs but it is affordable.</li>
            <li> good machine but something missing.&lt;br /&gt;the machine is brand new, but for some reason the cleaning brush was missing.&lt;br /&gt;it could be customer return.</li>
            <li> I was a little weary at first to buy this based on reviews. I have an incredible tolerance for pain, and this hurt. After awhile the area I was working on would became numb but as soon as I moved to a new area the pain process started all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating in general is painful but this epilator seemed to hurt more than ones I&#x27;ve had in the past. I had to go over areas 5,6,7 times before most of it was gone. Even then not everything was gone. Not something I&#x27;d buy again given the chance. If you have patience and a very high tolerance for pain, get it. If not, yeeea don&#x27;t do it. lol</li>
            <li> It is very painful.  And the hair grows back in just a few days.  I thought it was more of a permanent hair removal.  It is NOT permanent</li>
            <li> Shaving left bumps, waxing left scars, but this was awesome!!! The hair usually grows back the next day but this took more than a week.</li>
            <li> After my old epilator died after 8 years of faithful service, I urgently started to search for a replace. Based on a percent of positive feedbacks and price I choose this one and so far I am very happy about it. I don&#x27;t even need to use the second speed; it is working great with first. The process is even less painful than with my previous epilator and it is removing hair very efficiently, no need to go many times on the same area. I personally use it for my legs, armpits and it is also good for the bikini area. The efficiency cap which coming in set is absolutely useless for me.&lt;br /&gt;Besides the epilator itself is much lighter than my old one which was rechargeable. This is also a plus for someone who travels a lot like me.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely recommend this for anyone who wants to have a good epilator who does its job properly. Also if you purchase this one you don&#x27;t need to pay extra for fancy (and most of the time quite useless) addition like cooling heads etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wax my stash anymore! It&#x27;s so awesome. I hurts like a mofo though. If you&#x27;ve ever tried to pluck your stash, just imagine that feeling one very little hair...It hurts buy it WORKS!! Beauty is pain my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator!  I use it every week.  I bought one for my mom and my daughter and they love it.  This gets the hair out by the root and it really is not too painful.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to give two separate reviews for this product.&lt;br /&gt;To those new to using an epilator: it hurts. Sorry,  I&#x27;m not going to sugar coat it. The hair is pulled from the root so there is pain involved. BUT, I can attest (and believe me, I was a non believer in this one )it gets easier. The first time you use it you are pulling ALL the hair at once. But less and less will grow back each time and what does is thinner. And you won&#x27;t have to shave for at least a week at a time.&lt;br /&gt;To those who&#x27;ve used an epilator before: if you are willing to be patient, the price is fair. It seems to break hair even when I go slow and I have to go over the area several times but it does the job. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because if you are willing to spend more time during and between using the epilator to save money on buying a more expensive alternative than I would suggest this product, but I think I will be purchasing a quality one later down the road.</li>
            <li> I have been using the epilator for 4 months on my legs and bikini area. The pain is pretty bad the first few times, but eventually it gets less for some reason. I did have a few ingrown hairs the first time but haven&#x27;t had any since then. The results last almost 3 weeks... then I let the hair grow about 10 days before I use it again. I don&#x27;t believe every product works for every person, we all have different hair and skin types. But I highly recommend this product. It is much cheaper than getting waxed once a month, and most of all, you can do it when you want and in private.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to pay more than $30 for a good epilator. This one works magnificently especially for its size. The only downside is having to keep it plugged for it to work, but otherwise that&#x27;s a minor inconvenience compared to the work it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed, shaved and tweezed and this is such a great solution to hair removal. It&#x27;s a little painful the first few times, and you&#x27;ll have to go over areas a bit at first, but once you&#x27;ve used the product for two weeks or so, it works so well with maintenance and keeping unwanted hair away. Definitely happy I purchased this!</li>
            <li> I like this better than shaving because i dont have to use cream or end up cutting myself but the downside is this thing hurts a lot. its literally ripping the hairs out of youre skin but if you follow the directions its not to bad. some areas it hurts more than others like around the bottom of my legs near my ankle really hurt when using this but in the long run this is cheaper than buying razors every couple of weeks and getting shaving cream and its also a cheaper alternitive to wax so im going tostick with it</li>
            <li> The main reason why I bought this is its capability to be used across the world. 100-220V&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a minimal epliator, but this is the attachment you probably would use most of the time even with your most expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Functionally, it works like any other epilator (I have a remington one) and also works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic thing that covers the roller blades is actually not covering it, if you want to call this a downside...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the other thing... this has to be plugged in the socket if you need to use it... NO BATTERY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, in my opinion even the rechargeable ones lose their charging capacity after many uses and require them to be plugged in if you want to use them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> The product description states this is a &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; item.. and while it is true that you can unplug the device from its cord, it stops immediately.  There is NO internal batteries.  So it must be pluged in at all times.&lt;br /&gt;Other then that, it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I rate it at 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Good delivery time&lt;br /&gt;Works as advertised&lt;br /&gt;Not really cordless&lt;br /&gt;Not a wet/dry model</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my under arm hair and despite the little bit of pain, the results were so worth it. Smooth, silky under arms. I have yet to try it on my legs....</li>
            <li> Okay this is my third update so I&#x27;m just going to start from scratch. It hurt, but had it been effective the pain would have been worth it. Every time I thought it worked, I found a new patch of hair on my legs that it wouldn&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter how many times, what pattern and direction I went it, it never got it all. I did it three nights in a row because of this and still had hairy legs. I don&#x27;t have hours and hours to commit to dehairing myself and have it not work. I&#x27;m not exactly a gorilla - I have relatively fine leg hair and maybe that&#x27;s my problem. But I will most definitely be returning this.</li>
            <li> While I am new to using an epilator, I am SUPER impressed by this product. I absolutely HATE shaving, and this lasts longer anyway! I have always considered myself to be someone with low pain tolerance, and I don&#x27;t know need to take asprin or anything to use this! Not to say it doesn&#x27;t hurt, I mean you ARE ripping hair out from the root, but the pain doesn&#x27;t last long, it&#x27;s very quick. You will probably want to do this on a day you aren&#x27;t showing off the area you are epilating because it WILL have little red polka dots from the irritation of hair being taken out.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely WONDERFUL product.</li>
            <li> Works but too painful.</li>
            <li> Hurts Doesn&#x27;t work well. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Tried to use this to remove body hair. It would break about 50 percent of the hairs. When it didn&#x27;t break the hair, it would suck it up and pinch the skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;I watched a handful of tutorials on epilating before and during use to make sure I was doing it properly. I have a pretty painful rash area that&#x27;s been red for about five hours now.&lt;br /&gt;Count this review toward epilating in general. Not to sound spoiled, but you&#x27;d think there would be better options for hair removal by now... :P</li>
            <li> I love it, thank you!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is something you should not use if you have tender skin. I have a higher pain tolerance than some so I think it&#x27;s awesome. I use it anywhere I want hair gone and my skin is super smooth with no razor burn. Whoop whoop!!</li>
            <li> Loved it. It easily removed hairs under the arms. But they also left some tiny hairs but its ok.  This is a gud product</li>
            <li> Not great. Save up for a better quality one.</li>
            <li> Horrible waste of money</li>
            <li> good product, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and does not hurt at all..just a pinch which is normal!!</li>
            <li> this little bastard has changed my life</li>
            <li> The device works well. It&#x27;s light and comfortable to hold. The cap is easy to remove and clean. The only problem I had with it was it did not come with a brush as advertised.</li>
            <li> not good. Does not epillate from roots.</li>
            <li> i give it a 5 because you cant complain when you buy the standard cheapie and it does the job---the more you invest in an epilator, the more pluckers it has so yes it tends to work faster, and hurt less, cordless, etc etc.. but does great and beats buying disposable razors all the time!</li>
            <li> Many yrs. ago I had an Epilady at more than 3 times the price as the Satinelle. I always wanted to get a replacement and I finally bought the Satinelle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with it. If you follow the instructions you will have very little discomfort. The only area that &amp;#34;smarted&amp;#34; was the upper lip and I found if I stretched out the skin as recommended in the instructions it made a difference. I also used it under my arms and it worked great and putting on deodorant right after didn&#x27;t sting like it does when shaving. It does a great job on peach fuzz on the face and back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;Use the Satinelle right after washing your face and showering and remember to stretch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, it does what it says it will do and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product for the price offered. It works as expected and I would definitely recommend others to buy this one</li>
            <li> Wow!  This one is not bad at all and it does exactly what I need it to do ... remove the hair under my arms and legs.  I purchased another one (Emoji) prior to this and it was just too painful to use.  I enjoyed this one so much I was looking for hair on my body to remove. LOL!  Great buy for the first timer!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator. I wanted to get a cheap one just to see how I liked it. Unfortunately I wanted a full body one and didn&#x27;t understand that this was only for legs, or at least that is what it says in the manual. Before using it I had uh.. a lot of growing out, then I shaved, then used this a few days later. It worked well, and didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much as I was fearing. I shortly took off the newb cover and turned it from speed 1 to speed 2. It did a good job of grabbing the hairs, and I didn&#x27;t notice any breaking off. My second use wasn&#x27;t as successful. With the hair grown back more sparsely and soft, it didn&#x27;t really grab a lot of them as well and I did notice at least a few breaking off. I do agree with a comment that I remember reading when I was choosing to buy one(which was not necessarily about this model), which is that it never felt smooth like after shaving. Even though it looked smooth it felt bumpy, so I am not sure if it is actually pulling the hair out from as deep as it should. I still think it&#x27;s worth using, especially at this price point, shaving to me always feels like a hassle and a waste of water. Eventually I&#x27;d like to try one with more power to it.</li>
            <li> Nice long cord, works great. I will never go back to a regular shaver. Once a week is all it takes.</li>
            <li> I use this for my underarms.  An ex previously remarked that &amp;#34;it looks like there&#x27;s a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; on the same day I shaved, and shaving irritated my underarms, so I made the switch.  The 5 o&#x27;clock shadow is much better, as what he was seeing was hair under the skin.  This thing frightens my cat a bit because it&#x27;s noisy, but it grips hair well and isn&#x27;t all that painful.  I have to go over each area a few times for maximum effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess from seeing the picture, I thought that it would be charged and then used, but it has to remain plugged in while in use. Still, not a major complaint.</li>
            <li> i like everything in this product and I would recommend it to everyone. it is a really good purchase for sure.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and it does a good job for the price! I can use it once a month and it works well</li>
            <li> At first I loved this thing, but then I realized it was breaking the hairs and 3 says later I&#x27;d have to use it again or shave. It&#x27;s to painful to be using every other day. I could do it if it actually lasted 6 weeks. Not it just sits at the bottom of my drawer. It&#x27;s better to just get waxed or pay for Lazer treatment.</li>
            <li> I use for bikini line/armpits. I&#x27;ve never epilated before and what everyone says about it hurting at first and then you going numb is absolutely true. Every time you do it, you kind of expect what it feels like at that point so it&#x27;s not really so bad. I used it without the guard like the 3rd time I picked it up and got way better results. Gets rid of the hair well, but it definitely has to be a certain length (5/8 inch or something) and it&#x27;s better when it&#x27;s sticking straight up (I epilate when I&#x27;m cold lol). I gave 4/5 stars because my hair starts growing back sooner than I wanted to (2-3 weeks instead of a full 3 or 4), but that might just be my body. The device also misses a couple of hairs sometimes, but I&#x27;m a newbie and it just may not be the right length at a certain spot. I&#x27;d recommend - great price!</li>
            <li> It will take several passes and is very painful, but that is what I expected from an Epilator (They aren&#x27;t magic after all). It does seem to get easier after the first time, but I could only handle small areas at a time...after several sessions, my calves stayed smooth for quite a while! Make sure you exfoliate a lot!</li>
            <li> The epilator is horrible and is extremely annoying and painful. It does not even get all of the hairs. I am still left with long hairs and took me forever just to do one section. I would not recommend this to anyone! Go buy wax instead or go pay someone $30 to get you legs waxed every month.</li>
            <li> Hurts like a tattoo first few uses (i would know, im covered in art). Now its the quickest and easiest way to stay smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! it is so powerful and pull your hair completely. I have tried other expensive brands but so far this is better. I think is worth the money. The product is great and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was blessed with fine blonde body hair, but it is thick and grows quickly. I also have extremely sensitive skin, so any form of hair removal comes with ingrown hairs, bumps, burns, or worse. I wanted an easier, longer-term option than shaving without trying to wax myself at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this today, and I love it already. I did my &amp;#34;test areas,&amp;#34; but I couldn&#x27;t resist the temptation to do more on my leg. The test area on my arm is red and bumpy (very typical for my skin; I expect it to fade), but my legs aren&#x27;t at all. Both feel crazy smooth! It feels as good as waxing, but without the mess or going to a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a high pain tolerance, but it was much less painful than I expected. It hurts much less than waxing; it&#x27;s a kind of prickly pain, and the vibration of the machine helps numb my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a first time epilator user, but I&#x27;m already loving this little guy. I&#x27;m actually looking forward to finishing my legs.</li>
            <li> piece of crap pulls hair cut very painful</li>
            <li> I originally got this epilator just for my bikini line because I get bad razor burn. However, it does such a great job i use it everywhere (legs, armpits, bikini line). It is not that painful to me... for example, on my legs it feels like somebody is scratching me. Be aware that you must be plugged in to an outlet for this to work. The cord is super long so I don&#x27;t have a problem reaching anywhere. After using this product I can normally go about 2 weeks without epilating again. Also, it takes a pretty long time to epilate my legs (probably about 20 mins) because this is not the most expensive product out there. But for $30-50 it is totally worth it to me! I have even brought most of my family to the hairless side mua hahah!  ;)</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator purchases, and I spent a LOT of time reading reviews. While an epilator is not for everyone, this particular one is exceptionally good. It does the job with much less pinching than some other models, and is quieter than some other models. People with ingrown hair problems need only follow the recommendations about skin prep. I will buy one of these again when the need arises.</li>
            <li> Oh, I debated getting an epilator for a very long time. I loved the idea of it, but was also scared about the process of it! The first one I got had a faulty part and stopped working after 20 minutes. A quick call to amazon and I had a brand new one the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-epilator:I tried to do it without waxing first, as I have been a shaver for years- bad idea. It hurt for me ALOT and decided to do waxing first, as others had recommended. Good idea- the waxing also hurt (the woman told me that redheads tend to have longer hair roots, and could hurt more than normal), and when I told her I was planning on using an epilator, she gave me a &amp;#34;good luck&amp;#34; look. She said hair grows in 3 different waves, and she encouraged me to come back two other times. I came back another time, after 4 weeks, and then used the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the epilator: This thing is great! Using it is very easy, and after having my hair used to being ripped out rather than cut off, it honestly wasn&#x27;t painful like it was the first time I tried it or the first time I got waxed. It&#x27;s loud, and my husband asked what was happening, but it was quick and easy to do my feet and lower leg (right to my knees). I would epilate every other or every third day to make sure the regrowth was stopped. My legs feel absolutely amazing, and I&#x27;m not going back to shaving!!</li>
            <li> I love Philips! Wonderful!</li>
            <li> For those who are not used to it ,well it&#x27;s a little bit painful, but the result is awesome in some months you can see that less hair is growing.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for the price. I love it. I have been using it for couple of months and it works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good price for a great value!&lt;br /&gt;Phillips is the best! Amazing results! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, it&#x27;s not the best at removing hair like the Braun SE 5180 Silk Epil I had before, I am using the tweezers a lot.</li>
            <li> i like it because its easy to use and it really works and do all the thing that tell you and its a good a very good price for this product.</li>
            <li> It works, but I have to say, if you&#x27;ve got thick hairs with deep roots like me, it is quite painful the first time. Other than that it&#x27;s effective, although I have to go over the same area several times to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> still looking for the best epilator. THIS one gets more than most but not the truly short and thick hairs. It does work less painfully than the others and seems to be somewhat &amp;#34;closer&amp;#34; and much faster . Am wondering about combining more than one epilator. Hmm. WIll get back to you on that one. It;s becoming more important to have a good epilator as my eyes become less sharp as I age and I certainly don&#x27;t want any strays.</li>
            <li> Very painful it doesn&#x27;t take the hair  with the first pass you have to go over a few times  did not remove hair effectively&lt;br /&gt;not recommended</li>
            <li> Ok it hurts alot, but it is my first time ever doing this and i hear it gets less painful. First i wanna say this epilator does what its supposed to i recommend it, although i did my leg very thoroughly and it still feels prickly in some places.. i think its cuz i need to wait another day for those hairs to be long enough? I just got one leg done and im honestly kinda nervous to do the other... it took me forever to do the first because of the pain. also i recommend getting a pose epilation lotion i put it on and the pain is gone and almost all the redness is gone and its only been about a minute.( GiGi post epilation lotion) i hope this helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update* i have used this a few times now and i barely feel anything at all, love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this twice so far. and it works perfectly.. I thought I might need a more expensive epilator but this works just fine. it&#x27;s quick and doesn&#x27;t hurt. ....but keep in mind you can&#x27;t wait until you have a forest growing in your armpits because then it&#x27;ll hurt no matter what kind of epilator you have.</li>
            <li> I got my first epilator and it&#x27;s painful around the underarms. The device is perfect for travel. It is noisy no matter what speed it&#x27;s on, very intimidating. Doesn&#x27;t really bother me. You may need to epilate like 3 times when using this product the first time as it seems to not get the small hairs at the 1st level. The 2nd level works best.I went with 5 stars because it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me. I am liking what this product is doing.</li>
            <li> its really hurt..!!!!</li>
            <li> This Epilator is great, I love it. No pain at all, it is really easy to use. The price was great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Emjoy epilator for a few years now, and it was really good. The problem though was that it didn&#x27;t seem to very easily go in and around the curves above my lip etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one by Phillips seems to be shaped and sized in a way that fits MUCH better....and there is this cool little attatchment which prevents ripping at your skin etc......I think it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus is that the head is removable for cleaning....</li>
            <li> I bought this because I got tired of spending so much money on waxing, and I&#x27;m glad I did. It hurts, I&#x27;m not going to lie, but it works well and leaves skin so smooth. Have you ever had little drops of hot oil splatter on you while you&#x27;re cooking? To me that&#x27;s what this feels like. I think it&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li> Works just like they say it does. Stings a little bit, but not a real problem. Worth the &amp;#34;pain.&amp;#34; Just wished I&#x27;d bought a cordless one--cord gets in the way.</li>
            <li> Painful and the hair grows back quickly still. I&#x27;ll stick to waxing.</li>
            <li> a little pulling, just dont go fast on legs it did get alot of hair removal.</li>
            <li> Definitely does the job, and is worth the price.  I should have read more carefully though.  I thought it was rechargeable, but it must be plugged in the whole time.  On the up-side, the cord is long enough that I can use it a few feet away from any outlet.</li>
            <li> Just got it today... People talked about it hurting less than other devices, but HOLY HANNAH, from a first-time user standpoint, IT HURTS! It&#x27;s like waxing, only slower. And probably more effective. I wrote waxing since it didn&#x27;t work, but hurry like crazy. Trying to get the guts to try again right now, as I only got through about a 1x2 inch area when it came.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself using my husband&#x27;s account.  For my first epilator, I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.  It does leave behind some baby hairs but as I&#x27;ve never been one to flip my lid over legs that aren&#x27;t completely smooth this is not an issue for me.  There is some pain, but after a couple of runs up my leg I got used to it and actually honed in on it as that meant I was in a new place and the hairs weren&#x27;t gone yet.  Over all I think it does just fine.  I wouldn&#x27;t try it on my underarms or any other sensitive areas as I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work on the courser hairs.  All in all I&#x27;m quite happy.</li>
            <li> Worked great until it broke...within a month of rather sparing use. One day it just would no longer switch on anymore.</li>
            <li> Great epilator for a great price. I am a man and love this thing and so does my girl. A little uncomfortable for the first couple of times but with some alcohol OR pain reliever in the system this thing is amazing. The beauty of it is that you can go at your own pace to gauge how much pain you can tolerate instead of waxing chunks out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No pinching. There is a few hair breaks during but nothing another servicing couldn&#x27;t handle. I use this on medium-thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the price this is a great deal. Will buy another as a backup.</li>
            <li> Exc! Highly recommended! I have been using it since 1 or more years ago and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing quite the job, though if you want to have perfect legs you have to do it every week but I&#x27;ve never seen any machine with which you wouldn&#x27;t have to. It&#x27;s cheaper than others for a better job.</li>
            <li> Hurts a little when you first start but got used to it after a while, did the entire leg (just above the knee all the way down) and the results last for weeks!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning, though- bikini area works but extremely painful, same for underarms. I&#x27;d recommend sticking to waxing for those (quicker...).</li>
            <li> Does it hurt?  OH YEAH! But does it work? DEFINITELY!  I have been waxing and am so glad I finally tried this type of hair removal. No more mess at home with the wax and saving money from going to the salon.  As soon as you touch the machine to the skin it pinches and annoying, however as  you keep it on , it becomes more tolerable. If you are a shaver, it will hurt, but be patient, with time you will learn to tolerate it and it will hurt less because the hair will grow weaker and weaker. If you have a very low pain threshold then stick to shaving. Unfortunately 6 months its the cord seems to be damaged. In other words it stops working and then I have to jiggle the cord to get it to start again.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised. It&#x27;s not a magic solution to never shaving again but it&#x27;s good to have around.</li>
            <li> Tested it on an area on my arm. Wasn&#x27;t as painful as I expected. Almost feels like getting a tattoo. Gave my goosebumps (I also get goosebumps when I got a tattoo). I haven&#x27;t tried it on other areas of my body yet and I&#x27;m sure the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; might be different on more sensitive areas. But this works. The area I tested on my arm is hair free and lovely looking.</li>
            <li> Portable and great for travel. Gets the job done, which is better than manually plucking individual hairs &amp; shaving. It&#x27;s just really loud and the device smells kind of smells like overworked device from using electricity. Overall, recommended for first epilator!</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator because it&#x27;s cheap and I have no regrets. There&#x27;s no fancy features but it works fine for what I need.</li>
            <li> small and efficient love it</li>
            <li> I have had another Philips epilators and I loved them. This one is good too. It is pretty basic though, just the epilator and the cable, nothing else. But it does the job.</li>
            <li> Sooo... the last time I had my legs professionally waxed, it felt like my skin was being ripped off like some medieval torture technique.  Traumatized, I followed up a few weeks later by using a home-kit (from Walmart), which worked ok but it was a pain to keep re-heating the wax and it was horrifically messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, epilators and I have a history - I used one once about 5 yrs ago for roughly 10 seconds and never touched it again due to the sheer pain.  But now, when some leg hairs started growing back, I decided to give it a second chance, instead of wrestling with that pot of gooey wax.  Laser removal is too expensive (and not an option since most of my leg hairs are too light) and shaving is useless, as I have the distinct impression that those persistent little hairs immediately start growing back - envision Michael J. Fox in Teen Wolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this particular model of epilator based upon the positive reviews and am now happy to add my own to the list.  When I switched it on, the loud whirring noise made me cringe, since it sounded like a contraption that should be used to edge a lawn, but only the first few seconds hurt a little - once you know what to expect it is absolutely fine (and quick!)!  Keep in mind that my leg hairs were less dense than usual, due to the intermittent at-home waxing, so there was less to rip out. I would definitely recommend getting a wax first and then using this epilator once the hairs start growing back.  There are few errant hairs remaining but overall it did a great job!  My plan is to use it every 3 days or so to grab the few hairs that start to grow back.  Ahhhh, gone are the days of medieval torture, gooey wax and hopeless shaving.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased that I finally found an epilator that simply does what it&#x27;s been designed to do. It is very basic, simple in use and does the job, much better than many of the expensive epilators that are currently available in the market. For a very long time i was trying to find a simple epilator, that wouldn&#x27;t have all those ridiculously over-priced and absolutely unnecessary and useless in my opinion gadgets and features, such as wet epilating, ice attachments, lights, dual blades, and so on and so forth. This one is exactly what one needs for performing a simple task of removing unwanted hair from your body.  I am giving it only 4 stars, because it does not perform on 100% under your armpits.  It&#x27;s great to use on your legs though.</li>
            <li> I feel like this isn&#x27;t really the best quality wise (you get what you pay for?) I had a LOT of hair break off, not actually be ripped out, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;and yes, it hurts. But seriously? you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your body, it&#x27;ll be ok.</li>
            <li> It gave the burning smell after using for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I would have given a 5 star if it wasn&#x27;t by tye fact that this product it doesn&#x27;t Take &amp;#34;all&amp;#34; the hair. I keep going back and  forth but some hair stays.  But over all, I am happy I have almost no hair in my body!!!!</li>
            <li> Work nice, good price. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Supposed to remove ALL hair, correct? It doesn&#x27;t. $30 wasted on a gift to the wife that is now a brick discharging in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now, and I am still happy with it.  I use it on my legs and my face.</li>
            <li> So i have only barely used this, its pretty intimidating. It seems to work well when i do use it but it its rather noisy which made me hesitant to use it at first.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but it is a little loud. Once you get to the initial pain of ripping hairs it works better with thick slightly longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does get the thin hair if you angle it just right.</li>
            <li> It definitely hurts at first, but you get used to it the more you use it. It does the trick! I used it before going on vacation and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about shaving my legs. It is a much cheaper alternative to waxing.</li>
            <li> Water washable feature is the best..i have been using it for 2 months now! My hair growth got slower! Great thing :)  use it after taking a bath! Love this product!</li>
            <li> It works great, better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This model can&#x27;t be used unplug,it will make some difficult  with the electric wire.</li>
            <li> I have a high tolerance for pain, but no way could I handle this torturous device!  Returned the very next day.</li>
            <li> i kinda liked this. I felt like I had to go back in the same spot over and over which made the process take forever. It was also hard to use around the knee. It did the job and its fairly inexpensive, but I rather continue waxing my legs for a better finish in less amount of time.</li>
            <li> I only use this on my lower legs. Way better than waxing. I find it to be quite important that you use it at the right hair growth length. If the hair is too long it&#x27;ll break instead of being pulled out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful. I wish I saved that box so that I can return....</li>
            <li> Pretty good not great but good for the money</li>
            <li> No more expensive waxing for my wife.</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t handle waxing, this is NOT for you! However,  I can and I love this little device. I use it on my legs and under arms and anywhere I don&#x27;t want hair and it works wonderfully! I couldn&#x27;t wax my legs before because the hair just wouldn&#x27;t pick up. But using this epilator WORKS. Especially after the third week of using it. If you do try it, you just have to stick with it for a while and built the tolerance up! When the hairs grow back thinner, it&#x27;s even easier to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be using this method of hair removal for the rest of my life &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars I would. I have an extraordinarily high pain tolerance, but this topped it. I use it exactly how the instructions directed me to, but I saw a little to no results. It&#x27;s absolutely not worth it and I received a refund.</li>
            <li> it works well but I do miss my light that I had on the other one</li>
            <li> Works great, worth the price</li>
            <li> Horrible. Just horrible. I had a bad reaction to the metal and broke out. I look like I have acne all over my body. It didn&#x27;t pull any hair out either! It&#x27;s like I got a bad one. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone. This is a lot slower and more painful than waxing. Any hair that isn&#x27;t extremely fine and thin is going to hurt terribly. Barely gets half the hair, the only thing worse than using this thing once is using it again.</li>
            <li> i love this epilator. it takes very little time to take away all of the hair and doesnt hurt terribly. bikini line is a bit sore and so are arm pits but deffinitely worth the results :)</li>
            <li> This thing works. Its loud. A bit obnoxious but hair does not seem to come back. I use this after I get laser removal. If you know anything about laser treatment the hair follicles begin to fall out after treatment. Those hairs cannot be shaved. At least not more me. This gently removes the hair and pulls out the light colored hairs the laser did not get.</li>
            <li> Exelente producto, cumple con la especificaciones requeridas, me llego dentro del tiempo ofrecido, el vendedor cumplio con todo lo requerido</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an epilator before and had been told to take it in small sections.  I have now completed both legs and love that I haven&#x27;t had to shave in over 5 days!  Still smooth!!</li>
            <li> I have tried shaving, hair remover creams, no!no!ing and waxing. Shaving takes care of hair for maybe a day and a half. Hair remover creams didn&#x27;t ever seem to work at all. I used the no!no! for about 6 months and gave up seeing no difference in hair growth,  I like immediate results. :P Waxing... that was just painful and I felt like I had no control which was the biggest problem. I searched online for several days trying to find something new to try when I heard about epilators. There were a lot of mixed reviews about hair growing in thicker after use and hair not coming back at all. Almost every review made the comment about how painful it is. I&#x27;d say I have probably an average tolerance for pain... what I&#x27;m trying to say is I&#x27;m a b***h about it. I found this epilator on amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a bunch of money on something I wasn&#x27;t even sure would work. I got it, I used it, and I&#x27;ll have you know I only cried for like 10 minutes. Ha, but seriously it did hurt. I epilated my arm pits first. The whole time I was saying &amp;#34;Ow... ow.. OWEE&amp;#34;. After I was finished they looked horrible. They were red and they had bumps all over them, but the internet told me that would happen and there are no lies on the internet. I waited. That day at work I was very uncomfortable because my armpits were on fire all night. The next day I took a look at the magnificence which was my pities. They looked AMAZING. I tried my legs next and I only finished the front side of one leg before I b***hed out. Eventually though I did get it done and I&#x27;m happy with those results as well. The hair was gone for a good month before I had to epilate again. And when I did there was only a few hairs. They aren&#x27;t coming all back like when shaving so every few days or so I check and I may have to epilate a few hairs, but for the most part my armpits and legs have no hair on them. I use a rough lufa in the shower to exfoliate now because I read that if you don&#x27;t you may end up with ingrown hairs. I haven&#x27;t had that problem thankfully. So, if you are looking for a new method of hair removal, I would definitely recommend this product.wn hairs. I haven&#x27;t had that problem thankfully. So, if you are looking for a new method of hair removal, I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this on my arm hair and it takes 3-4 weeks to start growing back. Works really well! For the price, it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> Its ok but can t be used on all the body like it says in internet.Inside the box instructions say to use on the legs only.I wanted to use it in intimate area as well..</li>
            <li> The product it self was nice, but damn did that hurt. I decided it was not for me and returned it.</li>
            <li> This shipped in earlier than expected. It&#x27;s painful at first, but you eventually you get used to the pain. It&#x27;s meant for legs, but I used it on my underarms and they feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> Very good!!! 2 time I bought!!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have returned this after I used it the first time. I feel like it does NOTHING. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great performance, very ergonomic design. Works great , highly recommend .</li>
            <li> After several long years of seeking an effective hair removal option, I was really happy to come across this epilator. From shaving to hair removal lotions to waxing, I&#x27;ve tried a fair amount of alternatives. The epilator is easy to use and clean. I had never used an epilation device before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure how painful the hair removal process would be. WARNING: It is painful because the epilator removes the hair from the root. However, the hair takes a while to grow back. Great for the price!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this...much safer than shaving.</li>
            <li> The clip that holds the head on was broken when I opened it. I use tape now to be able to use it unfortunately</li>
            <li> Not the best at pulling out the hair but I&#x27;ve used worse.  Decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Works Ok, do not take off all the hair, use it under arms,</li>
            <li> Better than the older Braun epilator it replaced.  Lighter, more efficient, nice that head can be washed with water</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter as a birthday present. She LOVES it! Painful as all get out but effective and VERY economical. Thank you for this product that has improved her outlook on being seen at the beach on our trip to Florida next week!</li>
            <li> Does its job really well!</li>
            <li> I have never used an epilator before and I figured I could by this and save some money. It is terrible... even with MULTIPUL passes my legs were still hairy. It went from a bear skin rug to a slightly balding bear skin rug...&lt;br /&gt;Also if you have sensitive skin this is a no no. After just one go round, I had these awful discolored bumps for weeks, and I did more than my fair share of exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;Pain wise... I have lots of tattoos and a high tolerance, but it still hurts. I don&#x27;t know who these ladies are that say it&#x27;s painless... they obviously took a handfull of percocets and 3 glasses of wine before doing this...</li>
            <li> I got it for a friend as a gift, she says she likes it . Hopefully it will last a few years, as my Brown one</li>
            <li> Works great on face.  Have to run over same section 2-3 times on legs for desired result.  It&#x27;s a bit painful, but lasts a good week.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife. I thought she was crazy for buying it. FYI not for use on a beard. I tried it thinking it would be easy to use. I screamed like a mouse had jumped at my face. I have had that happen and I screamed then too. Back to the review, she loves it and says it just feels like tiny pinches. Here&#x27;s a tip: Shave your hair then when you feel stubble, epilate. Oh yeah, she said don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate before you use it everytime. Her legs feel soft.</li>
            <li> Works ok but it&#x27;s very loud. Painful but managable. Wish it was chargeable though.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. save your money.</li>
            <li> All I can say is ouch! And even after all of the pain, it still did not get all the hairs! It actually just seemed to break some of them off, rather than eliminate them.</li>
            <li> Love the price and love how it works! but after lots of try it kind of died a little, not as good like in the beginning. like in the beginning when i was using it pulled out almost everything, fast and you didnt need to go over the same place so much. but now its just kind of slow but i still like it. since it still works. got this for only 3 months... so hopefully it don&#x27;t died out on me. i also like this because its not the one that needs batteries so u can just plug it in/ do ur thing. i just dislike it how its just kind of loud.</li>
            <li> This epilator I purchased to use on my face, it is effective and does what it claims. Epilators do sting but this was the gentlest one I have ever used on my face.</li>
            <li> Try it...it works amazing. .</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this. It is easy to use, does a great job of removing hair on legs. I will never shave again!! I recommended this to a co worker. She loves it as well!</li>
            <li> I take anticoagulant medication and cannot shave anymore. Can&#x27;t always get my act together to schedule and go for waxing. This is better! So happy to have smooth legs all the time!</li>
            <li> Its been a week since I got this and precisely the same time I last used it and I am loving it. Its wayy wayyy better than wax. Bye bye to the sticky waxyy days. I have been waxing since as long as I can remember and lately have been sick of it, someone recomended me to try epilator and ordered this one ( since its the cheapest ) as quickly as I could. It didnt hurt at all on my arms just a little tingling  and my arms are still perfectly clean and its been a week, it did hurt a little when i was doing my underarms, and especially since im right handed, i couldnt do my right underarm properly, and it did hurt but it was worth it cuz after sometime i figured out how to position the epilator and my arms for painless epilation. I would totally recommend this to anyone who is hesitant about epilation. Its awesome and I wish i wouldve bought it long ago. PS : I didnt use it after shower, I used it minutes after I received the package cuz I am very impatient.</li>
            <li> not great. I bought this hoping for a corded epilator that would last longer due to not losing charge over time. It left a lot of stubble because it broke a lot of hairs. My dying Veet epilator did a more thorough job. It is also much more painful to use than my previous Veet one ever was.I bought another Veet one and I am much happier.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers have already done a good job of outlining the general pros and cons of epilating versus other methods of hair removal, so I will keep my review brief. This is my first epilator after years of waxing, both at home and at salons. I don&#x27;t know why it never occurred to me that this was still an option, but I&#x27;m really glad I tried it. This little gadget plugs in with a cord, is about the size of my palm, and gets my legs virtually hair free in about 5-8 minutes. Of course all other methods are a little less comfortable than straight up shaving, but the rough stubble and constant upkeep of shaving was something I outgrew in college. After probably at least ten years of waxing, I started seriously considering forking over money for electrolysis because I no longer wanted to make the time to complete the waxing process (heat the wax for an hour or more, perform the awkward waxing, clean all the drips and strings, etc) and paying $30-50 a month for waxing just wasn&#x27;t financially reasonable anymore. This is a piece of cake. It is far less painful than waxing and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all except a tiny bit on the back of my calves where I am sensitive. If it does feel uncomfortable, a little trick is to run it over the skin faster than recommended because it creates a kind of sensation that you really get used to and then can slow down and pluck more hairs without initial sting. I am really happy with this as a solution to the constant bother of waxing. It doesn&#x27;t grab every single hair, but you could tweeze if necessary and I think the results are every bit as good as my usual waxing. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this epilator. For its price I get good coverage of hair removal, relatively quick results, few problems such as ingrown hairs, and (over weeks of use) less grow back. If considering, this is a good, inexpensive, handy epilator (for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more details, read below:&lt;br /&gt;I am very ( :-( ) hairy for a woman. When I shave, though my legs are 95% smooth directly after, I will have noticable stubble within 12 hours. During the summer I regularly shave daily or every other. I have not had much experience (or luck) with waxing. However, just before getting this, I had been experimenting with sugar waxing. I have never had or used an epilator before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the epilator for about 3 months now. I used it almost immediately and had legs about as smooth as if I had shaved. A few days later, though, my legs were ready for another go-round. For the first month, I probably used it 2-3 times a week. This I attribute to different growing cycles. While it catches the majority of the hair, any too short or too long will remain. I either shave, pluck, or wait a few more days for those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it less painful than waxing and more like a quick sting (as others noted) on sensitive areas like behind my knees. I have had almost no ingrown hairs from this device. (Note: I did have ingrown hairs from the waxing, which I have been slowly working on. As I work those out the device has not noticeably created any new patches; just maybe one or two.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the first month I don&#x27;t even use it once a week. My hair has grown back thinner and softer. Most areas grow back slowly and a few not at all. The plug in has not been an issue for me, as there is a long cord, and it&#x27;s small enough to fit in my medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this device and would definitely recommend it. I will probably some day move on to an epilator with more blades (?) and a wider path. This device can take time depending the area you&#x27;re working on. I&#x27;m impatient and often have to go back to areas I missed. The removable head has been handy in making sure it is cleaned after every use (and therefore I&#x27;ve had no issues with sanity).</li>
            <li> This epilator has been worth every penny. I had an Emjoi in the same price range before and this Satinelle epilator is a much better product. The key feature seems to be that the tweezing discs are flush against the skin which allows it to pull out hairs which are very short. This epilator does a very good job of pulling the entire hair out root and all. My last epilator would break many of the hairs and leave the root. I am a guy who works out a lot and body hair is just really uncomfortable so I use this product on my chest, back, and legs. The first time I used the epilator it hurt quite a bit but after using it for a few weeks I don&#x27;t feel any pain at all. One thing that you should do with any epilator is to invest in a good exfoliating sponge/brush. I use an exfoliating sponge and brush every time I shower and this makes a huge difference with ingrown hairs. One other thing I am noticing with this epilator is that the hairs have already started to become finer and softer. That did not happen with my last epilator and I think this is due the entire hair being pulled out. Anyway, I am really happy with the Satinelle and I am buying another one to have as a backup.</li>
            <li> This product works great but my boyfriend tried using it and ended up crying......:) not good for extremely sensitive skin. I used creams and stuff before and the pain from this tweezer is so much more comfortable than the weeks worth of burning from creams. Unlike creams the tweezer has many my hair grow out so much lighter.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was tired of the sticky mess that waxing always leaves me with.  First, it&#x27;s loud, but no louder than an electric razor or clippers.  I started on a leg because I thought it would be less painful there even though I really bought it for my bikini area.  WRONG!!  The leg stung like crazy, and I&#x27;m sitting here typing this with one hairy leg.  So, I was feeling really nervous to drop my pants and try the rest....and it wasn&#x27;t that bad at all.  I feel like it hurt less than waxing and I didn&#x27;t have the skin peeling and bleeding that I sometimes get from waxing.  I only going 4 stars because the head is much bigger than the actual working area of the device and that made it awkward in tighter places and its very directional. I found that in areas where the hair growth changed directions I had to try from all directions to find the one that worked best.</li>
            <li> I love it... wonderful product. This Product works so well. And &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; cheaper than other Epilator . I said bye bye razor.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs, armpits, bikini area, etc. It works very well. It&#x27;s very painful the first time, but that&#x27;s expected. But after the 3rd or fourth time, the pain was minimal. The only thing I want to say is that it&#x27;s very loud. So if you&#x27;re looking for a quiet one, this is not that. Otherwise though, I STRONGLY recommend this!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this epilator was not as painful as other brands I have tried! Does what its supposed to do, love it</li>
            <li> So I had no clue these things existed. I&#x27;ve never used one and don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I personally have to go over areas a few times (female, not very hairy). That being said, it definitely works. I&#x27;m not very hairy but I have dark hair on my legs and even after shaving, if I&#x27;m &amp;#34;winter white&amp;#34; when you can see them under the shin. After one round with the baby I can definitely tell a difference. I&#x27;d have to shave every other day if I was showing my legs, more because of my self conscious. I used this over 3 weeks ago (I did shave the &amp;#34;leftovers in between&amp;#34;) and though I have a bit of stubble, they are very, very fine hairs and unless you&#x27;re rubbing my legs, you can&#x27;t even tell!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those complaining about the pain... it&#x27;s puling your hair from the root... it&#x27;s going to hurt.  What did you expect? You get used to it. Unlike waxing, this only &amp;#34;attacks&amp;#34; your hairs and not your skin. It feels more like a &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; but is tolerable.</li>
            <li> After trying epilators a few years back I had given up as they were very painful, ater trying this one I was happily surprised to find that they have come a long way. This Philips is small and light enough that it&#x27;s easy to handle, love the longer than normal cord that lets me use it wherever I want to regardless of how far the outlet is. But most importantly love the fact that it&#x27;s almost pain free to use it, honestly I have little tolerance for any pain and can use this without even flinching!</li>
            <li> This epilator is perfect for what I need ! It is small &amp; work well. Pretty noisy but I guess all of the epilator are ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Useful &amp; cheaper ! Great deal !</li>
            <li> painful and causes ingrown hairs also doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair</li>
            <li> I was having my chin/lip threaded, so I was more or less used to the stinging sensation, so that was no shock.  I am thrilled with the results I get, whether it be on my legs (ouch ouch ouch), chin or lip.  I get carried away and &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; other areas, too, and yes, it&#x27;s a little painful, but not any worse than waxing.  Sometimes it misses a hair or two on my face but so was my threading lady. All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased and wished I would have tried this a long long time ago.</li>
            <li> I had never used an epilator but OMG I love it after one use. It did not hurt and I used it in my face for my mustache and those tiny hairs on my face. Then I used it on my legs. It was so awesome. Try it and you will love it too.</li>
            <li> works really well for me!!!</li>
            <li> Hair gets pulled out by the root, and yes, it hurts, but its not unbearable.  You get used to it.  I do not like doing the underarms, but I grin and bear it as that is the most painful to do.  But it is so nice to only have to use it about 1 time a week or 1 every 10 days or so.  It works well on legs and gets all the hairs after a few times going over the areas.  I&#x27;m a white female with dark hair and some of hair is thin and it gets all of it.  I did get an ingrown hair in my bikini area and that hurts, but I&#x27;m using tweezers to deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great solution and not as expensive as buying replacement heads for razors or getting waxing done.  Very easy to use and long cord, which I prefer than a chargeable one because I want full power and don&#x27;t want to have to worry that its not charged up all the way.  I would buy it again and when its time for my kids to start shaving, I&#x27;m going to tell them about this.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my first epilator (an expensive, wet/dry Braun model) and it is amazing.  The Braun was my first epilator, and it routinely took me up to an hour to use it on both of my legs.  I figured that was just the way epilators work, and even though I wished it was faster, I accepted it.  Imagine my surprise to find that this product is much, much faster.  This is largely because it just works better--it grabs way more hair on the first few passes and so I can do both legs easily in 20 minutes.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s faster and more thorough than more expensive products with more tweezers, but it is.  Maybe it&#x27;s something in the design?  Regardless, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> As the headline says I ride about 100 miles per week and shaving my legs, especially man hair, became cumbersome and required I shave quite often. The itching and ingrown hairs became too much so I looked for an alternative. So I must tell you that the first time i used it I had not shaved my legs for about 5-7 days. I and yes, it does feel like bee or even wasp stings all over. You will also notice that around your knees is a very sensitive area. It took a long time the first time I used it and my legs looked like I had some sort of rash or allergic reaction when I was done. That soon subsided and I had no residual pain or discomfort after a few minutes. Having said all of that the subsequent times i have used it have been great, very easy to use, does a great job and is much more convenient than shaving, as well as less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this since August, 2012.  I got it mainly to reduce skin irritation that I got from shaving and to save a little money by not waxing.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly since then, it still works great, and it reduces skin irritation while saving me money.    Here&#x27;s the low-down:    I&#x27;m assuming that if you&#x27;re a person who has hair, you understand that yanking your hair out is not a pleasant experience.  Is using this epilator more enjoyable after a glass of wine and NSAID of your choice, at least at first?  Yes, but so are a lot of things in life, so I don&#x27;t consider that a big mark against it.    Furthermore, it starts hurting less and less the more you use it.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because my technique has improved or because my pain tolerance has, but either way, I no longer require the aforementioned glass of wine and NSAID.  Doing my legs isn&#x27;t my favorite sensation, but I would no longer characterize it as painful.  My underarms are a bit more sensitive, but I can do them both in one sitting without any major discomfort.    Beyond that, this thing does the job without irritating my skin.  I threw out the guard I got with it within a month because it just isn&#x27;t necessary, but it was nice at first because I was a little leery of it pinching me (it doesn&#x27;t pinch, by the way.  That was me being silly).  I can do my legs and underarms in 20 minutes flat, and they stay smooth for a week.  The epilator itself has never shown signs of breaking, slowing down, or becoming less effective.  I do keep a pack of razors on hand for emergencies when I just don&#x27;t have time to epilate, but I&#x27;ve used one pack in the past year and a half.    I haven&#x27;t had issues with ingrown hairs with this--if anything, I have far fewer ingrown hairs than when I shaved regularly.    It does take a while to get all of your hair growing on the same schedule.  I live in Florida and wear a lot of skirts, so if there&#x27;s a special occasion coming up, I&#x27;ll epilate or shave what stubble I have, which means I&#x27;ll be yanking some hairs out when I epilate next and leaving others, but even with my lack of commitment I only have to epilate every week at the most.  I&#x27;ve been going a week and a half without looking unduly stubbly, lately, and I&#x27;m hoping to be able to go two weeks before too very long.    I&#x27;ve noticed the areas I regularly epilate seem to have slowly lost some hair, and the hair that remains is finer and lighter.  I am very pale (despite living in Florida) and have dark body hair, so this development is a huge relief and lets me go longer between epilating.    As to getting this thing to work maximally well, here are my tips:    +Hold the epilator in one hand and hold the skin tight in the other.  No, hold the skin tighter.  Tighter!  Like you mean it!  Does it hurt to epilate?  Yes?  You&#x27;re probably not holding the skin tight enough.    +Take some NSAIDs and/or glass of wine the first few times.  Do the epilating in patches--this gives you time to relax and troubleshoot your technique.    +Technique is important and you will get better with time.  This is a skill and is frustrating at first, just like shaving your legs was (I mean, I still can&#x27;t shave my legs without nicking the back of my ankle or my knee).  Give it a few tries before giving up.    +Legs are the least painful areas to epilate, at least for me, followed by underarms.  Bikini line is doable, but legitimately painful.  I tend to get ingrowns there even if I epilate, so I&#x27;ve just cut my losses and opted for swim shorts.    As I said, this product has led to less skin irritation, saved me money, and is still working after a year and a half.  It costs less than getting your legs waxed and it does the job just as well with a little practice.  I recommend it!    ETA:  I&#x27;ve had this product for two years and counting.  I can go for two weeks (more, if I&#x27;m not wearing skirts every day) between epilating my legs or underarms, and I have reached the level of epilating expertise where I can domy bikini line with only a little discomfort.  As I said, it takes skill, which takes practice, and also persistence. This gadget costs less than a single leg wax, has lasted two years, and is still going strong.  Does it hurt a little at first?  Yep.  So does waxing (or shaving, if you&#x27;re clumsy like me and accidentally cut your knees or ankles).  Does it work, get easier/less painful with time, and last a while?  Absolutely!  I have and continue to recommend this product very highly!</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t buy this off of amazon, I snagged it at the Meijer down the street from my house on clearance at $27.99! I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be getting much considering they had to mark it down, so I was pretty much ready to try it, return it, and never talk about this experience again.&lt;br /&gt;A little backstory:&lt;br /&gt;I, like probably every other woman, have been on the hunt for a hair removal method that actually works, and keeps the hair away for a long time. Unfortunately for me, I have super sensitive skin, and can most certainly cannot afford the laser hair removal! (Who can!) I cannot shave because it leaves super painful bumps, and nicks, that have left permanent scars on my legs, no matter what kind of &amp;#34;Sensitive Skin&amp;#34; formula shaving cream I tried. I attempted the hair removal creams next, I had more success with the Veet Sensitive Formula with Aloe, than I did the Nair, which I tried before the Veet, and it left second degree burns on the backs of both my legs, plus it smelled really bad. I clearly wouldn&#x27;t recommend anything with Nair, but that was only my personal experience.&lt;br /&gt;After the Creams were effectively a bust, I saw the Philips Satinelle Epilator at my local Meijer, I cringed the first few times I saw it, because the picture described that it would be ripping out the hair by the root, like waxing! But I am a big wuss when it comes to pain, I do have a couple tattoos as well, but after a few days of thinking, I decided, &amp;#34;what the hell. I can return it if it doesn&#x27;t work.&amp;#34; I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hurts, yes. But your ripping out the hair by the root! What do you expect? I was going to dinner with my Aunt and cousins, so I only had time to do one leg before I left, which I felt would be a good trial run. It wasn&#x27;t too bad, but if it gets too bad, all it takes for relief is to lift the epilator away. After the initial epilation of my right leg, there were some bumps, and was a little rough, but by the time I returned the bumps had gone away, and my legs were super smooth! my tattoos haven&#x27;t looked this good since I got them done! I put on some lotion, and my leg looked great! Awesome! I went to do my left leg, and it hurt quite a bit more. I think it could be because I&#x27;m right side dominant but it got done. After some point, the burn/itch became almost therapeutic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bumps, no irritation, no redness, almost no hair! I&#x27;m sure after a couple uses, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll perfect the usage of this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I probably should have mentioned earlier, exfoliation is a MUST. I would highly recommend taking a hot shower before epilating, and exfoliating while taking said hot shower. It&#x27;ll keep the ingrown hairs to a minimum. I would also suggest exfoliating regularly, it&#x27;ll not only keep your legs super smooth, but it&#x27;ll also keep the ingrown hairs down.</li>
            <li> Works great for my facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Works well but I found it to be pretty painful. It does what it says it&#x27;s going to do though, which is yank out your hairs by their roots. I normally wax and found the epilator to be much more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove my hairs... Lots of pain however.</li>
            <li> I have been a home wax enthusiast for years and was looking for a less set up, less sticky mess way to deal with my body hair.  This epilator was able to remove the hair, root and all from my legs, bikini line and arm pits. It feels like getting shocked and the armpits where the most painful for me personally.  The pain was the wort when I first start on an area and the hair was still thick but then it gets more tolerable as the hair thins.  Andreaschoice on youtube has a great video on this subject if you want to watch a how to video.  I used the first- lowest setting and slowly as I could moved it up each body part.</li>
            <li> Great product for great price! It comes with warranty and I hope it will last a long time. Philips is a great brand.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good on longer hair but didn&#x27;t seem to work very well on the peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!!</li>
            <li> it hurts tooooooo much！</li>
            <li> I simply love this product. No need to say more than that... well there&#x27;s something: I am a very heary girl :( but not anymore :)</li>
            <li> Love it. It works perfectly. Glad I bought this one. Have recommended to family.</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator. It is very easy to use and I purchased it for a reasonable price. The only complaint I have is that it is very loud.</li>
            <li> When my daughter asked to purchase an epilator, we settled on the Philips HP6401, as it was a good value and was highly rated. She was thrilled when it arrived! That excitement was short-lived, however because once she tried it, she immediately regretted her purchase! The pain was extraordinary! I tried it myself thinking maybe she was exaggerating. I learned right away, that this little tool could be used as a form of torture treatment! We returned it promptly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used epilators for years, both corded and cordless, and have always preferred them to shaving with a razor or an electric shaver. My old epilator, a rechargeable cordless model, started losing its charge after only two years. Running it with the charger ruined it after a month, so I went shopping for a corded model and found this one. It had decent reviews, and I didn&#x27;t think the noise level that some people complained about would be a problem. I do have to admit that this baby is LOUD -- sort of like shaving with a gas-powered lawnmower. But, hey, it works; and it hopefully will last longer than the cordless one did.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my aunt because she got tired of women razors and she loves it is great product</li>
            <li> Too pain,and not clean</li>
            <li> From all the epilators I&#x27;ve ever had, this is the best one. I&#x27;m so glad my last one broke...! It removes all the hair on the first try, so it makes the work so much faster. Super pleased.</li>
            <li> Typical standard Epilator. Been using epilators for about 12 years, my last one was getting slower, so I decided to go with this one. Been using it for about a month. It does the job. Plenty of power. I like it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the Mrs. and I like it.</li>
            <li> I think I am going to like this product very much. If it means shaving less often, that is definitely a plus and also the fact that you don&#x27;t have to us shaving cream. So far, I am a fan.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a year and am shocked it works so well.  Finally bought a bigger more expensive one from QVC for christmas this year but I will still use this on my face!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product, it was indicated that the package would have a cleaning brush and a no-zip pouch for the product. Both the items are missing from the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is ok. I am not extremely happy with it. But it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> This works well and is easy to clean.  It takes a bit of practice to get the right angle and pressure.  It can be painful so I started with small sections of my leg and worked my way up to doing the whole leg at the same time.  It&#x27;s still painful on some areas, like my face, but still less painful than wax.</li>
            <li> This is excellent, fast and easy to keep is clean.</li>
            <li> I prefer this epilator over the battery powered Philips I have tried. It grips the hair better and removes more efficiently.  One pass with this epilator is equal to two or three with the Philips.  Also most battery powered models are not useable once the battery dies.  This model will never suffer that fate. It&#x27;s really an excellent little machine.</li>
            <li> This does the job by pulling your hair out, it does grow back but slower than when you shave or wax.&lt;br /&gt;I find it works great.  For little jobs of hair around the chin area where you don&#x27;t want to wax.  also underarms&lt;br /&gt;and private areas.  Be careful as the hair is pulled out, so if you are sensitive to tweezing, you won&#x27;t like this.&lt;br /&gt;The leg area as well as overall this is a good way to quickly do away with hair.</li>
            <li> Awful! Breaks hairs rather than removes hairs. Fine, medium, coarse hairs... Very inconsistent maybe removed 10% of hairs and broke the rest. Is very loud. I threw it away. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife, she&#x27;s owned two or three epilators in the past. She only used this once and said it was trash. She says it caused a great amount of pain and got nearly nothing done.</li>
            <li> Simply fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my lower back, full front chest and lip area and it does a marvelous job and removing hair! It however does not work on under arm/ public hairs. There are some hairs that the epilator will not remove, those being really tiny baby hairs. Ive been using this product for about 4 months now and I&#x27;ve noticed that the more I use it, the less and less my hair is starting to grow back. I use it about once a week, and the battery and strength of this product is simply unbeatable for the price.</li>
            <li> Shave less but doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs even after going over areas several times. Does hurt, not really bad but it stings and may require a break inbetween rotations</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Need to go over a couple of times to get desired smoothness. Not my favorite hair removal technique but it is useful for some areas.</li>
            <li> So far my wife loves her Christmas present. She says it works great and she is really excited about using it again when her hair is longer. She says the pain is something else but the directions say she will get used to it. Shes really excited about this Epilator(asphalt grinder). Proof she and alot of other women are NUTS.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly - not quite painless but didn&#x27;t expect that :)</li>
            <li> Love an epilator and this one is great.</li>
            <li> Works great! Came fast!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand the purpose of this if it didn&#x27;t do its job and I had to use tweezers afterwards. Such a waste of money, please don&#x27;t buy and regret it like I did.</li>
            <li> The product works pretty well. Keep in mind that it is still very painful to use.&lt;br /&gt;The size is just right and its fairly lightweight.</li>
            <li> About me:&lt;br /&gt;No tattoos, never had a baby&lt;br /&gt;Have waxed my legs before&lt;br /&gt;My leg hair is jet black and my skin is pale. I needed a hair removal system that would last longer than shaving but not be too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely hate shaving; I was ready to shell out a lot of money on laser hair removal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I chose epilation: Epilation is the only FDA approved method for permanent hair reduction. This means if you epilate regularly for long enough, you may see a reduction in the number of hairs. I have been using this epilator for over six months and it does seem I have fewer hairs in the areas I regularly epilate. But that is just anecdotal evidence, so you may want to do your own research if you are looking for permanent hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I chose epilation over waxing: less mess and lower cost. The epilator doesn&#x27;t have wax I need to dispose of and I don&#x27;t need to keep purchasing wax and strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I chose epilation over shaving: epilation lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t cut my skin like razors. I haven&#x27;t had razor burn since I started epilating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, why this epilator? My friend uses this epilator and the reviews seemed encouraging. I am very happy with this purchase. It is easy to clean, easy to use, and very effective. The two speeds are really nice; I use the fast setting on my legs and the slow setting on my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful advice so you can learn from my mistakes:&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely do not use this on your face. I tried using it around my eyebrows and severely hurt the skin where I used it. There was a bad rash that lasted several days. I had read the instructions saying not to use it on your face, but I did it anyway. I feel very dumb for having done this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful if you use this on your underarms. The first few times I epilated my armpits they became very irritated but this only lasted overnight. I could use deodorant in the morning just fine. Now when I epilate my underarms, I only use the slower setting and only go over the area once or twice. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with irritation since starting these two practices. Also, the first time I epilated my armpits hurt so much tears poured out of my eyes. It still hurts more than my legs, but not as badly as when I first epilated them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating the bikini area hurts so much. It hurt terribly the first time and the pain has only lessened slightly. I feel each hair and the pain is very intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this incredibly loquacious review has helped you make an informed decision!slower setting and only go over the area once or twice.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had another epilator prior to this that would take much longer to cover the same area. The tweezers are much more efficient at plucking since my previous one tended to break off the hairs. The best part is that it&#x27;s so lightweight and ergonomic.</li>
            <li> Everything came in my package except for the cleaning brush, which was disappointing. Anyways, this stuff works very well! I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has a cord and all because it can get tangled and become a huge mess. Kind of a hassle when it comes to traveling as well because the cord is so long. But overall i like it and i will deal with the long/unnecessary cord.</li>
            <li> It takes time to get to know proper way to use it.</li>
            <li> Amazing little device! I wish I had known these things existed a long time ago. It really works.  You just slide it along your skin and it yanks the hairs out.  It DOES hurt, of course, because it is yanking the hairs out by the root, but you get used to it and the results are worth it.  Cons:  It is super loud.  I tried to use it while watching tv and it&#x27;s so loud I couldn&#x27;t hear the tv over it.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions twice - didn&#x27;t do anything... maybe I have super roots on my hair, but no results worth mentioning, unless you could the tiny swatch of tissue that was whisked away...</li>
            <li> This is my second one to purchase. Loved it so much, I bought my daughter one! I will not lie, it is painful at first, but over time it becomes easier to tolerate.  The time gained from not having to shave daily is definitely worth the discomfort of having to endure the hair removal process.  I found that holding the skin taunt helps.  This unit is small and portable.  It is not rechargeable and has to be plugged in to use but the cord is long enough to reach.  it is durable and lasting.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> I had the old model in Europe and I was looking for a replacement here inUS. I ended up buying again satinelle because it works perfectly. I am using this machine since more than 10 years</li>
            <li> If you have a grumpy pants man in your life this is the perfect thing to get him back into shape! When he comes home grumpy from work, whip this thing out and turn it on.. He will instantly turn his frown upside down and then offer to give you a back massage!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, though.. this thing hurts but the pain is totally worth it! Your legs come out soft after a few hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a woman with dark, thick leg hairs is quite embarrassing. I shave and have stubble a few hours later! So when I was bored the other night browsing Amazon, I came across an &amp;#34;epilator&amp;#34;. I had never heard of this fancy machine before. I have tried the No!No! before (HUGE waste of money, plus gross smelling!) so I was a little hesitant to make another hair remover purchase.  I read the reviews, most of which said it was not painful and the price tag was fairly decent. I also reviewed some YouTube videos and the girls epilating their legs were smiling so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, Amazon sent the order to which someone stole my package! I spoke to a representative and they shipped a new one to me to my office. GREAT customer service on that part. Shipping was fast both times and because of the incident, I was able to grow out some hairs for epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I got it home, I plugged it in and turned it on. The sound is very loud! Like, I am afraid my neighbors were wondering what on earth I was doing. But who cares, they don&#x27;t need to know I am epilating my legs :p. It looks very scary, as well. Because those little metal graspers move very fast and screech.  I put it on my legs.. and OW! Oh my gosh does it hurt! Those YouTube girls must have been drunk or something!!! I had to move it in small circular motions. The pain honestly feels like a burning sensation. Once you get going though (and with many breaks and hesitations around the ankle) the pain starts to become numb. Probably because it hurts so bad. Because I was going so slow ittook me half and hour to do both legs. Once I was done my legs has millions of red bumps all over them, some were bleeding! I rubbed some non-frangranced lotion on them and it felt soothing. I went to bed and in the morning the red bumps were gone and my legs looked AMAZING! They feel so soft from doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some hairs were too short to get picked up from the epilator so I will be doing it again in a couple days. Honestly. I feel that it hurt so bad because I had so many hairs being pulled at once. This next time around it will not hurt as bad. Must buy for those pretty ladies with man hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I hope whoever stole my package was tortured by this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> if u need one that it is perfect! it&#x27;s cheapest and it works good!!! I suggest to buy this one. fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the intention of using it on my face (even though the directions say not to).  I have not gotten the courage to do so.  I will not lie, epilating hurts.  However, it is true that the more you do it the less it hurts.  I have currently only used this on my arms and it works great.  It leaves my arms baby smooth.  The only issue I consistently have is ingrown hairs.  However, I&#x27;ve found that washing with a cleanser with Salicylic acid and a loofa greatly reduces this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that I had spent a little more money and bought one that was cordless as well.  The cord on this one is fairly long, but it tethers you to an outlet.  And if your bathroom is anything like mine, a comfortable spot in which to do this is not close to the outlet.  So if you&#x27;re thinking about getting one of these, take that into consideration before you make your final decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I don&#x27;t use this for the purpose I had intended, I am very happy with how it works.  I get smooth arms for a couple weeks with just 30 min or so of pain.  Maybe one day I&#x27;ll build up the courage to do my legs.</li>
            <li> I have been using epliators since they were invented. During this time so many new models have been invented, that are just a waste of money and time. I understand they have to make new models to keep selling new things, but it does not improve the quality and I would say it make it worst. My previous one was one of those fancy ones with hundred of little things and so perfect in grabbing the hair that sometimes grab the skin too. I am very happy of going back to the basics with this epilator. I works better than the new models, it takes me less time and is much cheaper. Also I am happy that it can be plug and used whenever I need, the time I need unlike the cordless models that you always have to remember to charge, the battery last 40 minutes only.</li>
            <li> This was my second epilator.  My first was a $25.00 one (it&#x27;s blue and pink, can&#x27;t remember the name.) I&#x27;d purchase a cordless one next time. It works well but it&#x27;s strength has irritated my leg skin quite a few times and I&#x27;ve used it less than my previous epilator. I expected more for the price and the dact is manufactured by Philips</li>
            <li> First time using one of these, first time using something other then shaving. Was a bit more painful then I anticipated so if you&#x27;re looking for painless I&#x27;d say this isn&#x27;t the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;After trying it on my arm and on my legs I think I&#x27;ll stay there....I&#x27;m not putting this anywhere near my face or underarms....&lt;br /&gt;Works well though, only had to make on pass of an area to remove hair with the occasional straggler. Over all I like this epilator but its going to take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Anyone who says epilators don&#x27;t hurt is either lying or has nerve damage. The legs are bearable, but I can hardly stand it on my underarms or bikini line. It does the job, though. I&#x27;ll continue to use it on my legs but I can&#x27;t subject myself to that kind of torture to my underarms or bikini area just so I can shave less.</li>
            <li> Wow. Ouch, it does do what it says, &amp;#34;Smooth Legs&amp;#34; but OUCH. It takes some time to get a hang of it, and it is very painful. I did not expect ripping hair from the roots to be a walk in the park. I was surprised at how painful it was. I used to give myself brazilian waxes, this hurt much worse. To me, the stinging pain felt like a combination of tweezing and electrocution. They never claimed it was a painless method, just that it was effective. My legs are very smooth. It will take awhile for the hair to grow back, and my nerve to do this for next time.&lt;br /&gt;*They also caution that anyone with auto-immune disorders or poor circulation do not use their epilator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one of these and I expected it to hurt but was not prepared for this. I also had to go over the area several times to get it all. I will be going back to my razor.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It works but yes it is a little painful at first until you get use to it.  It just doesn&#x27;t work as good as I thought it would but I still use it when I feel brave.  It does last longer then shaving when you use it right.</li>
            <li> Short summary:  does the product work?  Yes.    Longer summary:  I am a male.  I purchased this item to remove torso hair I did not want from medium to \\&quot;high-traffic\\&quot; skin areas-- no sensitive skin areas.  Thank goodness.    First of all, the item is White/Gray per the item description, with a pink add-on attachment for first time users/victims:  overall, a cute, innocent-looking pink and white device.  This, in my opinion, is frankly devious and borders on false advertising.  There is a spectrum between discomfort and pain.  When I had purchased this item, I had hoped 1) it would work well, and 2) that it would hurt less than Nair or wax treatments.  Well, 50% it is.  All you women out there, feel free to mock me and men in general for our low pain tolerance, and how most men wouldn&#x27;t be willing to go through half the discomfort/pain you women go through in the pursuit of beauty each week.  Go on, get it out... fair enough.  But for me, and I don&#x27;t think that my wife or others who know me would describe me as a wimp, this device produces a lot more pain than discomfort.  Yes, if you use this device only on super high-use skin, the sensation you get stays right on the high end of discomfort, not quite tipping over the cusp into pain.  But use it anywhere else?  Pain.  Picture ripping hair wax treatments off slooowly, pulling hair by hair deliciously out by the roots, all the while listening to a cute little pink device hum along cheerfully.  Nowadays, even hearing the humming noise causes me to clench instinctively...    So, does this thing work:  yes.  Use it judiciously, or give it as a gift to an in-law.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator because it seems that this one gives you the least pain (according to numerous reviews). I haven&#x27;t bought another epilator so I can&#x27;t really compare...Using this epilator is a bit painful; when I used it for the first time it felt like my legs were on fire for a minute or two. However, with continued usage you get more used to the pain and it becomes easier to use. My only complaint is that this epilator is not good at grabbing all the hairs. I go over parts several times and it seems like the epilator can&#x27;t pick it up. I end up epilating against the grain, which is something everyone tells me not to do, but I honestly have no choice. Fortunately, the epilator does work when I shave against the grain...I do have rather thin hair, so I guess it&#x27;s understandable, but nevertheless, 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Love it, really takes the hair off.</li>
            <li> I normally purchased much more expensive epilators (Emjois), and I was nervous to give this one a try. I&#x27;m really happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than my previous epilators were (by nearly half the price)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s very powerful, and does and excellent job of clearing the hair all over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one complaint, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m a little nervous about the safety features of this unit. I&#x27;m not quite as confident about it auto-stopping if it picks up some skin by accident (which all epilators tend to do in more delicate spots). I&#x27;ve been very nervous about using it in more sensitive areas. I&#x27;m still successfully using it there, and have never had any problems, but I&#x27;m nervous!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. This was my first time using an epilator. I have never waxed my legs before and thought I would try this since it would be cheaper in the long run. I have dark leg hair (I&#x27;m Italian) and I used to shave every 2-3 days. I have used this item maybe once a month every other month or so. Today, I wanted to wear a dress and hadn&#x27;t shaved in over two weeks so I felt my legs and was absolutely shocked. I had barely any leg hair. It looked like I had shaved only a few days ago. I was absolutely amazed. I am so excited to continue using this product. It works well. I do not think that it hurts too bad. I use it on the highest setting and it seems fine. I LOVE this product and would greatly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I do not use it often because it is too painful, not easy to get used to that pain.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but it seems to do the job just fine.  I wished I would&#x27;ve tried epilation a long time ago.  I like this method much better than any other unwanted hair removal.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot and took a chance on this Philips Satinelle Epilator since it comes with a 2 year manufacturer warranty.</li>
            <li> Love this use on my legs and other parts.</li>
            <li> This is not as painful as you think. At least not more painful than you doing it manually, but for sure it&#x27;s way faster. 1 star off since I wish it takes batteries for traveling use.</li>
            <li> Great product, use it monthly for underarm, arms, and legs. Happy with it and cord is long enough.</li>
            <li> I had never even heard of an epilator before purchasing this, but I hate shaving and waxing so I was looking for an alternative. This product was the number one bestseller in its category on Amazon so I decided to check it out. After reading reviews for about half an hour, I decided to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and I tested it out as soon as I got it. I was scared it would really hurt because of the reviews, but it actually wasn&#x27;t bad at all. If you&#x27;ve ever gotten a tattoo you&#x27;ll know exactly what this feels like. Some people compared it to bee stings or other frightening things, but a way better description is just like getting a tattoo. My skin quickly went kind of tingly numb and I didn&#x27;t even notice the pain anymore (exception to bikini area - that was pretty painful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my legs, underarms, and bikini area. It worked perfectly everywhere and removed hair with shocking effectiveness. It&#x27;s been a week now and the hair still isn&#x27;t back!! The only really unpleasant part of using this was when I went &amp;#34;down under&amp;#34; with it. I wax myself regularly and this didn&#x27;t feel any different from waxing (and it worked better) but it was a slower motion so it was definitely more painful. It wasn&#x27;t unbearable though; I was able to complete the upper triangle as well as my bikini line before I called it quits. I think I&#x27;ll still be using a razor for the really sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is by far the best thirty dollars I&#x27;ve ever spent on hair removal and in the long run I think it&#x27;s going to save me time of money on razors and wax. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a more convenient and economical method of hair removal, and don&#x27;t get scared away thinking it&#x27;ll be super painful! It&#x27;s definitely worse in your head ;)</li>
            <li> okay so the thing about epilators is that it all depends on YOUR hair type and YOUR skin type&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER IF YOU ARE PRONE TO INGROWNS YOU MAY NOT WANT THIS&lt;br /&gt;(im actually prone to ingrowns and i have horrible skin but this actually works fairly well)&lt;br /&gt;1. do they work on thick hair&lt;br /&gt;yes i have very thick hair on my legs and happy trail and also my armpits and it doesnt go as easy as light hairs but you have to force yourself to go over it a few times until it gets pulled out&lt;br /&gt;2.do they work on thin hair&lt;br /&gt;i have thick and thin combo hair all over my body (im a hairy girl -_-) and i use it on the thick hair on my arms and the light blonde hairs on my tummy and other places where i feel self concious&lt;br /&gt;3.does it hurt&lt;br /&gt;let me give it to you straight it hurts like hell i have a high pain tolerance and it feels like youre being burned or maybe cut and the more it hurts the better its working but once you see the results its worth it&lt;br /&gt;4.does it REALLY work&lt;br /&gt;for ME with my thick and thin hairs i use different settings and strokes and it works really well for me despite giving me red bumpy rashes but my skin is prone to getting those even when i shave so its just natural i would get bumps and stuff&lt;br /&gt;this is good for beginner epilators to test out to see if its for them and after trying it im willing to save up and get a higher quality one</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator. I hate shaving, and I hate having to do it so often. I found this epilator and decided to give it a try despite the warnings of pain as it rips out the hair. Sounds scary, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway I plugged it in, hesitated, and then went for it. I felt it pulling the hair, but was relieved that it was not really painful at all. I mean, it wasn&#x27;t pleasant, but it wasn&#x27;t agony either. A few seconds into it, and I just went to town making sure I&#x27;d covered every square inch. I actually looked for the \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; feeling so that I knew where I had missed. So I honestly don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that bad. I can&#x27;t promise everyone else will feel the same way, since I suppose some may be quite sensitive to pain, but I really didn&#x27;t consider it pain as much as a discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I even took off that dumb cap, as I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s only there for psychological reasons...it really doesn&#x27;t do anything in my opinion. It felt and functioned the same with or without. What really matters, is how hard you press the unit to the skin, and even then, it only affected how well it removed the hair and did not give the nicks or cuts that a shaver would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So the results? Afterward I had tiny little red bumps where the hair was removed, but they didn&#x27;t hurt. I put on some natural lotion (one without alcohols or chemical irritants) and within a few hours, smooth legs. I&#x27;ll likely start exfoliating in the shower regularly to avoid ingrown hairs. If I can get away with longer periods between hair removal with this as compared to shaving, this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> OK...I&#x27;m a guy and I use epilation to remove body hair that I don&#x27;t really care for...I have tried my wife&#x27;s epilation prior to purchasing my own...mainly because she would nag too much about her epilator being left unclean etc....she told me to buy my own.  I have tried a few of hers which include the Braun and an Emjoi...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my reviews of each one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun:  This was the first one I used...it seemed to more or less cut the hairs very painfully...they didn&#x27;t seem like they were being pulled out from the root.  I would remove the hairs and it seemed like the area was smooth, but a few days later (about 3 days) the hairs would begin growing back.  This one was probably one of the most painful ones I used.  After I used it the first time, I vowed that I would never epilate again....2 weeks later I did it again...and it did hurt less than the first time, but still hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emjoi:  Had to go over the area multiple times to get the hairs removed and still it would miss a lot of the hairs.  It wasn&#x27;t as painful as the Braun.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the way this one worked just because it took forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Philips:  Finally I ordered my own cuz wifey nagging about her epilator just got annoying. And I used it today on my pubic area and underarms.  This was actually the least painful epilator I have ever used.  I am not saying it is pain free, but I couldn&#x27;t feel too much.  I didn&#x27;t shower before using it.  I would go over an area about 2 times and the hair would all be gone.  As I&#x27;ve said I have tried other epilators and this one seemed to work great in very sensitive areas.  On my wife&#x27;s Braun, I would slightly bleed at times, but this one there was no blood.  I am actually very happy with this one and even though I would never be sitting at a bar and suggest this to one of my drinking buddies because I&#x27;d probably be drinking alone from then on...I can suggest that anyone on Amazon (male or female) who is looking for an epilator...THIS IS THE ONE YOU NEED TO BUY!!!..THIS IS THE ONE YOU NEED TO BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this kind of epilator for 12 years. I get a new one every 2 years ( that is the time more or less starts going bad or make noises) .</li>
            <li> This hurts like heck. I can&#x27;t use it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a wimp. Maybe it hurts more for thick coarse hair? I&#x27;m fairly used to plucking and that doesn&#x27;t hurt me, but this sucker hurt bad.</li>
            <li> Im so glad i purchased this it works just like all the reviews said it would, my only issue is that it does take a few times to really get all the hair but it does not hurt all that much and works really well I tried it on my arms first and it got them as smooth as if i had shaved them, I have only had it one day so I dont know how long the smoothness will last but it took about the same time as shaving. I would definetly recommend this to anyone looking for something easier than shaving practically every day.</li>
            <li> I give this 2 stars not because of functionality issues but because it&#x27;s very painful (I knew this going in but thought it would be a alternative to waxing which it&#x27;s not),&lt;br /&gt;It is much simpler to wax and remove alot of hair in one go then trying to use this shipping/functionality 4/5&lt;br /&gt;use ability 2/5&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I am just overly sensitive but I find it difficult to think about using it again waxing is just better faster and less painful.</li>
            <li> This did not work as well as i expected.  I keep giving it another try and it fails on me.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Silk Epil 7 after meeting up with a college friend who used to be extremely hairy whose arms were now as smooth as a baby&#x27;s. When that device started wearing down (as i hear epilators tend to do) I replaced it with this epilator since it was cheaper and it had good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing I can say about the Philips vs the Braun is that this epilator is far less painful, but that being said, it is only because it doesn&#x27;t actually pick up most of the hair.  On my arms, I can get about 80-90% of the hair off but only after doing maybe 20 passes over the hair.  On my legs I did maybe a minute of swiping and couldn&#x27;t really see a difference in hair removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Braun, it hurt like heck, but my arms were smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside and my legs got most of the hair removed as well.  I&#x27;ve only had this device for around a month but I will be throwing it out and buying another Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS if you have thick hair like I do I would not recommend either of them for your sensitive regions due to the pain.  I would highly suggest just paying the extra money to have a professional wax you as they can get it done extremely quick and with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> I have had the product for a few months now. I like it so far. I use it on areas of my body that have had laser hair removal (laser isn&#x27;t 100% effective) so it does a good job keeping those straglers at bay.</li>
            <li> I tried a friend&#x27;s 25 year old epilator several times to see if I liked using an epilator. After one time I was sold on epilators.  But the old one was large and clumsy to handle. This one is streamlined, works great and  is very easy to handle.  I would recommend a corded epilators as I believe they have more power than battery operated ones. There is some slight discomfort, but it can be minimized  by holding any loose skin around knees or other areas taught .</li>
            <li> The product is really good. Excite my expectations. You can have a good waxing with sort time. Practical an easy for use.</li>
            <li> I have chosen it as i reviewed the others rating and comments.&lt;br /&gt; I had a Broun one before that I missed it in my home country. I could find this epilator much better than that. I could easily use it for every part of my body. face, hands and foot, Bikini with almost no harmful pain.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to anybody who wants to have an epilatr with reasonable price and good performance.</li>
            <li> Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;Does the job inexpensively.&lt;br /&gt;Stalls when clothing gets stuck in teeth - rather than burning up the motor. Clothing isn&#x27;t torn. Turn it off and pull fabric out and it starts again when the switch is turned on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;Plastic gears - don&#x27;t know how well they will last over time.</li>
            <li> Bought this to shave my wife&#x27;s cooter, but the instructions say legs only.</li>
            <li> Okay, lets start with the first thing on everyone&#x27;s mind in these reviews. I keep seeing a lot of &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; comments. Let me tell you, if you think you&#x27;re an expert as a first time user you&#x27;re wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you don&#x27;t listen to the directions, or have patience for trial and error this product isn&#x27;t for you. My first time using this on my legs it hurt, yes, but not an enormous amount and might I add my leg hair was LONG. NOT RECOMMENDED, I just thought I knew everything! It was a new sensation. I&#x27;ve never &amp;#34;plucked&amp;#34; my legs before. I also left room for error though. I didn&#x27;t keep the epilator at a hard 90 degrees, I either pressed too hard or not hard enough, and I made it hard on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be PATIENT, everyone is going to use it a little bit differently. I found that on the front of my legs I needed less pressure, and more on the back. I&#x27;ve used this product twice and stopped using the cap because I find life to be far easier without it. Now on use two I already feel little to no pain. This is on both the 1 and 2 settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with my experience stated, let me give you some facts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. For folks saying it only breaks, and does not remove the hair? If you are too light in the pressure department you will trim your hair and not have it removed fully. It will sting the first time or two. It fades quickly unless you have a very low pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. All of your hair isn&#x27;t always in the same direction, this is why I&#x27;m guessing a lot of folks complain about missing patches? You might have to go over your leg twice at most, but it really does snag any hair you move it over AS LONG AS IT&#x27;S THE RIGHT DIRECTION. Always have the button facing the direction you&#x27;re aiming for. Have it face up toward you for your first stroke, then turn it and go down your legs. I promise you will be impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Is their a burn or bumps? I experienced little to none. Far less than shaving. FAR less than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Using this epilator anywhere other than your legs? TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. This is for legs. I&#x27;ve done my thighs, and my inner lower thighs where I get some thicker hairs, and where I have waxed. [Aka where the skin is far more used to this type of sensation so I feel no pain.] I don&#x27;t recommend using this anywhere other than legs, especially not on super sensitive areas. Bikini isn&#x27;t so bad, definately not your face. That should just be common sense, but I know someone will try it. [I did. I&#x27;m a curious person!]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Is it worth it? I say 5 stars worth of yes. I&#x27;m a woman, I&#x27;ve shaved for a while now and it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s hard, or taxing, and it&#x27;s no less time consuming than this, but it cuts costs. [No more shaving creme, using extra body wash or buying razors as often. Now I only need one razor for my underarms and genital area and that will last me much longer than if I had to do my legs every night. My leg hair grows very quickly!] Also I live in a small studio apartment with a very tiny bathroom that doesn&#x27;t leave me, someone with long legs, much room TO shave. My shower is cramped, and the rest of the bathroom is very tight. I prefer to be able to sit and get a close up look at my legs when I shave them! I&#x27;m a bit OCD. :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this epilator is fantastic. It might take a shake to get used to but it is definately worth it and a great bargain for the price. Get a loofa or a nice exfoliating wash. Don&#x27;t skip your legs in the shower and it will be clean, painless sailing as long as you&#x27;re patient for your first few uses, use it as directed, and don&#x27;t try it on overly sensitive areas.

            <li> I got this for my bikini line, and it works but it hurts.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any bleeding so that&#x27;s a plus.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch my skin either. I don&#x27;t have to do many passes at all (you don&#x27;t want to do many passes) it grabs the hair well.  I was scared of this at first but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> i  like it. gives good hair removal. less pain felt. comfortable to hold and remove hair. would recommend it to friends too</li>
            <li> Very good price comparing with other brands. Also very useful and clean. You will definitely need it in the summer!</li>
            <li> My wife says not as good as the Braun she previously had. Have to run the Philips over the area more to get the same results.</li>
            <li> It works and makes my legs feel super smooth afterwards! You have to go pretty slow to get everything but I imagine it&#x27;s probably the same with most epilators. I would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for an epilator that&#x27;s reasonably-priced and removes hair well.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money. When you a search for men, this comes up and unless you have super fine hair, its a waste and even then it takes like 3 or 4 swipes in the same area to get everything. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for this product however it doesn&#x27;t pull out the entire hair. It seems to snap the hair in half instead which means I have to go over the same are multiple times. I&#x27;ve only used it 4 times so maybe I have to figure out my own method.</li>
            <li> I did not like epilating. This feels like many little extremely painful pinches on the skin, I prefer waxing over this.</li>
            <li> I like this epilator. It fits just great in my hand. Easy to use. I&#x27;m surprised with all the reviews that say &amp;#34;it&#x27;s painful to use this particular epilator&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s painful with ANY epilator. But once your legs get use to it the pain is not anything you couldn&#x27;t handle. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> wow this thing hurts and barely worked.</li>
            <li> It worked fine but after 3 months of using it it stop working</li>
            <li> Have used an epilator for years.  This one replaced my small battery powered epilator.  The size this epilator is large enough to work a bigger area than my last epilator but still small enough to work with precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> LOOOOVE my epilator. the hairs on my leg are so much thinner and takes about a week or 2 to grow back :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend crazy money on the expensive kinds. Get this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned or used one of these before this one so I assume it works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to. It rips your hair out 20 at a time temporarily exposing you to an unholy pain equivalent to ripping your hair out 20 at a time with an electrical device.  Not awesome for unwanted facial hair. Unless its already noticeably long like that weird guy with the mole hair who works at the Chinese buffet in town here for some poorly thought out reason.  It pretty much just grabs those short little jerks causing the pain but not actually removing the hair. Works well on arms, legs, and armpits though.</li>
            <li> My first epilator. It was kind of scary at first, but I am getting used to the sound and feeling. I think is sound scarier than it is. I felt like it works really well.  I think that it worked better on areas with courser hair. Areas with finer hair, still grabbed and pulled out. Overall, I think it was a good buy. I would get it again.</li>
            <li> Its ok. It was small and the cheapest one so I decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t know what an epilator was so I watched YouTube videos about them. When I finally tried it OMG. It hurt like crazy. I&#x27;d honestly rather wax. Its just a machine with a bunch of tweezers pulling out your hairs. The more expensive ones have more tweezers. People say the more tweezers the less it hurts but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;ll still hurt too. This is something I would recommend to use after a couple days of shaving when the hair starts to grow back. Since its pulling the hair from the root your hair grows back in less time just like waxing. I would say this is something to purchase if your trying to stop shaving and stop ingrown hairs. But you have to be tolerant to the pain.</li>
            <li> Amazingly painless compared to my older one; removes hair quite well, very easy to use. Though the instruction says it is just for legs.  I was thinking it had a light - mine does not.  I need to check on that.</li>
            <li> This can be used between waxes for touch ups. I don&#x27;t think its effective enough to use as a primary hair removal method. I also would imagine that it would be very painful to use over entire areas of skin that were covered in hair. I use it for minor touch ups. The price was really good and of course it shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s painful!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quite effective.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator experience ever and I must say I&#x27;m hooked! I received it yesterday and used it right away with amazing results. I&#x27;ve never really waxed either so I can&#x27;t say yet how long this amazing smoothness will last but so far I&#x27;m loving it. I know the manual says to only use on legs but I used on my arms too since I once shaved there and have had thicker hair than I&#x27;d like ever since. Well I feel like I have the skin of new born baby now!</li>
            <li> It is a little small for my hand but it is better than shaving, and with time hair takes more time to grow.&lt;br /&gt;I used epilator all my life but here in the US, mine (220v) didn´t work, so I needed a new one with 110v.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought an epilator in 15 years since my Satinelle finally bit the dust, so I was depressed when I had to buy another. This one shows the advancement in technology. Its light weight, does what it is supposed to do &amp; fits great in my tiny hands. I recommend it anyone that needs a well priced machine.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and works well. I chose a corded epilator specifically as I dont like dealing with batteries and recharging them.&lt;br /&gt;Been waxing for 15 years, and the results of using this epilator are equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lay down newspapers on the floor before epilating, so its an easy clean-up. Takes about 20-30 mins to get both legs and hands done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to always go against the hair growth, so, usually on hands the epilator goes side-to-side, on thighs it goes diagnally. So, always watch the direction of your hair. If you simply go up and down, then you will call for pain for sure.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To women who have never epilated before: This will be painful. Terribly, terribly painful. And for those who are brave enough to venture to their underarms: This will be tear-inducing painful. And to those who risk using this on your bikini line: You are a fool and I am envious of your bravery!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time, I was forced to do it in small shifts: A few strokes on the legs, then a break. Eventually, I got my legs and underarms finished. Keeping up with it is a lot less excruciating, but it is going well. This particular epilator seems to have about 15 sets of tweezers, which is a small area, really, so it is very time consuming and it does not get all the hairs the first time over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my underarms stay dark even after shaving, I was hoping this would help, but it still hurts so bad, I think I may have to go back to shaving them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this epilator is easy to clean and is a great size. The print on it is very beautiful!</li>
            <li> It really hurts, lives my under arms very very sore, it does not get the hair at all, my daughter try it but the same for her it didn&#x27;t do nothing.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, she loves it, does without say that it&#x27;s not painfree, but according to her, it&#x27;s pretty endurable.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed with the skin irritating head.</li>
            <li> This epilator is just great. Since it&#x27;s my first epilator, I didn&#x27;t want to spend so much money on it, so I made my decision and bought this one, that wasn&#x27;t expensive at all. Just in case I didn&#x27;t like it. But I tried it on Saturday and I loved it! My legs are so soft and it didn&#x27;t hurt so much, as I thought it would be. I suggest to use it in a well lightened place, because it&#x27;s easier to find those tricky hairs if you have enough light.</li>
            <li> strong tweezers do the work at an affordable price!!!!</li>
            <li> seems to be a gd product, my wife likes it, the only thing I observed is that its not rechargeable its just needs the plug to be hooked up all the time, of-course no where in the packing its mentioned as rechargeable, seeing the plug and wire we thought its a rechargeable one, nevertheless seems my wife is happy..</li>
            <li> Sometimes a product comes along that is so effective, that it deserves accolades. The Philips &amp;#34;Satinelle&amp;#34; epilator, (model HP6401) is very deserving of praise. It does what it claims to do and it does it very well. It permanently removes hair from the human body.&lt;br /&gt;As an American male of half Middle-Eastern - half Slavic blood, I have been blessed with thick black hair that grows out of most parts of my body...and now that I am entering my geriatric years, hair has been growing on parts of my body where hair does not belong. While dealing with trimming one&#x27;s eyebrows, beard and skull-top hair is easily done and acceptable barbershop routine, hair growing out of one&#x27;s nostrils and on one&#x27;s ear lobes, including the entrance to the hearing canal requires a more personal approach. The Philips epilator removes this unwanted hair with very little pain and with amazing precision....PLUS I get to do this in the privacy of my home.&lt;br /&gt;Before I purchased this device, I either had to individually pluck hairs with a tweaser or cut them with my Norelco three-headed razor. The plucked hairs were very difficult to target and the cut hairs simply grew back. This Philips epilator &amp;#34;cleans&amp;#34; these hairs for once and for all. Any future hair growth, which will occur, is easily attacked and solved.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, simply love it. I&#x27;m a veteran waxer, so there&#x27;s not much discomfort for me. I took very little time to get the hang of and works like a dream. Even if it breaks in two months (like another reviewer stated) it would STILL be totally worth it as I spend more than that getting waxed. And I&#x27;ve done nearly my whole body at this point (1 week of use)! I exfoliate on a regular basis anyway so ingrown hairs aren&#x27;t a real problem for me. Plus I follow up with a hair growth inhibitor lotion (I use Nisim Kalo or GiGi Slow Grow lotion). I use it every to every other day with great results!</li>
            <li> Is it possible to return it? My Braun epilator was much better...It does not clean well, the tweezers are flat.</li>
            <li> Was hoping to find a replacement for my Remington epilady, purchased a dozen years ago. This product does not work NEAR as well, and after the first 2 uses has a small crack in the head cover surrounding the tweezing discs.</li>
            <li> I like this goods.I bought it earlier in other country.I bought it again,because  I broken it. Good quality and best price for me.</li>
            <li> The size of this may be ok for a smaller person but I found it too small and challenging to hold. Worse, the &amp;#34;cap&amp;#34; (with the turning/rolling parts) comes off very easily and this morning one of the tiny prongs that holds the cap onto the base broke so now the product is useless. I would call this a design defect and suggest buying a different item. The cap needs to stay on while the devise is moved around pressed to you skin.</li>
            <li> I like this designed and tested even esoty esoty performance and reviewing their functions and so far I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> Love this. Have been looking for a good epilator for a long time. Philips did this right!</li>
            <li> Still works, immense pain at the beginning (bearable) now I feel no pain and in the sensitive areas of my body I feel an itch or tickle. Eliminates hair for long periods of time and grows back slowly and sparse. When this fails on my I shall invest in a more expensive, advanced epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone worried about in grown hairs I had a few at the beginning, which I plucked with some tweezers, problem never happened again.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth but if you have never wax or use one of these you may not like it. Try waxing first it&#x27;s cheaper if you can do that you&#x27;ll love this. My friend says it&#x27;s too painful. LOL</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!! Just what I wanted.So much better than the NoNo that quit working after a few months.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this it was horrible.  The pain was unreal.  I say this as someone that has a very, very high pain tolerance (giving birth, tattoos, didn&#x27;t bother me).  Then I realized I wasn&#x27;t moving the item fast enough.  Staying in one spot too long caused the pain.  So I got the nerve to try it again.  Perfect timing on my part.  If you move it quickly enough, the pain isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  It isn&#x27;t painless.  It&#x27;s ripping your hair out of the follicles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results, I am happy.  I&#x27;ve used this mostly on my legs.  I hate shaving.  The knee area, around the sides, and on the back of the knee are very sensitive.  However, everywhere else has been great.  I haven&#x27;t seen broken hairs, just a lot of hair gone.  After my first round, I had a little bit of redness that went away fairly quickly.  I also use washcloths in the shower that aren&#x27;t super soft, so they help exfoliate and keep me from getting ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the hair is too short, it will not work well.  That&#x27;s the only downside.  However, I know that after repeated use, the amount of hair that grows back will be less than it was before I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the guard that comes with it is purely for psychological reasons.  You can remove it, and it works just fine.  The epilating rotating wheel is not sharp and you will not cut yourself.  I use it without the shield.</li>
            <li> I waited 2 months to post a review for this, because I wanted to have some experience using the product before rating it. I&#x27;ve used it regularly for the 2 months to epilate from my ankles to my knees. I&#x27;ve found that the hairs have to be at least around 4mm for this thing to pick them up.  Shorter hairs just don&#x27;t get pulled. Additionally, longer hairs can break instead of coming out by the root, and then you are left with a hair too small for the device to pick up. My legs are never smooth after epilating because there are always some smaller hairs / stubble from breakage or just different growth cycle. I do get plenty of ingrown hairs which I have to pluck out with a tweezer as well, even though I exfoliate consistently with exfoliating gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I am now noticing much less hair growth than before. I will continue using this for the long term effects of lessening the amount of hair that grows.  However, I still have to shave after epilating to get the perfectly smooth skin that I desire.</li>
            <li> I looked at a ton of other epilators before buying this one. It is not cordless. It will only run while plugged in, buttttt the cord is super long and its not an issue at all. It is meant for your legs...an insurance thing I&#x27;m sure...but I&#x27;ve used it on my underarms as well and got fantastic results. Yanked all those suckers out by the root. Everything came brand new in it&#x27;s own box. Nothing shady. This definitely compares to the new Phillips epilator for $100. I rely so much on decent reviews to help me make a choice so I hope this helped.</li>
            <li> Ok. Not the best Satinelle but pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. I had different epilator that I had lost and it didn&#x27;t run as smoothly as this one does. I generally only use it on my forearms and legs, but by the way it feels, I&#x27;m tempted to try more sensitive areas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great investment instead of buying wax,razors all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! Bought this on another account.</li>
            <li> Owned 2 of these, both stopped working when the cord connection to the epilator started getting loose. Wouldn&#x27;t reccommend at this price.</li>
            <li> Very sleek. I really like it. Certainly something you have to get use to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Although it makes me xxxx,my legs are clear.</li>
            <li> I had a different brand that was 1/3 the size of this, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to do the job in 1/2 the time!</li>
            <li> Great first epilator!</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator so I am not really sure what to expect, this was one of the highest rated ones. I am pretty happy with it, it&#x27;s definitely cheaper than getting waxed and I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> Works  wonderfully. I have used others brands but this one is by  far the one with  higher performance.  Works even with very tiny hairs. Highly  recommend</li>
            <li> is perfect, but I really, it hurts a lot of pain, but the results are excellent, if anyone knows how to avoid pain tell me, I really need</li>
            <li> Cord breaks/stops powering device in a matter of months despite very little use.</li>
            <li> Definitely got most of the medium-textured hair on my calves. Had a harder time with the very fine hair on my thighs and arms. Did well on the courser hair of my bikini area and armpits, although the elasticity of the skin in those areas made this hard to use. Yes, the box says for legs only. It works fine for all of my body, but I really DO NOT recommend this for facial use.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t rip up my skin. While it did break some hairs, it works better than home waxing does for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does hurt. A lot. It took me a very long time to really do my body after a very painful experience doing just one leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be worth it though, since it has the benefits of waxing (slow to grow back in, less hair over time), without the mess and ongoing expense.</li>
            <li> Loved this product for the month it worked. Shaving was no longer necessary for the most part. But the connection between the cord and the epiliator has broken even after careful storage and use.  Disappointed. I like the price so may buy another but sorry it only lasted a month. I barely used it once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I originally started looking at the more expensive ones, but decided on this one because of the good reviews and the cost. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on one if I was never going to use it (since I have never epilated before and wasn&#x27;t sure how painful it would be). Well I love it, I have been using it for just over a month and I would say I&#x27;m addicted to it. The first 3-4 days were uncomfortable (the 3rd being the worst) but now it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;m not sure if the more expensive ones would be any less painful, but you are pulling your hair out so I think all of them would be painful to some extent. I use it mostly on my legs and my bikini area, I have tried my chin and my lip but it is a little difficult because of the size. I am currently looking for a facial one, so if I had to buy again I would buy one that had the attachments for your face. I like the fact that it is corded so I do t have to worry about having a good charge, the cord has been long enough for me to work with so it hasn&#x27;t been a problem so far. I would definitely recommend it for the price and I have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> plz don&#x27;t buy i hate this ,and painful too. plz don&#x27;t buy i used just one time i will use never ever again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever used an epilator. I can tell a big difference with the hair coming in as far as less often and softer so easy to pluck (around mouth/face) I haven&#x27;t used this on my legs just face but I like it quite a bit...it&#x27;s pinches some but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator thinking I&#x27;d be able to use it only on my legs. However, today I decided to give it a try on my bikini area and, to my surprise, I manage to epilate the whole area (really, EVERYTHING). I did this little by little, just like one eats soup: going from the outside a bit at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Did it hurt? More than shaving, obviously, but less than waxing. Really.&lt;br /&gt;For the legs, I thought it took a long time, and it didn&#x27;t take everything off. But it did an acceptable job, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I tried under my arms and it hurt more than I expected, and the area was a bit irritated afterwards. I&#x27;ll skip this area in future, sticking to my legs and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have too much hair, both my leg and bikini area don&#x27;t have thick hair. I&#x27;d think that for everyone with thicker hair, it would hurt more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to everyone who doesn&#x27;t have that much hair to remove and is tired of waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super impressed with this epilator.</li>
            <li> so far i love it. i use it after a shower or bath once a week and i have smooth legs in a short time vs waxing that took me 2 hours sometimes&lt;br /&gt;my hair is soft since i wax over 10 years so it does not hurt me anymore but Advil or glass of  wine recommended for beginners!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this epilator about two weeks ago to replace my recently broken emjoi emagine. Was very impressed with this product in comparison. This product seems much more effective at removing the hair although in my opinion it is more painful. My legs feel very smooth which never happened with the emjoi. They always felt stubbly. I used to have to shave daily and would experience hair growth by the end of the day. I can go at least a week with nothing noticable. It is also smaller and able to fit in my pits and bikini line well which the emagine couldn&#x27;t do. It also works faster which surprised me because its smaller and more lightweight. My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t have a light but that&#x27;s not really a big deal to me. My emjoi didn&#x27;t have one either. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and happy with the results of the product. What a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I sometimes have to go over my leg area twice, but overall it is a great product.</li>
            <li> i ordered this so i wouldn&#x27;t have to shave everyday especially with summer right around the corner and after reading everyone&#x27;s reviews i went ahead and ordered it but i have to say i wish i wouldn&#x27;t of wasted my money. it didn&#x27;t work at all like i thought it would, and in the little spots it did work it was really painful....so not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and sensitive skin, this is the only thing I have found that gets rid of those disgusting chin hairs completely without breaking me out.  It&#x27;s a little painful at first, but i got some numbing cream at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, and it helped alot! I just use that and a little aloe lotion when I&#x27;m done, and I haven&#x27;t broken out yet.  Plus they&#x27;re starting to come in lighter already and I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times.  It&#x27;s not for everyone, but if this thing ever quits, I&#x27;ll definitely buy another. So worth it to me</li>
            <li> Does a good job removing hairs, even those stubborn ones.  Works best if you exfoliate the day before and use talc power with salicylic acid (i.e.foot powder) just before.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve seen a ton of reviews on this specific epilator and although there are many good reviews, I&#x27;m only concerned with the bad ones. The bad reviews tell me if there&#x27;s something genuinely wrong with the product or if people are just whining about insignificant things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to start, ALL EPILATORS HURT! There&#x27;s no getting around that. This product is no different. This is something you simply have to acknowledge before buying it. For my first time using an epilator, I learned a valuable lesson rather quickly. You cannot run this thing over your body the same you would a washcloth. That will really REALLY hurt. It&#x27;s far better to work on small areas at a time. I&#x27;ve found that doing a centimeter at a time seems to work the best and is quite tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve personally found that this epilator works pretty well, so long as you take it slow and easy with plentiful breaks. Doing your legs may be an all night process your first time. But if you take it slow, the pain really isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. Just take it slow and easy. Slow and easy. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a couple of days, but I used it on my elderly mother, who I take care of.  It worked wonderfully, on her face, underneath her chin, where she has a tendency to grow a few old lady hairs. I&#x27;ve yet to try it on myself.</li>
            <li> Its great! Although the first time I used it, it was a little bit painful but don&#x27;t let that stop you as I can&#x27;t pain as well as others. After the first few uses I got use it and my legs are pretty smooth now thanks to this!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I read the instructions and tried a few times on different days to see if I just needed practice but to no avail.  Maybe others have had better luck but not this gal!</li>
            <li> Purchased this epilator because of the great reviews. I was extremely nervous to use it initially as I anticipated unbearable pain but I quickly got accustomed. I used it on my legs, underarms and my upper bikini line without problem, although the instructions state that is is really supposed to be used solely on legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m black and from the Caribbean and I have dark underarms. I was advised to wax instead of shaving to reverse this problem. I assumed epilating would be a good alternative as it really does remove the entire hair follicle. Enough time has not yet elapsed to see a marked difference but I have noticed a subtle difference from epilating in conjunction with the use of a glycolic peel on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review helps!</li>
            <li> it works great  and its very well built ,hopefully we get few years out of it ,good price as well&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> It does hurt but it&#x27;s a lot better than waxing and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I tried this to avoid plucking or shaving my chin and under my chin.  I am a woman, so having hairs there is NOT SEXY!  There were some that were blonde &amp; fine and some that were course and darker.  I hadn&#x27;t left the house in a couple of days in order to grow them out a bit to use this epilator.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator did not remove the hairs and gave me a strawberry on my chin.  I am returning it.  Don&#x27;t waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> It works well for me. I have been using this for over an year now and I have had no complains.</li>
            <li> Great for (Pain is bearable):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs&lt;br /&gt;Arms&lt;br /&gt;Chest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK for (Pain get&#x27;s rough):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stomach&lt;br /&gt;Bikini Area&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so great for (Beyond my pain tolerance):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Brazilian&lt;br /&gt;Face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try to use it in places with thick coarse hair, expect some pain and some bleeding.  If you have some thick hairs that are attached pretty well to your body, expect this to YANK them painfully several times before pulling them out.  You don&#x27;t want super long hairs when you epilate, so shave a few days beforehand.  This worked the best on my legs and arms.  This is not a good alternative to shaving your face, as you will bleed from every follicle.</li>
            <li> This requires patience, persistence, and a high pain threshold!  I have very thick black hair and did little patches at a time until I thinned my hair out enough to tolerate it.  I actually had to visualize myself in an interrogation situation and ask myself would I cave over some hairs being pulled out? That got me through, and I&#x27;m happy to report it no longer hurts at all.  BUT you have to stick with it or it will come back just as thick.  It gave me the worst ingrown hairs I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life but regular exfoliation as well as using an alpha hydroxy lotion every day durikng the first few months solved the issue. I&#x27;m sure people with lighter, thinner hair would have a much easier time using this product.</li>
            <li> This works! I&#x27;ve been using mine on my underarms (even though the directions clearly say to use on legs only.) I have very dark, very thick underarm hair, that is emphasized by my white as white can get skin.  And my underarm hair grows so fast I have to shave everyday, and even still it leaves behind a shadow.  So I was so excited to try this.  After the first use it took a week and a half, maybe almost two weeks, for my underarm hair to start growing back.  And the hair that did grow back is definitely finer and softer.  I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use the hair will get thinner and take longer to grow back.  It did take a while, though, to pull out all the hairs.  I epilated both underarms about three times a day for three days before finally getting nintey five percent of the hairs out. (I have a lot of hair, gross, I know.) But each of these sessions were only a few minutes long.  I&#x27;m sure I could have gotten all the hairs out in one session, but my arm was starting to go numb after holding it up for so long.  (I did find that if I laid on my bed and held my arm over my head, that helped keep the blood flowing and my arm from going numb.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of other reviewers said it hurts, and it does, but I thought the pain was totally manageable, and I&#x27;m terrified of just a little shot or blood work.  I also noticed that the pain was a lot less after the initial epilation.  If you can push through the pain, do it! I think it&#x27;s worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have two complaints. I wish the head was movable. It was hard getting the right angle to pull hairs out, and I imagine around ankles and knee caps it might be hard to reach hairs there too.  Second, now that some hair has started growing back, I&#x27;ve noticed that some follicles seem to grow hair back faster than others.  Not that this is the epilators fault. But if I want to wair for every follicle to grow back in, I&#x27;m gonna have to wait for my underarm to be thick and full of hair again. Otherwise I have to epilate a bit every day for a few days until I&#x27;ve pulled all of them out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this and will continue using it.  I think the price can&#x27;t be beat. A six pack of razors costs just as much!  It will easily pay for itself.</li>
            <li> it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this gadget works! I bought this particular one because it has the same number of 4 and 5 ratings as more expensive models. Now I see why: It is very effective at removing hair. In contrast to what the instruction sheet says, I had better results with longer hair (previously unshaven) than with 1/8 stubble. I did have to make multiple passes, but that doesn&#x27;t make your skin raw like multiple applications of wax will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the pain, that will probably be pretty bad for people who have never had their legs waxed or used an epilator before. I used the original Epilady in the 1980s and found it unbearable. Luckily, I have had my legs waxed many times in the intervening years, so this epilator was not painful for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do use it in an empty bathtub or over a towel, because you will shed lots of little hairs. Ick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After a while i think the cord broke inside, because i have to wiggle it to get continuous power, I think it need to improve the wires</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it!!  First time user and she did her legs and underarms with no problems in a little over an hour.  She tends to have a high pain tolerance (probably from putting up with me)  :)</li>
            <li> I have used epilators for many, many years.  I never have had to shave my legs since getting the first one.  The trick for me is never shaving again, just going back to the epilator when needed.  I got this one for a family member and she can&#x27;t wait to try it.  They are all painful, but you do get used to it with prolonged use.  It is worth it to get rid of porcupine legs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s made for armpits or not. But my armpits bleeds after using this. It was okay with legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting an epilator for a long time and I finally broke down and got this one. I used it on my feet the first day I got it and it worked very well! Then I decided to use it on my arms. It hurt a lot!!! But, I made it through and I would do it again. It hurts more than waxing, but you&#x27;re paying the same price for a one time waxing when you can use the epilator as often as you like. Its great if you can stand the pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She has a very old coil-style Epilady device which still works fine but is more or less torture to use on longer, thicker hair. After looking at the current products available she indicated the HP6401 seemed worth trying. She has used it several times and reports the pain-factor is minimum, especially compared to the Epilady. The only complaints are that it appears to sometimes cut rather than extract and that it doesn&#x27;t do well with very tiny hair, she has to go over the same area several times to get the job done. That said for the price it is working well for her.</li>
            <li> This is a good epilator. It just doesn&#x27;t last long. I had to replace it... or maybe I epilate too much?</li>
            <li> Best Epilator I have found!</li>
            <li> Really good this one. Its my first time using an epilator and was painful at the beginning but you get used to it. If you go fast on the areas, you will have to go over, I suggest you to go slowly to be sure and always do it after the shower, it will be less painful.</li>
            <li> this product really useful in plucking your unwanted hair&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t bleed your skin nor making a rash onto you skin.&lt;br /&gt;at first it was kinda hard to use just because i&#x27;m not familiar,&lt;br /&gt;buat the second use quite faster and not &amp;#34;that&amp;#34; hurting as the other says on their review</li>
            <li> Used it once and it hasn&#x27;t worked since. It&#x27;s dead, it won&#x27;t turn on regardless if it is plugged in or not. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does do the job but very painful. I have good pain tolerance but this was painful. If you can take the pain then I recommend as it does get rid of hair!</li>
            <li> Good for what it does. It is painful the first time, which does get better the next time. I found getting used to handling it helped and putting it on high. Couldn&#x27;t use it on facial hair, too big. They sell face epilators though. Sensitive areas hurt even worse. Epilating can cause ingrown hairs too.</li>
            <li> It cuts off hair instead of pulling out  at the  root. I had a battery opererated one from Emjoy for 10 years which I wanted to replace thinking of changing it to a newer improved  model.   this one has a chord but it does not work nearly half as well..... Also, there was no invoice in the box so I am having difficulty sending it back.When I called customer service they told me they could not send me a copy of the invoice in the mail This is a problem .Since my printer isn&#x27;t working; and they never sent me an original, I think this is very unfair. They offered to send me a new replacement but I do want this poor model. I will be purchasing another Emjoy in another manner.I never have had this problem with purchases on HSN or QVC.Customer Servive is now telling me that they cannot send me a copy of my original invoice WHICH WAS NEVER INCLIDED IN THE BOX!</li>
            <li> i hope this one will always be on the market.  i really love it.  it works great on the face, upper body and leggs.</li>
            <li> Works as described I had more expensive one and they were worse than this one, the taking off head to rinse feature is really good.</li>
            <li> I have been an emjoi brand user for about 15 years.  I have gone through 4 emjoi epilators.  I decided to give this epilator a chance and try something different.  I don&#x27;t have a major hair problem, since I have lasered most of my body.  From time to time I may need to touch up here an there and I use an epilator.  Here is what I noticed:  This unit is loud and rough.  When I say rough, I mean the blades leave your skin feeling sandy.  I used both my emjoi and this one together on the area and emjoi felt much softer against the skin with less noise.  Pain is not an issue with me, since I have epilated for so many years and lasered, but I have to say, this unit actually hurt at times. I was very surprised.  But overall, I decided to keep it as a back up just in case.  My main epilator will remain an emjoi.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator. It really worked nicely for me. It even works on short hairs with only two days of skipped shaving. The only place that it caused irritation was my bikini line, everywhere else was fine. It wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be either.</li>
            <li> I like the price and how easy it is to use it. However, it is a bit loud. I would still recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work the way I waanted..It hurts a lot and doesnt even pull hairs even after using it on same area for long time.</li>
            <li> So I bought the device, received it, plugged it in and glide it across my legs. Hair gone, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Used it before showering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had such great success with my legs, tried it with my armpits. Glide it across the armpit, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, but my armpit is starting to show redness. Doesn&#x27;t care, glides it across more armpit. My armpit is definitely red, and some parts of it is bleeding, but doesn&#x27;t hurt. If waxing hurts like a bitch, this one is like...not waxing.. doesn&#x27;t even come close, since you can control and only go on small areas if it does hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might as well go on my lady areas. Ok this one does hurt a lot. And the device did pull my skin a little but I controlled by going in small areas and zapping it off easily. I don&#x27;t have a lot of patience to do this yet, nor I dared to go through my lady areas in one full sweep like what I do with other areas, because it will hurt, but it does work, you just have to do it slowly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The skin does feel very soft afterwards. I even think it&#x27;s better than shaving since I always nick myself with the razor. I probably will epilate for the rest of my life, I don&#x27;t even mind investing in more expensive epilators now. I believe that people who have waxed before will be able to tolerate this easily, it feels like nothing especially on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I am bummed that I haven&#x27;t discovered this device sooner! Why did I do all those years of shaving for!</li>
            <li> Does a clean job with lesser pain.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She said it was like a really fast tweezer running over her legs but it got the job done after a couple run overs and her legs are amazingly smoother than using a razor on them.</li>
            <li> Ouch! This thing rips your hairs from your skin??!! I had to return. It seemed like a touture device to us.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this worked for the money. I was going to go with a more expensive model, but this one does the job. It hurts a little- but over time gets better&lt;br /&gt;Kristina</li>
            <li> after readng the instructions i realized i couldnt use it so returned it</li>
            <li> So I just bought this, and to be honest when I first turned it on, I was terrified! It&#x27;s very loud, and seeing the discs rotate was intimidating. I had to watch a youtube video of a girl using it to psych myself up again to try it. I just tried it and while it isn&#x27;t excruciating, it&#x27;s definitely uncomfortable. Kinda feels like tiny needles pressing into your skin. I think part of the problem was that my legs were reeaaaaallly dry. Also, I never waxed my legs before so that didn&#x27;t help either. Think I&#x27;m gonna try waxing, let the hair start to grow out and then try this again. I like the results it gives though! I checked the discs and it doesn&#x27;t break the hair off, it pulls it out by the root, which is fantastic! I was a little gun shy with it and didn&#x27;t press as close as I SHOULD have so some hairs didn&#x27;t pull out all the way. My advice? Exfoliate your legs, wax them, then once that hair grows out exfoliate again and then try this out. BE PATIENT. Don&#x27;t get frustrated and give up. This is very different from shaving, waxing, or hair removal cream. I think the more you use it the better and easier it&#x27;ll be :)</li>
            <li> Works with no problem.</li>
            <li> It doesnot remove small and thin hair. So u may have to shave or use another method on top of this to get rid of those thin hair</li>
            <li> I really like this epilator. Its affordable and simple. I like how it has two speed settings as well, although I&#x27;ve gotten used to the highest setting now and don&#x27;t have to use the lower one very much anymore. It fits well in my hand, and I have small hands. It sometimes irritates my skin if I don&#x27;t use the plastic protector on sensitive areas, and I accidentally broke mine, so be a bit careful. It can cause small cuts here and there. It does hurt at first but the more you use it the easier it gets. I have very hairy legs and my skin is quite sensitive so shaving is really bad for me. This product makes it so I don&#x27;t have to shave at all so I don&#x27;t get razor burn anymore. I still get occasional ingrown hairs though. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for your bikini area. I get a lot of ingrown hairs if I do the whole thing but it works well for the sides if you pull your skin tight and use the protector. Overall I&#x27;m really glad I bought this product. I would upgrade to a better product but get the same brand.</li>
            <li> better then i expected</li>
            <li> functional and as expected. wish it could be wireless and operated by battery</li>
            <li> It works. Haven&#x27;t had ir for long, so I can&#x27;t say much more than that. If it lasts I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to an epilator I guess, but I will never ever buy one again. It felt like tiny bee stings all up and down my leg. I hated it. I&#x27;d rather shave every day than try it again.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and packaged well. This is my first time using one of these. I can do everything except the most most sensitive area!  Ouch!  Works well,  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> If your a wussy you definitely won&#x27;t be able to use this.&lt;br /&gt;First time use is a lot more harsh than anytime after that so if you can make it through the first round it wont be nearly as bad the next time!</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this for the blond hair I have on my face. I tried to use this on my upper lip&lt;br /&gt;and it literally took my skin off. Be careful! Although the product works, it&#x27;s not meant for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;which I have. Just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Hair removal is never pleasant. I&#x27;ve tried every method except laser hair removal. Much against my unfounded fear of epilators, I decided to go for it. The main reason I chose the Philips HP6401 was the price. It&#x27;s small, compact and easy to hold. I can&#x27;t compare it to another epilator so here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preparing your skin by exfoliating is a must. Make sure your skin is dry. The epilator has two settings, and they both sound really scary. If the idea of tiny little tweezers yanking out your body hair at the same time, don&#x27;t look at the head for too long. Bring the tool close to an area of your skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive and just test it out slowly. The direction you&#x27;re supposed to go will come to you naturally. The process hurts while the hair&#x27;s being pulled out, but that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about this epilator is that you may have to go over the same spot twice or thrice. It&#x27;s also a lot messier than I imagined. The benefit is that it does pull the hairs out from the root so you&#x27;ll be hairless for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I have a wax warmer, I don&#x27;t see myself waxing since this tool is a lot quicker and less time-consuming.</li>
            <li> I used one of these before but this one seemed more painful to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to order it on amazon.com, it delivered so quick, earlier than it was supposed to. and I love the product in many ways it&#x27;s easy to use,the top is washable, and after using it once I&#x27;m happy of the result I use it mostly for my forearms and underarm. before I had Braun epilator for many years, they are just the same thing this is as good as Braun one and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It works!  And the price was right. I really like not having to shave everyday and this is easy to use.  The long power cord is a plus.</li>
            <li> this is my first epliator, and i love it. after trying shaving and then waxing to get smooth legs i ended up with this. my hair is coarse and grows incredibly fast - i was shaving everyday, and then waxing once a week, and would still have stubble! with the epilator i get longer lasting, MUCH smoother results. i&#x27;m very happy. :)</li>
            <li> It was ... an interesting experience.  Never used one before.  First off, yes, it f***ing hurt.  But it wasn&#x27;t anything unbearable like some people claim.  Those were probably the same folks that cried when they got their ears pierced. I would actually really like it except there are still random hairs on my legs it missed.  No matter how many times I went over it there are still those little bits there that never got picked up!  Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it lasts for a while I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it.  (Also took me over an hour to do the legs only)  Depends on how fast I have to do it again.  Bottom line, for my stupid hairy legs it might be a good thing.  Current opinion is &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;, if I have to do this and still shave to get the strays it&#x27;s not worth it to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it traumatize me?  Naw.  I&#x27;m a strong ass b*tch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it suck?  You betcha.</li>
            <li> Decent product. I&#x27;ve been a little disappointed in how it seems to shear off some of my chin whiskers and not yank &#x27;em out, but then, it says it&#x27;s for legs anyway. It does a great job on the peach fuzz, though, and it&#x27;s great on legs. Watch the video to get a better idea of how to get the most out of it. I&#x27;m not sorry I got it and I use it about every two weeks. It is kinda loud, though. Seems durable, easy to clean, nice little velour bag for packing.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work for me, caused a lot of inhair growth , also doesnt epilate well even after trying 2-3 times at the same area on my legs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my Emjoi epilator finally died after 8 years of loyal service. I had good results with it most of the time but there were issues with hairs breaking instead of being removed. However after about 8 months of use it developed a short somewhere in the cord so it only works if it is held in exactly the right spot. Supposedly it has a warranty but personally for the price I&#x27;ll just replace it.    Edit 9/27: I ordered a replacement for the one that shorted out after 8 months and after less than 2 months it has already developed a short in the cord. The epilator was handled with care and was used and stored correctly so there is no reason for a short to appear this soon. The price as also doubled in the past two months.     Save your money and avoid this faulty device. I ordered a new Emjoi to replace it since I know that it will be a quality product based on previous experiences.</li>
            <li> RETURNING THIS, NOT WHAT I WANTED, AND DESCRIPTION DID NOT SAY COULD NOT BE USED ON FACIAL HAIR.</li>
            <li> OK, I got this yesterday and used it once.  Here are my thoughts so far:&lt;br /&gt;I was a little afraid at first so I talked my 17 year old son into trying it on a spot on his leg (and before you think me a horrible person, I only tired it on him because my husband threatened me with bodily harm if I got close to him with it and I like the dog too much to even go there) and he said it did not hurt.  So to continue on, after an uncomfortable amount if stinging (not really pain) my legs are fairly hairless.  I can see how it would take a few times to get all the hairs as some do break and the machine does not get the shorter hair.  The most painful part was the shins, which was completely unexpected since I thought it would have been the softer areas.  The redness went away after about an hour and I am going to try again on the hairs it missed in a few days.  So far I am pleased and hope it continues to work!</li>
            <li> it works, but like others say, cord dose not seem to last for some reason. mine broke in only 2 months of using.</li>
            <li> If you are a wimp- don&#x27;t even bother. It definitely hurts! But to someone who shaving daily, hates waxing, and doesn&#x27;t have luck with hair removal creams, the pain is worth it to me! I recommend this to all my friends but most cannot endure the pain. It only hurts when it actually pulls the hair out, doesn&#x27;t sting afterwards like waxing. Be careful not to push onto the skin. Just go lightly, &amp;#34;hover&amp;#34; over the hair or you will get bad razor burn. I tried it on my boyfriend and he couldn&#x27;t handle it. I however use it on my legs, bikini area, and arm pits. I only use it in the bikini area or armpits when I feel brave enough. Actually pulls hair from root. It gets three stars because it hurts when the hair is pulled and doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, but gets most.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering of these hurt, then take tweezers and pluck hairs out.  It will feel just like that but several at a time!  Of course!  I&#x27;ve used it three times and starting to get used to it.  Definitely have to exfoliate a lot, had quite a few ingrown hairs, but hoping that will get better with time</li>
            <li> From what this was described as and reading the material that came with the packaging of this product I&#x27;ve found it to work quite well, even just to start! This is my first time using one if these and it seems to work pretty decently. Yes I had to go over spots repeatedly but it&#x27;s not the fault of the product but my skin/hair... However one issue though is there is nowhere for the extracted hair to go aside from all over :-/</li>
            <li> Only used it ones , but up to now seems great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this stuff for my wife and she loves it more then waxing.</li>
            <li> worst thing i ever bought in my entire life, it caused me so much pain! beware of the pain</li>
            <li> I bought them for the chest area. Very bad idea. It is very painful and the skin gets irritated with red dots lasting weeks to go away. Apparently when they say that it&#x27;s only for legs there is a  reason, my fault anyway</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but nothing special...use only on legs.</li>
            <li> have one for the last 10 years it quit on me so I ordered me this one, can&#x27;t be without it. use it about ones every 2 or 3 weeks, no more razors for me!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I want and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews for this and several other ones. I went with this one and man am I happy I did. I used this and found it works very good. I then waited and waited to see when the next time I needed to use this and it turned out to be over one week. I then used it again and worked great. I have noticed that using this is so much easier than using a disposable razor ( I don&#x27;t seem to cut myself with this and almost always around the knee and ankles). The cord is nice and long so I do not need to hover over the outlet. I will purchase this again if something happens. I love I do not need use very often and that is a plus when you are busy with working over 12 hours a day.</li>
            <li> *EDITED BELOW* I have to say that I really like this. My husband had a gift card for Amazon and i&#x27;ve been wanting to try an epilator, but it had to under $50 so I decided to get this one. The price is great. I just received it today, shipping was really fast (got here before any of the other items we ordered).    I opened the package, put it together (with the cap), read the instructions and decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s really easy to use, but I was only able to get half of one of my legs completed because I did a really terrible job of half-shaving the other day and the hair is kind of long on different areas. On the longer parts it did hurt quite a bit more, so I definitely recommend shaving a day or two before you use this so that the hair is not too long - but the parts that were just short stubble were fine. I was intimidated by the sound and the rotating tweezers and was honestly scared to put it to my skin, but once I did, it really wasn&#x27;t bad and I got used to it pretty quickly. It&#x27;s more uncomfortable than actually painful, in my opinion.    It&#x27;s been two days since I tried it and that one part of my leg is still smooth. That may not seem that exciting, but normally after shaving, my legs are prickly again the same day so that is a huge plus for me. Even if I have to do this once a week (which hopefully it will last longer), it will still save me a ton of time.    ///EDIT: 3 Weeks after I tried this, I had tons of ingrown hairs on the lower part of my legs. I only used it on clean, exfoliated skin, and exfoliated in between the times of use and growth so I&#x27;m not sure why this happened. So I am not using it on my lower legs anymore. But it is still a lifesaver for my upper legs (which are very sensitive &amp; prone to razor burn) and my bikini area (Yes... I DID go for the Brazilian). It hurt like H#%* the first time, but since that one time all I have to do is go over it all once every two and a half weeks (takes maybe 10 minutes) and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all anymore because it&#x27;s growing back so slow and it doesn&#x27;t all grow at the same rate for some reason. The one painful time has been SO worth it.. I&#x27;m LOVING IT! It&#x27;s SO much easier to just have to go over my lower legs in the shower and i&#x27;m done. No more razor bumps, NO paying for waxing, and i&#x27;m sure that my husband is appreciating me not complaining about &#x27;not feeling sexy because I haven&#x27;t shaved&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read a review from a man that bought a few, tested them out (on himself) and said this one was the best.  I was tired of shaving daily and couldn&#x27;t afford waxing. I love it, best buy yet!</li>
            <li> Works great. Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better. I just didn&#x27;t know I would have to have it plugged up for it to work. But completely worth it for how well it works !</li>
            <li> Ok so, I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now and I wanted to wait and use it more than a few times before posting my review. Here is my verdict: the result is not worth the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me explain: I have very thin hair and not an awful lot (I am Caucasian and used to waxing if that information helps). I thought the epilator would be a nice alternative to waxing and a more long term solution than shaving. I am new to epilators so I don&#x27;t know if my expectations were unrealistic, but it took me a million passes to get rid of all the hair in a small area in my leg while hurting all the time. And yes, pain is perfectly tolerable and it does get better after the first use, but not worth it if the hair is not going to be removed! Waxing hurts, but at least after two seconds of pain you see immediate results. With this, it hurts for a longer time and it doesn&#x27;t work half as well. So I don&#x27;t see the point. Also my skin was very irritated after the first time, but that got a little better too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use it on my legs only as a &amp;#34;helper&amp;#34; to shaving, so that it removes at least some hair and I don&#x27;t need to shave so much... But still not convinced. I have been unable to use it for my armpits at all because it hurt without getting any visible results.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! So much better than waxing and it works.</li>
            <li> Very painful and not all of my hair was removed.</li>
            <li> does not work well at all. Have had for a few weeks and misses more hair than it pulls out!</li>
            <li> This product does work as intended, epilating hairs and pulling them out. It does not get every hair on a single pass. Unfortunately, this was my first epilator, and I used it only on my chest, and it proved to be extremely painful. It was tolerable for a while, however, because it does not get every hair on the first pass, I found myself going over the same spot multiple times, which caused the skin to get very sensitive, and eventually became too painful to do over that single spot anymore. I did epilate twice, about 4 days apart. Coming back the second time, the skin was still very sore and made it difficult to use this product again. After epilating the same spots as the first time, I decided to give the skin on my chest a break and see if any hair grew back. While it may seem slightly thinner/lighter hair growth in the areas I used the epilator on, there was still hair growth there and it still required me to shave. After seeing the less than desirable results of two very painful epilating sessions, I decided not to use this product a third time.</li>
            <li> It does the job. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months, and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased the epilator after hearing people talk about it on YouTube.  I chose this one mainly because of the price.  It is the only epilator I&#x27;ve tried so I have nothing to compare it to.  First impression...holy cow it hurts! With that said, it&#x27;s kind of supposed to hurt because it&#x27;s pulling your hair out from the root.  The product gets no points deducted for that, I just wanted to mention it because I was expecting it to hurt less.  With that said, after a few minutes of using it, you get either used to or numb to the pain.  I&#x27;ve heard that the more you use it the less it hurts.  If you have waxed in the past it will also hurt less.  I thought this product worked GREAT on my underarms.  I let the hair grow out for a couple days before using it the first time and it had no problem grabbing onto the hairs.  I also tried using it on the legs where it had a harder time grabbing onto them.  I have fairly thin soft hair on my legs, even after letting it grow for a few days (same amount of time as my underarms) and I found that the product did not get all the hairs and I felt like I still needed to shave. I went over the same area many times, slowly, quickly, trying to get them and it didn&#x27;t realy work.  It might work better if I let it grow out even longer, but honestly who wants to let their leg hairs grow out??  I didn&#x27;t try using this on the bikini area yet, too scared!!!  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Did not pull any hairs out, I had to use over and over with no success. I had bought other that really worked good. should have order those again. I thought they are all the same tu they are not,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to make this review seem too personal or sound like a \\&quot;personals\\&quot; ad, but since this device is used on very \\&quot;discreet\\&quot; parts of the body I might as well disclose all the gritty details. First, let me give a little background history on my experiences with hair removal in general. For anyone who wants to know, I am an African-American female on a quest to find a mechanical contraption or formula that will remove body hair effectively and efficiently. The hair on my body tends to be rather thick/coarse/dark in certain areas such as the armpits, the \\&quot;happy trail\\&quot;, and of course the forbidden pubic area. Areas where the hair tends to be more fine are the arms and legs. In the past, I have subjected myself to typical methods of hair removal i.e. (cream depilatories, waxing, and of course shaving). Out of all those options the most hated is shaving, somehow I always end up nicking myself or dealing with constant in-grown hairs. With cream depilatories I often experienced some adverse chemical reaction and with waxing, well, its f@#!ing painful, but probaly the most swift and effective method I&#x27;ve used. However, I have never in my entire life heard of a contraption called an \\&quot;EPILATOR,\\&quot; so this is my first introduction/purchase of an epilator. So you can call me an epilator virgin, but unfortunately I&#x27;m not entirely satisfied with my first time. So let&#x27;s get down to the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive  (most epilators are marketed at a very high price point)&lt;br /&gt;- Light-weight (even though I have never used an epilator, I just know from personal preference that I do not want to work&lt;br /&gt;  with a device that is heavy or awkward.)&lt;br /&gt;- Minimal Pain (There was not much discomfort experienced while using this product, but I will admit that the discomfort&lt;br /&gt;  intensified while using on more sensitive areas such as the underarms, torso, or pubic area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ineffective on areas where the hair is thick/coarse/dark. (It took several passes to remove coarser hair.)&lt;br /&gt;- Broken Hairs (Some of the hairs were broken and not removed from the root at all, especially when using on areas with&lt;br /&gt;  denser hair growth. Fine Hair: 75% removed 25% broken ; Coarse Hair: 55% removed 45% broken&lt;br /&gt;- The cleaning brush advertised with the product in the instruction manual did not come with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I can tell that this product is probably best used for legs only or areas where the hair is NOT dense/coarse. After reading the instruction manual, I noticed that it is recommended that this product is to be used only on the legs and nowhere else, but obviously I want this product to be effective everywhere not just my legs. Today I still use cream depilatories on my legs that is formulated for sensitive skin and I&#x27;m okay with using just that, but my sole purpose for buying this product is to use it for underarm hair and the infamous \\&quot;happy trail.\\&quot; Overall, I&#x27;m not 100% satisfied, I will use the product a few more times and give an update, but if I&#x27;m not entirely happy with this product I will definitely take advantage of the 45 day full money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> just like the one i was looking, it works perfectly fine and doesnt leave hairs behind, the people who is looking something that doesnt hurt let me tell you that it doesnt exists but is a pain you can handle.</li>
            <li> This changed my life! I no longer use veet hair removing cream because it&#x27;s so messy. This might take longer but the results last longer and he&#x27;s easy to do. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is after a while it seems to not remove hair as well but still works great. I use it to remove hair pretty much anywhere. Love this thing!</li>
            <li> This product worked great as far as I could tell. But just a warning, it&#x27;s not made for underarms or anything else. The directions said legs only, which is why I returned it. But if you&#x27;re looking for a product that works for your legs and is cheap, this will work for you. I ended up buying a nice expensive Epilator so I could do my full body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first electronic body shaver so I don&#x27;t have rich experience for comparison. The positive part for it is that you won&#x27;t feel hurt when you shave. To me that&#x27;s enough. So overall I like it.</li>
            <li> Have been using one of these for years, the old one broke, after many years. This one works really well and has minimum pulling sensation.</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be cordless but it doesn&#x27;t work without the cord!!! Disappointed... Very disappointed... It does look nice but still disappointed...</li>
            <li> Yep..takes every hair out of its roots... when I don&#x27;t feel like waxing I use it.. and amazing results. ..you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference. ...</li>
            <li> This does the job, you have to clean it alot but it&#x27;s great for  price</li>
            <li> I used it for places that I&#x27;ve waxed before or places with really fine hair/peach fuzz. It works great and hardly feel any sort of pain. The most painful was the bikini area because I have thick hair there and it just tugs on it. It&#x27;s extremely painful. It takes several passes to completely remove the hair. It might take some getting use to since that area is sensitive but I&#x27;d rather go back to waxing.</li>
            <li> best decision i have ever made! and the cord is super long which is a plus ! :D</li>
            <li> My wife said &amp;#34;It hurts if not applied properly but fits the purpose&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> in hte description on amazon it says it is for all over the body not just the legs but the package it self says just for the legs.  it works fine everywhere else.  obviously it will hurt.  in the beginning use it in stids don&#x27;t think you can do all the area at once as first.  after abput a month it i could use it in all the areas in 1 sitting.  this was my first epilator and i have enjoyed going hairless for longer despite hte pain at first.  some hairs to break off instead of getting plucked, mostly on the legs ironically.</li>
            <li> much better than shaving or other alternatives. Does a really good job of removing unwanted hair from your body.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product if you don&#x27;t have the time for waxing and sugaring and all its costs.</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator, I love the way this works its smooth and am a tough gal so yeah it doesnot hurts me. Over all good looking compact product , however I end up giving them 4 pts as they forgot to send me a cleaning brush which is mentioned as a part of product.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Does the job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this, having never epilated or done any sort of waxing before, because it was inexpensive and I wasn&#x27;t so sure I would be committing to having my leg hairs ripped out on a long-term basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s...fine.  Gets the job done.  For me, it hurt like the dickens the first time I did it and I wanted to cry like a baby, and I tend to have a high tolerance to pain.  I&#x27;ve since done it consistently once a week, and both times after the first it has definitely been more tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, now that I do think I will stick with this method of hair removal, I might upgrade to something else to see if it is more efficient.  This does take a bit of time, going over the same area, and hasn&#x27;t quite succeeded in getting all hair, although it does get most.  I have pretty fine hairs, so it may just be me.  I won&#x27;t know unless I try a different epilator, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price, it works well enough.  For a novice, it would be a good first epilator to purchase.</li>
            <li> i had a phillips epilator  before this one and it seemed stronger but this one does the job it is smaller than my previous model</li>
            <li> I used the same Epilator for a while this one is my second and I tried other brands  before that one is the best ever.</li>
            <li> I had never used an epilator prior to buying this Phillips.  My biggest gripe with this product is that it misses too many hairs.  I feel like I can sometimes make a dozen passes over a small patch of skin with visible hairs of a length that should be perfect and the hairs are still left standing.  I&#x27;ve tried using it both with and without the include guard with the same results.  The product just doesn&#x27;t seem to do what it is supposed to do.  For that reason, I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have used it for several months now, and it works great. Never used a more expensive one, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine they could work much better than this.</li>
            <li> This is a whole bunch of NO. Just say no. I would not recommend this for anyone besides my worst enemy. It&#x27;s not for removing hair. It&#x27;s for torturing prisoners at Guantanomo. It seriously missed about half the hair no matter how many passes and attempts to stand the hair up straight so it all catches. Tried to get rid of some stomach and chest hair. I did about half my stomach and just tried various other spots to see if it would do anything. It leaves a lot behind that simply can&#x27;t be caught with the auto tweezers but what it does rip out hurts so much it&#x27;s unbelievable. Within seconds I had massive amounts of sweat dripping out of my arm pits, face bright cherry red dripping sweat, clinched my teeth so hard I thought they were going to break and after a couple minutes my legs felt too wobbly to stand, got light headed, blurred vision and felt the need to lay down. My lips went numb as well like I had that feeling of spider hole face where you can&#x27;t open your mouth and your lips kinda feel all tight like your spider hole... I guess this is what happens when someone&#x27;s body goes into shock..? I am not sure but the experience was unforgettable. This product is useless as a hair removal device but amazing as a torture device. Whoever came up with this invention is very sadistic to say the least. Within minutes the areas where it tore the hair out became super inflamed and red, caused open wounds large enough to bleed. Now to be clear, I am no city boy hipster that can&#x27;t take pain. I work hard all the time pushing my body to the limit and don&#x27;t shed a tear when injured but this had me in total submission mode. It says to only use on completely dry skin, but it doesn&#x27;t mention you&#x27;ll sweat to profusely that it&#x27;s completely impossible. Had to take a second shower. I may have actually lost weight in the process. All the clinching probably made my abs better. That is a plus. If you can handle this thing, you&#x27;re one tough feller. After doing this, all I can think about aside from my own mind bending pain is how on earth does a girl do this to her downstairs?? I thought about drinking to see if I could finish but unfortunately it was day time and I had driving to do....darn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this epilator for about a year now and I can say it really gets the job done every time I use it. The reason why I&#x27;m writing this review though is because in the past 2 months, the cord has been failing and now every time I epilate, it stops frequently and I have to fiddle with the cord until electricity can flow through it again. Since then I haven&#x27;t enjoyed my epilating sessions because it now takes 40 minutes to do my legs, half of which that time is f**king around with the cord to make it work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIL: the cord it comes with is crap. I know amazon sells after market AC adapter cords for these things so I might just do that.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot of good things about epilators, and decided to give one a try as the hair removal is supposed to last a big longer than shaving. I was very disappointed. This product was very painful to use and I couldn&#x27;t even complete a single leg before giving up in pain. I can&#x27;t even imagine using it in more sensitive areas. It&#x27;s also louder than I expected. As for hair removal, it would have required going over the same spot a few times to get everything, and I most certainly didn&#x27;t want to keep reliving that.</li>
            <li> Great product, it tends to hurt but leaves the skin smooth</li>
            <li> Simple and efficient, very good.&lt;br /&gt;Painless for me that was used to wax.&lt;br /&gt;Just forgot tho check that this is not cordless</li>
            <li> it works like a charm but holy crap it hurts like hell!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a single wax job, and far lower maintenance than shaving.  I&#x27;m new to epilators, but I&#x27;ve done home waxing and threading before.  This does seem relatively low pain - on the legs where my hair is relatively fine, no worse than trying to shave with a scratchy razor.  The underarms were killer - remember to pull skin taught, and consider a wax job to get you started.  I&#x27;m going to guess that because my underarm hairs are coarse, and I have some multiple-haired follicles there, it was a tougher job.  It probably has everything to do with your hair&#x27;s texture and growth patterns.  I ventured to try on my chin/lip area, and it worked well, there too.  Hair doesn&#x27;t have to be long, maybe try this a week or so after your last shave for the least discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;My first pass did miss some spots, so the next day, I laid a towel out in a well-lit area to do more cleanup.  I wound up doing my arms the second day because I&#x27;m so satisfied with the effect.&lt;br /&gt;As with any hair removal, be sure to exfoliate - I used a gentle glycolic acid scrub before, applied witch hazel toner after, and plan to exfoliate again in the next few days.</li>
            <li> Very good! however my hair is very thin and sometimes I realized it doesn&#x27;t do a good job with thin hair...but still recommend! takes more time to hair grow compared to shaving legs!</li>
            <li> Although compact and thin, this epilator packs a punch and does what it promises to do...remove hair flawlessly. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. It does everything it promises to do and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Stuck between useful, very clean</li>
            <li> It hurts, but it works.</li>
            <li> It hurts and does not solve the purpose. Not sure why this product is even made. Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> First off, I am a man who also bought this for his first epilation session, so I can&#x27;t compare it to any other epilators, but it hurts less than waxing and tattoos.  Just received it started right away.  I knew that it was going to be painful by reading multiple reviews so I was not surprised.  I used it on my calves and thighs and was not as painful as I thought. Oh, I forgot to mention I have tattoos on my legs.  Only hurt enough for me to stop when it was going through bunches of hair, but I went over it a second time and it didn&#x27;t hurt as much.  I had the epilator on setting number 2 and it hurt me less than setting number 1, which is slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 because it leaves many short hairs that I need to go over, but it does take it out after the second run. Overall, really satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very light. Easy to use. Better than the rechargable type because this one doesn&#x27;t stop working! The other ones died before I finished shaving &amp; then it was HOURS until it was recharged enough to continue. They don&#x27;t work while charging either. This one was cheap as well! Bonus! I wish I had bought this one years ago.</li>
            <li> I liked but it is not so powerful. Some hairs are still on the skin after using it. And it is a little bit noisily.</li>
            <li> To small to actually pluck anything, but can still cause pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before, but I really do like this one.  It definitely does pull the hair out.  I found that it didn&#x27;t cause much pain on my legs and did seem to get almost all of the hair.  I feel like it never does get all of the hair, but it gets most of it.  I like the way that it makes my legs look more &amp;#34;uniform&amp;#34;, meaning that the pores on my legs aren&#x27;t as dark because there is not dark hair left in the follicles.  The only way that I wish it could be a bit better is if it got all of the hair on the first go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note, I did use this product on  my under arms and wow, did it hurt!  However, I was determined to make my armpits look better (I was always so embarrassed to wear tanks or sleeveless dresses in the summer) and this has really helped.  They look tons better and the hair has definitely grown back less thick and it&#x27;s much less painful the second time around.</li>
            <li> I had never used an epilator before, had never even heard of epilating until about 24 hours before I purchased this epilator. I am SO GLAD I did. Yes it hurts, you&#x27;re ripping your hair out by the roots, it&#x27;s gonna hurt. However, once you get through it once, you don&#x27;t have to epilate (or shave) again for another 2 weeks! When the hair does eventually grow back it comes in sparser and finer, so it&#x27;s easier to epilate it the next time and even easier the next. SO worth it. I love mine. I&#x27;ve been converting all of my family and friends to epilating instead of shaving (which is annoying and it grows back way fast) or waxing (which is hot, hurts, iffy on how well it works, and gets everywhere). I love this epilator. I&#x27;ll use it until it dies and then I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this one, I&#x27;ve had other epilators before, but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to want to harm hairs, or maybe it&#x27;s shortsighted, you have to go over the same hair a few times before it will make up its mind about whether it wants to get rid of the hair for you. Lame.</li>
            <li> I received the Philips HP6401 Satinelle Epilator without a brush! It works but it is so noisy! Anyway it works!</li>
            <li> I have to confess, I didn&#x27;t even know such a thing as this existed until about an hour before I bought it. It was an impulse buy that I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for. When I used it for the first time, I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading other reviews, I was a nervous about how painful this would be, because I&#x27;m a Grade A wimp. Again, I was pleasantly surprised. I would describe the feeling as an unpleasant nettling sensation that occasionally veers into the territory of bee sting-painful in sensitive areas like the inner thighs. As other reviewers have said, this is perhaps not the most efficient Epilator out there (though I can&#x27;t speak from experience on that, as I&#x27;ve never used another). I do have to go over the same area sometimes 3 or 4 times before all the hair is gone, so it ends up taking 15-20 minutes to finish both legs. However, it has been a week since I used it and my legs are still silky smooth! This is a huge improvement over having stubble 2-3 days after shaving. In my mind, that&#x27;s worth the extra time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the directions specify, I exfoliate before I use this (though usually just a couple minutes before, not the couple days the instructions recommend). So far, I&#x27;ve had no problem with in-grown hairs or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the cleaning brush is not included. I don&#x27;t really know that&#x27;s it&#x27;s necessary. The head pops off easily and it&#x27;s not hard to run it under water or blow on it to get the hair out. I will say that the head doesn&#x27;t feel terribly secure. Occasionally it pops off while it&#x27;s running. I don&#x27;t see this as a big problem, as the same thing used to happen with my old electric razor. Maybe I just like technology with a personality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a useful product that does what it advertises at a fraction of the cost of its competition.</li>
            <li> Works great, hurt like a B**** the first time I used it- but the more you use it the less it hurts. Way easier than shaving in my opinion. The hair grows back slower and lighter eveytime.</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW!!!!  This product is amazing.  It’s been a few months since I bought it and i am sure this will be my go-to product for my under arms.  The first time I used it, it hurt… but not as bad as I thought it would.  The second time, I got smart and used it just as my hairs were coming in, soooooo much better the second time around, less pain, less hair, less effort.  Now my hair grow in finer and less than before.  At least my underarms are smooth for a month plus.  I tried it on my southern region; didn’t go so well.  The hair came out form the root but when it healed It left with scars ): it looked the same way as if I shaved.  My verdict underarm only.</li>
            <li> I used a razor before I bought this one. This pinches a little but that&#x27;s what its supposed to do !&lt;br /&gt;It works perfect on any parts of your body. I tried using on my belly where I have fine little hair. I had smooth soft body after using this. You have to use it at a proper angle to pull the hair. It may need some practice. I dint find it very loud.&lt;br /&gt;I am 5ft 6 in tall with really long and pretty hefty legs. It takes lot of time to work on my legs with this product. If you are tall I suggest you may consider buying a one with more blades which will work faster.&lt;br /&gt;But I found this is a good product for its price and works fantastic !</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for more than 20 years. I have had 2 epilators and have been very satisfied but time does take it&#x27;s toll. I did read the reviews prior to choosing Philips. i have found it to to be painless with an occasional tug on the stubborn chin hairs. My arms look clean and feel smooth.I no longer have in-grown hairs from using a liquid hair remover. The motor is powerful for all body hair (careful not to get scalp hair). A few more times and I should be hairless for 4-6 months.  I&#x27;m glad I chose Philips Epilator, it was reasonable priced, arrived quickly with all needed parts and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice on the legs and once on the face. I do not recommend this product for the face because of it&#x27;s size and ripping off too much skin instead of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I pray that all the reviews are correct in stating you get used to the pain. I can&#x27;t imagine.&lt;br /&gt;So to recap, my review.......Torture device!&lt;br /&gt;After I use it a few more times I will try to come back here &amp; update the review.</li>
            <li> Love it, works fast and great. And For a great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this little machine and absolutely I loved!  You Must try to see the results! Every skin is diferent.&lt;br /&gt;The first time that I used was a little bit irritation but after nothing of that just a little bit pain! But nothing to worry about it.</li>
            <li> First I wish it worked after the first time because my girls seem to epilate EVERY DAY NON-STOP. The noise is grating but my girls love the results and the feel of their skin afterwards and SWEAR by it. Teenage vanity-humfh. This was cheaper than wax kits and laser hair removal so I still win. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This was the epilator I chose to buy based on all the reviews and I&#x27;m pretty impressed!! I looked epilators up for quite a while before settling on this one and was convinced this would be the way i could remove my pesky dark underarm hairs and it was great! Worked well and was as painful as I expected it to be. I can&#x27;t say this method will ever become painless because come on, it is a rotating blade of a bunch of tweezers plucking out every single hair, but the pain does become insignificant after a while!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw a review saying that this was the best epilator of all the epilators this person has tried. That is such a lie. This product did not work. It did not pull out all of the hairs. I have very average hairs on my legs and thicker hairs on my armpits and pubic area. I grew my leg hair out a bit so the tweasers could catch it and I ran the epilator over my legs about ten times per area. There was allot of pain with little result. It only pulled out about a quarter if the hairs and just ripped the tops off another quarter. I would rather just shave. I thought with all that pain it would at least get a good bit of the hairs. Also I got red bumps and irritated skin everywhere from all the tugging but not pulling out.&lt;br /&gt;  I tried my armpits and that was awful. It just tugged the hairs verrrrrryyyyy painfully and didnt pull them out. It doesn&#x27;t have enough power and when I look at the tweasers the ends don&#x27;t even line up perfectly like good tweasers should. They remind me of dollar store tweasers.&lt;br /&gt;  Save your money and buy the expensive epilator. It&#x27;s worth it. This one is junk. I tried it multiple times all with horrible results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Emjoi and Epilady epilators in the past and when my Emjoi died, I decided to try Philips HP6401 Satinelle. I don&#x27;t know how or why (because they all do the same thing, pull the hair out by the root) but the Philips HP6401 Satinelle seems to work better than my Emjoi or Epilady. It seems to be less painful (almost no pain) and seems to do a better job of getting the hair at the root instead of breaking the hair and leaving the root, AND it gets more hairs per pass so I&#x27;m smooth and hair free much faster. I wish I&#x27;d purchased one of these years ago.</li>
            <li> It leaves some small hairs behind, but not many. Overall good, it leaves my legs much smoother than using a razor, and for longer.It does hurt on the ankle area and on the back of the leg (calf) but other than that, its good. Takes longer than waxing, but its cheaper than it. So I will continue to use this product, it may take up to 30 minutes to get my legs done, but its worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the second eppilator I used, so I have something to compare to. I am about to purchase the second one after having it for over a year. The only reason I need a new one is because I dropped mine on the tile floor and it no longer pulls out my hair add it did before. I eppilate all areas that I don&#x27;t want hair, including private area. I love this machine! It pulls all the hair out very consistently. My hair can be coarse in some areas but the machine does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to address all the negative comments. I think some people did a good job explaining why this product hurts and why it may not. It works well for me because I have either waxed or eppilated my hair for years. I can&#x27;t wax anymore because it&#x27;s a waste of money. I don&#x27;t have enough hair to wax. The machine does a great job for lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying a second one and can&#x27;t wait to receive it. It will be torture to shave until I get my new machine.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this epilator! It is a great price and does the job. I have thin hair in my legs and it removed all of them, including hair in my knee. It didn&#x27;t hurt like some people wrote. I wish I got this sooner!!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Great price for a great little gadget.  I bought it to replace a previous one from another brand.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It works very fast and effective. It does hurt a little. The price is good.</li>
            <li> It is horrible, hurts terribly, and DOES NOT work properly. I even shaved first wait a day then use this, my razor works much better. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and very good hair remover and I have tried them all.  It works fast and is thorough.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This item is not safe!</li>
            <li> I have only used once but it cannot work this morning. When I used it, i feel hurt.</li>
            <li> returned it. didn&#x27;t really pull out my hair.</li>
            <li> A little painful but no worse than waxing. I may have to get a little waxing for the very sensitive area but the rest is all good. Works great on under arms and bikini area have not tried the legs yet. I suggest having someone help you for the under arms if possible I&#x27;m not flexible so it&#x27;s a little difficult to pull the skin taught.</li>
            <li> Although it is less powerful, I like it because it is lighter than my previous Emoij one. Also the input for the adapter is 110-250V which works also in Europe or other places, not like my previous one.</li>
            <li> honestly. What am I doing wrong? Why is it that a day after, my legs feel prickly? I get better results from shaving where I actually feel smooth for at least three days. Am I not putting enough pressure? Is my diet making me grow hair faster than normal? Idk! But I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for my underarms. It doesn&#x27;t quite pluck it which Is what I wanted. All it does for me is trim it and that is a no Bueno for me :( (but it&#x27;s fine since the box said this was meant for legs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone can tell me how to properly epilate without havingn to wake up with prickle legs, that would be great!</li>
            <li> I  am very satisfied with my new epilator, I really love it, it is not as painful as other epilators. Very easy to use. I recomend to buy this one.</li>
            <li> can never be without this, I can&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t tried one sooner.</li>
            <li> Mainly used for under arm. It hurts for the first couple of times but gets better. Now I hardly notice it. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute, light and arrived very quickly so yay for that. however the efficiency of this epilator is very poor compared to my previous philips epilator. now i understand why some of the previous reviews stated that it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as some epilators: it doesn&#x27;t pluck out all the hair, so no wonder! still it&#x27;s ok for the price, it just takes forever to do the job. but i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, if you are looking for a fast and efficient epilator. i wish i would&#x27;ve invested a tiny bit more on better quality.</li>
            <li> Works great but a bit painful</li>
            <li> the product is sleek n looks good, but epilator is definitely tough n painful on skin. if you have the budget go for the next level product.</li>
            <li> *I dislike this product for two main reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. It was significantly painful (at least the first time).&lt;br /&gt;2. It caused me to break out in a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Discomfort aside, I did notice a significant difference. (Note: I have coarse, dark hair.)&lt;br /&gt;1. My hair didn&#x27;t grow back for at about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;2. After I epilated my lower legs, the hair was significantly finer and less noticeable upon regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I epilated a second time, the pain wasn&#x27;t as bad. I did get a rash again but it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the first time either; I treated it with aloe gel. The epilator itself is good with a two-speed setting, a detachable head for easy cleaning, and a long, detachable plug (runs on batteries too). However, there is no hair filter to catch the hair and you&#x27;ll have to go over areas more than once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** epilated my underarms too and that is where I found the best results. It did hurt very much the first time but I didn&#x27;t get a rash. However, after epilating a few times it doesn&#x27;t hurt all. The skin is really soft and smooth and the hair grows back very fine.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want to use this product I suggest you think twice if you mind pain and have sensitive skin. I recommend that all users buy some kind of lotion to use after epilation and an exfoliating scrub glove to use prior to epilation.</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs, bikini area, and underarms. I usually go to the wax salon but this was easy and hassle free. Great product. Oh and I have very stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter a few times and it did not work.  I ended up with a raw chin with the whiskers still there.  I am so disappointed that shaving is faster and easier and less chafing than this costly thing.  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I recived as I espected, it came with everything that sais in the box exept for the brush to clean after the use.&lt;br /&gt;At the first time it hurts a little but, after you use regulary it becomes less paintfull, its doesnt take the little hairs but it works just great</li>
            <li> To start, I am a caucasian female who has lots of experience with waxing.  I wanted to try something a bit less messy (and I liked the idea of not waiting until hair is long to remove).  The hair on my legs is mostly fine except coarse hair towards the bottom of my calves.  I found that this epilator did a good job of removing the coarse hairs, but simply broke the fine hairs off rather than pulling them out.  The results were just okay.  My legs are not nearly as smooth as waxing or shaving.  Nevertheless, this epilator did a fantastic job of removing my coarse armpit hairs.  I am currently just using it for armpits and have gone back to waxing for legs. If you have hair like me, you might want to try a more expensive epilator to catch and pull out the fine hairs on your legs.  If your hair is fairly coarse all over, this epilator will probably work well for you.</li>
            <li> OK, So I&#x27;m new to using epilators.  I&#x27;m one of those ladies who is \\&quot;blessed\\&quot; with coarse leg hair, and truth be told, I&#x27;m really sick of it.  I can shave in the morning, and have stubble by night...and I can&#x27;t tell you how many razors I go through in the course of a month.  I originally decided to use MOOM sugaring product, and while it worked well above the knee, I wasn&#x27;t really thrilled with how it worked on my lower leg.  Cue my search online, and I came across some reviews on epilators.  After my lower leg sugaring fail, I decided to order the Philips Satinelle epilator based on reviews and price.  When I received the product, I thought it looked kind of cheap and lightweight and I was pretty intimidated by the tweezers.  I was even more intimidated by the sound and envisioned ripping my skin off with this thing.  However, I was ready for some smooth legs and decided to just do it.  I am pretty tolerant of pain, but when I turned the epilator on and put it up to my leg, it caught some hair and felt like the sting of some pretty angry bees.  I forged ahead, and became immune to the pain after a few swipes on my leg.  After starting on level 1, I quickly decided to switch to level 2, and found it to be less painful.  There was a learning curve to using this product, holding the skin tight, and figuring out the angle to glide over my leg.  Once I saw some hairs coming out by the root.....I was HOOKED!  I seriously used the epilator for an hour. When I finally turned it off, I was somewhat disappointed.  I felt like I had ripped out a lot of hair, but my legs were still prickly.  Some of the hairs I thought ripped out by the root were likely just cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still not convinced that I let my leg hair grow long enough for this to be super effective, so I will keep trying.  I have noticed though, that even with some longer hair, this epilator does not grab the hair and I have make several (sometimes painful) passes to remove the hair.  But, I have also seen this remove some very short hairs very effectively.  I&#x27;m kind of perplexed by how that happens, but I&#x27;m going to try this product for a few more weeks before really judging its true effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on the fence about buying this product, I would say go ahead and try it.  I&#x27;m guessing most people aren&#x27;t dealing with the same coarse hair I am (thanks mom and dad!).  I think there is a 45 day trial period, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong.  Make sure to exfoliate to avoid ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve had some, but I also get some from when I was shaving, so it wasn&#x27;t that big of deal to me.  I will add that there is no way I can use this product around the bikini area...it is super painful (I think sugaring is faster, easier and far more effective).  I have not used on other areas of the body.  I will update in a few weeks if I can give this product a higher score...or if I end up getting a pricier model.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Works if your hair is soft and thin</li>
            <li> I received my epilator a couple of days ago. I immediately tried it and it&#x27;s really effective. This is one of the least painful epilators I&#x27;ve used. I just have a slight problem with the loose connection of the cord but I think I can live with it. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I hate shaving and waxing takes a lot of time and costs a lot. So I used for the first time yesterday on my arms, legs and underarm. It did hurt at first but after a while I got used to it. I like that it has 2 speeds. I don&#x27;t really like the cord because I felt like it was getting in my way. It took several passes to rid most of my hairs and I feel like I still missed some. Today I noticed that I have some bumps, ingrown hairs already and not very happy about that. I think it&#x27;s because the hair was broken off rather than pulled at the root. Overall the product was ok. I feel like this would be good to use maybe in between waxing or shaving. Today I&#x27;m going to go over again to try and get any missed hairs. For the price it was good though.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use it gets disconnected in certain angles when i move it. I guess the problem must be with the cord. I have not treated it badly or been careless with it. it is now just very frustrating to use and i&#x27;m looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Nice but is better to look for the cordless version if you do not have a NEMA outlet in bathroom</li>
            <li> It goes without saying that ripping a hair out from the root hurts a lot more than just shaving it. However, if you can steel yourself and work through the pain, the results are great. The first time I used this epilator, it took me a couple of hours just going bit-by-bit, and I only ended up doing just up to my knees. I didn&#x27;t want to continue because of how long it was taking and how much pain I felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, many days later, my half-finished legs are serving as a live before-and-after shot! I ended up shaving what I couldn&#x27;t epilate, and the results are pretty clear. Below my knees, my legs are smooth as ever. Above, they&#x27;re already looking like they need a trim so I can epilate the next part, too! The other great thing is that there&#x27;s no chance of cutting yourself -- I&#x27;m a bit clumsy, so this is a big plus for me. I&#x27;ve heard stories about particularly stubborn hairs causing a tiny bit of bleeding (no more than a pin prick) but it&#x27;s yet to happen to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes. It does hurt, and it&#x27;s not the fastest solution... but it really is worth it! Since I haven&#x27;t used it (I didn&#x27;t need to!) on the same area that I managed to get done again, I can&#x27;t really tell you if it hurts less the second time around. Even if it did hurt the same amount again, I&#x27;d still do it. It&#x27;s about results!</li>
            <li> You get most of the hair off your legs but it hurt a lot. I would not recommend using it on other parts of the body unless you can stand it. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this epilator for fine Asian hair. It had trouble picking up the hairs even as pressed down onto my skin and ran over the area 4-5 times. The charger does not stay securely in the epilator and would fall out if bumped.</li>
            <li> works great, fast, very fine little device, does a great job.</li>
            <li> At first my wife complained that it hurt to use. Now she just whips this out and goes to town without saying a word. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my arm pits, I can&#x27;t use a razor because it irritates and swells my lymph node for some reason. I tried waxing but that didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;d rather do it myself than pay ridiculous amounts of money somewhere else. So this was my last option. Luckily it worked great! It pulls the hairs right out and I didn&#x27;t have any pesky stragglers. The pain went away pretty quickly and I didn&#x27;t have any problems. Plus you don&#x27;t get any irritation bumps like a lot of people get from shaving.</li>
            <li> Mys first time trying one of these. Works well on my legs, but I have not mastered the underarm without removing skin.</li>
            <li> Breaks as many hairs as it pulls out.  I have never gotten fully smooth with this epilator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I read the description and it said CORDLESS, it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators for over 25 years and this is the best one I have ever used.  I was amazed at the price since they are usually over $50.00.</li>
            <li> It works OK. Not real satisfied on some areas where I wanted it the most. Will keep trying. Some say it is painful. Not at all painful unless you are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator about a year ago and it died yesterday. The epilator area is a little small, I wish it were bigger. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought this years ago. It&#x27;s already paid for itself. Used it on my legs, which have fine blonde hair. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all and my legs are smooth as silk.&lt;br /&gt;Armpits and lady bits however, are a different story. I might just be wussy, but there was some tears, some cursing and some blood. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is how women get jumped into and out of gangs. It might be one of the devils favorite torture tools for really really naughty sinners. Hitler even thought the use of this device on crotches was barbaric, if that gives you any indication of how much it hurt. But in the end I will do it again, because yet again, I&#x27;m soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, it&#x27;s totally worth it. I&#x27;m not being facetious either lol.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with the product at all!! It hardly grabbed any hair. I am dissapointed!</li>
            <li> DIDN&#x27;T REALIZE YOU HAVE TO KEEP THIS PLUGGED IN, WHEN IN USE.  WORKS WELL, AS LONG AS YOU CAN SIT NEAR AN OUTLET.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for everyone. Depends on your hair, i guess. I use it for my legs, and my mom borrows it. It works great on her, but not on me. She has coarser hair, whereas mine is a mix of thick and fine. The thick ones get plucked right, but the fine ones just get broken off, so the hair grows back funny.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything. I only use it for my underams because I feel like I&#x27;ll burst into tears if I use it on my legs. I nearly screamed my head off when it plucked a few legs strands. That being said, it works pretty well and can get the tiniest of hairs. I would&#x27;ve given it five stars if it didn&#x27;t sound like a lawnmower. I regret not buying a portable one that doesnt need to be plugged in.</li>
            <li> Great epilator. I&#x27;ve already had one before and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li> This is a good epliator.  It&#x27;s a little noise, but does the job.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my old epliady either - another plus.</li>
            <li> This was my first epliator and it was PAINFUL but people were right after the first tjme it hurts less. This epilator works BUT it leaves behind hair and u have to keep going back I would recommend using another one and if you cant find another get this one because it does work just not that well.</li>
            <li> Neat product.  I did buy a tea oil lotion to cover my burning legs with after they turned red from using the epilator.  Regardless, this thing is powerful and works!</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to, but takes a lot of swipes over the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to know how painful it is take some tweezers and pull a few hairs from wherever you plan to use it.  I figured it would be faster, therefore less painful... NOPE!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was excited to use this but it broke after the second use.</li>
            <li> I love that I can continually run this with the power cord. My previous epilators (from a different brand) were only able to run after charging it. This is easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> So ... it works. It doesn&#x27;t clear everything (have to pull out the razor), but after using it 1-2 times a week for a while, I see less hair and have smoother skin overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should wait until the hair is long enough to pluck, otherwise the epilator won&#x27;t catch the hairs. Maybe a few centimeters?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: DO NOT OVERUSE THE FAST SPEED. YOU COULD START BLEEDING. This is why I only use the epilator 1-2 times a week only and only on the slower speed. If you overuse it, your skin could become tender and, quite frankly, traumatized &#x3D; bleeding. Not good times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: Easy to clean. The cord is long enough that you could probably just plug it in and use it over the sink (if you&#x27;re plucking underarm hair)</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my epilator. I have been using it for about 3 months now and each time I use it-it becomes less painful, in fact it&#x27;s not painful at all anymore. I got a few ingrown hairs and red spots on my legs at first, but I dealt with them and kept epilating...I no longer have ingrown hair and epilating is a breeze. I use &amp;#34;Emjoi&amp;#34; After Epilation Cream every time I epilate and it seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> I have never been this satisfied with results in a beauty product before! The first time I used this Epilator it hurt beyond belief however with a painkiller and two hours later my leg was hair free, cut free and the red bumps subsisted within 30 minutes. The next day I took care of the ingrown hairs which is common, and used the epilator once more. Now I only need to use the epilator twice a month,pain free, and I can wear shorts for weeks straight without needing to worry! I have not used this item in sensitive areas however for legs, stomach, bikini line and arms I am amazed with the results!</li>
            <li> To harsh for my wife. Sent it back.</li>
            <li> Cuts the hair, does not remove it as it should.  Not worth the bother, get something a little more pricey for results, there are some great ones out there!</li>
            <li> Results last longer than shaving. This item is supposed to Be used on legs. On legs, it is not very painful (feels more like a lot of pinching) but if you use it on underarms for example, it hurts like heck. But I think all epilators are like that. So if you are looking for something for all areas of the body, perhaps consider an epilator that works in water because I don&#x27;t think this one does. don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hurting at all!</li>
            <li> I thought I got a nice product that would help me pull out my underarm hair in affordable price but I was wrong. I tried many times to remove my underarm hair unfortunately many still left than pulled out.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use it but I&#x27;m not really satisfied with the product. Apart from the pain, it pulls out some hair but breaks most of them and skin doesn&#x27;t feel soft. You also have to go through some parts over and over again and you can see the broken hair. I don&#x27;t mind if it takes longer i just didn&#x27;t like the fact that it breaks the hair more than it pulls them out. :( very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just received it and it has hair on it!!! It is used!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It takes a little adjusting to the pain, but eventually your legs get used to it.  It works so much better than a razor because it pulls the root.  I don&#x27;t have to shave so much with it because the hair does not grow back as fast. Plus over time the hair starts to thin out. Haven&#x27;t tried it down south yet. I have to have a couple of cocktails before I try that.</li>
            <li> This is my first elipator ever and I love it. It&#x27;s gets the job done and I have straight corse Asian hair. Sometimes it misses the smaller ones but nothing a quick tweezers touch up can&#x27;t fix. The cord is long enough to reach any where. And I prefer taking off the purple &amp;#34;help cap&amp;#34; that way you can get a little closer to the skin.</li>
            <li> I had one of the original epilators and it lasted for years.  I loved it so I was sad when it died and had to replace it.  I am pleased with the size and light weight feel of this Philips epilator.  It feels a bit more aggressive and rough but it also seems to remove the hair faster.  I prefer a corded version because re-chargeable batteries don&#x27;t last as long.  I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all. I thought i would try epilating, but this is not for me. I dont have very thick hair so maybe that was the issue, but the only thing it did was break the hair. I tried it both on my arms and legs and the area was stubbly when I felt it after trying the epilator. I tried going over it, but it of course did not grab the hair. I was hoping this was my solution to shaving, but it is not. Maybe it is time to save up for laser treatments. I use to wax when there was a salon nearby, and the pain was not close at all, for those who are wondering, but it did break the hair and not pull it out. So that is probably why it did not hurt. If you have thick hair, I say try it, but if you have fine hair it probably wont pull it out.</li>
            <li> This item was not as effective in hair removal as others I have purchased. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife instead of a &amp;#34;NO-NO&amp;#34;.  She hates it ~ to noisy and totally ineffective!  Glad it wasn&#x27;t more expensive.  Would not reccomend it to anyone.  If possible would give it less than an one star rating.</li>
            <li> I have medium thickness leg hair and this epilator did a terrible job. It missed 70% of the areas I went over. I&#x27;ve had epilators which I just went over one swipe and it got everything. This one took too much time to achieve below average results.</li>
            <li> It is perfect. I love it :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product in August and it was working fine until this past week when the power would shut off at random intervals. I had to completely stop using it when I was shocked from turning it on. I now have a painful finger and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Thought it could be used for facial hair.</li>
            <li> A little painful, but not too bad. Seems to do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I haven&#x27;t used it in any very sensitive areas yet, just my arms and legs. It does hurt, but it&#x27;s tolerable. I&#x27;m sure you have to build up your endurance for pulling hair out by the roots. :)</li>
            <li> It hurts a bit, wish it was painless, ha.</li>
            <li> Package arrived before expected, first time I have ever used an epillator, and dont know how Ive lived this long without one. It stings at first, but after a couple minutes its not quite as bad. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> OWWW! Cant say it doesn&#x27;t work but can&#x27;t say that I enjoy using it. Does what it should but am not brave enough to use for all those undesired hairs</li>
            <li> I had never used an epilator before trying this product. I know that the first time takes longer than most, but after using it for a half hour on a small section of my leg, my skin became irritated and there was still hair there. It was also incredibly painful - I thought I could handle it because I&#x27;ve done waxing before, but this was a totally different beast. If the epilator was more effective it might have been worth it, but it left lots of hair and I had red bumps on my leg for a few days. This was not a good product for me.</li>
            <li> I tried to like this thing but it really didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations - it sucks at &amp;#34;epilating&amp;#34; despite following the directions and whatnot. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t return it. :(</li>
            <li> it works, not a great thing but works</li>
            <li> works on the underarms.  Did not work on my legs and caused a grip of ingrowns on my legs.  If u can let the leg hair grow over 1/4 of an inch, it would work better on the legs.  for legs, I use it once a month and shave as well.  my underarms look very nice with this tool and are red for about an hour after, which is better than waxing.  I have dark, a bit thick, and straight hair.</li>
            <li> first time I use an epilator , at first it hurts , but gradually you get used to , and I really like it because it lasts much longer shaving, only to be moisturize skin thoroughly after use .</li>
            <li> My epilator was broken down, so I bought this one. It is great. It can take away the short hair if you are patient. And the head is washable which makes the cleaning easy. But the noise is so aloud. Every time I used it, the noise made me feel standing in the airport.</li>
            <li> This is a decent little epilator for the price, though I really wish it came with a cleaning brush. It is much less painful than my previous one!</li>
            <li> I would go over an area a couple of times with this epilator and it would leave the area smooth and hair free. It gives you a tolerable pain like a multiple quick pinch on your skin.</li>
            <li> Not water proof. Epilaiton is so painful that I need to be in hot water to open up the pores and have the hair slip out more easily. This product isn&#x27;t what I thought but was able to return for free!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an epilator that I can clean under the water faucet and had an adapter. I was happy to come across this one which has both. I received the product in a timely manner but the packaging was missing the cleaning brush. I didn&#x27;t want to send the whole thing back so didn&#x27;t contact the seller about it. Overall the epilator is good. It wasn&#x27;t surprised by the noise level since I&#x27;ve had an epilator before but my old one was smaller and funny enough was more loud. I don&#x27;t really understand the need for the two speed settings since the highest speed seems to be the best for me. I found that the batteries ran out fast in my other epilator so having a corded adapter is great for not having it run out on you but if it has a recharger and can attach and detach the cord that would be a lot better. Not sure there are any epilators like that, but it would be very nice.</li>
            <li> Its good but I feel I got ingrown hair problem after using it.</li>
            <li> Painless, easy to use and the epilating head can be rinsed under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative (which would have been apparent to me had I read the description closely) is that it is corded, not a rechargable.  I wasn&#x27;t even aware they made corded ones :D  This is the only reason I did not give it five stars--it would be perfect otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used several different kinds of epilators through the years--including the first Epilady, which was an instrument of torture whipped up by the Marquis de Sade, I think--and this is the least painful.  Works quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot. It can get really short hairs and it works super quickly. It definitely hurts but it hasn&#x27;t broken off any hairs which could cause ingrown hairs. Overall great product but I would suggest using it in segments giving yourself time to recover from the pain.</li>
            <li> From a guy&#x27;s perspective...  This gets 4 stars for now.  When I use it in &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; regions, when I get up the courage, with improved results, I will change my rating.  Even if you don&#x27;t buy one of these, I hope you get some comic relief reading my review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! #1:  OMG, lol, I felt as if I&#x27;d been electrocuted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me explain:  I have an area on my face where the hair grows out of one spot about 3x faster than the rest of my face.  Gross, I know.  It&#x27;s an area about 1/4&amp;#34; in diameter, but it bugs the crap out of me.  I originally was going to spend $400 on a NONO, but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to it.  I have seen professional laser removal systems for about $800, and I couldn&#x27;t do that, either.  So, after reading the Philips reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I fired this thing up and looked at the spinning discs.  I visualized a wood chipper grinding into my face...but decided to try it anyway.  After all, millions of women have used this on their legs--how bad could it be?  I put this thing closer and closer to my face, and it finally grabbed a couple hairs.  Has anyone ever been snapped by a rubber band or one of those novelty joy-buzzers?  Have you ever stuck a 9v battery to your tongue???  That&#x27;s what it felt like on my face--about 10x at once.  Not wanting to be a Sally, I kept going on both sides of my face.  Let me tell you, I am no sissy, but it hurt.  No bloodshed, mind you, but it felt like getting electrocuted by that 9v battery multiple times every time it pulled hairs out of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! #2:  This thing actually works.  I would like to say it doesn&#x27;t, but it did and does work.  Those hairs are coming back in that spot over time, but there are a LOT fewer (less?) of them than before.  I had to endure quite a bit of pain (for me) to get the job done, but I&#x27;m thinking it was worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! #3:  The price.  I paid about $40 for this corded version.  Philips has a $100 cordless version with ceramic discs that I may upgrade to sometime, but this will do for now.  Considering I was thinking about paying about 10x this amount for a NONO, I would say it was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy one, good luck.  I just wanted people to know what to expect, at least based on my experiences.</li>
            <li> Best method for removing hair leg. Shaving my legs gives me allergies, so I bought this in order to try soemthing different, and I&#x27;m impressed with the results. It&#x27;s painful in the beginning, I have to be honest, but once you get used to it is not that bad. For the armpit I don&#x27;t recommend it, because as the surface is not as flat as the legs it can get more painful, so I just use it for the legs. I LOVE THIS LITTLE THING!</li>
            <li> I had another philips epilator since 2008 that died one week ago. Since having my late epilator I have not used a razor for my legs and underarms, that is why it didn&#x27;t hurt when using this one (the very first time using my previous epilator it hurt a lot, but didn&#x27;t after using often). I compared both and are very similar (even though the box of the old one said that I could use it for underarms and bikini as opposed to this one). I am glad with the price.  Hope it lasts 7 years as the other one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update:  After two years and a half I noticed a brown spot in the plastic disks in the head.  Then I found it was coming from rust in the leads that go in the middle of the blades/disks.  That was a disappointing, I was washing it once a week and letting it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the head of the old one I bought 9 years ago (Europe made) and has no rust on it, even when I used it for 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered already 2 replacements heads, each cost almost as a whole new epilator, but I don&#x27;t need the whole device, so I prefered just to buy the spare part.</li>
            <li> I had for years a Braun epilady, but died two month ago, I seached for few weeks reading reviews and I decided for this brand and model, I so happy with my product. It is easy to use and no pain. I recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.  I read the instructions first.  I read the tips posted in all of these great reviews.  But this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I never have been prone to ingrown hairs, but (from what little hair this item actually did pull out) that&#x27;s what appeared.  My husband freaked out wondering how I got all these horrible red bumps on my legs...and they were still hairy!  It was kind of humiliating.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it first during a cold Minnesota winter, so my legs can be comfortably covered while they heal.  I tried it on longer hair.  I tried it on shorter hair.  I went over the same area multiple times, but it just did not perform well on me.  I&#x27;m not going to complain about pain, because of course it&#x27;s going to hurt:  it pulls out hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, but only if you know how to use it correctly. As a first-time epilator user, it took me awhile to figure out what exact angle and distance works best for my hair type- don&#x27;t give up if you botch the first time; I kept clipping hairs instead of pulling them from the root and thought my device was defective. A few more tries and I got the hang of it. That adjustment period goes for everyone, though I think if you buy a fancier model they might be more intuitive to use. My one gripe with this model is that I always have to repeatedly go over areas to get them completely clear, so as a result epilating is a much longer (and painful) process than shaving. But given the results, and having nothing else in the epilating world to compare it to I&#x27;d still give it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it most effective for my underarms. Did it hurt like a mother and bleed the first time I tackled that area? Sure did. But it&#x27;s made a HUGE difference in the thickness and texture. Shaving always left me with a five-o&#x27;clock shadow look at the end of the day- even newly shaved, you could still somewhat see the dark roots. Not cute. But once I suffered through that first time, the hair grew back thinner, and by the second time it was much easier to remove. Definitely boosted my confidence with wearing sleeveless tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s pretty much how epilation goes anywhere you try it. Hell the first time, then it gets better. If you naturally have finer body hair, that starting pain threshold will be respectively lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have stated, hair/skin needs to be dry, and you have to let your hair grow out some between epilations so they are accessible to the tweezer blades, but I&#x27;d also add to that don&#x27;t wait too long or it will be more painful. I still hate epilating my legs- too painful, and takes too long. For them I still get tempted to shave. One of these days I might upgrade to something that can get them in one go. This is a good, affordable starter modelthough that can help you test the waters and see if epilation works for you.</li>
            <li> A well built product that does what it states. No issues. I have had another one in the past and this one works better. I use this on my pubic area and am a male. Make sure you follow the directions and use after a shower with your skin dry. Keep your skin stretched and move the epilator against the way the hair grows. Go slowly and the pull of the hair is not bad.</li>
            <li> This thing hurt so bad I couldnt take it, I couldnt get used to the pain and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I just received my epilator and and used it on my lower legs - full power. It took just about 10 minutes per leg and anihileted all the little hairs (peach fuzz) as well. It was a little bit painful in the begining as I haven&#x27;t done it in a while, but after the 2nd minute it was a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to use it on my wiskars (shhh...!), on the lower setting and hope it will work without fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I found is that this tiny little machine makes a big, loud noise, but really a small price to pay for the work it does.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the purchase and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it at first it is loud and it is painful, you soon get used to it though. It does skip a few hairs so be sure to go slow. After using twice on my legs I did get some ingrown hairs, about the same as shaving. I took Tylenol the first time just in case and that helped. I now mostly use under my arms, once a month and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one of these before, so I don&#x27;t have any other brands to compare it to. That being said, I feel like for the price (I paid around $30) it&#x27;s a great working product that does a good job, is easy to use, and easy to clean. A friend of mine told me about this, so I thought why not, I&#x27;ll give it a chance if it means less shaving! I&#x27;m a female in my late 20&#x27;s, with dark brown hair, and I shave my legs (full) armpits and forearms. Those are the places I decided to use this product. I&#x27;m still a little too chicken to use it on the downstairs, I fear it will hurt too much! Haha.&lt;br /&gt;I shave my legs between 3-6 days, my armpits every 2 days, and my forearms every 7-13 days.&lt;br /&gt;First use of this.....just WOW. It hurt!! I have a pretty decent pain tolerance and having thick, stubble hair after years of shaving getting ripped out by the root, PHEW!!!! It hurt. But it was tolerable. Knowing it could end result in minimal shaving, I was willing to suck it up. It did a pretty good job and grabbed most hair.&lt;br /&gt;Day three...I went over everything again. I wasn&#x27;t totally used to the product the first time, so I went over everything a second time in hopes to capture hairs I missed the first time. It hurt much LESS. And got most of the hair!!&lt;br /&gt;Then I went SIX days before I had to reuse this product a third time. My armpits are the softest they have ever been since I was like, 6 years old. It&#x27;s been a few days since that third go over with this product, and everything feels even softer!!! The third time going over everything was nearly painless and the hairs they were able to grab didn&#x27;t hurt as bad getting yanked.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot WAIT to keep using this product, so then in 4 months when I go to the beach for a vacation, I can use this once and then I won&#x27;t even have to worry about packing a razor!&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the purchase in my opinion!!!</li>
            <li> Take a little getting used to this device, and then it works fine. The main thing is not to hurry and to believe that beauty demands of &amp;#34;victims&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Feels a bit flimsy. Very very light weight. But it does it&#x27;s job in an ok Manor so it gets a 4 star.</li>
            <li> Works great and it is very efficient. Better than my previous epilator. very handy to have when traveling and not able to go to the salon to wax!</li>
            <li> It is definitely not for the face.  It chaffed my chin very badly.  I read it could be used on the face and that is not true, very very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about using an epilator but I like it. I use to wax and my hair would still grow back in a couple of weeks. I used it for the first time and there was some pain but nothing too bad. My hair is has yet to start growing back in and it has been 2 weeks already. Im a huge fan of this epilator.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s not expensive but yet it does a great job removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;I got really tiered of waxing(it can get messy sometimes). Its so easy to use and clean&lt;br /&gt;that if you try it will never go back to shaving or waxing again. There might be a beter&lt;br /&gt;once, but not for $30 with free shipping. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Good job Philips!  I like it!</li>
            <li> My sister bought an epilator that worked great; it made me want to buy one of my own.&lt;br /&gt;While I wanted to get the same one she did, hers was around 70? And I chose this one because I was only charged something around 30.&lt;br /&gt;The flaws were more annoying that I anticipated: having to go over it ten or so times! I kept reading reviews that said &amp;#34;more than once&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t mind that. But I mind when I try to no avail. I&#x27;m debating returning this product.&lt;br /&gt;(It also doesn&#x27;t have a light which is a pretty neat feature actually.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SE5180 by Braun (the one my sister has) was a much better epilator, and I would recommend that one. It is very efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this product. It works perfectly, it&#x27;s pretty small which makes it so much comfortable and the only bad thing I see is that you really need to take time to do it perfectly, but hey, I prefer this than spending money in professional waxing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing product,  cheap, clean, easy and most important less painful....I strongly recommend to everybody who wants to remove hair</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst thing I have ever bought in my life. Can I give it 0 stars? Why on earth would anyone ever choose this method of hair removal? I&#x27;ve done waxing, shaving, hair removal creams and tweeting. This is by far the most painful method and there really is no benefit. It doesn&#x27;t stay away any longer and it creates redness and bumps. It hurts really bad and I&#x27;m used to waxing! I would choose waxing a hundred times over! Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Purchasing this epilator was not an easy decision for me. The fact that it sounds painful didn&#x27;t appeal to me but I knew it I had to buy since I was getting irritated of having to shave my underarms twice in the same day (I actually bought the epilator for my underarms instead of my legs). Okay, so let&#x27;s get this over with, questions I wanted to know before I bought this was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Will it hurt? -A: Yes it will hurt. It pulls out hair from the root, of course it&#x27;s going to hurt. How much will it hurt? It depends on how well you handle pain but yes, the more you use it, the more you&#x27;ll get use to it and soon you&#x27;ll feel nothing at all. The pain wasn&#x27;t honestly as bad as I thought it was going to be. If you want to have an idea on how it&#x27;ll feel, try pulling out the hair from your desired-to-be-hairless-soon area with a pair of tweezers. Now imagine that sensations but triple (actually has 5 of them) cause this epilator has more the one but again, you&#x27;ll get use to it. I only felt the pain the first two times I used it. I actually removed my underarm with tweezers before I epilated (yeah, ew) so I think that&#x27;s the reason it didn&#x27;t hurt so much and just felt little pinches instead. So try it if you want to know your pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.How fast does it go? -A: Very fast. There are two speed settings on this thing \\&quot;for thin hairs and difficult to reach areas\\&quot; (says so on the back of the box). I have only used the 1st settings because it already seemed very fast and the couldn&#x27;t imagine how the second one felt like. My first reaction was \\&quot;Jeezes!\\&quot; before quickly turning it off. Though now that I&#x27;m used to epilating, for some reason I have yet to use the second setting and questioning myself why as I write this. Either way, it was fast enough for me to be chicken before trying it. It was already midnight before I could bring myself to do it only to find myself feeling silly over nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. How loud is it? -A: It&#x27;s loud enough for someone to askyou what you&#x27;re doing. Though it was louder than I thought it would be but not loud enough to wake up my brother after closing the bathroom door (though he is a heavy sleeper). Don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not loud enough to wake up your neighbors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. How messy will it get? -A: It depends on the areas you want to epilate but whether its the arms, legs, underarms or back, they all have one thing in common the hair will not magically put it self in neat pile. The hair will go everywhere. If you&#x27;re planning to do your arms and legs, I suggest you epilate in the bathtub because it will get messy. Real messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. How to start? -A: Before using the epilator, you will need to shave the area. Wait 2-3 days for the hair to grow so the epilator will be able to grab the hairs. Don&#x27;t have the hairs to long on the epilator will just break the hair which would be the same as shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. How well does this epilator work? -A: Out of 10? A 7.5 since it does a decent of grabbing many of the hairs but I never have a completely hairless armpit without having a few tiny hairs left behind. Usually 2-4 hairs left but you can just use a set of tweezers to remove them. It does, however leave your area feeling smooth like a babies bottom. For the rest, you can read on the instructions that comes in the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Will I get ingrown hairs? -A: If you don&#x27;t exfoliate you probably will. On the day after first time, make sure to clean the area that you epilated which you can do in the shower. You can epilate after a shower but make sure your legs/arms/armpits are dry before epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. What does the box (actually) come with? -A: Box comes with charger, efficiency cap, instructions and of course, the epilator. It comes with everything the box says it does, except for the brush to help remove hair from the epilator. Couldn&#x27;t find it in the box but it wasn&#x27;t a problem since I had a brush similar and just used that one instead. The box actually looked likeit have been opened but I didn&#x27;t care as long as it come with the major stuff (bought it from Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to finish off this review, I would like to say that I don&#x27;t regret buying this epilator, though it&#x27;s my first one and I don&#x27;t have others to compare to, I like it. I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore as long as I have this baby. My pits feel smooth and I am satisfied. If you haven&#x27;t epilated before and shaving irritates the crab out of you then buy this epilator at least for first timers it does a decent job. Good luck and hope you achieve your hairless goals.</li>
            <li> this product did not remove hair well, at all despite its high rating and overall good reviews, it works as well as most 1 star rated objects, this item barley removes any hair at all and when it does it breaks off and is no different than shaving. Your better off with razer rash than this time consuming product, that has very little positive results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Yep, first time hurt like heck, however every time afterwards is easy as shaving with much longer lasting results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you get super smooth legs? No, well, not yet anyway. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, but visually there is nothing there. Looking forward to the summer months of capris, shorts and skirts without having to shave my legs daily!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on full legs, full bikini, and armpits. I&#x27;d recommend the Philips epilator to everyone!</li>
            <li> Buying this was the best choice I could have made! I usually use wax but this epilator is faster to use and leaves the skin smooth for about three weeks, so I love it! I can use it for almost every part of my body and get good results. It&#x27;s not painful at all. What is more,  It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for over 10 years and this one is great.  I used my old one in the morning and the new one in the evening and it got everything the older one didn&#x27;t.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> It´s better than waxing, but in order for it to be effective it needs practice and patience. Its great for touch ups between waxes.</li>
            <li> hate it it stratch my face</li>
            <li> This is the simplest of the satinelle... a friend got it through my account... she loves it!!! One more shaver turned... Ladies got one you will never have stubble again... we are meant to have soft skin and this is the at home cheaper way to get it!!</li>
            <li> I had the same epilator before and I liked it. I bought it again because it works well and very cheap.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to use. UPDATE: been using the same one (for facial hair) for 3 years now. It remains durable, with no issues whatsoever!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no worth to buy.that&#x27;s my opinion.</li>
            <li> light, nice grib and long cable didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because didn&#x27;t come with a small case-like my old Revlon and small cleaning brush-I have to say, from Phillips I was expecting much better marketing approach.&lt;br /&gt;Would I recomande to a friend? Yes, is still nice product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I had to return it after one use..it irritated my skin, it has been a week and the bumps on my skin look like nasty pimples.</li>
            <li> I love it for my face I suffer from really bad facial hair and now I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore.  Just pluck from time to time but not as much. It really hurts during but the outcome is great.  Now I can finally work on the scars from plucking and shaving.  This saved my life I feel so much better showing my face</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t pull short hair...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to get used to the feeling of multiple tweezers plucking out hairs by the roots. After a while your skin becomes accustomed to it and won&#x27;t be as sore. You&#x27;ll see some redness but it goes away. My hairs grow back more sparsely than before I began using this epilator. I had used an ancient version of  this device in the early  &#x27;80s called The Epilady - not comfortable at all.</li>
