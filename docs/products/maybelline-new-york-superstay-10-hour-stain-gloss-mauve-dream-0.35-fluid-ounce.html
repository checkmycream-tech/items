            <li>its amazing</li>
            <li>nd the color is amazing too</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best lip product I have ever come across-</li>
            <li>It has a nice finish, and when the finish wears off, the stain remains all day.  </li>
            <li>Even some of my lipsticks stay better than this stain...</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this color too.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s my favorite, and I was so glad to find it again...</li>
            <li>and with free shipping!  </li>
            <li>Love the color, love the consistency &amp; ease of application.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>This color is awesome and makes my teeth look very white.</li>
            <li>Now I have three tubes of this lipstick that I love</li>
            <li>I love the lip gloss.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for a warm complexion than a cool complexion.</li>
            <li>so the gloss goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It is so unique.  </li>
            <li>Available in a wide range of great shades.</li>
            <li>For me, when I don&#x27;t do any extra activities, it lasts about a good three hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although that&#x27;s true, I still like the color a ton.</li>
            <li>when u apply it, it like feels cool on ur lips and it does stay on for 10 hours</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  This product is no longer in production and while I&#x27;ve been very lucky and happy to have found a few suppliers with tubes for sale, the applicators have not withstood the test of time.  </li>
            <li>This has become my new favorite lip product.  </li>
            <li>The exact color I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>Good customer service - product as expected</li>
            <li>I can only think that maybe these were stored somewhere warm</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too bright or too dark.</li>
            <li>I got this for my mom to use during the work, color is nice and it stay for pretty long time.</li>
            <li>They are super low maintenance and its an my absolute favorite color.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and use it daily.</li>
            <li>I put chapstick on first</li>
            <li>The mauve dream is my basic favorite color.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a Stain that stays on more than 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>While 10 hours is a stretch, this lasts a long time and feels absolutely great with only one step application.  </li>
            <li>Truthfully, I reapply after eating, etc., but it still far surpasses regular lipstick and looks and feels moist and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I will buy again real soon.</li>
            <li>so now I have three tubes of this marvelous stuff I never use because it just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw them away :(</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using this along with a gloss or balm.</li>
            <li>but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying.</li>
            <li>B006UEUJV0 Maybelline New York Superstay 10 hour</li>
            <li>I am sad that this stain-gloss is no longer available in stores, but was so glad I found it online</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t happen when I bought my first several tubes from the grocery store before they disappeared from shelves.</li>
            <li>I like it though I don&#x27;t think its the exact same as the one I purchased 2yrs ago</li>
            <li>The last three just dropped off into the tube as I pulled it out (gently!)</li>
            <li>A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li>I only wish it stayed on just a little longer but definitely love it.</li>
            <li>Two came with a little plastic safety wrapper around the top, but the third didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>or they&#x27;re old</li>
            <li>It was completely gone in about 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>But not exactly \\&quot;10 hour\\&quot;s worth of it.</li>
            <li>I really hope Maybelline is simply going to repackage and bring it back.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural, not painted, and never dry.  </li>
            <li>but apparently they have just been decomposing.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like super thick old lady lipstick and it stays where I put</li>
            <li>The sponge applicator is amazing and different than any I&#x27;ve used, so it&#x27;s  particularly unfortunate that they have not held up to just sitting in the tubes for an extended time.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The exact color I was looking for!  Thank you!  Arrived promptly!</li>
            <li> This has become my new favorite lip product.  They are super low maintenance and its an my absolute favorite color.</li>
            <li> Good customer service - product as expected</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff and use it daily. The color of this stain is perfect! It&#x27;s not too bright or too dark. It&#x27;s a shame that they don&#x27;t make it anymore. I purchased 4 so I have plenty of time to find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will leave a color stain on your lips, but does not hydrate them. I would highly recommend using this along with a gloss or balm.</li>
            <li> But not exactly \\&quot;10 hour\\&quot;s worth of it. For me, when I don&#x27;t do any extra activities, it lasts about a good three hours. If I&#x27;m out and about, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;ll last about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although that&#x27;s true, I still like the color a ton.</li>
            <li> This stain smells and tastes like chemicals.  They also dry the lips out so bad that they start cracking and peeling after just the first wear.  They don&#x27;t stay for as long as my other lip products, either.  Even some of my lipsticks stay better than this stain...</li>
            <li> Such a shame these are getting discontinued!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cake or flake or dry your lips. A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time. Definnitely not 10 hours... but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying. It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
            <li> My favorite. I love this color too. I only wish it stayed on just a little longer but definitely love it.</li>
            <li> The first thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that it felt watery on my lips, which was weird  to me. The second thing I didnt like was that I had to apply like three coats to get it to the color I wanted. And the third thing is that it didn&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;- I hate it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead...and this is my go to color.  I even get compliments from strangers, so it&#x27;s a winner in my book.  The color is, indeed, long lasting (even thru lunch!), but, of course, it does fade during the day.  Still, it&#x27;s my favorite, and I was so glad to find it again...and with free shipping!  So sad it&#x27;s no longer available in stores, but Amazon saved the day.  Take That, Maybelline!</li>
            <li> The tip fell off when I tried to apply it</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom to use during the work, color is nice and it stay for pretty long time.</li>
            <li> MESSY AND DID NOT LIKE THE COLOR MY STAIN GLOSS SOUNDED LIKE JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE</li>
            <li> Love the color, love the consistency &amp; ease of application. Lasts for hours, no flaking or stickiness. Available in a wide range of great shades.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. I put chapstick on first so the gloss goes on smoothly. The finish (shine) wears off after a bit but the color stays! This color is awesome and makes my teeth look very white. It doesn&#x27;t last ten hours, but it last longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I apply before work and after lunch to get through the work day. So happy to find it on amazon since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. It doesn&#x27;t look like super thick old lady lipstick and it stays where I put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;So since I could never find this lipstick except on Amazon and was worried there would be a limited supply, I ordered three! Two came with a little plastic safety wrapper around the top, but the third didn&#x27;t. I complained and the company sent me a replacement without any hassle. After a few days, the little applicator on the wand of my first tube broke off, leaving just the plastic stick! No sweat, I swapped lids so I could use the applicator wand from one of my other tubes...but over the course of the month ALL THREE APPLICATOR TIPS BROKE OFF THE WAND! I about cried when my third one broke. Now I have three tubes of this lipstick that I love and I can only apply it by scraping the color off the wand stick with a q-tip. It&#x27;s hard to get enough this way, requiring multiple dips of the wand and shakes of the tube, and it doesn&#x27;t apply very evenly with a q-tip. I&#x27;m distraught! This didn&#x27;t happen when I bought my first several tubes from the grocery store before they disappeared from shelves. I can only think that maybe these were stored somewhere warm or they&#x27;re old and so the plastic is weak? You can&#x27;t apply with your figure tip because it stains...so now I have three tubes of this marvelous stuff I never use because it just isn&#x27;t worth the hassle, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to throw them away :(</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lip product I have ever come across- even compared to ones that are $20+. I was so enraged when they discontinued this product. Enraged actually barely begins to cover the disdain I feel toward Maybelline after this poor business move. I now purchase it regularly from ebay/amazon. I want to recommend this to everyone, but then the stock will go down for when I need to buy this every so often after I&#x27;ve run out. So try this, but get a different color because I need all of the Mauve Dreams.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this product is and does all that it says. A little goes a long way for me too. It does stain well and it keeps my lips fairly moist. I wish I had bought more!</li>
            <li> I am sad that this stain-gloss is no longer available in stores, but was so glad I found it online so I could stock up.  I really hope Maybelline is simply going to repackage and bring it back.  It is so unique.  It has a nice finish, and when the finish wears off, the stain remains all day.  It looks natural, not painted, and never dry.  The mauve dream is my basic favorite color.  It&#x27;s better for a warm complexion than a cool complexion. I also like the pink plush and the red.</li>
            <li> I have never owned this product but thought that I would give it a try.  I loved the color and shine.  It stays on for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I like it though I don&#x27;t think its the exact same as the one I purchased 2yrs ago and they no longer sell in the stores, but it does the job and I like the results I have for now.</li>
            <li> I love the lip gloss. Its very nice and a lovely color. 10/10 recommend. It is cheap and amazing. Arrived before estimation.</li>
            <li> This Stain is great. I finally found a Stain that stays on more than 20 minutes.  I can go 6 hours &amp; the stain is still on my lips.  I will buy again real soon.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a long lasting lip stain, this was not it.  It was completely gone in about 2 hours.  The texture is nice, but does not hold up.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> While 10 hours is a stretch, this lasts a long time and feels absolutely great with only one step application.  Truthfully, I reapply after eating, etc., but it still far surpasses regular lipstick and looks and feels moist and fresh.  This is my go-to lip color.  I wear it almost every day and I love it!  [[ASIN:B006UEUJV0 Maybelline New York Superstay 10 hour Stain Gloss, Mauve Dream, 0.35 Fluid Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This product is no longer in production and while I&#x27;ve been very lucky and happy to have found a few suppliers with tubes for sale, the applicators have not withstood the test of time.  The sponge applicator is amazing and different than any I&#x27;ve used, so it&#x27;s  particularly unfortunate that they have not held up to just sitting in the tubes for an extended time.  The last five I purchased (and sadly they will have to be the last) fell apart upon first use.  This was never an issue before but apparently they have just been decomposing.  The last three just dropped off into the tube as I pulled it out (gently!)</li>
            <li> I loveeeeeee this product! its amazing when u apply it, it like feels cool on ur lips and it does stay on for 10 hours nd the color is amazing too</li>
            <li> Great product!  It&#x27;s too bad they discontinued making it.</li>
