            <li>It&#x27;s simply amazing and a great price point.</li>
            <li>I think this is good product ^^</li>
            <li>But no one is asking the question … How in the world did you ever think these microbeads would be a good thing?</li>
            <li>and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week when my skin is misbehaving at night, and use a good moisturizer afterwards to replenish my skin as this can be a tad drying.</li>
            <li>, it seems it&#x27;s doing a good job cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>It will make for a good exfoliator if you use it often.</li>
            <li>I thought the smell was good</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing, I like to scrub my face with this before my shower then just jump in and wash it off, skin looks amazing afterwards!</li>
            <li>Great, light but effective product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it works wonders!</li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice exfoliation without over drying.</li>
            <li>Nice Item as described</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it&#x27;s still an effective scrub at the macro level.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, softer, and I am loving the lack of blackheads and my shrinking pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, softer, and I am loving the lack of blackheads and my shrinking pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t opened since about a month ago and my skin is healing nicely.</li>
            <li>Awesome new face wash!</li>
            <li>Perfect strength of micro beads, not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li>and I thought that was a good thing, even though I never saw any significant results with regards to my acne</li>
            <li>This is a good product to like clean your face</li>
            <li>I always use this with a face sponge, it makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells SUPER GOOD.</li>
            <li>After a week, it got rid of most of my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I know everyone reacts differently to various products, but this was the best xmas gift I got myself.</li>
            <li>Caused more oil production and more acne for me.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and the way it leaves my fave feeling</li>
            <li>doubt it removes blackheads but its an okay scrub..</li>
            <li>Absoultely love it.</li>
            <li>and i got even more.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels after i use this</li>
            <li>I love most of garner face washes, it works well on my acne prone skin...</li>
            <li>Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out.</li>
            <li>My teens LOVE this cleanse.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>I am a fan of many Garnier products but this has become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I feel much better not wearing make-up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so many breakouts ever.</li>
            <li>will say over the years I have tried many face washes and soaps and I have ALWAYS had a blackhead problem on my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like to be able to feel  the beads.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite Garnier products!&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by this in the store and, after a friend&#x27;s recommendation, just had to try it</li>
            <li>remove ALL my blackheads, but most of them</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Like most products that say they remove it all, it does</li>
            <li>This is an okay face scrub.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products on the market</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But overall, this product is really awesome.</li>
            <li>I wanted better skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, if you like the smell of charcoal.</li>
            <li>Its better to use in the showever as it foams up a bit and can easily get in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I would have loved if this cleanser got rid of my blackheads, but they haven&#x27;t really made a dent.</li>
            <li>I pressed my nose, and rose nostril blackheads came right out.</li>
            <li>It certainly gets the oils off my face and my skin stays oil free for a good part of the day</li>
            <li>but it feel more clean then,&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I would say that it was easily 75% of the blackheads were gone.</li>
            <li>Its has a strong perfume-like smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much better my face will get, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>They are as abundant as the first day.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t the best at clearing up black heads.</li>
            <li>and she combines using it with dry brushing and the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Cream Cleanser and says it&#x27;s been brilliant for her skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay mild exfoliator with its texture, but that is it.</li>
            <li>God knows how many products youve tried already IMO this one wont hurt and you may actually find pleasant</li>
            <li>I have had oily skin and huge, clogged  pores over my face for 25 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for 2 days and already see a huge improvement in my blackheads.</li>
            <li>Having used this from December to March, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in blackheads.</li>
            <li>Honestly people, if you want to find an exfoliater, use an exfoliating brush and a gentle wash.</li>
            <li>After four days my face above my nose was healed and looked great</li>
            <li>The patch is almost healed but I wasn&#x27;t even as comfortable in my skin as I was even with the acne.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this is probably a good fit.</li>
            <li>I really really don&#x27;t recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I love it and treat it like pure gold!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the soft pleasant scent and the fine texture of the scrubbing crystals and charcoal.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and have noticed significant results.  </li>
            <li>In one use, I saw a significant decrease in my blackheads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good and considering how my face reacts very strongly to a lot of stuff, it actually is very gentle as far as scrubbing your skin goes.</li>
            <li>It is not as &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; as I like but it does clean well.</li>
            <li>and i liked feeling like I could concentrate the crystals to specific crystals without the sensation that I&#x27;m grinding my skin with a pumis stone or a cheese greater.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt clean my skin as well as I thought it would have.</li>
            <li>left my skin flawless and clear.</li>
            <li>The Garnier Clean +</li>
            <li>Blackhead Eliminating Scrub just feels like your skin is really clean without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li>This foams up well and rinses off cleanly, and does leave my skin feeling clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I scrubbed my face and instead of feeling like washing my face with coarse sand paper, it was pleasant  </li>
            <li>thing I can think of is the charcoal being the most effective ingredient lifting the \\&quot;impurities\\&quot; and oil from under my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is ok its not powerful or over bearing and</li>
            <li>This suits my oily skin perfectly, but someone with dry to normal skin may not want to use this scrub every day as I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product so far the best for black heads and greasy faces</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special here, folks.</li>
            <li>I have fairly good skin, the only problem it being oily.</li>
            <li>My whole life, I get much better results with drier skin, so I am going to stay with this until all impurities are gone.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>At first it was fine when i was using the product</li>
            <li>Helped my skin tremendously</li>
            <li>receive fast received as described so far works good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often make a big effort to buy the same products over and over, but this Garnier charcoal scrub is the best.</li>
            <li>Works great - doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and makes everything look and feel so much clearer and smoother after!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying the clean and clear 3 in 1 exfoliator because it clears up pores and removes blackheads and helps with acne and makes your face feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Supposedly charcoal the active kind draws impurities and in the case of your precious face</li>
            <li>I am using Clean and Clear 3-in-one Foaming Cleanser with better results.</li>
            <li>out!&lt;br /&gt;After the first time using it, I was hooked!</li>
            <li>I have resorted to home remedies such as DIY baking soda face masks and have seen better results in one application than weeks of this stuff!</li>
            <li>Two days of using a mild soap and a non-acidic moisturizer, and I was right as rain.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of the strongest acne fighters you can get for such a reasonable price, and with a good moisturizer it can work like magic to give you clear skin!</li>
            <li>With the help of this and some lotion product i bought, my face is so soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>so well my face really gets feeling super clean after I use this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been self conscious about my blackheads and tried many products including the strips.</li>
            <li>It is really helping getting rid of my black heads and making my skin look beautiful.</li>
            <li>and smooth AND clean and NOt dried out.  </li>
            <li>This face wash does a great job of kepping my skin clear, smooth and helps alot with making my face less oily.</li>
            <li>Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain.</li>
            <li>product will make your skin feel smooth and like new.</li>
            <li>I think considering how well it works, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating beads are so fine, that they don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m looking forward to getting regular shipments :)</li>
            <li>That was the first use.  </li>
            <li>and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>And, blackheads require higher chemical peels as well.</li>
            <li>This one, you can feel the softness from the first rinse.</li>
            <li>Most of these face washes only differ by scent!</li>
            <li>I love this facial scrub</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>This scrub is called the &amp;#34;Impurities Eliminating Scrub&amp;#34; here in Canada, but I love it just the same!</li>
            <li>I thought that this was an initial breakout like you get from many acne products, so I remained vigilant in my use of the scrub.</li>
            <li>By the end of the first week, I couldn&#x27;t find any blackheads on my face at all.</li>
            <li>So I was super excited when I found this, not only that but the reviews it</li>
            <li>As a 30 year old guy I have been lucky to have been without any breakouts in many years, suddenly last month that changed</li>
            <li>I thought my soft beautiful healthy ( rather than dried and pruned) skin was a fluke of trying a foreign product for the first time.  </li>
            <li>When I used the product the first time I applied to my whole face, scrubbed with my hands, then rinsed.</li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft as well.</li>
            <li>If you want help w/ blackheads, you really need a 1-9% pure salicylic solution to apply 3-7 days a week.</li>
            <li>Very clean feeling and didn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t REALLY obvious, so they aren&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li>When I read an article about how charcoal is now being used in soaps as an absorbing agent, I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this in the mail and it left me running for Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>This dries my face so much.</li>
            <li>I like the way this feels and works, but it is very fragrant and makes my allergies go bananas.</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m just gonna buy clearsil and gently exfoliate my skin while it recovers.</li>
            <li>This thing really cleans blackheads.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the scrub to feel the way it did.</li>
            <li>and I thought I would try it to target the acne that AMBI and PanOxyl (a whole&#x27;nother animal) didn&#x27;t affect.</li>
            <li>This stuff, his charcoal, I guess, really does draw out the blackheads.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Point is I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had combination skin and this product really works.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Like it, skin feel really cleanse after used.</li>
            <li>It is much smoother on my face...</li>
            <li>I still get some pimples, but they seem to be a fast resolving.   </li>
            <li>I like the Garnier line of skin care products because they are so affordable and they really do well.</li>
            <li>but my blackheads had shown absolutely no improvement, and in fact had been made more pronounced.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very greasy, and my blackheads have been brought to the surface...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Acne Wash.</li>
            <li>Have purchased this 3 times now and converted a very picky roommate to it.</li>
            <li>use a gentle hydrating cleanser in the mornings.</li>
            <li>use a gentle hydrating cleanser in the mornings.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really remove my blackheads</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t so much helped with the blackhead&#x27;s on my nose</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has diminished most of my blackheads and has NOT dried out the skin on my nose(this is the only place i use it on my nose)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike many other products, I did not suffer a rush of breakouts as my skin cleared out.</li>
            <li>Unlike many other products, I did not suffer a rush of breakouts as my skin cleared out.</li>
            <li>I liked that it has really small microbeads</li>
            <li>but later I found it wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t break out easily and have never really had acne.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice more of an improvement with this on my blackheads than I have with any generic brand of similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even realize it until Garnier didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the blackheads imbedded in my nostrils and they looked paler and more vulnerable for lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li>I got too overzealous with this by using it twice a day (followed by my Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream) and my skin ended up very red and with a mild &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; sensation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended; I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li>you have oily skin, I highly recommend buying a cleanser with salicylic acid for your morning wash and using this in the evenings.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates far better than any other face wash I have tried, and I do think it is helping with my blackheads.</li>
            <li>The large pores on my forehead, which I spent thousands of dollars at dermatologists trying to remove, have never looked better and the smaller ones are disappearing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling so clean, helps swipe away any dry patches, and has helped keep my breakouts to a minimum.</li>
            <li>I like my skin dry and clean</li>
            <li>but it truly left my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>Within the first use, all of my dry skin was completely exfoliated, leaving my face soft, smooth, and dead skin free.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive/combo skin, and as soon as I noticed that this new scrub from Garnier has both charcoal, and salicylic acid in it, I grabbed one to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And mainly, it&#x27;s all natural..</li>
            <li>love this product so sad it cost more in a regular beauty supply store</li>
            <li>I have pretty combo/dry skin and the skin around my nose area is especially senitive.</li>
            <li>In the summer when you&#x27;re hot and sweaty, this is the only cleanser to use!</li>
            <li>The exfoliate is actually small pieces of charcoal, so it&#x27;s more like a micro scrub suspended in cleanser.</li>
            <li>my skin was actually soft!  </li>
            <li>The same exact thing happened.</li>
            <li>used this daily for the first week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a clean medicinal scent I really like, and the particles aren&#x27;t too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>It really does clean out my pores and get rid of my black heads!</li>
            <li>AMBI Even&amp;Clear Exfoliating Wash. The the scrubbing crystals are large and coarse and it dries out my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every face wash out on the market, with very minimal results.</li>
            <li>My t-zone gets very oily, leaving my nose especially, with deep blackheads and large pores.</li>
            <li>I use this every other day, because if I use it more then my skin will be too dry.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin clear And pores reduced...</li>
            <li>One thing I was hoping for was that this would clear out the blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 30, with clear skin otherwise) and nothing has ever worked.</li>
            <li>but it can be sensitive.</li>
            <li>I suffer from adult acne</li>
            <li>They ALL contain salicylic acid (at least most do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to have a real $150 facial for that.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t remove makeup at all and it stings when you apply the scrub anywhere near your eye.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>so bought this scrub to try and so far it has been going well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, if you massage gently, this product is gentle enough to use once daily.</li>
            <li>I just discovered this in a store a few months ago and have totally fallen in love with this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every alternative from Neutrogena, Biore, and Clean &amp; Clear over the years and saw little to no improvement with the blackheads I get on my nose.</li>
            <li>My expectations of anything involving removal of blackheads is likely too high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I got a small free sample of this and just had to buy it.</li>
            <li>I first wet my face and hands, then squeeze out a dime size amount.</li>
            <li>With proper and regular use, it really help decrease the comedienne.</li>
            <li>cuz it is always out of stock even at major retailers.</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for over 2 months and it has never dried out my skin!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only takes a day and for my pimples to disappear COMPLETELY with this product!</li>
            <li>My skin now is pretty dry and the larger blemishes are healing.</li>
            <li>This cleanser smells fabulous, does not over dry my skin but does help make it smoother and less prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>I though dried out was a sign of ultimate clean.  </li>
            <li>You can barely see them now</li>
            <li>stars (only because my blackheads arent completely gone)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mostly given up and just used poor strips since the majority of my problems where around my noise.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive when it comes to using different facial products, so when my face didn&#x27;t break out I was relieved.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s helped to tone down my breakouts a little bit! :)</li>
            <li>I am an 24 year old, African American women.</li>
            <li>Totally got rid of the black heads around the corners on my noise with the first use and</li>
            <li>This is the first product that I have found that made a difference without destroying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>yet it does not dry my skin to where I need to use some creams like Neutrogena Clear Pore astringent which would dry my skin to the point where it would start flaking.</li>
            <li>While this product helped me a lot with tiny bumps and large pores, I started to get large, hard cysts that take a long time to heal...</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s simply amazing and a great price point.</li>
            <li> I think this is good product ^^</li>
            <li> But no one is asking the question … How in the world did you ever think these microbeads would be a good thing?</li>
            <li> and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week when my skin is misbehaving at night, and use a good moisturizer afterwards to replenish my skin as this can be a tad drying.</li>
            <li> , it seems it&#x27;s doing a good job cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> It will make for a good exfoliator if you use it often.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was good</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I like to scrub my face with this before my shower then just jump in and wash it off, skin looks amazing afterwards!</li>
            <li> Great, light but effective product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!</li>

            <li> Nice exfoliation without over drying.</li>
            <li> Nice Item as described</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it&#x27;s still an effective scrub at the macro level.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, softer, and I am loving the lack of blackheads and my shrinking pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, softer, and I am loving the lack of blackheads and my shrinking pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened since about a month ago and my skin is healing nicely.</li>
            <li> Awesome new face wash!</li>
            <li> Perfect strength of micro beads, not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> and I thought that was a good thing, even though I never saw any significant results with regards to my acne</li>
            <li> This is a good product to like clean your face</li>
            <li> I always use this with a face sponge, it makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells SUPER GOOD.</li>
            <li> After a week, it got rid of most of my blackheads.</li>
            <li> I know everyone reacts differently to various products, but this was the best xmas gift I got myself.</li>
            <li> Caused more oil production and more acne for me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and the way it leaves my fave feeling</li>
            <li> doubt it removes blackheads but its an okay scrub..</li>
            <li> Absoultely love it.</li>
            <li> and i got even more.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after i use this</li>
            <li> I love most of garner face washes, it works well on my acne prone skin...</li>
            <li> Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out.</li>
            <li> My teens LOVE this cleanse.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I am a fan of many Garnier products but this has become one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I feel much better not wearing make-up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had so many breakouts ever.</li>
            <li> will say over the years I have tried many face washes and soaps and I have ALWAYS had a blackhead problem on my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like to be able to feel  the beads.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Garnier products!&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by this in the store and, after a friend&#x27;s recommendation, just had to try it</li>
            <li> remove ALL my blackheads, but most of them</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Like most products that say they remove it all, it does</li>
            <li> This is an okay face scrub.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products on the market</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But overall, this product is really awesome.</li>
            <li> I wanted better skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, if you like the smell of charcoal.</li>
            <li> Its better to use in the showever as it foams up a bit and can easily get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I would have loved if this cleanser got rid of my blackheads, but they haven&#x27;t really made a dent.</li>
            <li> I pressed my nose, and rose nostril blackheads came right out.</li>
            <li> It certainly gets the oils off my face and my skin stays oil free for a good part of the day</li>
            <li> but it feel more clean then,&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I would say that it was easily 75% of the blackheads were gone.</li>
            <li> Its has a strong perfume-like smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much better my face will get, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> They are as abundant as the first day.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t the best at clearing up black heads.</li>
            <li> and she combines using it with dry brushing and the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Cream Cleanser and says it&#x27;s been brilliant for her skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay mild exfoliator with its texture, but that is it.</li>
            <li> God knows how many products youve tried already IMO this one wont hurt and you may actually find pleasant</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin and huge, clogged  pores over my face for 25 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 2 days and already see a huge improvement in my blackheads.</li>
            <li> Having used this from December to March, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in blackheads.</li>
            <li> Honestly people, if you want to find an exfoliater, use an exfoliating brush and a gentle wash.</li>
            <li> After four days my face above my nose was healed and looked great</li>
            <li> The patch is almost healed but I wasn&#x27;t even as comfortable in my skin as I was even with the acne.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is probably a good fit.</li>
            <li> I really really don&#x27;t recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love it and treat it like pure gold!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the soft pleasant scent and the fine texture of the scrubbing crystals and charcoal.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and have noticed significant results.  </li>
            <li> In one use, I saw a significant decrease in my blackheads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good and considering how my face reacts very strongly to a lot of stuff, it actually is very gentle as far as scrubbing your skin goes.</li>
            <li> It is not as &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; as I like but it does clean well.</li>
            <li> and i liked feeling like I could concentrate the crystals to specific crystals without the sensation that I&#x27;m grinding my skin with a pumis stone or a cheese greater.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt clean my skin as well as I thought it would have.</li>
            <li> left my skin flawless and clear.</li>
            <li> The Garnier Clean +</li>
            <li> Blackhead Eliminating Scrub just feels like your skin is really clean without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li> This foams up well and rinses off cleanly, and does leave my skin feeling clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I scrubbed my face and instead of feeling like washing my face with coarse sand paper, it was pleasant  </li>
            <li> thing I can think of is the charcoal being the most effective ingredient lifting the \\&quot;impurities\\&quot; and oil from under my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is ok its not powerful or over bearing and</li>
            <li> This suits my oily skin perfectly, but someone with dry to normal skin may not want to use this scrub every day as I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product so far the best for black heads and greasy faces</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special here, folks.</li>
            <li> I have fairly good skin, the only problem it being oily.</li>
            <li> My whole life, I get much better results with drier skin, so I am going to stay with this until all impurities are gone.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> At first it was fine when i was using the product</li>
            <li> Helped my skin tremendously</li>
            <li> receive fast received as described so far works good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often make a big effort to buy the same products over and over, but this Garnier charcoal scrub is the best.</li>
            <li> Works great - doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and makes everything look and feel so much clearer and smoother after!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying the clean and clear 3 in 1 exfoliator because it clears up pores and removes blackheads and helps with acne and makes your face feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Supposedly charcoal the active kind draws impurities and in the case of your precious face</li>
            <li> I am using Clean and Clear 3-in-one Foaming Cleanser with better results.</li>
            <li> out!&lt;br /&gt;After the first time using it, I was hooked!</li>
            <li> I have resorted to home remedies such as DIY baking soda face masks and have seen better results in one application than weeks of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Two days of using a mild soap and a non-acidic moisturizer, and I was right as rain.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of the strongest acne fighters you can get for such a reasonable price, and with a good moisturizer it can work like magic to give you clear skin!</li>
            <li> With the help of this and some lotion product i bought, my face is so soft and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> so well my face really gets feeling super clean after I use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been self conscious about my blackheads and tried many products including the strips.</li>
            <li> It is really helping getting rid of my black heads and making my skin look beautiful.</li>
            <li> and smooth AND clean and NOt dried out.  </li>
            <li> This face wash does a great job of kepping my skin clear, smooth and helps alot with making my face less oily.</li>
            <li> Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain.</li>
            <li> product will make your skin feel smooth and like new.</li>
            <li> I think considering how well it works, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating beads are so fine, that they don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m looking forward to getting regular shipments :)</li>
            <li> That was the first use.  </li>
            <li> and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> And, blackheads require higher chemical peels as well.</li>
            <li> This one, you can feel the softness from the first rinse.</li>
            <li> Most of these face washes only differ by scent!</li>
            <li> I love this facial scrub</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This scrub is called the &amp;#34;Impurities Eliminating Scrub&amp;#34; here in Canada, but I love it just the same!</li>
            <li> I thought that this was an initial breakout like you get from many acne products, so I remained vigilant in my use of the scrub.</li>
            <li> By the end of the first week, I couldn&#x27;t find any blackheads on my face at all.</li>
            <li> So I was super excited when I found this, not only that but the reviews it</li>
            <li> As a 30 year old guy I have been lucky to have been without any breakouts in many years, suddenly last month that changed</li>
            <li> I thought my soft beautiful healthy ( rather than dried and pruned) skin was a fluke of trying a foreign product for the first time.  </li>
            <li> When I used the product the first time I applied to my whole face, scrubbed with my hands, then rinsed.</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft as well.</li>
            <li> If you want help w/ blackheads, you really need a 1-9% pure salicylic solution to apply 3-7 days a week.</li>
            <li> Very clean feeling and didn&#x27;t over dry my skin.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t REALLY obvious, so they aren&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li> When I read an article about how charcoal is now being used in soaps as an absorbing agent, I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this in the mail and it left me running for Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> This dries my face so much.</li>
            <li> I like the way this feels and works, but it is very fragrant and makes my allergies go bananas.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m just gonna buy clearsil and gently exfoliate my skin while it recovers.</li>
            <li> This thing really cleans blackheads.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the scrub to feel the way it did.</li>
            <li> and I thought I would try it to target the acne that AMBI and PanOxyl (a whole&#x27;nother animal) didn&#x27;t affect.</li>
            <li> This stuff, his charcoal, I guess, really does draw out the blackheads.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Point is I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had combination skin and this product really works.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Like it, skin feel really cleanse after used.</li>
            <li> It is much smoother on my face...</li>
            <li> I still get some pimples, but they seem to be a fast resolving.   </li>
            <li> I like the Garnier line of skin care products because they are so affordable and they really do well.</li>
            <li> but my blackheads had shown absolutely no improvement, and in fact had been made more pronounced.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very greasy, and my blackheads have been brought to the surface...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Acne Wash.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this 3 times now and converted a very picky roommate to it.</li>
            <li> use a gentle hydrating cleanser in the mornings.</li>
            <li> use a gentle hydrating cleanser in the mornings.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really remove my blackheads</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t so much helped with the blackhead&#x27;s on my nose</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has diminished most of my blackheads and has NOT dried out the skin on my nose(this is the only place i use it on my nose)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike many other products, I did not suffer a rush of breakouts as my skin cleared out.</li>

            <li> I liked that it has really small microbeads</li>
            <li> but later I found it wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t break out easily and have never really had acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice more of an improvement with this on my blackheads than I have with any generic brand of similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even realize it until Garnier didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the blackheads imbedded in my nostrils and they looked paler and more vulnerable for lack of a better word.  </li>
            <li> I got too overzealous with this by using it twice a day (followed by my Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream) and my skin ended up very red and with a mild &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; sensation.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended; I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> you have oily skin, I highly recommend buying a cleanser with salicylic acid for your morning wash and using this in the evenings.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> It exfoliates far better than any other face wash I have tried, and I do think it is helping with my blackheads.</li>
            <li> The large pores on my forehead, which I spent thousands of dollars at dermatologists trying to remove, have never looked better and the smaller ones are disappearing.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling so clean, helps swipe away any dry patches, and has helped keep my breakouts to a minimum.</li>
            <li> I like my skin dry and clean</li>
            <li> but it truly left my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> Within the first use, all of my dry skin was completely exfoliated, leaving my face soft, smooth, and dead skin free.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive/combo skin, and as soon as I noticed that this new scrub from Garnier has both charcoal, and salicylic acid in it, I grabbed one to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And mainly, it&#x27;s all natural..</li>
            <li> love this product so sad it cost more in a regular beauty supply store</li>
            <li> I have pretty combo/dry skin and the skin around my nose area is especially senitive.</li>
            <li> In the summer when you&#x27;re hot and sweaty, this is the only cleanser to use!</li>
            <li> The exfoliate is actually small pieces of charcoal, so it&#x27;s more like a micro scrub suspended in cleanser.</li>
            <li> my skin was actually soft!  </li>
            <li> The same exact thing happened.</li>
            <li> used this daily for the first week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a clean medicinal scent I really like, and the particles aren&#x27;t too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> It really does clean out my pores and get rid of my black heads!</li>
            <li> AMBI Even&amp;Clear Exfoliating Wash. The the scrubbing crystals are large and coarse and it dries out my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every face wash out on the market, with very minimal results.</li>
            <li> My t-zone gets very oily, leaving my nose especially, with deep blackheads and large pores.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day, because if I use it more then my skin will be too dry.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin clear And pores reduced...</li>
            <li> One thing I was hoping for was that this would clear out the blackheads on my nose</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 30, with clear skin otherwise) and nothing has ever worked.</li>
            <li> but it can be sensitive.</li>
            <li> I suffer from adult acne</li>
            <li> They ALL contain salicylic acid (at least most do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to have a real $150 facial for that.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t remove makeup at all and it stings when you apply the scrub anywhere near your eye.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and is relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> so bought this scrub to try and so far it has been going well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, if you massage gently, this product is gentle enough to use once daily.</li>
            <li> I just discovered this in a store a few months ago and have totally fallen in love with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every alternative from Neutrogena, Biore, and Clean &amp; Clear over the years and saw little to no improvement with the blackheads I get on my nose.</li>
            <li> My expectations of anything involving removal of blackheads is likely too high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I got a small free sample of this and just had to buy it.</li>
            <li> I first wet my face and hands, then squeeze out a dime size amount.</li>
            <li> With proper and regular use, it really help decrease the comedienne.</li>
            <li> cuz it is always out of stock even at major retailers.</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for over 2 months and it has never dried out my skin!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a day and for my pimples to disappear COMPLETELY with this product!</li>
            <li> My skin now is pretty dry and the larger blemishes are healing.</li>
            <li> This cleanser smells fabulous, does not over dry my skin but does help make it smoother and less prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I though dried out was a sign of ultimate clean.  </li>
            <li> You can barely see them now</li>
            <li> stars (only because my blackheads arent completely gone)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mostly given up and just used poor strips since the majority of my problems where around my noise.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive when it comes to using different facial products, so when my face didn&#x27;t break out I was relieved.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s helped to tone down my breakouts a little bit! :)</li>
            <li> I am an 24 year old, African American women.</li>
            <li> Totally got rid of the black heads around the corners on my noise with the first use and</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have found that made a difference without destroying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> yet it does not dry my skin to where I need to use some creams like Neutrogena Clear Pore astringent which would dry my skin to the point where it would start flaking.</li>
            <li> While this product helped me a lot with tiny bumps and large pores, I started to get large, hard cysts that take a long time to heal...</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews are right though.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice a vast improvement in my blackheads on my nose just a small difference.  </li>
            <li> The product smelled very masculine and the scrub had a very strange texture unlike other face scrubs I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This cleanser foams a lot, if you have a wet face and hands, so only a tiny bit is necessary.</li>
            <li> I would recommend witch hazel and Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt scrub if you&#x27;d like to remove black heads over time.</li>
            <li> I found using this product only once my nose became dry, peeling and itchy.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the extra dry, sensitive skin at the sides of my nose burned slightly when I used my moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> The only reason this product didn&#x27;t receive 5 stars was because I found this same product at my local Duane Reade for half the price.</li>
            <li> There are other similar washes and scrubs out there, and Garnier makes a similar looking package with the scrub is in a cream form (which I bought by accident thinking</li>
            <li> I rub it onto my lightly dampened skin in small circles and let it set on the skin for at least a minute so that the salicylic acid can do</li>
            <li> I rub it onto my lightly dampened skin in small circles and let it set on the skin for at least a minute so that the salicylic acid can do</li>
            <li> Since regularly using this charcoal formula shortly after thanksgiving, my face has cleared up noticeably after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It dries out your skin, so be careful with daily applications.</li>
            <li> I am 57 yeasr old and have had trouble with my skin since puberty.</li>
            <li> Way too drying if you have dry skin and does NOT clear blackheads.</li>
            <li> around quotations because it&#x27;s not exactly a scrub in the traditional sense of having shells or beads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with blackheads as long as I can remember and this stuff visibly reduced them in ONE wash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep ordering this as long as it works!</li>
            <li> I found that it didn&#x27;t hurt my skin as bad when I did it with my nighttime routine as that puts more moisture back into my skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face in anyway,</li>
            <li> My face was not too dry, so I decided to use the scrub two times a day.</li>
            <li> have combination-extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> The rest of my skin is horribly dry.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed by how many negative comments there were before I bought this product...</li>
            <li> but still the left a few blackheads around the corners of my noise and sometimes it seemed as if my pores where larger after using the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Have been using this item for about a week now</li>
            <li> In my case I definitely can not use the scrub daily because it over dried my skin.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have with it is that my blackheads really haven&#x27;t gone away after a few weeks of using it, but that could be chalked up to me not knowing what it is I&#x27;m doing as far as taking care of my face goes.</li>
            <li> I have never liked beads before, but this one seems tolerable and my skin is not totally tight after using it, just to be oily later in the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I have been using this product (though it contains the SAME ingredients other brands do minus the charcoal)</li>
            <li> This scrub has especially helped me clearing out my dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> but the bottom was a big dark patch.</li>
            <li> After several uses the black heads on my nose are still there and after using this my skin feels really dry</li>
            <li> Some are stubborn and require squeezing to force them out of the pore, but not nearly as many as I&#x27;ve dealt with over the last several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face is a lot less greasy and my pores are so much smaller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to help with me big pores and black heads over the years.</li>
            <li> But I noticed that after using it, my skin became very dry so heads up to the people who have combination skin like mine.</li>
            <li> These are a little too micro for me personally.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many things for my bad acne and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I am careful to avoid the eye area, and rinse well.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Not too rough, can be used daily&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling refreshed and brighter&lt;</li>
            <li> I tried the scrub again a few days later to just the areas of my face where I have blackheads.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Acne Wash Pink Grapefruit Cream Cleanser the rest of the week with my Clarisonic, rubbing it onto my skin to set for a minute before brushing it around.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Acne Wash Pink Grapefruit Cream Cleanser the rest of the week with my Clarisonic, rubbing it onto my skin to set for a minute before brushing it around.</li>
            <li> You can usually find it for less than $6 and it will easily last you a month if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> I was still skeptical however right up to these rinse.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I am not found of the smell but other than that</li>
            <li> and I started to get small white heads on my nose</li>
            <li> I had it recommended off a blog post along with a collection of other products.</li>
            <li> have dry skin, but when I use this product, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all if I don&#x27;t use an excessive amount of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful about what I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> You can usually find it for less than $6 and it will easily last you a month if you use it daily.an after sun lotion by Hawaiian Tropic that had aloe vera in it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it irritated my skin and left it red, dry, and blotchy.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the smell resembles men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> After only one use, I could tell this worked at least somewhat.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this is a not too thick gel, with tiny micro-bead scrubbers in it.</li>
            <li> acne flare ups have been down since I started using.</li>
            <li> It must be the charcoal, which oddly makes the soap look dark gray...</li>
            <li> These micro-particle polyethylene beads, which are less than 1mm in diameter and designed to be washed down the drain, are polluting lakes and the oceans.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in black heads.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say that every black head is gone, but I do see improvement.</li>
            <li> The scent is just amaizing , it gor rid of black heads on my nose in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Since I have begun using it, even though I am using it less now to save my skin, I am noticing my pores</li>
            <li> Since I have begun using it, even though I am using it less now to save my skin, I am noticing my pores</li>
            <li> but when i forgot to use it my skin broke out super bad.</li>
            <li> Before using the product i had little to zero blemishes.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying</li>
            <li> and I do have a little bit of dryness after using it</li>
            <li> ; hey I just tried to fried your face&amp;#34; Which is how I usually feel after using other products.</li>
            <li> The little charcoal pieces are evenly distributed (they don&#x27;t all fall to the bottom).</li>
            <li> This is a little bit of a hassle because remembering which product you used on which day can be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s maybe a little harsh for me, though -- not something I can use every day.</li>
            <li> But it is so heavily fragranced, felt like I was rubbing cologne on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> cuz I thought the sting it left behind was a sign the product was beneficial.  </li>
            <li> Will update this in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Dried out my face and did nothing for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> A few days of use and I kid you not, the blackheads were gone, and my skin was looking clearer and brighter than ever.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;ve got these horrible black speckles that are way more noticeable than they were before.</li>
            <li> My intention on using this was specifically for my blackheads because they were pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will buy again, but it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I am concerned about the possibility that there are microbeads in this product, but am not sure.</li>
            <li> This product works, even with a small amount used so it doesn&#x27;t need to be wasted.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But I have been using it for more than a month, and my skin looks horrible.</li>
            <li> I had hard blemishes all over my face.</li>
            <li> Ive had a hard time finding a face wash that worked well with ny sikn, untill now.</li>
            <li> It sucks all the moisture out of your skin and does nothing to improve blackheads and reduce pore size.</li>
            <li> and personally I have a bad problem with blackheads.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that a cleanser actually worked so well at eliminating blackheads.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> This got worse over the course of the week as it cleaned out the blackheads.</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong with this product?</li>
            <li> The sides of my nose harbor horrible blackheads but remains very dry.</li>
            <li> that means all the dirty up to the surface where it could be washed away.</li>
            <li> caused my skin to breakout really bad.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was the bad stuff exiting my skin</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone struggling to get rid of annoying blackheads!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who has a horrible problem with blackheads or acne except in the summer.  </li>
            <li> This caused me to breakout worst than the Proactiv.</li>
            <li> terrible product.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t too terrible.</li>
            <li> One of my friends has insanely oily skin</li>
            <li> It was my horrible mistake buying this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for the horrible blackheads on my chin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was shocked that a cleanser actually worked so well at eliminating blackheads. I&#x27;ve tried just about every alternative from Neutrogena, Biore, and Clean &amp; Clear over the years and saw little to no improvement with the blackheads I get on my nose. When I read an article about how charcoal is now being used in soaps as an absorbing agent, I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. In Canada, this is called &amp;#34;Impurity Eliminating Scrub&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s identical to the American product. After a week, it got rid of most of my blackheads. Some are stubborn and require squeezing to force them out of the pore, but not nearly as many as I&#x27;ve dealt with over the last several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will make your skin feel smooth and like new. I use it in the morning and at night and have been extremely happy with the results. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone struggling to get rid of annoying blackheads!</li>
            <li> It is not as &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; as I like but it does clean well. If you have sensitive skin, this is probably a good fit. Not sure if I will buy again, but it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Works great on my whiteheads</li>
            <li> Got this as an add-on during the holidays, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;m incredibly picky about facewashes and personally I have a bad problem with blackheads. Since regularly using this charcoal formula shortly after thanksgiving, my face has cleared up noticeably after only a few weeks. I know everyone reacts differently to various products, but this was the best xmas gift I got myself.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me. My expectations of anything involving removal of blackheads is likely too high. This stuff helps. It&#x27;s a never ending battle. I am concerned about the possibility that there are microbeads in this product, but am not sure. Microbeads never biodegrade.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Have to buy it from Amazon cuz it is always out of stock even at major retailers. Works well for my oily acne prone skin. Nice exfoliation without over drying.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive/combo skin, and as soon as I noticed that this new scrub from Garnier has both charcoal, and salicylic acid in it, I grabbed one to try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this about 2-3 times a week, for about two months now, and I am really happy with the results. It leaves my face feeling so clean, helps swipe away any dry patches, and has helped keep my breakouts to a minimum. The exfoliating beads are so fine, that they don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all. The consistency of this is a not too thick gel, with tiny micro-bead scrubbers in it. It has a fresh/unisex smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use this: I first wet my face and hands, then squeeze out a dime size amount. This cleanser foams a lot, if you have a wet face and hands, so only a tiny bit is necessary. I am careful to avoid the eye area, and rinse well.</li>
            <li> I liked that it has really small microbeads so it doesnt feel like im scratching my skin. But it is so heavily fragranced, felt like I was rubbing cologne on my face. Needless to say, it irritated my skin and left it red, dry, and blotchy.</li>
            <li> Caused more oil production and more acne for me.</li>
            <li> my face is a lot less greasy and my pores are so much smaller I love this product so far the best for black heads and greasy faces</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and I don&#x27;t have even the slightest decrease in blackheads on my nose. They are as abundant as the first day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and the way it leaves my fave feeling</li>
            <li> I think this is good product ^^</li>
            <li> This stuff has helped my acne a ton. Plus it smells SUPER GOOD.</li>
            <li> Over all I like it. Just feel it is bit not enough beans to do the scrub.</li>
            <li> love this product so sad it cost more in a regular beauty supply store</li>
            <li> doubt it removes blackheads but its an okay scrub..</li>
            <li> This face scrub has been a life saver! It really does clean out my pores and get rid of my black heads!</li>
            <li> Helped my skin tremendously</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this in the mail and it left me running for Subscribe &amp; Save. Seriously, this stuff is awesome. I washed my face not expecting anything different but it truly left my skin feeling super soft. I don&#x27;t have abnormal skin but it can be sensitive. This didn&#x27;t irritate me at all. Now I&#x27;m looking forward to getting regular shipments :)</li>
            <li> Worked for about a week and made a difference, then stopped working. Smells good though and great scrub.</li>
            <li> I was annoyed by how many negative comments there were before I bought this product...so I decided to try it anyways. All the negative reviews are right though. If anything, this product made me break out. Didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in black heads. I tried it for 1 month and then stopped. I would recommend witch hazel and Lush&#x27;s Ocean Salt scrub if you&#x27;d like to remove black heads over time. Makes skin super soft as well.</li>
            <li> This dries my face so much.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Has the stuff in it to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Its has a strong perfume-like smell. It seems to be working</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice more of an improvement with this on my blackheads than I have with any generic brand of similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> Absoultely love it. It is really helping getting rid of my black heads and making my skin look beautiful. With the help of this and some lotion product i bought, my face is so soft and healthy looking.  i will defintely continue to buy</li>
            <li> I like the way this feels and works, but it is very fragrant and makes my allergies go bananas. I can&#x27;t use it on my face unless I want to sneeze for hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to like clean your face but it isn&#x27;t the best at clearing up black heads. After several uses the black heads on my nose are still there and after using this my skin feels really dry so I have to put a moisturizer on. You&#x27;re better off buying the clean and clear 3 in 1 exfoliator because it clears up pores and removes blackheads and helps with acne and makes your face feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This stuff ruined my skin. Before using the product i had little to zero blemishes. My intention on using this was specifically for my blackheads because they were pretty bad. At first it was fine when i was using the product but when i forgot to use it my skin broke out super bad. I had hard blemishes all over my face. So i stopped using it and i got even more. So now I&#x27;m just gonna buy clearsil and gently exfoliate my skin while it recovers.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels after i use this but I don&#x27;t think it does anything about my blackheads at all.</li>
            <li> receive fast received as described so far works good</li>
            <li> Made my skin clear And pores reduced... Oil is washed away... I love most of garner face washes, it works well on my acne prone skin...</li>
            <li> Feels great. Has charcoal that&#x27;s why I bought it. Supposedly charcoal the active kind draws impurities and in the case of your precious face that means all the dirty up to the surface where it could be washed away.</li>
            <li> This thing really cleans blackheads. My nose has never been cleaner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good and considering how my face reacts very strongly to a lot of stuff, it actually is very gentle as far as scrubbing your skin goes. The only real complaint I have with it is that my blackheads really haven&#x27;t gone away after a few weeks of using it, but that could be chalked up to me not knowing what it is I&#x27;m doing as far as taking care of my face goes.</li>
            <li> Shame on you for allowing microbeads in your product(s). And don’t insult my intelligence by stating that you didn’t know they would be a danger to the environment. Where did you think these microbeads would end up? These micro-particle polyethylene beads, which are less than 1mm in diameter and designed to be washed down the drain, are polluting lakes and the oceans. Fish who swallow them are not getting the nutrition they need to live a healthy life, thus impacting the whole food chain. Many companies, including L’Oreal, The Body Shop, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble have agreed to phase out them out. But no one is asking the question … How in the world did you ever think these microbeads would be a good thing? It’s shameful. Avoid products with polyethylene as one of its ingredients. Microbeads have been put in facial scrub products, bath gels and toothpastes. For further information, simply put the words microbeads and pollution in your favorite search engine.</li>
            <li> My teens LOVE this cleanse. It is a little drying but we have seen great results with this and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Way too drying if you have dry skin and does NOT clear blackheads. I have pretty combo/dry skin and the skin around my nose area is especially senitive. I found using this product only once my nose became dry, peeling and itchy. It sucks all the moisture out of your skin and does nothing to improve blackheads and reduce pore size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who has a horrible problem with blackheads or acne except in the summer.  This cleanser gets rid of bumps--almost immediately. In the summer when you&#x27;re hot and sweaty, this is the only cleanser to use! I&#x27;ve washed my face in the morning and seen results by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t know what they put in it, but in the south where it&#x27;s 101 in the shade, it&#x27;s the thing to have.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting the scrub to feel the way it did. I would put &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; around quotations because it&#x27;s not exactly a scrub in the traditional sense of having shells or beads. The exfoliate is actually small pieces of charcoal, so it&#x27;s more like a micro scrub suspended in cleanser. It&#x27;s not a miracle product that will get rid of all your blackheads, but I like the smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face in anyway, As for my acne, there is no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliation with this product! My acne and acne scars have totally faded since I started using this product! Highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I am an 24 year old, African American women. My pores are constantly clogged, especially around the nose and chin area. Within the first use, all of my dry skin was completely exfoliated, leaving my face soft, smooth, and dead skin free. I would definitely recommend  following up with a moisturizer..but over all this is a great product.  No need to use every day. Use mabey once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> IT A with the OP.  I used to use AMBI Even&amp;Clear Exfoliating Wash. The the scrubbing crystals are large and coarse and it dries out my skin and I thought that was a good thing, even though I never saw any significant results with regards to my acne I was satisfied with the product cuz I thought the sting it left behind was a sign the product was beneficial.  A month or so ago, I saw a Garnier commercial for blackheads and I thought I would try it to target the acne that AMBI and PanOxyl (a whole&#x27;nother animal) didn&#x27;t affect. Specifically the blackheads imbedded in my nostrils, cheeks, and between my eyebrows.  The first thing I noticed was the soft pleasant scent and the fine texture of the scrubbing crystals and charcoal.  I just knew this would prove to be a rip off... I scrubbed my face and instead of feeling like washing my face with coarse sand paper, it was pleasant  and i liked feeling like I could concentrate the crystals to specific crystals without the sensation that I&#x27;m grinding my skin with a pumis stone or a cheese greater.  I was still skeptical however right up to these rinse.  TO MY UTTER SURPRISE my skin was actually soft!  and smooth AND clean and NOt dried out.  I though dried out was a sign of ultimate clean.  AMBI WAS STIPPING MY FACE and I didn&#x27;t even realize it until Garnier didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I checked out the blackheads imbedded in my nostrils and they looked paler and more vulnerable for lack of a better word.  I pressed my nose, and rose nostril blackheads came right out. Shutthefrontdoor I thought.  That was the first use.  I thought my soft beautiful healthy ( rather than dried and pruned) skin was a fluke of trying a foreign product for the first time.  The next morning I used it again. The eyebrow blackheads came out.  This stuff, his charcoal, I guess, really does draw out the blackheads.  I bought mine from Walgreens don&#x27;t remember the price I think around $8? Could have been 15, dunno.  But it&#x27;s my go to stuff now</li>
            <li> I am a fan of many Garnier products but this has become one of my favorites. I suffer from adult acne so I have to be very careful about what I put on my skin.  This cleanser smells fabulous, does not over dry my skin but does help make it smoother and less prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many things for my bad acne and blackheads. My acne scars have faded and my blackheads are non existent! I have been using it daily for over 2 months and it has never dried out my skin!</li>
            <li> I have fairly good skin, the only problem it being oily. Bought this once I saw the ad on TV. The product is great. It dries out your skin, so be careful with daily applications. My face is very sensitive when it comes to using different facial products, so when my face didn&#x27;t break out I was relieved. The only reason this product didn&#x27;t receive 5 stars was because I found this same product at my local Duane Reade for half the price. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for wanting the product w/o leaving the comfort of my bed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m a mid 30s female who still has the occasional breakout.  I got this  because of the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I use it twice a day and have noticed significant results.  specifically,  my face would get shiny during the day at work and by the time I was off work,  I couldn&#x27;t wait to use the face  cleansing pads in my car.  Since I started using this,  it dawned on me that I&#x27;ve forgotten all about using the cleansing pads after work.</li>
            <li> Doesnt clean my skin as well as I thought it would have. I like my skin dry and clean this leaves a slimy sort of feeling</li>
            <li> Nice Item as described</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads.  I still have them.</li>
            <li> This scrub didn&#x27;t do a thing for my blackhead. It&#x27;s an okay mild exfoliator with its texture, but that is it. Nothing special. If you want help w/ blackheads, you really need a 1-9% pure salicylic solution to apply 3-7 days a week. And, blackheads require higher chemical peels as well. Nothing special here, folks.</li>
            <li> OMG! I&#x27;ve had a problem with blackheads as long as I can remember and this stuff visibly reduced them in ONE wash! It&#x27;s been a week now and there almost gone and my pores are smaller than they have ever been. You can barely see them now and I feel much better not wearing make-up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point is I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product works, even with a small amount used so it doesn&#x27;t need to be wasted.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin, but when I use this product, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all if I don&#x27;t use an excessive amount of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a day and for my pimples to disappear COMPLETELY with this product! I love it and treat it like pure gold!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had combination skin and this product really works. I&#x27;ve pretty much tried every face wash out on the market, with very minimal results. This one, you can feel the softness from the first rinse. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple weeks, so I hope it keeps doing what it&#x27;s doing!</li>
            <li> I got a small free sample of this and just had to buy it. This stuff is amazing, I like to scrub my face with this before my shower then just jump in and wash it off, skin looks amazing afterwards!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin so when I saw that it was for oily skin I was ecstatic as Proactiv+ caused my skin to breakout really bad. I tried this product for over a month hoping eventually it would work but I&#x27;m sending it back. I&#x27;ve never had so many breakouts ever. This caused me to breakout worst than the Proactiv. Not to mention, I still have blackheads. It also didn&#x27;t help with my oily skin. I guess I&#x27;ll just visit my dermatologist. It may work for others but not me.</li>
            <li> Awesome new face wash! I just discovered this in a store a few months ago and have totally fallen in love with this. It exfoliates far better than any other face wash I have tried, and I do think it is helping with my blackheads. I won&#x27;t say that every black head is gone, but I do see improvement. Plus since this exfoliates so well my face really gets feeling super clean after I use this.</li>
            <li> Read the ingredients! Most of these face washes only differ by scent! They ALL contain salicylic acid (at least most do)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say over the years I have tried many face washes and soaps and I have ALWAYS had a blackhead problem on my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using this product (though it contains the SAME ingredients other brands do minus the charcoal) I find this product to be effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has diminished most of my blackheads and has NOT dried out the skin on my nose(this is the only place i use it on my nose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I can think of is the charcoal being the most effective ingredient lifting the \\&quot;impurities\\&quot; and oil from under my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is ok its not powerful or over bearing and the exfoliant/scub isnt too abrasive yet is noticeable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In end i will buy this product again in the future and recommend anyone who has blackheads give it a try! God knows how many products youve tried already IMO this one wont hurt and you may actually find pleasant results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars (only because my blackheads arent completely gone)</li>
            <li> I like to be able to feel  the beads.  These are a little too micro for me personally.  I don&#x27;t know if skin can tell they are there or not. I am a grandmother as apposed to a teen.  That may make all the difference.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Garnier products!&lt;br /&gt;I was intrigued by this in the store and, after a friend&#x27;s recommendation, just had to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;After the first time using it, I was hooked! This suits my oily skin perfectly, but someone with dry to normal skin may not want to use this scrub every day as I do.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic&lt;br /&gt;Does it&#x27;s job&lt;br /&gt;Not too rough, can be used daily&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin feeling refreshed and brighter&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t remove ALL my blackheads, but most of them</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have a lot of blackheads on my chin and nose. They aren&#x27;t REALLY obvious, so they aren&#x27;t a huge deal. I would have loved if this cleanser got rid of my blackheads, but they haven&#x27;t really made a dent. I use this every other day, because if I use it more then my skin will be too dry.  Other than that, I think it&#x27;s helped to tone down my breakouts a little bit! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to help with me big pores and black heads over the years. I&#x27;ve mostly given up and just used poor strips since the majority of my problems where around my noise. but still the left a few blackheads around the corners of my noise and sometimes it seemed as if my pores where larger after using the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Have been using this item for about a week now and I LOVE it. Totally got rid of the black heads around the corners on my noise with the first use and after using for about a week i am actually noticing my pores ARE getting smaller. I would recommend this to anyone!!! Like most products that say they remove it all, it does and I do have a little bit of dryness after using it but it feel more clean then,&amp;#34; hey I just tried to fried your face&amp;#34; Which is how I usually feel after using other products.</li>
            <li> Very good product and it does what suppose to do. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am 57 yeasr old and have had trouble with my skin since puberty. Since using this cleanser, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. It has been a miracle for me. I love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Like it, skin feel really cleanse after used. With proper and regular use, it really help decrease the comedienne. And mainly, it&#x27;s all natural..</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Rite Aid and use it daily. It&#x27;s been close to a month now and I have seen NO results. I have resorted to home remedies such as DIY baking soda face masks and have seen better results in one application than weeks of this stuff!</li>
            <li> FINAL UPDATE:  While this product helped me a lot with tiny bumps and large pores, I started to get large, hard cysts that take a long time to heal...I had 4 recently. This has caused me to discontinue the product. I am using Clean and Clear 3-in-one Foaming Cleanser with better results. It is much smoother on my face...smoothest cleanser I have ever used. I still get some pimples, but they seem to be a fast resolving.   I found this product by total accident...my daughter was using the DVR and paused on a Garnier commercial. I have had oily skin and huge, clogged  pores over my face for 25 years. Nothing has ever helped. After using this scrub 3 times, an especially huge pore that&#x27;s been on my nose for over a year is virtually gone. It must be the charcoal, which oddly makes the soap look dark gray...I like it though. My face is no longer so oily throughout the day. I don&#x27;t know how much better my face will get, but so far so good. I am going to alternate this product with the Garnier shine control gel, which seems about the same, but without the scrubbing beads. I have never liked beads before, but this one seems tolerable and my skin is not totally tight after using it, just to be oily later in the day. Will update this in a few weeks.  UPDATE: After about a month of alternating the scrub with the gel, I started getting some larger blemishes. My face was not too dry, so I decided to use the scrub two times a day. My skin now is pretty dry and the larger blemishes are healing. My whole life, I get much better results with drier skin, so I am going to stay with this until all impurities are gone. The large pores on my forehead, which I spent thousands of dollars at dermatologists trying to remove, have never looked better and the smaller ones are disappearing.</li>
            <li> After receiving a sample in the mail and using for three days, I ordered Garnier Cleanser from Amazon and discovered that it is about the same as all the rest.  I use twice a day with my Clarisonic Cleansing Brush.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my oily skin or disappearance of blackheads.  You have to have a real $150 facial for that.  It will take me a year or two to use this up.  I will use it until it runs out and then on to the next cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my breakouts, however I definitely can&#x27;t use it too often, or else my face ends up chapped and peeling. This has to be one of the strongest acne fighters you can get for such a reasonable price, and with a good moisturizer it can work like magic to give you clear skin!</li>
            <li> The charcoal is a bit of a gimmick, there&#x27;s no way any micropores would work with all that gel smothering it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s still an effective scrub at the macro level.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Feels it is very effective!</li>
            <li> Has helped a lot with my whiteheads and blackheads. I like the Garnier line of skin care products because they are so affordable and they really do well.</li>
            <li> Great, light but effective product!</li>
            <li> This is great. left my skin flawless and clear. O nly problem is that you might put lotion on afterwards becauses it gets ALL the oil away.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son, its heloing him with his blackheads.</li>
            <li> I love this facial scrub</li>
            <li> I really really don&#x27;t recommend this product!!! I have sensitive skin but I don&#x27;t break out easily and have never really had acne. However, I&#x27;ve always had blackheads. So I was super excited when I found this, not only that but the reviews it show&#x27;d were very good. When I used the product the first time I applied to my whole face, scrubbed with my hands, then rinsed. (I also used the moisturizer that I always use.) The product smelled very masculine and the scrub had a very strange texture unlike other face scrubs I&#x27;ve used. It also doesn&#x27;t remove makeup at all and it stings when you apply the scrub anywhere near your eye. The next day my face had multiple breakouts and my skin was red and blotchy. Not only that but my blackheads had shown absolutely no improvement, and in fact had been made more pronounced. I tried the scrub again a few days later to just the areas of my face where I have blackheads. The same exact thing happened. I was very disappointed with this product and I really don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is an okay face scrub.  I really didn&#x27;t notice a vast improvement in my blackheads on my nose just a small difference.  In my case I definitely can not use the scrub daily because it over dried my skin.</li>
            <li> terrible product. It does not work at all. It doesn&#x27;t remove blackheads, it doesn&#x27;t remove oil, it basically doesn&#x27;t do anything. It was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This scrub is called the &amp;#34;Impurities Eliminating Scrub&amp;#34; here in Canada, but I love it just the same! It&#x27;s got a clean medicinal scent I really like, and the particles aren&#x27;t too harsh on my skin. I use it once a week when my skin is misbehaving at night, and use a good moisturizer afterwards to replenish my skin as this can be a tad drying. It definitely helps with clogged pores and pimples.</li>
            <li> It takes the oil away from my skin</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and is relatively inexpensive.  Give its try.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It has a very nice cooling effect on the skin.</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong with this product? It makes my skin very greasy, and my blackheads have been brought to the surface... But they have NOT gone away. Therefore, I&#x27;ve got these horrible black speckles that are way more noticeable than they were before. I thought that this was an initial breakout like you get from many acne products, so I remained vigilant in my use of the scrub. But I have been using it for more than a month, and my skin looks horrible. I&#x27;m going back to Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Acne Wash.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. I don&#x27;t often make a big effort to buy the same products over and over, but this Garnier charcoal scrub is the best. There are other similar washes and scrubs out there, and Garnier makes a similar looking package with the scrub is in a cream form (which I bought by accident thinking I had THIS product.) Not nearly as good. The Garnier Clean + Blackhead Eliminating Scrub just feels like your skin is really clean without being too abrasive. I don&#x27;t use it daily but every couple of days. Have purchased this 3 times now and converted a very picky roommate to it. Highly recommended; I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I am not found of the smell but other than that, it seems it&#x27;s doing a good job cleaning my face.  I use it every night.</li>
            <li> As a 30 year old guy I have been lucky to have been without any breakouts in many years, suddenly last month that changed and I started to get small white heads on my nose so bought this scrub to try and so far it has been going well. It certainly gets the oils off my face and my skin stays oil free for a good part of the day yet it does not dry my skin to where I need to use some creams like Neutrogena Clear Pore astringent which would dry my skin to the point where it would start flaking. I wash with this during my morning and night shower and it seems to do the trick. One thing I was hoping for was that this would clear out the blackheads on my nose but that has not happened. As a overall face wash though I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been self conscious about my blackheads and tried many products including the strips. I&#x27;ve used this for 2 days and already see a huge improvement in my blackheads. I&#x27;m a big fan of the texture and feel like it exfoliates my face. I think considering how well it works, the price is very reasonable. The only negative is the smell resembles men&#x27;s cologne but it isn&#x27;t too terrible. I&#x27;ll keep ordering this as long as it works!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! The scent is just amaizing , it gor rid of black heads on my nose in less than a week. I will keep purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Dried out my face and did nothing for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had it recommended off a blog post along with a collection of other products. They basically said to use five products and it would get rid of blackheads. All of the products were out of stock with the exception of this one when I went, which must of been fate. This has been the only product I have needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily skin, I highly recommend buying a cleanser with salicylic acid for your morning wash and using this in the evenings. I found that it didn&#x27;t hurt my skin as bad when I did it with my nighttime routine as that puts more moisture back into my skin. Oily skin, will want to use this daily. It will make for a good exfoliator if you use it often. One of my friends has insanely oily skin and she combines using it with dry brushing and the Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Cream Cleanser and says it&#x27;s been brilliant for her skin. She looks younger as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination-extra dry skin. My t-zone gets very oily, leaving my nose especially, with deep blackheads and large pores. The rest of my skin is horribly dry. The sides of my nose harbor horrible blackheads but remains very dry. I&#x27;ve tried many products on the market and they all either do nothing for my blackheads, or they damage my skin to the point of it cracking open and even bleeding. This is the first product that I have found that made a difference without destroying my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this daily for the first week I got it. In one use, I saw a significant decrease in my blackheads. I would say that it was easily 75% of the blackheads were gone. By the end of the first week, I couldn&#x27;t find any blackheads on my face at all. I did notice that the extra dry, sensitive skin at the sides of my nose burned slightly when I used my moisturizer afterwards. This got worse over the course of the week as it cleaned out the blackheads. It wasn&#x27;t anything I couldn&#x27;t tolerate, even with my wimpy pain tolerance, but it did make me spot treat that area with an after sun lotion by Hawaiian Tropic that had aloe vera in it. If you have extra sensitive skin, I would use this carefully until you see how your skin reacts. Unlike many other products, I did not suffer a rush of breakouts as my skin cleared out. Since I have begun using it, even though I am using it less now to save my skin, I am noticing my pores are shrinking rather well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a gentle hydrating cleanser in the mornings. At night, I use this three times a week. I rub it onto my lightly dampened skin in small circles and let it set on the skin for at least a minute so that the salicylic acid can do it&#x27;s job before rinsing it off. I use Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil-Free Acne Wash Pink Grapefruit Cream Cleanser the rest of the week with my Clarisonic, rubbing it onto my skin to set for a minute before brushing it around. My skin is smoother, softer, and I am loving the lack of blackheads and my shrinking pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to everyone. It&#x27;s simply amazing and a great price point. You can usually find it for less than $6 and it will easily last you a month if you use it daily.an after sun lotion by Hawaiian Tropic that had aloe vera in it.

            <li> skin feels refreshed after using. acne flare ups have been down since I started using.</li>
            <li> Its great I always use this with a face sponge, it makes my skin very smooth. Its better to use in the showever as it foams up a bit and can easily get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot as a scrub. It doesn&#x27;t really remove my blackheads but I like using it as a regular scrub!</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin and it minimized my pores a great deal!</li>
            <li> Ive had a hard time finding a face wash that worked well with ny sikn, untill now. This face wash does a great job of kepping my skin clear, smooth and helps alot with making my face less oily.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it works wonders! My skin has never been better!</li>
            <li> I love this product. This scrub has especially helped me clearing out my dark spots on my face. Hasn&#x27;t so much helped with the blackhead&#x27;s on my nose but it has made my pores smaller than they were before. Which is great! But I noticed that after using it, my skin became very dry so heads up to the people who have combination skin like mine. It&#x27;s not a big deal for me as I always put on moisturizer after cleaning my face. But overall, this product is really awesome. My skin is balanced in color and my pores are definitely smaller. Just wish my blackheads on my nose would disappear already!</li>
            <li> Works great - doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and makes everything look and feel so much clearer and smoother after!</li>
            <li> Honestly people, if you want to find an exfoliater, use an exfoliating brush and a gentle wash. It was my horrible mistake buying this product. I thought the smell was good and I followed the directions. Twice daily and then every night. I wanted better skin so I followed it. After four days my face above my nose was healed and looked great but the bottom was a big dark patch. I assumed it was the bad stuff exiting my skin but later I found it wasn&#x27;t true. It was the exfoliater. The patch is almost healed but I wasn&#x27;t even as comfortable in my skin as I was even with the acne. I haven&#x27;t opened since about a month ago and my skin is healing nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, if you like the smell of charcoal. Having used this from December to March, I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference in blackheads. And quite frankly, it irritated my allergies. Don&#x27;t buy if you&#x27;re looking for a miracle.</li>
            <li> Very clean feeling and didn&#x27;t over dry my skin. Perfect strength of micro beads, not harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> After only one use, I could tell this worked at least somewhat. I checked the mirror before and after, and could see fewer blackheads. They weren&#x27;t all gone, but a lot of them were. So I&#x27;m happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also contains salicylic acid, which should help with breakouts. The little charcoal pieces are evenly distributed (they don&#x27;t all fall to the bottom). This foams up well and rinses off cleanly, and does leave my skin feeling clean after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s maybe a little harsh for me, though -- not something I can use every day. On the package I have, it recommends alternating with another product. This is a little bit of a hassle because remembering which product you used on which day can be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try if blackheads are a problem for you, though.</li>
            <li> Its worked so well on oily skin and bkackheads</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product in the mail yesterday and I woke up with results. I felt it work instantly! Definitely purchasing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product with expectations. I&#x27;ve tried everything for the horrible blackheads on my chin (I&#x27;m 30, with clear skin otherwise) and nothing has ever worked. This DOES. A few days of use and I kid you not, the blackheads were gone, and my skin was looking clearer and brighter than ever. I now swear by this stuff! It smells good and is pleasant to use, too. One word of warning: give your skin a break every couple of days. I got too overzealous with this by using it twice a day (followed by my Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream) and my skin ended up very red and with a mild &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; sensation. Two days of using a mild soap and a non-acidic moisturizer, and I was right as rain. I&#x27;d say, if you massage gently, this product is gentle enough to use once daily.</li>
