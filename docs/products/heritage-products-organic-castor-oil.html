            <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>

            <li>, It doesn&#x27;t really stop the hair loss completely, it kinda just slows it down because of the oil properties</li>
            <li>So much nicer than the other brand I was using</li>
            <li>It is a bit gooey and thick, but the end result is worth it!</li>
            <li>Can apply the oil on the whole scalp for few minutes or before washing it off completely with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>It is priced higher than Heritage&#x27;s conventional castor oil since organic is more expensive to produce.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using this product as a mix with evoo, for about 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen much results other than my skin being soft.</li>
            <li> so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little worried this castor oil would irritate/inflame my acne, but on the contrary, after I rinse it off, my skin feels tight rather than super oily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Heritage probably the highest selling quantity producer of castor oil in organic form as well as conventional form based in Virginia was sold few years ago to a Utah company with many lines of beauty products.</li>
            <li> I went to my local natural foods store and purchased castor oil.  </li>
            <li> , It doesn&#x27;t really stop the hair loss completely, it kinda just slows it down because of the oil properties</li>
            <li> So much nicer than the other brand I was using</li>
            <li> It is a bit gooey and thick, but the end result is worth it!</li>
            <li> Can apply the oil on the whole scalp for few minutes or before washing it off completely with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> It is priced higher than Heritage&#x27;s conventional castor oil since organic is more expensive to produce.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for skin problems and there is nothing close to this for deep long moisturizing as well as healing.</li>
            <li> Bottle is glass and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and now I can see where the scar is getting flat and have stopped itching.</li>
            <li> My lashes used to be LONG with Lattise  but after using it for a couple of years the skin around my eyes was darkening and ringed with red.</li>
            <li> I mix it with aloe vera because it&#x27;s pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase again when I run out (although that won&#x27;t be for a very long time).</li>
            <li> I am currently using one drop in each eye at night before I go to bed to eliminate my dry eye problem in the morning when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> and my hair is so so soft after using it, however u have to use little , bcas its more than enough and that its very difficult to wash off...</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil -</li>
            <li> Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was using this as face wash mixed in with other oils, but it was way too drying for my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes at night for one thing but the list of uses is very long</li>
            <li> I have severe dry eye problems.  </li>
            <li> Finding pure, organic products that are reasonably priced can be difficult, but this brand fits the bill!  </li>
            <li> not sure how this people uses for this product, but so far i didn&#x27;t see any results..  </li>
            <li> I had surgery and it left a hypertrophic scar down my stomach</li>
            <li> I have noticed my hair sheds less when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> you only need a little.</li>
            <li> It hydrates my skin and it doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.  :)</li>
            <li> for the product its self, it is as claimed and the ingredients are cold pressed organic hexane free castor oil.</li>
            <li> The product is I expected.  </li>
            <li> I just put half the amount of shampoo, rub it in my palm to mix the shampoo and the CO, apply it as shampoo every single time.</li>
            <li> The Castor oil is very thick, which I assume is normal for castor oil.</li>
            <li> comes in glass amber bottle which i can reuse for other things</li>
            <li> have a terrible pain on my left upper arms for more than 6 months for that my doctor prescribed 3 type of medicine with some exercise but all are vain.  </li>
            <li> Harmonizes Extremely Well with the body</li>
            <li> Started using this on the recommendation of other reviews here and other internet sites.  </li>
            <li> I use it at bedtime on my hands and when I wake up my pain is diminished extremely.  </li>
            <li> Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO&#x27;s omega-9 fatty acids can help.</li>
            <li> Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but castor oils omega-9 fatty acids can help.</li>
            <li> just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
            <li> since its castor oil is organic when shipped from India just like majority of castor oils which are produced and shipped from India regardless of conventional or organic but Heritage&#x27;s manufacturing in Virginia does not have the USDA organic approval</li>
            <li> I mix CO with AO to remove dark spots on my skin because of the scabs that I get from mountain biking.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the cap was cracked when I got it.</li>
            <li> Although this I ordered this for a friend, I had bought it previously for me.</li>
            <li> or otherwise it will mess up  pillow/bed.</li>
            <li> just use little on scalp.....</li>
            <li> Castor oil is sticky, so I put it in a bottle with a little organic coconut oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> pure, cold pressed ricinus communis (castor) oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lid is either so thin or so brittle that when you try to put it back on the bottle, it shatters immediately.</li>
            <li> Will update review in a few months time.</li>
            <li> Goes on heavy oil but absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> I leave it for few hours and then wash it off.</li>
            <li> and it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The pharmacies just sell the garbage castor oil that has been grown and processesed with garbage chemicals and a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I have recommended too a few people already.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier</li>
            <li> I pour a little in a  small glass bottle that has a glass eye dropper to keep it sterile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive department store products claiming to grow the hair back</li>
            <li> I was cooking breakfast this morning and realized that I was not yelping as usual as I moved around the kitchen.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid to put it directly in my eyes, so I just smear it over my eyelids and under and around my eyes at night before bed.  </li>
            <li> ..is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> We like the naturalness of this remedy, vs. drugs that are hard on the liver or kidneys.</li>
            <li> I use it for a lot of  things - lately started rubbing it into the brown spots (age spots) on my hands</li>
            <li> Took at least a week to arrive in Canada.  </li>
            <li> It is a slow process</li>
            <li> BUT does that mean it&#x27;s not Castor oil or has been diluted?</li>
            <li> In the mean  time I heard about Castor oil</li>
            <li> It is very thick and I am not sure if it is helping with my hair</li>
            <li> And, this is after he has spent a fortune on Advil Cold &amp; Sinus (with pseudoephedrine) trying to eliminate the problem.  </li>
            <li> Poor package protection for a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it a 5 if I didn&#x27;t receive it broken.  </li>
            <li> where others fail regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like organic and cold pressed which means no chemicals and no bug juice.</li>
            <li> I never received this but did get an almost immediate email stating that they no longer shipped this, as it came in glass bottle and they had had bad luck with breakage.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with water in a spray bottle and sprits my hair when I wake up and before bed trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> use this oil as a base for an acne mask.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it for hair, skin and eye lashes...</li>
            <li> Castor oil is a powerful healer! After an epsom salt bath, I put it on my skin before bed (all over body and face) - this is incredible to help get your lymph system moving.</li>
            <li> The lid is either so thin or so brittle that when you try to put it back on the bottle, it shatters immediately.</li>
            <li> love this product I would buy it again</li>
            <li> very good quality..i use it for my hair mixed with coconut oil...</li>
            <li> This product works excellent for healing skin. The healing properties of the oil also helps with strains swollen or joint it&#x27;s not just for use as a laxative. Simply research help with fast healing of rotator cup surgery and use in non evasive.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it is in a glass bottle. Always choose glass over plastic! 6 more words required. 2 more</li>
            <li> Finding pure, organic products that are reasonably priced can be difficult, but this brand fits the bill!  Exactly what I wanted: cold-pressed, hexane-free, organic castor oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this oil as a base for an acne mask.  At first I was a little worried this castor oil would irritate/inflame my acne, but on the contrary, after I rinse it off, my skin feels tight rather than super oily.  So it is great for drying up pimples, but following with a good moisturizer is definitely needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, clear color, no cloudiness at all, and it smells great! The best quality Castor oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this castor oil it already give me such a nice and long lashes I use it every night and I love it. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil, I use it for my hair, sore muscles, my belly...etc.</li>
            <li> Never used castor oil before.  It is very thick and I am not sure if it is helping with my hair but I will give it more time.  The shipping and handling of my product was as I expected and I am overall pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived fresh and works well in my homemade hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> Nice product on Parasites Protocol.</li>
            <li> not sure how this people uses for this product, but so far i didn&#x27;t see any results..  also  it has a stinky odor that i kept throwing up every time i use it... other people said it smells good, so i thought maybe mine is expired, . i was looking for expiration date but seen nothing on it..</li>
            <li> It works as an exceptional moisturizer.The fact that it is organic is an asset. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> It is a great product, i like the fact that it s in a glass container. I ve purhased it to use as eyedrop. I hadnt been been able to wear my contacts longer period of time for t least two years. After using only 5 days My eyes began to feel much better, now i can wear my contacts almost no problem for whole day!</li>
            <li> Although this I ordered this for a friend, I had bought it previously for me. I thinks it is great, and have found many uses for it.</li>
            <li> Its just as ordered and works well for my needs.  It doesnt have a scent, which I love.  It is the right consistancy.</li>
            <li> This product tastes a lot like peanut oil and is not as bad-tasting as Castor oil is said to be. BUT does that mean it&#x27;s not Castor oil or has been diluted? I just don&#x27;t know at this point.</li>
            <li> Bought it to apply to my eyelashes as I&#x27;ve ready they will grow! I hope they do. Will update review in a few months time.</li>
            <li> I use this from wrinkles on my face to a boil on my butt! Great under make up-really rids acne. Goes on heavy oil but absorbs into your skin. My teenage son&#x27;s acne really improved.  Slathering my feet during the winter&#x27;s torture up North. Will not be with out it put it on any body part.  I encourage you to read up on the benefits of using castor oil.</li>
            <li> The product is superb and the packaging for shipment equally so - since it comes in glass and the weather has been severe, I especially appreciated that.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this on her hair and eyebrows and her small bald spot has filled in and her eyebrows are full. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this castor oil.  I am currently using one drop in each eye at night before I go to bed to eliminate my dry eye problem in the morning when I wake up.  I especially like that this comes in a glass bottle, is organic, and hexane free.  I am very pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> So much nicer than the other brand I was using and I liked that one too!  Can&#x27;t beat the glass bottle and results from this one. I use it for a lot of  things - lately started rubbing it into the brown spots (age spots) on my hands and I swear two applications and they are fading!! I also use it with an aloe cream I have on achy joints and there is almost immediate improvement.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I really like this castor oil. It is helping with scar tissue and I&#x27;m using for lymph drainage, on my face. I really love this!</li>
            <li> Pros : Excellent moisturizer, without too much greasiness (once it soaks in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Maybe I wasn&#x27;t supposed to take this internally, I don&#x27;t know, but I did as part of a parasite cleanse and noticed it really seemed to stress my liver (light-colored stool). I only tried it twice this way, but both times it made me feel toxic, which is why I&#x27;m on the fence with 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the best I can find.</li>
            <li> Review of Heritage Organic CO;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heritage probably the highest selling quantity producer of castor oil in organic form as well as conventional form based in Virginia was sold few years ago to a Utah company with many lines of beauty products. Heritage claims organic castor oil but not USDA organic castor oil since its castor oil is organic when shipped from India just like majority of castor oils which are produced and shipped from India regardless of conventional or organic but Heritage&#x27;s manufacturing in Virginia does not have the USDA organic approval so Heritage sells it as organic but not USDA organic. It is priced higher than Heritage&#x27;s conventional castor oil since organic is more expensive to produce. It is a refined oil, cold-pressed not expeller pressed, without hexane gas and probably the only ORGANIC castor oil brand which specifies NO HEXANE where others fail regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CO is the most important oil out of handful of oils that I daily as beauty mix. I just put half the amount of shampoo, rub it in my palm to mix the shampoo and the CO, apply it as shampoo every single time. I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO&#x27;s omega-9 fatty acids can help. I leave it for few hours and then wash it off. I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth. I mix with VCO since it keeps the mix not only liquid but runny. It is the best mix after shaving. I apply the mix to my whole body before mountain biking without any shirt or pumping iron at the gym. The mix keeps the bees and flies away.  I mix CO with AO to remove dark spots on my skin because of the scabs that I get from mountain biking. I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any oil from any nut, seed or grain will go rancid, having no nutritional value shortly after production so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.onal value shortly after production so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.gle day since it damages hair and the natural oil of the hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but castor oils omega-9 fatty acids can help. Can apply the oil on the whole scalp for few minutes or before washing it off completely with apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li> comes in glass amber bottle which i can reuse for other things and well its castor oil and its very sticky</li>
            <li> Fast service, excellent product!</li>
            <li> I bought this Castor oil to try out oil cleansing for my face. I am very pleased with this oil. It feels great on your skin and soothes redness. Oil cleansing with this castor oil has cleared my face. I will continue to buy this as my face wash. Very please :)</li>
            <li> This item came quickly. Package nicely, oil is very heavy you only need a little. I purchased this oil to help with acne scars and re growth of hair. I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet but it&#x27;s only been 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s organic and the price was good. I try my best for myself and my kids to only put things in or on us that is free from chemicals. I&#x27;m using it as a scalp treatment/hair growth and I like it.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the castor oil. The Quanity and the Quality of it is great. I have recommended it to ll my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for oil packs and for eyebrows/eyelashes. for the latter I mix it with vit E oil and apply on brows and lashes. for oil packs you soak flannel wool with the oil. it smells and looks right, like I remember from my childhood. consistency seems right too.&lt;br /&gt;ingredients: pure, cold pressed ricinus communis (castor) oil.&lt;br /&gt;cold pressed, hexane free. 16 oz glass bottle</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for shrinking pore size and drawing dirt and oil off a person face. This is a must have for any home.</li>
            <li> I give this product, Heritage Organic Castor oil a 5 star rating because it is organic and the price was very reasonable. I try to buy all organic products. I have been using it for awhile on my face at night and my face looks so soft and full of moisture in the morning that I don&#x27;t even wash it. I would recommend it to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Shirley Smiley</li>
            <li> i used this for a castor oil pack and its amazing castor oil, it doesn&#x27;t smell and i didnt have to much a mess issue ...i liked</li>
            <li> Love it.  I use it on my eyelashes to stimulate growth.</li>
            <li> Very good product big conditioning for super healthy hair. Very satisfied with the price for that quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. I use it on my eyelashes to remove eye makeup...works wonders! I also use it on my scalp for hair growth and moisture. I have noticed my hair sheds less when I use it regularly. I&#x27;m a curly haired girl...so that&#x27;s a biggie for me!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SERVICE AND CONVENIENCES! GREAT PRICE AND SERVICE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i WOULD ORDER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE......LOVE THE CONVENIENCES OF ONLINE SHOPPING</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. it helped grow my eyebrow so fast. I will keep using this forever. And the bottle is HUGE, so you&#x27;ll only  need to  buy it once and it will last for life</li>
            <li> Great condition, slathered it on after my bad sunburn and it never hurt very much and did not peel. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this castor oil. It makes my eyelashes grow and my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I love it, The smell , its pure castor oil.....and my hair is so so soft after using it, however u have to use little , bcas its more than enough and that its very difficult to wash off...just use little on scalp.....im never going to use any other castor oil for sure....thumbs up......</li>
            <li> Came fast packaged very well happy with purchase thank you</li>
            <li> ..is hard to find.  This oil is bottled in a quality, dark-colored glass bottle which protects the oil from light rays.  I have searched many a bricks and mortar &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; stores for castor oil in a glass bottle to no avail.  It was great to find this nearly miraculous healing oil bottled in glass.  Thank you Heritage Store, Edgar Cayce and Amazon.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  I bought the oil for the purpose of using on my eyebrows that had been over waxed over the years.  I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive department store products claiming to grow the hair back and it was a waste of money.  I read where castor oil would do the job and it has not disappointed.  It is a slow process but it is working. Recently, I read where castor oil would help with lipomas and after 2 weeks of applying castor oil two and three times a day they are shrinking.  I have 4 lipomas on my legs and they were growing more aggressively lately and was going to have to have them surgically removed but I wanted to try this first.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and fast delivery! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious about the sleeping healer Edgar Cayce...found a Youtube instructional video on Castor Oil packs and I&#x27;m going to give it a go...:)</li>
            <li> this is perfect because it is in glass.  I prefer the glass bottle over plastic.  I love that it is organic.  I use this for many many things... but especially for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and I heard castor oil really helps.  It certainly has not healed her condition, however it does seem to take the itchiness away.  She actually asks for it when her condition starts flaring up.  I also notice if I put other aloe creams on her, it seems to still hurt, however anytime I use the castor oil, she holds out her arm expecting me to put it on her.  :-)  I will continue using it for this purpose.  Good luck with everyone else!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t 100% pure but I didn&#x27;t check before I purchased it,so it was my fault otherwise good deal.</li>
            <li> Poor package protection for a glass bottle.It arrived shattered.</li>
            <li> When I was young, my mother would give us a good dose of castor oil because of all the health benefits. It was considered a cure-all for whatever ailed us. Now I use it for hydrating my skin and hair. I saturate my hair with a quarter-size portion on my hand and then I work it into my hair until it distributed. After a couple hours, I wash it with an organic shampoo and the results are incredible. I don&#x27;t need anything else in the way of conditioning. I end up with the softest and most manageable hair ever.</li>
            <li> I really like that this product comes in an amber glass bottle. I&#x27;ve been using this castor oil for oil cleansing and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and I&#x27;ve been using this product as a mix with evoo, for about 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t seen much results other than my skin being soft. I heard it was really good at killing bacteria on your skin by getting into the pores and cleaning them out. I guess we&#x27;ll see how well it works after a month. c: However, the quality of it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing. I have very dry skin, and I apply a light layer of this with a warm washcloth.  Instant relief to tight (from freshly washed) skin, and pleasant &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that lasts. Probably would be a bit heavy on oily skin...but great for mine.</li>
            <li> I got this oil along with sunflower oil to start the oil cleansing method. The Castor oil is very thick, which I assume is normal for castor oil. I wouldn&#x27;t know because I never bought it before. I like that it comes in a glass container which does not leech harmful chemicals or toxins into the oil.</li>
            <li> My husband has been rubbing Castor Oil on either side of his nose for sinus issues when he goes to bed and this really seems to  help with that. And, this is after he has spent a fortune on Advil Cold &amp; Sinus (with pseudoephedrine) trying to eliminate the problem.  We like the naturalness of this remedy, vs. drugs that are hard on the liver or kidneys.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  A big ol&#x27; bottle of Castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for body and hair.  Took at least a week to arrive in Canada.  But I got exactly what is seen in the photo, and for a fair price as well.  I&#x27;m content.</li>
            <li> Great castor oil. It&#x27;s way better than Jamaican black castor oil. It healed my razor bumps. I tried jbco on it but it didn&#x27;t work. Heritage brand manufacturers the best castor oil and they&#x27;ve won my trust. I&#x27;ll buy the product forever!</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked well for what I have used it for. I use it under my eyes at night for one thing but the list of uses is very long so you will just have to do a web search on all the uses of castor oil. For all that I use this castor oil for I have had terrific results.</li>
            <li> Do a web search on castor oil. You will be amazed at all the uses, including growing hair, detoxing the liver and the most amazing little goes a long way moisturizer. I have tried everything for skin problems and there is nothing close to this for deep long moisturizing as well as healing.</li>
            <li> As expected, with great customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Very good on the skin and helps maintain my natural eyelashes</li>
            <li> I rated 5 stars for packing and shipment.  The items was in glass bottle and packed in with bobble plastic sheet.  I ordered two bottle of castor oil and both are shipped in safe manner.&lt;br /&gt;I have a terrible pain on my left upper arms for more than 6 months for that my doctor prescribed 3 type of medicine with some exercise but all are vain.  Finally my doctor plan to refer me to physiotherapist. In the mean  time I heard about Castor oil and I applied in the affected area before going to my bed.  Pillow and bed sheets to be covered by old bed sheet or otherwise it will mess up  pillow/bed. Within two days 50% of my pain gone and I cancelled my physiotherapist’s appointment and continue applying castor oil. Lot of useage..  Thanks Jesus finally got relief from  my pain.</li>
            <li> I was using this as face wash mixed in with other oils, but it was way too drying for my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Once agai I will try to explain this item.  I never received this but did get an almost immediate email stating that they no longer shipped this, as it came in glass bottle and they had had bad luck with breakage.  It was fine with me I went to my local natural foods store and purchased castor oil.  It&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Solid product. Seems good quality with good price. Highly recommended. Castor oil is sticky, so I put it in a bottle with a little organic coconut oil for my hair. I heat the mixture for 10 seconds, swirl it to mix, then apply.</li>
            <li> Got this to promote hair growth since I am trying to grow out my eyebrows. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked!</li>
            <li> Super happy not that that its organic it comes in a glass jar!!! No other company sale it in glass which makes it much better&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get why would they put somthing organic in plastic so I&#x27;m very happy this one ce in a glass they should add it to the item description</li>
            <li> Good product.. Works well for what I got it for.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived nicely protected in layers of bubble wrap and in a timely manner.  If you haven&#x27;t researched the many uses for this product you should!  It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle!  Do yourself a favor and order this, everyone can benefit from this bottle of magic!</li>
            <li> Good stuff and affordable price!</li>
            <li> I use this for me and my daughters hair and let me tell you this is the best I&#x27;ve used it grew our hair and it didn&#x27;t take long and it added thickness everyone asked me what u used and I&#x27;m ordering some more, I don&#x27;t leave a review on everything I buy but I had to on this one... I mix it with water in a spray bottle and sprits my hair when I wake up and before bed trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its a great product, however it took a long time to receive it from the time I placed my order.</li>
            <li> I know for sure this product is miraculous I have used it for many things from growing my eyelashes to taking off my make up good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is really high quality castor oil. I use this on my eyebrows and eyelashes to help stimulate growth (I haven&#x27;t experienced any clogged pores or breakouts around my application sites at all). I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable difference in thickness and length. I will definitely purchase again when I run out (although that won&#x27;t be for a very long time).</li>
            <li> Mom asked if I could buy this for her. She is raving ever since. Says her skin feels like a baby again.</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed at how great my face looks in the morning when I leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li> Works good, the smell, like old cigarettes ..</li>
            <li> Love It and love this brand</li>
            <li> Arrived packed in bubble wrap; no leakage; no breakage.  I use this on my eyelashes and hope they will help them to grow and not fall out so easily and often.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! Definitely going to purchase it again! ;)</li>
            <li> I had bought this and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores again. The Castor oil in the stores all come in plastic and are not organic. I recommend this! Great for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> If you have constipation and you take a tbsp of this you will not have constipation later</li>
            <li> Better than I expected. It has softened my feet and cleared my face. Also made my hair so much more manageable and gave it shine and lots of body</li>
            <li> Was as describe, fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this castor oil. It&#x27;s organic which is non existent in local stores.  So glad I found it here.  Been using it on my eyes which has helped with floaters and made my eyelashes grow.  Very soothing and safe to use.  Was recommended by a holistic eye doctor to help with age related eye diseases. Also helped eyebrows to grow and fill in.  Bottle is glass and will last a long time.  I pour a little in a  small glass bottle that has a glass eye dropper to keep it sterile.</li>
            <li> I just received my order and I was surprised at the extent they go to protect your order. It was wrapped in a lot of bubble wrap amongst other things that kept it safe from damage. So that was great.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product its self, it is as claimed and the ingredients are cold pressed organic hexane free castor oil. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have any strong odor , so that&#x27;s a plus. The viscosity is pretty high, but that&#x27;s expected with this kind of oil. Overall its a 5star product&lt;br /&gt; Def recommend this&lt;br /&gt;P.s. the 16oz was so affordable at 10 something and will sure last me a long time!</li>
            <li> Cold pressed castor oil is the best for hair loss induced itching and inflammation, It doesn&#x27;t really stop the hair loss completely, it kinda just slows it down because of the oil properties</li>
            <li> Great Oil.  Using it for my hair and skin and I&#x27;m loving the results.  Mixing with Coconut and avocado oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> Came on time, will buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Amazing oil, super thick and sticky though.</li>
            <li> I love that this oil it is so good, I&#x27;ve been putting it on my scar for about two weeks with the flannel cloth and I can see a differnce already. I had surgery and it left a hypertrophic scar down my stomach and now I can see where the scar is getting flat and have stopped itching. I&#x27;m so happy I luck up on this product and that it does work for me, I have tried so many things on scar and haven&#x27;t seen the results as this oil is a miracle. I will continue to use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s original castor oil as far as I know</li>
            <li> One of the great Cayace product, &amp;#34;The Oil That Heals&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever found.  Worth the wait and the price.  I have it in designated dropper bottles to use in my ears or on my gums.  I have tinnitus and it seems to help this problem.  Have been using Edgar Casey&#x27;s advice forever.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in good condition. I purchased this product to make my own facial oil cleanser, facial serum, hair growth serum, and other homemade remedies. Works amazing as facial cleanser and serum. For more information look up oil cleansing method.</li>
            <li> My New Favorite Oil! This oil is Great for my skin. I see rejuvenation in my face, arms and neck where I&#x27;m using it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it as Edgar Casey recommended on areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;I actually feel an overall wonderful energy with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;It Harmonizes Extremely Well with the body and it&#x27;s energy and I will continue to use it Daily !</li>
            <li> I use this stuff at night on my hands and face. I wake up to very soft hands and face.</li>
            <li> I use castor oil for detoxification.  This is one of the better quality products out there.  I would recommend this for sure.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a glass (not plastic) bottle, so none of the chemicals are leaching into oil.</li>
            <li> This has been a great addition to my blend of oils for washing my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I had a torn groin muscle or what but the pain extended all the way up to my bottom towards my waist for the last four months.  I yelped everytime I turned or backed up.  I bought the book on Edgar Casey by Dr.McGarey on amazon hoping to find a solution. I don&#x27;t run to doctors unless I would need stiches or a cast and I never have needed either one of them.  After reading the book I then ordered the Castor Oil and wool felt from amazon and followed the directions to the letter. I turned the lights out, lit a candle and meditated while the oil was being absorbed through my stomach.  Yes, my stomach as I did not have the pad on my leg. I was going to do that the next day.  The next morning the pain was gone from my leg and bottom.  I was cooking breakfast this morning and realized that I was not yelping as usual as I moved around the kitchen.  I cannot believe this happened in this manner even thought it happened to me just today.  I&#x27;m going to continue to do this for a month to clean out my lymphatic system and to use it for other things too.  This product will always be in my medicine chest.It took about two weeks for delivery but well worth the wait.I did a lot of research and I believe this organic product is the best on the market.The pharmacies just sell the garbage castor oil that has been grown and processesed with garbage chemicals and a waste of time and money.I like organic and cold pressed which means no chemicals and no bug juice.The price on amazon is great as per usual. Thank you God and thanks to amazon too.It is so lovely to be pain free.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given it a 5 if I didn&#x27;t receive it broken.  I know it is shipment problem but it&#x27;s also the quality of the cap.  The cap does break and it&#x27;s very likely that the bottles will leak in the package.  However, lucky for mine, it didn&#x27;t leak.  I had to look for another container to put the oil in.  On the bright side, the oil is good.  It hydrates my skin and it doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.  :)</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily on my eyebrows and lashes for about a month. I can see a difference in the density of my eyebrows but can&#x27;t really tell with the eyelashes.  My lashes used to be LONG with Lattise  but after using it for a couple of years the skin around my eyes was darkening and ringed with red. I stopped using it and my lashes are now short but full.  It takes about 3 months to see your best results with Latisse so I will keep using the oil and see what happens.  I apply it with the brushes I had from the Lattise every night at bed time.</li>
            <li> Great Quality, organic and well packaged</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I love the product, I would order it again.</li>
            <li> I had a severe case of eczema on my neck and upper chest.  After using the castor oil, it was gone!  It is a bit gooey and thick, but the end result is worth it!</li>
            <li> Works miracles!!!  I am a true believer in this product.  I owe thanks and gratitude to my physician.  She is the one who recommended it.</li>
            <li> It works short-term pain but not for hours; some relief is still gratification nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried swallowing a tsp for two days, taste like death but has many good benefits to ingest it if you can tolerate its taste.</li>
            <li> Using this for my eyebrows and eyelashes. It has only been 3 weeks but I see an improvement in both. I will now look and see what else organic castor oil is good for.</li>
            <li> I really love this Item. am also please with the quality of it.&lt;br /&gt;the price is also right. thank you.</li>
            <li> I have severe dry eye problems.  Started using this on the recommendation of other reviews here and other internet sites.  I was afraid to put it directly in my eyes, so I just smear it over my eyelids and under and around my eyes at night before bed.  I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement.</li>
            <li> HUGE bottle! really nice product!</li>
            <li> I use it at bedtime on my hands and when I wake up my pain is diminished extremely.  I researched this product and decided I would try it.  The pain and stiffness on my fingers which was a daily thing was taking away from my ability to use my fingers without experiencing pain. Castor oil does help tremendously.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> For the soul purpose I got this product it works greats.. I have recommended too a few people already.</li>
            <li> As presented- Thanks!</li>
            <li> Pure, cold-pressed, organic in a colored bottle to keep out the harmful sun spectrum and a reasonable size.  What more could you ask?  We&#x27;ve used this for years and it works well for some things.  It&#x27;s not to be taken internally because it wreaks havoc on digestion.</li>
            <li> Best Castor oil on the market!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my skin feel.  I mix it with aloe vera because it&#x27;s pretty thick.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> The product is I expected.  It works well and can be used to do many things.</li>
            <li> I use this, mixed with argon oil, as a makeup remover. I&#x27;ve stopped getting breakouts since I started doing this, and my skin looks healthier. (I use a 1/3 mixture since the castor oil can be drying.) The only negative is that the cap was cracked when I got it. It eventually broke, but I can still use it-just but twist it on.</li>
