    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>but this stuff is great!!</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product</li>
            <li>Best stuff on planet earth.</li>
            <li>It smells great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li>The best method for me is to set a tin lid on the radiator and set the bottle on that.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ll have to play around to see the best method to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a beautiful smell, a floral gardenia sandalwood blend.</li>
            <li>There are strict guidelines and quality standards which assures a great product.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing!</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing through the day or evening!</li>
            <li>The oil itself smells so wonderful and feels fantastic!</li>
            <li>I found this oil in a blog by a girl with gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li>It smells  good ...</li>
            <li>It may or may not be making my hair look as gorgeous as hers, but It&#x27;s smells so nice.</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>I will purchase more of this soon!</li>
            <li>My skin will feel amazing for hours</li>
            <li>I sun 12 months out of the year and this oil keeps my skin well hydrated, happy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Since it uses coconut oil you have to warm it up a bit before you use it-</li>
            <li>Just a bottle of coconut oil with no scent/aroma of any kind.  .</li>
            <li>I might as well buy a jar of coconut oil from the grocery store and add my own scent to it.</li>
            <li>and I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of the wonderful smells I would expect.</li>
            <li>You can liquefy the oil by running under warm water, but it&#x27;s somewhat time consuming to warm all of the bottle&#x27;s contents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have tried this lovely Monoi coconut oil!</li>
            <li>Has a very light scent and so is suitable for men and women.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed by the skin very easily and has a very light, pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>After I used it my husband immediately commented on how lovely it smelled and he was about 3 feet away from me.</li>
            <li>For some reason I assumed there was going to be more to this than just coconut oil and the the added flower for scent.</li>
            <li>love these oils.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I did and was glad to find it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Which I love...</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell more like sandalwood, but I guess it is blended with Tiare flower, too.</li>
            <li>the oil smells wonderful; I&#x27;ve applied it once already, and it starts to sink in right away, and disappears into my skin completely after about 5 minutes or so, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that strong &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; sandalwood scent, either.</li>
            <li>The shipping of this item was free because I am an Amazon Prime member.</li>
            <li>The oil, I found, is not greatly oily, making it perfect for not just body application after the shower, but for a nice treat for winter dryness on the face.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely moisturizer and the oil spreads well and soaks right in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells good, would be better with true sandalwood essential oil.</li>
            <li>but if you are familiar with coconut oil you know that this is just the way it goes.</li>
            <li>In fact the first place I purchased them was in Tahiti and am so excited to be able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This stuff is special to Polynesian culture, between rituals and beauty essentials.</li>
            <li>and it arrived early than originally indicated!!</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with these oils as I&#x27;ve ordered other fragrances.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough, and this is my favorite scent!</li>
            <li>We bought it in Tahiti a few years ago, and I was happy to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I like the way the product is absorbed by skin, no greasy slimy feel.</li>
            <li>(but it was almost completely unscented and I love perfumes and scented bath and body products</li>
            <li>The oil itself leaves skin soft and lasts, I love that.</li>
            <li>I use it right before I do my knitting / crocheting and</li>
            <li>I use it on my face right after I wash my face</li>
            <li>Still, it lasts a long time when used as a massage oil, and feels nice.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and keeps my very dry skin moisturized, yet not oily or sticky even on the most humid of days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wise to order during winter because it arrived solid and there was no mess.</li>
            <li>You can put it on your skin, face, hands and you can put it in your hair as well which works really well, Gets more solid when it is cool and just rub some between your fingers to spread it.</li>
            <li>you, but you will definitely smell it better when its on your skin or in your hair).</li>
            <li>You can get a much larger quantity for quite a better price than this.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered it from Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>I was first fascinated with its appearance in the bottle: a darker separation of oil on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I sometimes apply the oil in the shower, just before I turn off the hot water.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience ever with coconut oil for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Not only would that help prevent loss of product as well as a mess, I would feel more confident of receiving an unadulterated product.</li>
            <li>Other friends at the pool liked it as well</li>
            <li>Apparently the seller is aware of the possibility of this happening, and that is why the item was packaged securely, but why doesn&#x27;t the manufacturer seal these bottles?</li>
            <li>I find the history behind its use in French Polynesia fascinating and how it&#x27;s a special authentic Tahitian import.</li>
            <li>Overall, a special multitasking beauty product worth trying.</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb coconut oil very well.</li>
            <li>Instead, it is absolutely odorless.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend these oils to anyone who wants to improve the texture and condition of their hair.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair worn straight and use these oils after blow drying/flat iron as a  protectant.</li>
            <li>I really like the sandalwood fragrance; it&#x27;s not heavenly</li>
            <li>Ideally, warm it in the microwave for a few seconds before using.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years, I use it for special baths, in my hair once a week and as lotion daily.</li>
            <li>I had heard of Monoi before related to the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair products, but didn&#x27;t know the full story.</li>
            <li>I will definitely try another scent, likely the gardenia, one of my favorite flowers.</li>
            <li>OK, my little rant aside...</li>
            <li>You can even scrape a little solidified oil from around the top and it melts on skin.</li>
            <li>I know the melting descriptions are extensive, but just admit it&#x27;s fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>Has all pure ingredients and will solidify like pure coconut oil should in low temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is light, plesant I purchased 5 different company&#x27;s same product types.erent types I would highly recommend this maker /brand to all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and delicate, nice at bedtime after a shower.</li>
            <li>I love a few drops of this in my hair!</li>
            <li>The price was 99 cents less per bottle and with a minimum order, the shipping was free.  </li>
            <li>It is a solid and has instructions for gentle heating.</li>
            <li>I shook it up and opened the top and a delicate scent invited me to explore.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and silky.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and it makes it glow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle and sure way to melt the oil.</li>
            <li>I actually have been just squeezing the bottle to get a small amount to the top for use.</li>
            <li>Monoi has many benefits and is said to be hypoallergenic or at least low</li>
            <li>the finished item has a faint scent that is lovely!</li>
            <li>and it completely turns into a solid!  </li>
            <li>I love the subtle scent!  </li>
            <li>Luckily it was double bagged because the cap had loosened during transit and some of the oil had leaked out and would have made a bit of a mess, but it was all contained within the inner bag.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re too oily, some are not moisturizing enough, and few are just right.</li>
            <li>I desperately needed a winter pick-me-up and a good moisturizer (it&#x27;s been a dry season.)</li>
            <li>I expected this oil to have a strong, or moderate at the least, fragrance.  </li>

            <li> I expected this oil to have a strong, or moderate at the least, fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to use it during cooler months when the temps fall below 68 degrees in LA...</li>
            <li> I guess the only reason all of the oil hadn&#x27;t leaked out was because it had partially solidified.</li>
            <li> Smell not as expected, it has remained almost in a solid form even when warmed</li>
            <li> The bottle seems tiny, but you only need a little bit at a time, so I think it will take quite a while to use it up.</li>
            <li> and then I&#x27;d feel suddenly dry.</li>
            <li> I apply it all over and pat dry.</li>
            <li> /great results on my dry skin and hair</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely on the feet and hands, wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, I will have to try it a few times to give it 5 stars as well as on my clients.</li>
            <li> Skin is left soft with no residue and delicately scented.</li>
            <li> Will use the heating method when further down in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It arrives empty.</li>
            <li> but I am just worried it will arrive empty again.</li>
            <li> like I expected</li>
            <li> Seems like a warm and cozy scent for chilly fall and winter days!</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try one of the other versions).</li>
            <li> I useda little too much on my wet hair so it is day</li>
            <li> Besides, a little goes a long way and less melted means less mess &amp; waste.</li>
            <li> I learned not to hold over candle heat, it&#x27;s unpredictable and now my bottle has a warped spot.</li>

            <li> This scent seems relatively long-lasting--I put it on hours ago, and although it has decreased in strength, it is still there.</li>
            <li> No great harm was done, and only a small amount of oil was wasted...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It smells amazing! The smell is faint coming from the bottle but when you use it the scent comes to life (it&#x27;s not strong mind you, but you will definitely smell it better when its on your skin or in your hair). After I used it my husband immediately commented on how lovely it smelled and he was about 3 feet away from me. Since it uses coconut oil you have to warm it up a bit before you use it- it&#x27;s a little annoying but if you are familiar with coconut oil you know that this is just the way it goes.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but this stuff is great!! You can put it on your skin, face, hands and you can put it in your hair as well which works really well, Gets more solid when it is cool and just rub some between your fingers to spread it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product and it arrived early than originally indicated!!</li>
            <li> I should have read the ingredients before ordering. For some reason I assumed there was going to be more to this than just coconut oil and the the added flower for scent. My skin doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb coconut oil very well. My skin will feel amazing for hours and then I&#x27;d feel suddenly dry. Coconut oil works well for some, just doesn&#x27;t seem to do the trick for me. You can get a much larger quantity for quite a better price than this.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and keeps my very dry skin moisturized, yet not oily or sticky even on the most humid of days. Has a very light scent and so is suitable for men and women. Has all pure ingredients and will solidify like pure coconut oil should in low temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;I love these oils. In fact the first place I purchased them was in Tahiti and am so excited to be able to purchase on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it. I found this oil in a blog by a girl with gorgeous hair. It may or may not be making my hair look as gorgeous as hers, but It&#x27;s smells so nice. The only compliant I have is that pouring the oil out into the hand can be tricky. It&#x27;s easy to spill. And the narrow base make it easy to knock over.</li>
            <li> I like the way the product is absorbed by skin, no greasy slimy feel. The scent is light, plesant I purchased 5 different company&#x27;s same product types.erent types I would highly recommend this maker /brand to all.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Just a bottle of coconut oil with no scent/aroma of any kind.  . Would not recommend this stuff. Because I could not detect any scent at all I might as well buy a jar of coconut oil from the grocery store and add my own scent to it.</li>
            <li> It arrives empty. The box was all damaged. I would like to order another one but I am just worried it will arrive empty again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It is a solid and has instructions for gentle heating. I actually have been just squeezing the bottle to get a small amount to the top for use. Will use the heating method when further down in the bottle.  The oil itself smells so wonderful and feels fantastic! I use it right before I do my knitting / crocheting and the finished item has a faint scent that is lovely! I will purchase more of this soon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells good, would be better with true sandalwood essential oil. I Would pay extra for that.</li>
            <li> I sun 12 months out of the year and this oil keeps my skin well hydrated, happy and smooth.  It is absorbed by the skin very easily and has a very light, pleasant fragrance.  A friend began using this after a trip to Hawaii.  She let me try it and I liked it.  The first time I ordered it from Hawaii.  The price was 99 cents less per bottle and with a minimum order, the shipping was free.  Other friends at the pool liked it as well so I thought I&#x27;d try to find it on Amazon.  I did and was glad to find it.  The shipping of this item was free because I am an Amazon Prime member.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle scent!  I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to use it during cooler months when the temps fall below 68 degrees in LA...and it completely turns into a solid!  It&#x27;s July and it&#x27;s happening...ugh...</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, I use it for special baths, in my hair once a week and as lotion daily. I can&#x27;t get enough, and this is my favorite scent!</li>
            <li> I expected this oil to have a strong, or moderate at the least, fragrance.  Instead, it is absolutely odorless.  Still, it lasts a long time when used as a massage oil, and feels nice.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter who likes it for her locs.  I prefer the gardenia, jasmine and ylang-ylang fragrances.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of the wonderful smells I would expect.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with the quality!</li>
            <li> Best stuff on planet earth. Addicted!</li>
            <li> I just got this today, it&#x27;s really thick and has pieces of the plant in the bottle. It goes on nicely on the feet and hands, wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell, I will have to try it a few times to give it 5 stars as well as on my clients.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb.  We bought it in Tahiti a few years ago, and I was happy to find it here on Amazon.  Ideally, warm it in the microwave for a few seconds before using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Goldilocks type of body lotion/oil devotee. I try some and they&#x27;re too oily, some are not moisturizing enough, and few are just right. The Monoi has a solid reputation but I only recently gave it a try. To my delight, it was in the &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34; category. I was first fascinated with its appearance in the bottle: a darker separation of oil on the bottom. I shook it up and opened the top and a delicate scent invited me to explore. The oil, I found, is not greatly oily, making it perfect for not just body application after the shower, but for a nice treat for winter dryness on the face. My hair is thick and tends to be a little dry, so I use hair oils on it for smoothing and sheen. I love a few drops of this in my hair! It&#x27;s not that strong &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; sandalwood scent, either. Rather, it is tamed by the coconut essence and is a feminine scent that melds with the skin. I sometimes apply the oil in the shower, just before I turn off the hot water. The warmth of the water helps to increase the softness I feel from this oil. I apply it all over and pat dry. My skin feels amazing through the day or evening! I will definitely try another scent, likely the gardenia, one of my favorite flowers.</li>
            <li> It just arrived! It smells great! I put in on my hair as soon as I opened the package. I saw immediate results. My hair is soft, shiny, and silky. I am extremely happy with these oils as I&#x27;ve ordered other fragrances. I would recommend these oils to anyone who wants to improve the texture and condition of their hair. I have curly hair worn straight and use these oils after blow drying/flat iron as a  protectant.</li>
            <li> I like it. It smells  good ...I use it on my face right after I wash my face it&#x27;s excellent! Makes my skin so soft and it makes it glow.&lt;br /&gt;Which I love...</li>
            <li> I just received this today. Luckily it was double bagged because the cap had loosened during transit and some of the oil had leaked out and would have made a bit of a mess, but it was all contained within the inner bag. No great harm was done, and only a small amount of oil was wasted...I guess the only reason all of the oil hadn&#x27;t leaked out was because it had partially solidified. Apparently the seller is aware of the possibility of this happening, and that is why the item was packaged securely, but why doesn&#x27;t the manufacturer seal these bottles? Not only would that help prevent loss of product as well as a mess, I would feel more confident of receiving an unadulterated product. OK, my little rant aside...the oil smells wonderful; I&#x27;ve applied it once already, and it starts to sink in right away, and disappears into my skin completely after about 5 minutes or so, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. I&#x27;ve used the vanilla version of this oil w/great results on my dry skin and hair (but it was almost completely unscented and I love perfumes and scented bath and body products so I wanted to try one of the other versions). This scent seems relatively long-lasting--I put it on hours ago, and although it has decreased in strength, it is still there. Seems like a warm and cozy scent for chilly fall and winter days! The bottle seems tiny, but you only need a little bit at a time, so I think it will take quite a while to use it up.</li>
            <li> Smell not as expected, it has remained almost in a solid form even when warmed up.&lt;br /&gt; Not convenient to get the product out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have tried this lovely Monoi coconut oil! I find the history behind its use in French Polynesia fascinating and how it&#x27;s a special authentic Tahitian import. I desperately needed a winter pick-me-up and a good moisturizer (it&#x27;s been a dry season.) This is my first experience ever with coconut oil for moisturizing. I had heard of Monoi before related to the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair products, but didn&#x27;t know the full story. This stuff is special to Polynesian culture, between rituals and beauty essentials. Monoi is exclusive to the Polynesian islands and is made by infusing coconut oil with Tahitian gardenias. There are strict guidelines and quality standards which assures a great product. Monoi has many benefits and is said to be hypoallergenic or at least low allergy risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ll cut to the chase. I get lost in being a beauty nerd! I&#x27;ve only had the stuff for a day. It&#x27;s wise to order during winter because it arrived solid and there was no mess. You can liquefy the oil by running under warm water, but it&#x27;s somewhat time consuming to warm all of the bottle&#x27;s contents. Besides, a little goes a long way and less melted means less mess &amp; waste. I learned not to hold over candle heat, it&#x27;s unpredictable and now my bottle has a warped spot. The best method for me is to set a tin lid on the radiator and set the bottle on that. It&#x27;s a subtle and sure way to melt the oil. You can even scrape a little solidified oil from around the top and it melts on skin. I know the melting descriptions are extensive, but just admit it&#x27;s fun to play around with. This is a lovely moisturizer and the oil spreads well and soaks right in. Skin is left soft with no residue and delicately scented. I really like the sandalwood fragrance; it&#x27;s not heavenly like I expected but it&#x27;s still a beautiful smell, a floral gardenia sandalwood blend. I used a small amount to moisturize my face (combination skin) and it doesn&#x27;t break me out! Nor did it break me out on my body. I useda little too much on my wet hair so it is day two oily; I&#x27;ll have to play around to see the best method to use it on my hair. As for tanning use, I don&#x27;t bother with sunning--it&#x27;s the worst thing you can do to your skin. Overall, a special multitasking beauty product worth trying. I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> This is heaven on skin, but this sandalwood fragrance to me is reminiscent of baby oil. I thought it would smell more like sandalwood, but I guess it is blended with Tiare flower, too. It&#x27;s soft and delicate, nice at bedtime after a shower. The oil itself leaves skin soft and lasts, I love that. I will try another scent next time.</li>
