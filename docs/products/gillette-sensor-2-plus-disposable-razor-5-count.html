    <ol>
            <li>Perfect size for toddlers.  </li>
            <li>Pivot Plus Disposable Razors which were excellent.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the Mach 3 is at the best cost/performance</li>
            <li>best disposable razors on the market</li>
            <li>STILL LOVE MY GILLETTE !!!</li>
            <li>The price was awesome and a good product.</li>
            <li>Nice design!</li>
            <li>Nice quality, good price!</li>
            <li>Good razor for 2 bucks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a lot of things that are just as good at the dollar store, but I have to confess, razors are not one of them.</li>
            <li>Good price for 5 disposable razors.....</li>
            <li>Good inexpensive razors.</li>
            <li>Good for a disposable.</li>
            <li>Very cute.  </li>
            <li>This was my son&#x27;s favorite Christmas gift!  </li>
            <li>Ordered these for a friend, he liked the razors.</li>
            <li>Nice razors, nice price.</li>
            <li>I bought these because they were cheap (at the time of the order) and to have around the house in case I lost my good razor or if we had a guest that needed a razor or something.</li>
            <li>Each can provide shaves for a week or more, but I pre-shave with an electric.</li>
            <li>These razors are noticeably better than the cheaper Gillette blades.  </li>
            <li>Ok quality.</li>
            <li>i wont pay more than $5 dollar for them tho.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I use these mostly for shaving my head.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>At most you can get two of those things.</li>
            <li>Great, cheap, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m cheap, I guess.</li>
            <li>and I can see why paying a few bucks more for disposable razors is a good idea, lol.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased the CustomPlus 3 and it is not as good (more is not always better) besides being more costly</li>
            <li>Easy to be used and durable.</li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic could be softer and a better way to clean</li>
            <li>the Mach 3 is a great blade, and I can get 3-4 weeks out of one, with a better shave and easier cleaning - all at the same cost per week, or even cheaper.</li>
            <li>I ordered these razors when there was a coupon available making them well under 3 dollars - shipped.  </li>
            <li>Cheap quality&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Personna twin blade cartridges can be found as cheap as $0.10 each in packs of 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just want my face to be relatively smooth and free of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to assume that these disposables are genuine (because who would face plastic Sensors?), but I have to say</li>
            <li>I hope everything goes smoothly for you.</li>
            <li>Disclaimer, I got these at a discount to test, they give a clean, close shave, will buy them again.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t shaved in about three days when I tried one of these razors and it just sliced through the beard--nice clean and close shave.</li>
            <li>The only redeeming quality of these is that you can rinse the whiskers between the blades very easily.</li>
            <li>Does the job, good enough for my travel needs.</li>
            <li>Fast clean and easy to</li>
            <li>wife tells  me that are good only for male skin. :)</li>
            <li>As a result, I found that the shave was no smoother or more comfortable than any generic twin blade razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than some other brands for sure.</li>
            <li>many of us shavers know, there are a few factors that enter into a good razor - thinner, more flexible blades made of sharp, high quality steel; more blades in a cartridge or shaver head; sensitivity to pressure and the contours of the face.</li>
            <li>but they rust very fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dry shaver, so a good, sharp razor is very important to</li>
            <li>The first shave can be a bit nicky so caution is advised.</li>
            <li>Sensor was the first pivoting handle and pivoting blade razor ever made.</li>
            <li>Well the patents must have run out on Sensor technology by now and for the first time in 25 years, I am going to shave with a non-Gillette razor.</li>
            <li>I first became aware of these a couple years ago, they were priced at about 20% of the price of a Mach 3 blade.</li>
            <li>well if I buzz my head with the clippers first, as close as they will cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do manufacturers bait and switch us by convincing us that the quality is the same even as they reduce the quality on the manufacturing end by reducing QC and manufacturing specs as they make blades in Asia?</li>
            <li>Any shave after that is positively wretched and will scratch and irritate one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>(Having taken several marketing surveys on this topic, I have the opinion that perception and reputation are more important than actual performance.)</li>
            <li>I guess I expect more than two decent daily shaves from a Gillette.</li>
            <li>They are perhaps a little better than the dollar store razors but saved me the trip!  </li>
            <li>expected to find these acceptable, and I would say that they are passable if you get them on the cheap, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for them.</li>
            <li>If you have a light facial hair, get these they will stay sharper much longer than the cheaper version.</li>
            <li>Also, wasn&#x27;t a very close shave.</li>
            <li>These are very reliable and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say much else</li>
            <li>How much research and development go into the production of razors and blades?</li>
            <li>How much is just marketing hype?</li>
            <li>How much should a decent blade really cost?</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am fine with using generic razors, because I pay generic prices.</li>
            <li>they are just another cheap razor that only last (for me)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not a Gillette hater, and I have been satisfied with some of their blades in the past.</li>
            <li>(As I dry shave, I simply tap the razor on the sink every stroke or two to keep it reasonably clean.)</li>
            <li>Got them much cheaper than my local store with the subscribe and save program</li>
            <li>for this product, I found it to be made much like a generic plastic disposable.</li>
            <li>Blades last longer than my other cheap ones and were cheaper than them too.</li>
            <li>The first shave is great and the 2nd and 3rd aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li>how much worse/different are they, and how can you tell for sure you&#x27;ve gotten a fake?</li>
            <li>The holy grail of shaving is something that last a long time, gives a smooth, sensitive shave, and costs very little.</li>
            <li>In one word - garbage, in few words, waste of money and pretty much the old saying - you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure how useful it is anyway given the relative quantity of shaving creme.</li>
            <li>However, not sure if worth the extra price.  </li>
            <li>These make even shaving my face difficult, they aren&#x27;t very fine and they dull after the first shave.</li>

            <li> In my experience, they are still way overpriced compared to the minor increase in performance over the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time, could be that Gillette going down hill.</li>
            <li> the beard is getting a little longer, it&#x27;s the same situation, I need to use the clippers and get as close as possible and then use these to shave.</li>
            <li> The first 2-3 shaves are acceptable, but not great.</li>
            <li> What has happened is that the price of these razors has doubled, while the Mach 3 has stayed the same or even come down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working as expected.</li>
            <li> Really not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but that is expected.</li>
            <li> 4th to 7th get worse and by the end of the week I WANT a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it tends to scrape and also the pivoting makes it hard to discern angles especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> that brought the cost down to the dollar-store price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t seem as sharp out of the box&amp;#34; as other Gillette throw a ways that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Got less shaves out of each razor too.</li>
            <li> The gel strip lasts less than a week</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not worth that!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> have used Gillette Sensor razors in the past, but never the disposable ones.</li>
            <li> Gillette purposely design this to congest the space between blades, making it hard to use.</li>
            <li> Hard to say if it&#x27;s were they were made or ?  </li>
            <li> Gillette please shorten the life of blades to force it disposable, but at least ensure it works for ONE time.</li>
            <li> very bad, the blade only works on flat surface.  not suitable for face or body use.</li>
            <li> Not superior to generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a couple of shaves, then they are too dull to do anything with!  </li>
            <li> People who become obsessed with shaving tend to use double-edge safety razors from Dorco and similar brands, but the blades can be dangerous to change.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s just not worth it to risk cutting myself</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matching game!</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t imagine a fake being any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cheapo dollar-store variety would have just been hacking away like a bad lawnmower.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in these razors I thought they would be nicer because they are Gillette</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get all those unsightly ingrown hair bumps we men hate.</li>
            <li> and they are terrible.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s working as expected.</li>

            <li> The price was awesome and a good product. I would buy again.</li>

            <li> Fast clean and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic could be softer and a better way to clean&lt;br /&gt;My wife tells  me that are good only for male skin. :)</li>
            <li> Great, cheap, shipped fast. Blades last longer than my other cheap ones and were cheaper than them too. Highly recommended. Look for coupons and S&amp;S savings.</li>
            <li> The blue protective strip. Fell out shortly after I started shaving. Also, wasn&#x27;t a very close shave. Had to go over my legs 2 and 3 times.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t seem as sharp out of the box&amp;#34; as other Gillette throw a ways that I have bought in the past. Hard to say if it&#x27;s were they were made or ?  Got less shaves out of each razor too. I&#x27;ll try a different brand next time, could be that Gillette going down hill.</li>
            <li> I too bought these at Costco years ago and, as others have mentioned, keep the spares stored away in a freezer bag. The first shave can be a bit nicky so caution is advised. The gel strip lasts less than a week but I&#x27;m not sure how useful it is anyway given the relative quantity of shaving creme. Each can provide shaves for a week or more, but I pre-shave with an electric. I recently purchased the CustomPlus 3 and it is not as good (more is not always better) besides being more costly it tends to scrape and also the pivoting makes it hard to discern angles especially on the neck. In terms of quality of result the two iterations produce the same result.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t shave well at all. One dollar store quality.</li>
            <li> These are very reliable and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Ordered these for a friend, he liked the razors.</li>
            <li> These razors are noticeably better than the cheaper Gillette blades.  However, not sure if worth the extra price.  If you have a light facial hair, get these they will stay sharper much longer than the cheaper version.</li>
            <li> Nice razors, nice price. Got them much cheaper than my local store with the subscribe and save program</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in these razors I thought they would be nicer because they are Gillette but they rust very fast. Literally one time use.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m cheap, I guess. I&#x27;ve been buying dollar-store razors for a year or so and they are terrible. I finally bit the bullet and went back to Gilette and I can see why paying a few bucks more for disposable razors is a good idea, lol. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in about three days when I tried one of these razors and it just sliced through the beard--nice clean and close shave. The cheapo dollar-store variety would have just been hacking away like a bad lawnmower. I also got a $3 Amazon coupon (yay!) that brought the cost down to the dollar-store price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of things that are just as good at the dollar store, but I have to confess, razors are not one of them. I&#x27;m going back to Gilette.</li>
            <li> basic razors.  can&#x27;t say much else</li>
            <li> Had 3 cuts in 1 time shave. I dont even consider them as 1st generation razors. Bought them mistaking them for Gillette GoodNews! Pivot Plus Disposable Razors which were excellent. Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Nice quality, good price!</li>
            <li> Shame on Gillette for calling this &amp;#34;Sensor&amp;#34;. Sensor was the first pivoting handle and pivoting blade razor ever made. It revolutionized razors when it came out about 25 years ago. This razor neither has a pivoting head nor pivoting blades and so should never have been called sensor. I guess they must be slowly destroying the Sensor brand so you have to move up to their new $4 per blade razors. Well the patents must have run out on Sensor technology by now and for the first time in 25 years, I am going to shave with a non-Gillette razor.</li>
            <li> Really not what I expected.  Can I get off the enrollment?</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were cheap (at the time of the order) and to have around the house in case I lost my good razor or if we had a guest that needed a razor or something. These work, however, you&#x27;ll be using 5 times the strokes compared to a 3+ blade razor. The only redeeming quality of these is that you can rinse the whiskers between the blades very easily.</li>
            <li> STILL LOVE MY GILLETTE !!!</li>
            <li> Value priced razors for when you are on the go. They don&#x27;t work as well as the 3, 4 or 5 blade razors but that is expected.</li>
            <li> I have used these razors for about 3 years. I&#x27;m a dry shaver, so a good, sharp razor is very important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one really big fault of these Customplus blades is that there is no place for the cut beard to go, so it packs in between the blades. (As I dry shave, I simply tap the razor on the sink every stroke or two to keep it reasonably clean.) The Mach 3 and Fusion have the open backs, which are almost self-cleaning, so I prefer that design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each razor lasts me a week. The first shave is great and the 2nd and 3rd aren&#x27;t bad. 4th to 7th get worse and by the end of the week I WANT a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first became aware of these a couple years ago, they were priced at about 20% of the price of a Mach 3 blade. Now in 2014, they are about 1/2 the price of a Mach 3 disposable. What has happened is that the price of these razors has doubled, while the Mach 3 has stayed the same or even come down a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the Mach 3 is a great blade, and I can get 3-4 weeks out of one, with a better shave and easier cleaning - all at the same cost per week, or even cheaper. In my opinion, the Mach 3 is at the best cost/performance point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion? I used my initial blade for a whole year, though I have to admit that sheer pride kept me gritting through the pain through the last few months. The replacement blades only lasted a month or two before I couldn&#x27;t stand them anymore. In my experience, they are still way overpriced compared to the minor increase in performance over the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Ok quality. i wont pay more than $5 dollar for them tho.&lt;br /&gt;You should buy it when it is on promotion.</li>
            <li> I ordered these razors when there was a coupon available making them well under 3 dollars - shipped.  Good price for 5 disposable razors..... they are just another cheap razor that only last (for me) a couple of shaves, then they are too dull to do anything with!  They are perhaps a little better than the dollar store razors but saved me the trip!  I cancelled subscription when it was going to be over 5 dollars.... they&#x27;re not worth that!</li>
            <li> Cheap quality&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful disaster&lt;br /&gt;California expressway&lt;br /&gt;Death benefits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matching game! Only one of those oxymorons matches the 5-star rating!</li>
            <li> Does the job, good enough for my travel needs.</li>
            <li> It works for me. I don&#x27;t get all those unsightly ingrown hair bumps we men hate.</li>
            <li> In one word - garbage, in few words, waste of money and pretty much the old saying - you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I use these mostly for shaving my head.&lt;br /&gt;They do not work quite as well as the 3 bladed mach3/etc.&lt;br /&gt;They work well if I buzz my head with the clippers first, as close as they will cut.&lt;br /&gt;Even with that I still have to constantly rinse out the blade.&lt;br /&gt;The blade lasts probably 2-3 head shaves, max, before it starts to feel dull.&lt;br /&gt;I would say for shaving the face they work well, if the stubble is short.&lt;br /&gt;If the beard is getting a little longer, it&#x27;s the same situation, I need to use the clippers and get as close as possible and then use these to shave.</li>
            <li> very bad, the blade only works on flat surface.  not suitable for face or body use.</li>
            <li> Good inexpensive razors. I get about a week out of each razor vs. 2 weeks from the more expensive models. IF they&#x27;re on sale again, I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> best disposable razors on the market</li>
            <li> Good for a disposable. Better than some other brands for sure.</li>
            <li> Not superior to generics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Gillette Sensor razors in the past, but never the disposable ones. The reusable handle with replaceable cartridge has the advantage of a spring mechanism that increases the comfort of a shave. The item I am currently reviewing - Sensor2 Plus disposable razor - does not have a spring mechanism. As a result, I found that the shave was no smoother or more comfortable than any generic twin blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expected to find these acceptable, and I would say that they are passable if you get them on the cheap, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for them. I am fine with using generic razors, because I pay generic prices. The Personna twin blade cartridges can be found as cheap as $0.10 each in packs of 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many of us shavers know, there are a few factors that enter into a good razor - thinner, more flexible blades made of sharp, high quality steel; more blades in a cartridge or shaver head; sensitivity to pressure and the contours of the face. The holy grail of shaving is something that last a long time, gives a smooth, sensitive shave, and costs very little. At most you can get two of those things. People who become obsessed with shaving tend to use double-edge safety razors from Dorco and similar brands, but the blades can be dangerous to change. For me it&#x27;s just not worth it to risk cutting myself and I don&#x27;t want to learn the skill and art of shaving. I just want my face to be relatively smooth and free of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for this product, I found it to be made much like a generic plastic disposable. Not what I would expect from a brand like Gillette. The first 2-3 shaves are acceptable, but not great. Any shave after that is positively wretched and will scratch and irritate one&#x27;s face. We all get different numbers of shaves from a razor. I guess I expect more than two decent daily shaves from a Gillette. I have a medium beard, for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the lube strip on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a Gillette hater, and I have been satisfied with some of their blades in the past. The shaving world is shrouded in mystery though: How much research and development go into the production of razors and blades? How much is just marketing hype? (Having taken several marketing surveys on this topic, I have the opinion that perception and reputation are more important than actual performance.) How much should a decent blade really cost? Do manufacturers bait and switch us by convincing us that the quality is the same even as they reduce the quality on the manufacturing end by reducing QC and manufacturing specs as they make blades in Asia? And of course, there are tons of fakes out there - how much worse/different are they, and how can you tell for sure you&#x27;ve gotten a fake? I&#x27;m going to assume that these disposables are genuine (because who would face plastic Sensors?), but I have to say, I can&#x27;t imagine a fake being any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all you shavers out there. I hope everything goes smoothly for you.</li>
