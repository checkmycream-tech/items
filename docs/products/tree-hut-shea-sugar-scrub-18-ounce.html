            <li>I was thrilled to find that I could purchase these products on Amazon, they make your skin fill out of this world.</li>
            <li>Another nice benefit for the self-tanning application</li>
            <li>Would be nice to have a pack of 3.</li>
            <li>Great price, lasts a long time, perfect exfoliant and the smell is divineeeeee!</li>

            <li>Smells so good, and leave my skin smooth</li>
            <li>makes your skin feel perfectly smooth after your shower and it remains that way for a good while.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I bought this just because it was cheap!</li>
            <li>The smell alone is amazing, it leaves your skin smelling heavenly, on top of that</li>
            <li>I had never tried a sugar scrub of any kind, not even a salt kind and was excited to change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels wonderful, rinses clean, and is very softening.</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth after feeling (not greasy) and you just keep wanting to use more and more!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much better when I use it...</li>
            <li>[figured that out after the fact] but even with that I still love this product.</li>
            <li>There is nothing that Bath and Body works (which I love) has ever put out that has come close to the fragrance of the Tree Hut Coconut Lime scent.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Tree Hut could sell these sugar scrubs for twice as much and people would still buy them, they smell that great.</li>
            <li>I love this sugar scrub.</li>
            <li>Love this scrub.  </li>
            <li>I Love this body scrub,sometimes when I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li>So glad I got this product.</li>
            <li>Love Tree Hut products -</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I am really glad I decided to order this.</li>
            <li>some scrubs &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; as I apply, meaning I have to keep applying more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand Amazon&#x27;s fluctuating prices and I think $10 is the most I would pay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scrub.</li>
            <li>I love all the sugar scrubs from Tree Hut and thought I would try this flavor.</li>
            <li>I do suggest that you lather with your favorite soap or body wash and use the scrub before washing off the soap/body wash.</li>
            <li>Love it..  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this scrub.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the feel and smell of this scrub.</li>
            <li>the product really works &amp; is a great skin cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love how silky it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li>im a have to get some more and maybe even give out as part of a gift package</li>
            <li>I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so smooth!</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I totally love this scent and</li>
            <li>I have used Tree Hut products and are more than pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Brazilian Nut and I love that one</li>
            <li>Mango is my favorite fruit</li>
            <li>so I think I fell in love the minute I opened the jar of this scrub.</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to try out more scents from Tree Hut,</li>
            <li>but once I saw this I knew I had to try it as I love mango</li>
            <li>scrub provides the perfect exfoliation prior to epilating, which I do about once a week, or even sunless tanning since it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this body scrub.</li>
            <li>but the mango is even better.</li>
            <li>I love the thickness and the feel of the sugar on the skin.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the body scrub.</li>
            <li>Used to love this scrub until they added microbeads.</li>
            <li>it smells outstanding, and its mostly organic...</li>
            <li>Mmmm.... I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I purchased the product.</li>
            <li>I just love what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this scrub.</li>
            <li>and I love how it worked on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li>I love the Tree Hut sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li>I really love these Tree Hut scrubs.</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves your skin silky smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong, delicious and fills your entire bathroom with an the scent every time you use it, making it smell like a tropical paradise.</li>
            <li>and I recommend this to anyone who wants silky skin that smells amazing!</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s any downside, it&#x27;s that the scent is a bit sweet, but it dissipates throughout the day and still leaves a nice lingering scent on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance and really leaves the hands smooth.  </li>
            <li>so im not the only one to enjoy this wonderful smelling stuff</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, leaves my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells like a fresh mango and it leaves a nice mango scent on your skin.</li>
            <li>really fells good on my skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not so strong as I thought.</li>
            <li>mango smells a bit strong for a guy that is trying to avoid the fragrances.</li>
            <li>The first type I bought was the coconut lime, which is just simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but love the way it makes my skin feel,</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so good, and you cant beat the price, leaves your skin soo soft!</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my skin super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week to smooth out my legs, so when I use my Silk-Epil every 2-3 weeks I no longer have to deal with ingrown hairs and bumps.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a sugar scrub for a while and just couldn&#x27;t find one that had everything I was looking for: organic, smells great, actually smooths the skin.</li>
            <li>and it left my skin feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li>Yep, it gets that smooth with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It makes you soft and your skin smell good too.</li>
            <li>If you are more sensitive I would recommend using the scrub on its own rather than with exfoliating gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good and works very well, plus it leaves a lingering scent.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is actually effective for exfoliation, but smells great and not drying to the skin...would probably purchase again for $7...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give 5 stars if better, higher quality ingredients were used.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product from the youtuber saaammage and had to try it out since I love skin and body products.</li>
            <li>I originally owned the lavender and shae.........</li>
            <li>It works great as a once a week scrub, it may be too harsh to use any more than that.</li>
            <li>I just use this to scrub my arpits and body and I feel squiky clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>his face feels super smooth.</li>
            <li>well, my skin feels so clean after use.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I&#x27;m not overly familiar with the genuine fragrance of mangos; this actually smells lightly and pleasantly citrus-y, with maybe a tiny bit of vanilla in it.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not obnoxiously sweet.</li>
            <li>Lovve this scrub, feel super clean after using it, and the smell?</li>
            <li>so you really don&#x27;t have to use more than about a quarter size amount each time on a loofah.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this scrub, and it really leaves your skin so silky and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Good for all body exfoliating, especially to keep your legs and underarms in shape for epilating.</li>
            <li>Have only good things to say about this scrub</li>
            <li>This smells wonderful and is really thick and scrubby.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several of the True Hut Body Scrubs and loved every one of them.  </li>
            <li>This is super abrasive</li>
            <li>I already ordered a 2nd one as this scrub is the best for deep exfoliating for the body.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other scents, but I am going to stick with this one for sure!!</li>
            <li>This body scrub smells sooooooo good, and the aroma lingers long after the shower.</li>
            <li>This new Tropical Mango sent is just lovely.</li>
            <li>, in my opinion it is way too strong (very citric and mango that will smell around home for a couple of hours)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that my legs are smoother than they have been in a long time, thanks to this lovely-smelling scrub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty gritty, but its good so the oil isnt all over the place.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this body scrub and it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to remedy this by mixing in a small amount of moisturizing oil such as olive or coconut oil in with this scrub and now it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because it makes my skin feel so soft without the greasy feel, plus it&#x27;s super inexpensive.</li>
            <li>self tanning makes my skin super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the smell, which I very pleasant,  can tend to be very strong.</li>
            <li>and really makes my complexion look fantastic</li>
            <li>This smells lovely and keeps my skin soft year round, great product, and the tub lasts me awhile</li>
            <li>and now... i&#x27;m completely hooked, i love this product...</li>
            <li>However, my friend said she liked it very much, especially the scent, and she has even shared some of it with a friend.</li>
            <li>summer I decided I wanted to see if any of the other versions of the Tree Hut scrubs smelled as good.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>The price was right, too.</li>
            <li>Baby skin right after the shower</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, so normally when I use any kind of soap or scrub with a scent I break out</li>
            <li>It removes all dry skin and leave you with a smooth and refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run out that quickly and it is quite a large tub.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily if a product does not agree with me, but no breakout with this.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re moisturizing without being greasy or oily and causing your tub to become dangerously slippery; they smell crisp and pleasant and clean without being strong; the scrubbing particles are dense but are rounded so they don&#x27;t scratch your skin, and they&#x27;re so inexpensive for an 18 ounce jar!</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable and this is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, especially if you like mango.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>i am not 58.&lt;br /&gt;i discovered the benefit of this one day when i was getting my pedicure at Hot Springs Village Salon.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice rough texture that works wonders on the skin.</li>
            <li>first time using it</li>
            <li>I bought this product as a impulse by and I am not sorry I did.</li>
            <li>The smell of this scrub definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint--I love it and my skin feels refreshed and renewed after each use.</li>
            <li>I normally only purchase these on Amazon because of the variety of scents which you will not be able to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Okay, this is my second body scrub that I&#x27;ve ordered from Tree Hut.</li>
            <li>When I first tried the vanilla scented</li>
            <li>You could pay lots more for a similar product, but why do that?</li>
            <li>So definitely getting more.</li>
            <li>, they clean well and make my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it left my body feeling extremely soft</li>
            <li>This is a very decent sized tub.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel super soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>But I have a dry skin and this makes my skin more drier and so itchy.</li>
            <li>I bought this scrub because several other reviewers mentioned that it works great for creating a smooth canvas prior to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is great for removing dead skin cells, bringing the skin back to life!  </li>
            <li>the jar is huge it will last FOREVER!</li>
            <li>and I would definitely say this is on par, and with a cheap price I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t like much the fragrance</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper to buy these in bulk on Amazon than at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin really likes this brand of scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really does well to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li>Mango is always a very plesant aroma and smells yummy</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it was much cheaper but out of stock</li>
            <li>and it really softens your skin.</li>
            <li>Although this product can be used on your entire body, I primarily use it on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>straight dude here.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li>the scrub works very well to exfoliate your skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like this did much.</li>
            <li>whatever is in it should be finer to really exfoliate well.</li>
            <li>it exfoliates really well.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and look forward to trying some of their other scrubs as well.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit worried when I first got it, because it looked kind of liquidy, and I wondered if it would be abrasive enough, since I like a really rough scrub for my body.</li>
            <li>Not sure how good it is at exfoliating though, as there&#x27;s evidence that it didn&#x27;t do a complete job...</li>
            <li>You have to use a good amount of it to get the full effect which makes it expensive.</li>
            <li>like I was, I recommend using this scrub every other day for the first week to smooth the bumps,</li>
            <li>This is probably my third or fourth sugar scrub and I love this one just as much as the others.</li>
            <li>Decent scrub.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft and I&#x27;d recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>They exfoliate your skin well, they leave skin soft (not greasy like some scrubs) and they smell better than any other one out there.</li>
            <li>The exfoliant beads aren&#x27;t too fine nor too rough.</li>
            <li>Skin soft after use !!</li>
            <li>Not too harsh and it smell ok.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a body scrub that I could use a few times a week for exfoliation and since I love</li>
            <li>I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t runny like some can be such that they slide right off of your hand or get &#x27;looser&#x27; in texture...</li>
            <li>the oly proble is that you need to have the whole line ie wash, scrub and butter to really get the mango smell to last.</li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft after using!  </li>
            <li>The first use I scrubbed my entire body with just the amount on the lid.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week and it leaves my skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom, it&#x27;s that soft!</li>
            <li>Excited to try the other scents.</li>
            <li>NOT DARK BROWN SPOTS !!</li>
            <li>, it has a nutty, sweet scent, this on the other hand has a fruity scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rough enough to leave my skin really smooth but not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li>smooth sloshing away dead skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and therefore a product with a lot fragrance could cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li>have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this product fixed both of them.</li>
            <li>So if you have a sensitive nose this sent may not a the one for you.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and so moisturized.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>and it leaves your skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only reason this didn&#x27;t get five stars.</li>
            <li>Within a week the calluses I developed where gone and</li>
            <li>so far the scrubs I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>but with this having natural products I don&#x27;t break out at all.</li>
            <li>Not only does the mango scent of this scrub smell heavenly, it also works really well to exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped me to remove traces of old self-tanner and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>After I use it in the shower, I apply its sister body butter and the sweet and juicy scent last all day long.</li>
            <li>I pretty much expected that though, so it&#x27;s not a bother.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough, with enough sugar to exfoliate skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the major difference between this one and a home made product, the glorious scent.</li>
            <li>I would be cautious in doing this because it is very rough and needs a gentle hand to avoid damage to the sensitive skin around your face.</li>
            <li>Not too coarse, not too soft.</li>
            <li>the neck/collarbone can get a little red but this goes away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>i love the smell and the right amount of sugar to scrub away those ugly spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used small amounts of this on my face as well to help smooth away dry patches I have around my nose.</li>
            <li>Most scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past hurt, and they left my skin with little red whips.</li>

            <li> The smell alone is amazing, it leaves your skin smelling heavenly, on top of that</li>
            <li> I had never tried a sugar scrub of any kind, not even a salt kind and was excited to change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful, rinses clean, and is very softening.</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth after feeling (not greasy) and you just keep wanting to use more and more!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better when I use it...</li>
            <li> [figured that out after the fact] but even with that I still love this product.</li>
            <li> There is nothing that Bath and Body works (which I love) has ever put out that has come close to the fragrance of the Tree Hut Coconut Lime scent.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Tree Hut could sell these sugar scrubs for twice as much and people would still buy them, they smell that great.</li>
            <li> I love this sugar scrub.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub.  </li>
            <li> I Love this body scrub,sometimes when I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li> So glad I got this product.</li>
            <li> Love Tree Hut products -</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I am really glad I decided to order this.</li>
            <li> some scrubs &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; as I apply, meaning I have to keep applying more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand Amazon&#x27;s fluctuating prices and I think $10 is the most I would pay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub.</li>
            <li> I love all the sugar scrubs from Tree Hut and thought I would try this flavor.</li>
            <li> I do suggest that you lather with your favorite soap or body wash and use the scrub before washing off the soap/body wash.</li>
            <li> Love it..  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>

            <li> I love the feel and smell of this scrub.</li>
            <li> the product really works &amp; is a great skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love how silky it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> im a have to get some more and maybe even give out as part of a gift package</li>
            <li> I will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I totally love this scent and</li>
            <li> I have used Tree Hut products and are more than pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the Brazilian Nut and I love that one</li>
            <li> Mango is my favorite fruit</li>
            <li> so I think I fell in love the minute I opened the jar of this scrub.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to try out more scents from Tree Hut,</li>
            <li> but once I saw this I knew I had to try it as I love mango</li>
            <li> scrub provides the perfect exfoliation prior to epilating, which I do about once a week, or even sunless tanning since it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this body scrub.</li>
            <li> but the mango is even better.</li>
            <li> I love the thickness and the feel of the sugar on the skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the body scrub.</li>
            <li> Used to love this scrub until they added microbeads.</li>
            <li> it smells outstanding, and its mostly organic...</li>
            <li> Mmmm.... I love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I purchased the product.</li>
            <li> I just love what it does to my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scrub.</li>
            <li> and I love how it worked on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> I love the Tree Hut sugar scrubs.</li>
            <li> I really love these Tree Hut scrubs.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves your skin silky smooth and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong, delicious and fills your entire bathroom with an the scent every time you use it, making it smell like a tropical paradise.</li>
            <li> and I recommend this to anyone who wants silky skin that smells amazing!</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any downside, it&#x27;s that the scent is a bit sweet, but it dissipates throughout the day and still leaves a nice lingering scent on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance and really leaves the hands smooth.  </li>
            <li> so im not the only one to enjoy this wonderful smelling stuff</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, leaves my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells like a fresh mango and it leaves a nice mango scent on your skin.</li>
            <li> really fells good on my skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so strong as I thought.</li>
            <li> mango smells a bit strong for a guy that is trying to avoid the fragrances.</li>
            <li> The first type I bought was the coconut lime, which is just simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but love the way it makes my skin feel,</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good, and you cant beat the price, leaves your skin soo soft!</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my skin super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week to smooth out my legs, so when I use my Silk-Epil every 2-3 weeks I no longer have to deal with ingrown hairs and bumps.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a sugar scrub for a while and just couldn&#x27;t find one that had everything I was looking for: organic, smells great, actually smooths the skin.</li>
            <li> and it left my skin feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li> Yep, it gets that smooth with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It makes you soft and your skin smell good too.</li>
            <li> If you are more sensitive I would recommend using the scrub on its own rather than with exfoliating gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and works very well, plus it leaves a lingering scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is actually effective for exfoliation, but smells great and not drying to the skin...would probably purchase again for $7...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give 5 stars if better, higher quality ingredients were used.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from the youtuber saaammage and had to try it out since I love skin and body products.</li>
            <li> I originally owned the lavender and shae.........</li>
            <li> It works great as a once a week scrub, it may be too harsh to use any more than that.</li>
            <li> I just use this to scrub my arpits and body and I feel squiky clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> his face feels super smooth.</li>
            <li> well, my skin feels so clean after use.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I&#x27;m not overly familiar with the genuine fragrance of mangos; this actually smells lightly and pleasantly citrus-y, with maybe a tiny bit of vanilla in it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not obnoxiously sweet.</li>
            <li> Lovve this scrub, feel super clean after using it, and the smell?</li>
            <li> so you really don&#x27;t have to use more than about a quarter size amount each time on a loofah.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scrub, and it really leaves your skin so silky and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Good for all body exfoliating, especially to keep your legs and underarms in shape for epilating.</li>
            <li> Have only good things to say about this scrub</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and is really thick and scrubby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of the True Hut Body Scrubs and loved every one of them.  </li>
            <li> This is super abrasive</li>
            <li> I already ordered a 2nd one as this scrub is the best for deep exfoliating for the body.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other scents, but I am going to stick with this one for sure!!</li>
            <li> This body scrub smells sooooooo good, and the aroma lingers long after the shower.</li>
            <li> This new Tropical Mango sent is just lovely.</li>
            <li> , in my opinion it is way too strong (very citric and mango that will smell around home for a couple of hours)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that my legs are smoother than they have been in a long time, thanks to this lovely-smelling scrub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty gritty, but its good so the oil isnt all over the place.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body scrub and it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to remedy this by mixing in a small amount of moisturizing oil such as olive or coconut oil in with this scrub and now it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it makes my skin feel so soft without the greasy feel, plus it&#x27;s super inexpensive.</li>
            <li> self tanning makes my skin super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smell, which I very pleasant,  can tend to be very strong.</li>
            <li> and really makes my complexion look fantastic</li>
            <li> This smells lovely and keeps my skin soft year round, great product, and the tub lasts me awhile</li>
            <li> and now... i&#x27;m completely hooked, i love this product...</li>
            <li> However, my friend said she liked it very much, especially the scent, and she has even shared some of it with a friend.</li>
            <li> summer I decided I wanted to see if any of the other versions of the Tree Hut scrubs smelled as good.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> The price was right, too.</li>
            <li> Baby skin right after the shower</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, so normally when I use any kind of soap or scrub with a scent I break out</li>
            <li> It removes all dry skin and leave you with a smooth and refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run out that quickly and it is quite a large tub.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily if a product does not agree with me, but no breakout with this.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re moisturizing without being greasy or oily and causing your tub to become dangerously slippery; they smell crisp and pleasant and clean without being strong; the scrubbing particles are dense but are rounded so they don&#x27;t scratch your skin, and they&#x27;re so inexpensive for an 18 ounce jar!</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable and this is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, especially if you like mango.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> i am not 58.&lt;br /&gt;i discovered the benefit of this one day when i was getting my pedicure at Hot Springs Village Salon.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice rough texture that works wonders on the skin.</li>
            <li> first time using it</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a impulse by and I am not sorry I did.</li>
            <li> The smell of this scrub definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint--I love it and my skin feels refreshed and renewed after each use.</li>
            <li> I normally only purchase these on Amazon because of the variety of scents which you will not be able to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Okay, this is my second body scrub that I&#x27;ve ordered from Tree Hut.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the vanilla scented</li>
            <li> You could pay lots more for a similar product, but why do that?</li>
            <li> So definitely getting more.</li>
            <li> , they clean well and make my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it left my body feeling extremely soft</li>
            <li> This is a very decent sized tub.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel super soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> But I have a dry skin and this makes my skin more drier and so itchy.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub because several other reviewers mentioned that it works great for creating a smooth canvas prior to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is great for removing dead skin cells, bringing the skin back to life!  </li>
            <li> the jar is huge it will last FOREVER!</li>
            <li> and I would definitely say this is on par, and with a cheap price I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t like much the fragrance</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper to buy these in bulk on Amazon than at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin really likes this brand of scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really does well to exfoliate the skin.</li>
            <li> Mango is always a very plesant aroma and smells yummy</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it was much cheaper but out of stock</li>
            <li> and it really softens your skin.</li>
            <li> Although this product can be used on your entire body, I primarily use it on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li> straight dude here.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It exfoliates really well.</li>
            <li> the scrub works very well to exfoliate your skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel like this did much.</li>
            <li> whatever is in it should be finer to really exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> it exfoliates really well.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and look forward to trying some of their other scrubs as well.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit worried when I first got it, because it looked kind of liquidy, and I wondered if it would be abrasive enough, since I like a really rough scrub for my body.</li>
            <li> Not sure how good it is at exfoliating though, as there&#x27;s evidence that it didn&#x27;t do a complete job...</li>
            <li> You have to use a good amount of it to get the full effect which makes it expensive.</li>
            <li> like I was, I recommend using this scrub every other day for the first week to smooth the bumps,</li>
            <li> This is probably my third or fourth sugar scrub and I love this one just as much as the others.</li>
            <li> Decent scrub.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft and I&#x27;d recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> They exfoliate your skin well, they leave skin soft (not greasy like some scrubs) and they smell better than any other one out there.</li>
            <li> The exfoliant beads aren&#x27;t too fine nor too rough.</li>
            <li> Skin soft after use !!</li>
            <li> Not too harsh and it smell ok.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body scrub that I could use a few times a week for exfoliation and since I love</li>
            <li> I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t runny like some can be such that they slide right off of your hand or get &#x27;looser&#x27; in texture...</li>
            <li> the oly proble is that you need to have the whole line ie wash, scrub and butter to really get the mango smell to last.</li>
            <li> Skin feels so soft after using!  </li>
            <li> The first use I scrubbed my entire body with just the amount on the lid.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week and it leaves my skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom, it&#x27;s that soft!</li>
            <li> Excited to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> NOT DARK BROWN SPOTS !!</li>
            <li> , it has a nutty, sweet scent, this on the other hand has a fruity scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rough enough to leave my skin really smooth but not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> smooth sloshing away dead skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and therefore a product with a lot fragrance could cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li> have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this product fixed both of them.</li>
            <li> So if you have a sensitive nose this sent may not a the one for you.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and so moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> and it leaves your skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only reason this didn&#x27;t get five stars.</li>
            <li> Within a week the calluses I developed where gone and</li>
            <li> so far the scrubs I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> but with this having natural products I don&#x27;t break out at all.</li>
            <li> Not only does the mango scent of this scrub smell heavenly, it also works really well to exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped me to remove traces of old self-tanner and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> After I use it in the shower, I apply its sister body butter and the sweet and juicy scent last all day long.</li>
            <li> I pretty much expected that though, so it&#x27;s not a bother.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough, with enough sugar to exfoliate skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the major difference between this one and a home made product, the glorious scent.</li>
            <li> I would be cautious in doing this because it is very rough and needs a gentle hand to avoid damage to the sensitive skin around your face.</li>
            <li> Not too coarse, not too soft.</li>
            <li> the neck/collarbone can get a little red but this goes away fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> i love the smell and the right amount of sugar to scrub away those ugly spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used small amounts of this on my face as well to help smooth away dry patches I have around my nose.</li>
            <li> Most scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past hurt, and they left my skin with little red whips.</li>
            <li> I had a rash on my chest right on top of my breasts that I hate it but using this scrub every other day has virtually made it dissappear and not my chest is clear of blemishes.it</li>
            <li> I will be trying Tree Huts other scents soon in the near future!!</li>
            <li> The smell is long lasting and it makes your skin shine in the good way not the bad way.</li>
            <li> All I do is gently rub a small amount of the scrub onto a portion of the body and keep rubbing in circles until I can&#x27;t feel the sugar anymore.</li>
            <li> I recently tried a body scrub and it was so luxurious, I couldn&#x27;t believe I waited so long to use one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far</li>
            <li> It retains moisture all day long.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re starting out w/ rough skin or bumps</li>
            <li> After using every other day I do not notice the results or the extra moisture</li>
            <li> The mango smell is nice, but it&#x27;s a little artificial smelling.</li>
            <li> tree hut is a brand i will be sticking with for a long time!</li>
            <li> I am always trying new scrubs and have had soft ones that have hardly any beads to harsh ones that feel like they are going to gauge your skin off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 18 ounces--far more product than some of the very expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> A must for self tanner and dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> I did not particularly care for the scent on this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much for the tropical smell</li>
            <li> Got some of my rough spots smoothed out - some of the bumps from shaving</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve especialls been using it on my feet since the summer can be rather rough and drying to them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too rough on the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times prior to applying self-tanner (St. Tropez Bronzing Mousse).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to use it because I&#x27;m too impatient to send it back, and yadada...</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> I plan to buy a couple other scents to keep.</li>
            <li> -- I&#x27;ve noticed the times I have exfoliated with this scrub prior, my application lasts longer compared to past experiences using other exfoliating</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having read reviews for other scents by this brand, I am looking forward to trying others like the Coconut Lime as well as the Brazilian Nut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that now I&#x27;m going to have to buy all the other fragrances, too.</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that this scrub was a little abrasive and over drying for my already dry skin.</li>
            <li> I got this to help with my ingrown hair and dark patches on my skin</li>
            <li> i did not think about it, until i got home and sat down and looked at my feet, then my legs.  </li>
            <li> I mean its just soo yummy and juicy smelling, cant wait to try the same scent in the body</li>
            <li> My skin can be a little sensitive and typically the skin that is thin around</li>
            <li> This sugar scrub doesn&#x27;t have any lather and can be difficult to use if you don&#x27;t have enough water or additional later.</li>
            <li> i just wish it was a little cheaper on target</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for the body but not the face since it&#x27;s too harsh for it.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts for a few hours despite hand washing.</li>
            <li> It is harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to have a pedicure in a few months and it has been horrible.</li>
            <li> wish i considered this scrub or something similar for just the fake bake</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend at all for the face as it&#x27;s too harsh, but for the body, it works wonders!  </li>
            <li> I plan to use it every  other day to keep from over irritating it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and holds together, rather than plopping on the shower floor before you get it to your body, like some oily scrubs do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive crubs</li>
            <li> I was so sad when i saw the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> A must try for anyone addicted to either of these things as I am!</li>
            <li> A lot of scrubs can be really expensive, and I think I got this one for $6.00!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell of this scrub is wonderful!  It wakes you up in the shower in the morning and is so pleasant!  Skin feels so soft after using!  I&#x27;ve tried the other scents, but I am going to stick with this one for sure!!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this scrub! It was only like $6 and you get a lot for your $$. It smells really good, just like Tropical Mangos! I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, especially if you like mango. This is a very decent sized tub. Mine lasted 3+ months. I&#x27;d give 5 stars if better, higher quality ingredients were used.</li>
            <li> Not a mango person, but my mom is so I purchased this item for her and she loves it. thank you.</li>
            <li> Delicious smelling and feels great</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body scrub and it leaves my skin very soft. Great price for the product.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time keeps my skin smooth sloshing away dead skin</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much better when I use it...it isn&#x27;t runny like some can be such that they slide right off of your hand or get &#x27;looser&#x27; in texture...I&#x27;m not much for the tropical smell [figured that out after the fact] but even with that I still love this product.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how great a body scrub could smell until I tried out the Tree Hut brand of scrums. The first type I bought was the coconut lime, which is just simply amazing. There is nothing that Bath and Body works (which I love) has ever put out that has come close to the fragrance of the Tree Hut Coconut Lime scent. So I used it all last year each time I needed to exfoliate for sunless tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer I decided I wanted to see if any of the other versions of the Tree Hut scrubs smelled as good. I picked up a jar of this Tropical Mango and I LOVE it. Just like the Coconut Lime, it&#x27;s amazing. The fragrance is strong, delicious and fills your entire bathroom with an the scent every time you use it, making it smell like a tropical paradise. Tree Hut could sell these sugar scrubs for twice as much and people would still buy them, they smell that great. They exfoliate your skin well, they leave skin soft (not greasy like some scrubs) and they smell better than any other one out there. This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Great scent! It smells like tropical mango and I appreciate that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not obnoxiously sweet. It works great as a once a week scrub, it may be too harsh to use any more than that. I&#x27;ve used expensive crubs and I would definitely say this is on par, and with a cheap price I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have sensitive skin and therefore a product with a lot fragrance could cause me to breakout. However, this product smells AMAZING, and the smell lingers on the skin for a while, which I love! And it does not break me out.</li>
            <li> the product is nice, does the job but i didn&#x27;t like much the fragrance, in my opinion it is way too strong (very citric and mango that will smell around home for a couple of hours)</li>
            <li> I love this sugar scrub. Smells good and leaves your skin silky smooth and clean feeling. You have to use a good amount of it to get the full effect which makes it expensive.</li>
            <li> This smells lovely and keeps my skin soft year round, great product, and the tub lasts me awhile, glad I went with it!</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper to buy these in bulk on Amazon than at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin really likes this brand of scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good that I want to eat it...I don&#x27;t but it&#x27;s tempting.</li>
            <li> I just love this body scrub! Smells so good, and leave my skin smooth and I don&#x27;t need to put on lotion after.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub.  Smells really good and it works well to.</li>
            <li> I recently tried a body scrub and it was so luxurious, I couldn&#x27;t believe I waited so long to use one! Since then, I was searching for a similar scrub that didn&#x27;t cost $30 a jar; my search brought me to the Tree Hut line of products. I love this stuff because it makes my skin feel so soft without the greasy feel, plus it&#x27;s super inexpensive. I paired this with the corresponding Body Butter and it is luxurious as well.  If there&#x27;s any downside, it&#x27;s that the scent is a bit sweet, but it dissipates throughout the day and still leaves a nice lingering scent on the skin.  I love this product and look forward to trying some of their other scrubs as well.  I want to give these to all the ladies in my family so they can feel pampered too (combine the scrub, corresponding body butter and body wash to make a great gift)! Please make this scent in a 3-pack!</li>
            <li> love the smell!  this is a good scrub to use if you are looking for something inexpensive. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I Love this body scrub,sometimes when I&#x27;m in a hurry I just use this to scrub my arpits and body and I feel squiky clean afterwards. I had a rash on my chest right on top of my breasts that I hate it but using this scrub every other day has virtually made it dissappear and not my chest is clear of blemishes.it really does well to exfoliate the skin.I would recommend it for the body but not the face since it&#x27;s too harsh for it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and it is a great consistency... perfect scrub for the money. Would recommend to anyone who is considering it</li>
            <li> So glad I got this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure at first, but love the way it makes my skin feel,</li>
            <li> Love Tree Hut products - I have almost every singe one. Mango is always a very plesant aroma and smells yummy</li>
            <li> I love it. I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel. I can&#x27;t get enough but I do prefer the lavender one from the same brand. Its a must have either one.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, leaves my skin clean and smooth. Got some of my rough spots smoothed out - some of the bumps from shaving have almost completely gone away. I am really glad I decided to order this.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub! It&#x27;s rough enough to leave my skin really smooth but not abrasive at all. Also a little goes a long way.. some scrubs &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; as I apply, meaning I have to keep applying more. Not this one. It&#x27;s nice and thick. The first use I scrubbed my entire body with just the amount on the lid. It leaves skin moisturized but not &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; at all and the smell is AMAZING. it&#x27;s like passionfruit. One thing though when I bought this last week it was just under $6 and now it&#x27;s about $17. I don&#x27;t understand Amazon&#x27;s fluctuating prices and I think $10 is the most I would pay.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scrub. Gentle enough, with enough sugar to exfoliate skin. Not too harsh and it smell ok. Try to avoid getting water in the jar.</li>
            <li> Lovve this scrub, feel super clean after using it, and the smell? PERFECT.</li>
            <li> The Mango is so wonderful, it has such a strong smell and its delicious. I first heard about this product from the youtuber saaammage and had to try it out since I love skin and body products. This is super abrasive but it&#x27;s great on the body because it soften and smoothes and I&#x27;ve especialls been using it on my feet since the summer can be rather rough and drying to them. I&#x27;ve used small amounts of this on my face as well to help smooth away dry patches I have around my nose. I would be cautious in doing this because it is very rough and needs a gentle hand to avoid damage to the sensitive skin around your face.</li>
            <li> I love all the sugar scrubs from Tree Hut and thought I would try this flavor. This one is just as delicious as the rest. I use this in the shower once or twice a week and its a great exfoliater. It&#x27;s got some grit to it so you really don&#x27;t have to use more than about a quarter size amount each time on a loofah. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The granules aren&#x27;t too big, so the scrub isn&#x27;t abrasive. I do suggest that you lather with your favorite soap or body wash and use the scrub before washing off the soap/body wash. This sugar scrub doesn&#x27;t have any lather and can be difficult to use if you don&#x27;t have enough water or additional later. The smell is wonderful! It smells like a fresh mango and it leaves a nice mango scent on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love it..  Works great and smells even better!!  I will be trying Tree Huts other scents soon in the near future!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this!! It&#x27;s to die for. I use it once a week and it leaves my skin feeling like a baby&#x27;s bottom, it&#x27;s that soft! It doesn&#x27;t run out that quickly and it is quite a large tub. I am definitely a regular for this.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent but it&#x27;s not so strong as I thought. Feels wonderful, rinses clean, and is very softening. Smells great. Works very well!</li>
            <li> if my doctor had known about this and how it is helping me, she would have ordered it for me.  i have a skin condition that is not contagious but has spread to my legs and back.  there is not a cure.  However, this will help make it appear invisible to the public, only you will know you have this condition.  it is called Ichthyosis. i was diagnosed with this in my 20s.  i am not 58.&lt;br /&gt;i discovered the benefit of this one day when i was getting my pedicure at Hot Springs Village Salon.  Chris my manicurist used the sugar scrub they have on me.  i did not think about it, until i got home and sat down and looked at my feet, then my legs.  i could not believe what my eyes were not seeing.  NOT DARK BROWN SPOTS !! now, i can wear my sandals and dresses with out feeling like i have something catching. THANK YOU FOR CARRYING THIS SUGAR SCRUB.  I WILL BE BUYING MORE, SOON !! i love the smell and the right amount of sugar to scrub away those ugly spots. i am fair skinned and they stick out like a sore thumb.  !!!!</li>
            <li> The mango scent is very refreshing. After using every other day I do not notice the results or the extra moisture others claim... I would definitely not order this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feel super soft and refreshed. I got this to help with my ingrown hair and dark patches on my skin and I have to say this product fixed both of them. My only complaint is that the smell, which I very pleasant,  can tend to be very strong. So if you have a sensitive nose this sent may not a the one for you.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and my mother-in-law loved it. i just wish it was a little cheaper on target it was much cheaper but out of stock</li>
            <li> Smells so good, so that after using it I keep smelling myself... Not sure how good it is at exfoliating though, as there&#x27;s evidence that it didn&#x27;t do a complete job... But it&#x27;s such a treat to use it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and it really softens your skin. Everyone who smells it wants to try it out for themselves, Just try it, its only a few bucks</li>
            <li> Although this product can be used on your entire body, I primarily use it on my hands.  It has a great fragrance and really leaves the hands smooth.  It is great for removing dead skin cells, bringing the skin back to life!  The scent lasts for a few hours despite hand washing.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scrub, and it really leaves your skin so silky and not greasy. Also does not leave the shower a slippery death trap like some scrubs do. A must for self tanner and dry winter skin!</li>
            <li> I just tried this on my hands and it is wonderful. However, I would like to point out that at Walmart&#x27;s website, it is $5.88 for an 18-oz jar. Also, does anyone know if this can be used as a facial scrub, or no?</li>
            <li> Love this scrub. Good for all body exfoliating, especially to keep your legs and underarms in shape for epilating. Not too coarse, not too soft. Just right. Smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, and leaves my skin feeling absolutely beautiful. My skin feels so soft and so moisturized. I recommend this to anyone. I was so sad when i saw the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product. After I use it in the shower, I apply its sister body butter and the sweet and juicy scent last all day long. My skin is soft and moisturized. I combine any kind of lotion I use with either body oil or body oil gel. It retains moisture all day long.</li>
            <li> It does the job and really exfoliates without being too harsh on the skin. I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily if a product does not agree with me, but no breakout with this. I like the tropical mango the best out of all the scents.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved this product.</li>
            <li> straight dude here.&lt;br /&gt;this is pretty incredible stuff. makes your skin feel perfectly smooth after your shower and it remains that way for a good while. not oily. mango smells a bit strong for a guy that is trying to avoid the fragrances. others huve suggested lime and kiwi. i picked up some kiwi already and i imagine that will be just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also this now a necessity before i use a self tanner. wish i considered this scrub or something similar for just the fake bake</li>
            <li> I love the feel and smell of this scrub. It has a nice rough texture that works wonders on the skin. The oil in the mixture stays on well after washing. I plan to use it every  other day to keep from over irritating it. I plan to buy a couple other scents to keep. That&#x27;s the major difference between this one and a home made product, the glorious scent.</li>
            <li> I bought a sample @ ULTA this spring and loved it.  This is a great price!</li>
            <li> I originally owned the lavender and shae.........and now... i&#x27;m completely hooked, i love this product...would recommend! great buy and really makes my complexion look fantastic</li>
            <li> loved this product. my daughter took it from me &amp; i only got to use it once or twice. i bought it again &amp; just smells so wonderful. the product really works &amp; is a great skin cleanser.</li>
            <li> Smells and works great! It exfoliates really well. You can&#x27;t beat the price. I will definitely continue to use this product. I also use the body wash, and body butter. I love Tree Hut products!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! I love how silky it leaves my skin feeling. The exfoliant beads aren&#x27;t too fine nor too rough. I have semi-sensitive skin and it&#x27;s just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> In love with this scrub! first time using it and already my skin is softer!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone, so I can&#x27;t rate it for myself. However, my friend said she liked it very much, especially the scent, and she has even shared some of it with a friend.</li>
            <li> I had found some of these at Walmart but not this scent which added in in me ordering this.  It smells so good im a have to get some more and maybe even give out as part of a gift package so im not the only one to enjoy this wonderful smelling stuff and it leaves your skin feeling so soft.  Great all around</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! Works great and smells even better. I will buy more for sure. It makes your skin so smooth!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell, I loved the way my skin felt and I definitely loved the price. I would recommend this product to my friends and family, and I hope to do business here again. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful!  It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I&#x27;d hoped, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to be.  Because it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of oil in it, the consistancy is great.  It&#x27;s thick and holds together, rather than plopping on the shower floor before you get it to your body, like some oily scrubs do. The price was right, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a impulse by and I am not sorry I did. It smells so nice and works great. The smell is long lasting and it makes your skin shine in the good way not the bad way. Used it all over and did not have any reactions. The price was very reasonable and this is why I bought it in the first place. I bought it to use with my Pro X facial exfoliator device. Works great with and with out . I will defiantly buy again. Excited to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I bought this just because it was cheap! A lot of scrubs can be really expensive, and I think I got this one for $6.00! It smells great for one thing! I was a bit worried when I first got it, because it looked kind of liquidy, and I wondered if it would be abrasive enough, since I like a really rough scrub for my body. It was perfect though! I would definitely repurchase this, and probably will!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body scrub that I could use a few times a week for exfoliation and since I love mango smells, I decided to give this one a try. The smell of this scrub definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint--I love it and my skin feels refreshed and renewed after each use. However, I noticed that this scrub was a little abrasive and over drying for my already dry skin. I&#x27;ve been able to remedy this by mixing in a small amount of moisturizing oil such as olive or coconut oil in with this scrub and now it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and works very well, plus it leaves a lingering scent. The mango smell is nice, but it&#x27;s a little artificial smelling. I pretty much expected that though, so it&#x27;s not a bother. That&#x27;s really the only reason this didn&#x27;t get five stars. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has worked awesomely. I have not been able to have a pedicure in a few months and it has been horrible. Within a week the calluses I developed where gone and my feet are smoother. The scent awesome.</li>
            <li> This stuff was awsome! really fells good on my skin. the oly proble is that you need to have the whole line ie wash, scrub and butter to really get the mango smell to last.</li>
            <li> This product is very good, it smells delicious and it is soft on your skin as well as workable with water. It leaves a smooth after feeling (not greasy) and you just keep wanting to use more and more! I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good, and you cant beat the price, leaves your skin soo soft! My husband even commented that he liked how great my skin smelled after using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this scrub because several other reviewers mentioned that it works great for creating a smooth canvas prior to epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that it does! I use it once a week to smooth out my legs, so when I use my Silk-Epil every 2-3 weeks I no longer have to deal with ingrown hairs and bumps. I&#x27;m happy to report that my legs are smoother than they have been in a long time, thanks to this lovely-smelling scrub!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re starting out w/ rough skin or bumps like I was, I recommend using this scrub every other day for the first week to smooth the bumps, and then once a week thereafter. :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and it leaves a good smooth touch out of the shower!</li>
            <li> Great price, lasts a long time, perfect exfoliant and the smell is divineeeeee! I would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several of the True Hut Body Scrubs and loved every one of them.  This can be used all over your body.  It removes all dry skin and leave you with a smooth and refreshing feeling. If you try it you want regret it.  Very Good!!!</li>
            <li> I totally love this scent and the scrub works very well to exfoliate your skin.  I normally only purchase these on Amazon because of the variety of scents which you will not be able to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift for a friend and they like it a lot.  They said it was a great scrub and smelled awesome as well.</li>
            <li> I have used Tree Hut products and are more than pleased with them.  I did not particularly care for the scent on this one.</li>
            <li> I only opened the jar yesterday!&lt;br /&gt;Smells great! feels great! Skin soft after use !! Amazing Amazing Amazing !! Baby skin right after the shower</li>
            <li> Decent scrub.  I prefer the salt ones tho.  This did not have enough scrubby sugar in it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body scrub and it&#x27;s a great exfoliant for shower time. It makes you soft and your skin smell good too.</li>
            <li> Okay, this is my second body scrub that I&#x27;ve ordered from Tree Hut. I have tried the Brazilian Nut and I love that one, it has a nutty, sweet scent, this on the other hand has a fruity scent. Mango is my favorite fruit so I think I fell in love the minute I opened the jar of this scrub. I am looking forward to try out more scents from Tree Hut, so far the scrubs I&#x27;ve tried have smelled so good, they clean well and make my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this body scrub! I am always trying new scrubs and have had soft ones that have hardly any beads to harsh ones that feel like they are going to gauge your skin off.  This one is a very happy medium! I have tried the Tree Hut Coconut Lime and didnt even know this one existed but once I saw this I knew I had to try it as I love mango scents.&lt;br /&gt;This scrub provides the perfect exfoliation prior to epilating, which I do about once a week, or even sunless tanning since it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on your skin. A must try for anyone addicted to either of these things as I am!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find that I could purchase these products on Amazon, they make your skin fill out of this world. I recommend these products to everyone. I love using them!!!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this body scrub. When I first tried the vanilla scented it was good but the mango is even better. I love the thickness and the feel of the sugar on the skin. Have only good things to say about this scrub and I will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel like this did much. &amp; I felt like the sugar or whatever is in it should be finer to really exfoliate well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the body scrub. It&#x27;s not too rough on the skin and it smells great! All I do is gently rub a small amount of the scrub onto a portion of the body and keep rubbing in circles until I can&#x27;t feel the sugar anymore. It leaves my skin feeling soft. I will difinitely buy this one again.</li>
            <li> You could pay lots more for a similar product, but why do that? This is a great scrub, good smelling, great price.  It&#x27;s 18 ounces--far more product than some of the very expensive brands.  Since it does work well, and since it&#x27;s a great price--I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The smell is WONDERFUL! It leaves my bathroom smelling like a tropical drink. Most scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past hurt, and they left my skin with little red whips. This one does not do that at all. I also have sensitive skin, so normally when I use any kind of soap or scrub with a scent I break out and my skin itches, but with this having natural products I don&#x27;t break out at all. Using this product will make you feel like you are at a spa. I love it!</li>
            <li> Used to love this scrub until they added microbeads. It was awesome before microbeads, just sugar and oil. Now I need to find a different scrub.</li>
            <li> what is to say for a product that is absolutely perfect? the jar is huge it will last FOREVER! it smells outstanding, and its mostly organic...(i have sensitve skin). tree hut is a brand i will be sticking with for a long time!</li>
            <li> Not only does the mango scent of this scrub smell heavenly, it also works really well to exfoliate the skin.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times prior to applying self-tanner (St. Tropez Bronzing Mousse).  It&#x27;s helped me to remove traces of old self-tanner and leaves my skin soft.  I like that the scent lingers after using too.  Another nice benefit for the self-tanning application -- I&#x27;ve noticed the times I have exfoliated with this scrub prior, my application lasts longer compared to past experiences using other exfoliating scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using this scrub with Body Shop exfoliating gloves for an extra bit of scrubbing effect.  My skin can be a little sensitive and typically the skin that is thin around the neck/collarbone can get a little red but this goes away fairly quickly.  If you are more sensitive I would recommend using the scrub on its own rather than with exfoliating gloves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having read reviews for other scents by this brand, I am looking forward to trying others like the Coconut Lime as well as the Brazilian Nut.  For the price, it&#x27;s a great value and makes restocking an easy decision!</li>
            <li> I like to use scrub before shaving, and tried this brazilian nut version of this from walmart and was quite happy! Since I can no longer be bothered with waiting in lines at stores, or even driving to stores, I decided to buy this based on what I&#x27;ve tried before. The smell is sooooo delicious! I mean its just soo yummy and juicy smelling, cant wait to try the same scent in the body wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty gritty, but its good so the oil isnt all over the place. I guess it gets the job done, but the smell, its simply amazing! I hope they never discontinue</li>
            <li> The scent is out of this world. Mmmm.... I love this product. Keeps my skin so soft. My boyfriend can&#x27;t keep his hands off of me.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. I had been looking for a sugar scrub for a while and just couldn&#x27;t find one that had everything I was looking for: organic, smells great, actually smooths the skin. This product is all of that. You get a lot for your money and I recommend this to anyone who wants silky skin that smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this body scrub best I ever tried great for before self tanning makes my skin super soft and smooth! And smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and is really thick and scrubby. I&#x27;m really glad I purchased the product. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far and it left my skin feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells so, so, SO good. The smell is so bright and happy! I just love what it does to my skin. I have caught myself rubbing my arms at work just to feel the silky goodness. I&#x27;m addicted. The size of the tub of scrub you get is quite generous for the price, too!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this scrub.But I have a dry skin and this makes my skin more drier and so itchy.It is harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> This smells so good!  doesn&#x27;t leave a slippery film in the shower.  Smells more expensive that it is.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it left my body feeling extremely soft I topped it with the tree hut mango lotion... Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is actually effective for exfoliation, but smells great and not drying to the skin...would probably purchase again for $7...</li>
            <li> This smells soooooo good and I love how it worked on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Did not leave a greasy residue in my tub either. Scent is amazing...wish I had bought two instead of one.</li>
            <li> I love the Tree Hut sugar scrubs. This new Tropical Mango sent is just lovely. The company is great - would order again.</li>
            <li> The smell alone is amazing, it leaves your skin smelling heavenly, on top of that it exfoliates really well.  It&#x27;s so good I have now caught my husband using it. lol  He uses it after he shaves and I have to say he smells delicious and his face feels super smooth. So definitely getting more.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, cleans good. Makes showering a very enjoyable experience. Would be nice to have a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> I already ordered a 2nd one as this scrub is the best for deep exfoliating for the body.  I don&#x27;t recommend at all for the face as it&#x27;s too harsh, but for the body, it works wonders!  I use this 1-2 times a week to make my skin like a baby&#x27;s butt. Yep, it gets that smooth with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a sugar scrub of any kind, not even a salt kind and was excited to change that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells delicious and I cannot wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One con about this purchase for me was the fact that the lid wasn&#x27;t sealed. Is this normal? I&#x27;m still going to use it because I&#x27;m too impatient to send it back, and yadada...</li>
            <li> This is probably my third or fourth sugar scrub and I love this one just as much as the others. It smells great and makes my skin super smooth and soft. I would recommend this!!</li>
            <li> I really love these Tree Hut scrubs. They&#x27;re moisturizing without being greasy or oily and causing your tub to become dangerously slippery; they smell crisp and pleasant and clean without being strong; the scrubbing particles are dense but are rounded so they don&#x27;t scratch your skin, and they&#x27;re so inexpensive for an 18 ounce jar! To be honest, I&#x27;m not overly familiar with the genuine fragrance of mangos; this actually smells lightly and pleasantly citrus-y, with maybe a tiny bit of vanilla in it. It&#x27;s very nice and works so well. I&#x27;m thinking that now I&#x27;m going to have to buy all the other fragrances, too.</li>
            <li> This product does it&#x27;s job well, my skin feels so clean after use. And the smell!!! OMG the smell is amazing!!! Smells too good to not be edible!</li>
            <li> This body scrub smells sooooooo good, and the aroma lingers long after the shower. Makes my skin very soft and I&#x27;d recommend to anyone!</li>
