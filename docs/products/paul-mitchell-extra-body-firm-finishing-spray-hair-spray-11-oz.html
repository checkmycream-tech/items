            <li>it is so light, does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>Holds great for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>In the long run will probably save money AND it is a cruelty free product!!!</li>
            <li>Very natural, nice smell and feel.</li>
            <li>It has control, nice smell and makes my hair soft.</li>

            <li>This hairspray works very well on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Although it says it&#x27;s FIRM finishing spray, it brushes right out for a soft bounce to your hair.  </li>
            <li>had been using Sexy for hold but this  firming spray will hold without weighing ur hair down using less spray!</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, blonde hair.</li>

            <li> This hairspray works very well on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair. This product holds it without stiffness or stickiness. It is the only thing I&#x27;ll use. It is perfect for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Terrible hairspray. Maybe would have been good with some 1980s hairstyles where you needed cement.</li>
            <li> This holds my fine hair nicely without being too heavy or sticking it together.  Been using it for a long time.  It&#x27;s a 5 rating on cosmetics database, which is better than a lot of sprays on the market.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. Item was delivered as described and in a timely manner</li>
            <li> This spray works great on my short, spikey hair. Doesnt require alot and will brush out the next morning without leaving a residue.</li>
            <li> I was using a different Paul Mitchell hairspray but it was too sticky and you had to put a lot in to get your hair to behave the way you wanted.  This one is different.....it is so light, does it&#x27;s job and it smells great.  This is my new hairspray forever.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. An essential for me. I have very fine hair when I put curls in it and spray with this they last most of the night (using a styling mousse and anti frizz serum prior or my hair won&#x27;t hold the curl.) it does leave a bit of a film but a good shampoo and it washes out beautifully. Can lasts a while it use it maybe 3-4 times a week. Amazon is great as always, had it fast.</li>
            <li> I always tell my friends, &amp;#34;I need a finishing spray that will hold my hair in place during a tornado&amp;#34; and Paul Mitchell Extra Body Finishing Spray is the only one that meets with those requirements.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray ever!  It holds so well without making my hair stiff.  The hold last all day!</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my wife&#x27;s hair.  She loves the hold and how easy it is to use.  Will buy this product again</li>
            <li> Not only extra body but extra hold. Very little us needed at one time. In the long run will probably save money AND it is a cruelty free product!!!</li>
            <li> I loved it thank you.</li>
            <li> My favourite hairspray. Holds style firmly and adds volume. Good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Although it says it&#x27;s FIRM finishing spray, it brushes right out for a soft bounce to your hair.  Highly recommend for it&#x27;s great holding power but soft view</li>

            <li> Great for competition hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different name brand hair sprays.  This product was recommended to me by one of my good friends and I have to say that Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Extra Body Firm Finishing Spray is BY FAR the best I have used.  I have naturally curly hair and when I straighten it I like to have a firm hold.  This is a great product and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> A pleasure to deal with.</li>
            <li> I would be lost without this spray. It is wonderful because, as the first reviewer said, it makes fine or limp hair look full and lush. And it holds in the humid weather. AND it washes out with water and leaves no build-up on fine or silky hair. I can&#x27;t imagine a better tonsorial product.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sticky. I can still use a brush through my hair. Holds great for long periods of time. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item on Amazon &amp; buy @ local salons.....love!!! I have fine, thin hair &amp; use it for styling. I&#x27;m able to comb through &amp; spray once more to hold. Holds all day!!</li>
            <li> I give this less than 0. One container never worked and 2 others failed completely when not even half-used. For an expensive product, this is pathetic.</li>

            <li> I used to use Giga Hold until they stopped making it.  Looked all over for a hair spray that would hold without looking stiff.  This is the one.  Will use this until they decided to change it up.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great hold.  Just wish the smell were toned down a bit..</li>
            <li> Love this spray I have fine hair but lot&#x27;s of it! had been using Sexy for hold but this  firming spray will hold without weighing ur hair down using less spray! Very light with lot&#x27;s of hold!</li>
