            <li>Great palette and the shades blend well together for better coverage of whatever you&#x27;re concealing!</li>
            <li>Good quality, but darker than what I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not as good as Mac studio finish so don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I chose to get another elf concealer palette, this time in the shade Fair.</li>
            <li>Good for highlighting eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Good for concealing bruises.</li>
            <li>Good Variety of coverage samples.</li>

            <li>Its a good product</li>

            <li>E.l.f is good at the basics.</li>
            <li>is not the best concealer but is not bad.</li>
            <li>Great colors and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>and this is a great pallet for VERY light skin</li>
            <li>really happy.. :)</li>
            <li>This product is great however, I think it needs better &amp;#34;sticking to the skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The product is good goes on nicely, blends nicely.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love that I have colors to mix!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Great coverage but wipes/smudges easily</li>
            <li>This is an amazing concealer.</li>
            <li>amazing coverage  </li>
            <li>But its nice to have while you have it.</li>
            <li>I totally liked this palette.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>I considered it because I had read good reviews, and then decided to purchase once I had looked it up on the EWG SkinDeep database and found that it was rated a 1 (0-10 rating system with 10 being the most toxic).</li>
            <li>They accidently sent me 2, which was nice.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li>The concealers are decent quality, but provide medium coverage at best.  </li>
            <li>elf Eyes lips is a good price and the seller shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it melts very easy and stayed that way.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m fair skinned, so it&#x27;s not too light for me.</li>
            <li>I first opened the package I thought it was too light for my skin, however it was my perfect skin tone when I blended it a bit more onto my skin</li>
            <li>The product itself is very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Conceals very lightly.</li>
            <li>I love that you choose the colors needed on a daily basis, this is perfect for your daily changing concealer needs LOL its great.</li>
            <li>Very nice, a really  concealer, buy it again!</li>
            <li>It just crumbled, and as I tried to wipe it off it crumbled even more.</li>
            <li>nice coverage smooth looking</li>
            <li>so i guess its ok</li>
            <li>Another issue is the way most &amp;#34;emphasize&amp;#34; the lines instead of doing it&#x27;s job as intended.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This worked just as well, includes more colors, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and has much better ingredients.</li>
            <li>I like it better.</li>
            <li>I really liked the packing, the brush, and most importantly the consistency and quality of the concealer.</li>
            <li>Love the product  many colors</li>
            <li>I love my concealer and the fact that I can mix it to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The price is great, but it really doesn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>but the reason I didn&#x27;t get it from telco is because I thought Amazon would give more product in it</li>
            <li>I love this product I use it every day</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, even though is very creamy</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like the  product because you are able to blend the colors to what you need.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I like this, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it works on my skin</li>
            <li>Love these concealers.  </li>
            <li>product is ok</li>
            <li>You can use different shades on your face to  highlight your best features!!!</li>
            <li>If you have a tan complexion, these might work better for you.</li>
            <li>The different colors are nice for a good match though!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li>This one is a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li>just a click away perfect coverage and lasts a long time,.</li>
            <li>its a very compact palette,, the concealer does its job really well,, best buy for the price..</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and the light worked just right for me.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of the creams, the pigmentation is excellent -- it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover a large area -- and they blend very well.</li>
            <li>The colors in order are a light peachy color, warm yellow, a darker warm peach, and a more beige/tan color.</li>
            <li>I originally decided to try it because it had a great color palette, but it is pretty much like putting nothing on your skin.</li>
            <li>I picked a shade too light.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and brings out a refreshed/awakened look.</li>
            <li>It says light</li>
            <li>This is a smooth and creamy consistency and a quality product.</li>
            <li>The color choices were great, but not enough coverage.</li>
            <li>Website help is also available if you desire to seek help on how to use this product correctly.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this concealer pallet a lot and will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have fair, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>but i wish the convealer wasnt so creamy but other than that all the colors are great went well with my skintone :)</li>
            <li>The darkest one I can use alone right now, and the other shades will be perfect for winter and spring.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Great for covering up blemishes and also great for highlighting under eyes especially after a long night!</li>
            <li>Ok but really haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li>Works better when you use your finger to apply, the brush applies too much.</li>
            <li>It is too sheer for good coverage in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Blending between colors and problem areas was pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned, so I really only use the first two colors in the palette, and those work very well for me.</li>
            <li>Tecsture is not so good, it dries my skin and not lasts long.</li>
            <li>As long as you use it correctly, it really does work great.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for, like to use it to highlight my face!</li>
            <li>- I prefer to tap concealer on so that it blends more naturally anyway.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the most gentle; flattering concealer at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I definitely have the kind of skin tone that matches these colors, but it didn&#x27;t when I applied it.</li>
            <li>I am having fun playing with the concealers in this kit.</li>
            <li>but there is never the right hue</li>
            <li>Used on 2 different skin types and both experienced the same issue.</li>
            <li>The coverage sucks, looks cheap, but pigmentations good.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the color on the far left, which looks great with my skin.</li>
            <li>I actually use them together most days to get just the right shade.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for this product very much.</li>
            <li>I found a long time ago, actually goes on smoothly; covers gently if you want, or more if you care to layer it more.  </li>
            <li>The little box it came in said &amp;#34;fair to light,&amp;#34; which scared me because I AM fair and cannot wear &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; foundations.</li>
            <li>I am fairly pleased with the performance of the product as a concealer, although is it really possible for any concealer to truly provide 100% coverage??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried applying with both a brush and hands - I&#x27;ve used Smashbox concealer and NYX concealers and they are a lot higher quality - so this one is a 3.5 star, just like the eye shadow palette, and I&#x27;m glad I got it, but I have to apply some heavy layers for it to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to my skin! :)</li>
            <li>Studio Complete Coverage Concealer Color Light</li>
            <li>At first, I was leary because I did think it would be so creamy and thought &amp;</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried higher end brands</li>
            <li>It is not as thick which is great also because you don&#x27;t want a cake look.</li>
            <li>I put a layer of elf sparkly under-eye powder on top, which helps it last longer.</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe my other concealer was a more complete cover</li>
            <li>Nice colors came as expected and colors as pictured!</li>
            <li>I love the different tones of more yellow and more pink variations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought, and for beginners in makeup, this is absolutely perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pots are exceptionally small but a good product.</li>
            <li>After a certain age, those under eye circles need to be concealed.</li>
            <li>Elf cosmetics are pretty decent.</li>
            <li>This concealer goes on ok, but after an hour or so, it looks like the area it&#x27;s been applied on becomes very dry and patchy looking.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very mindful of my budget.</li>
            <li>this stuff does really well.</li>
            <li>I am really liking the ELF products.</li>
            <li>I was very unpleased with my order.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and it blends in really well without rubbing off or attracting my liner or mascara to it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li>fast delivery....</li>
            <li>I have other products that work better.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors looked really orange-y and dark, but match better on the skin.</li>
            <li>For my dark circles, which are purple, the third color does a good job.</li>
            <li>I was in the mall buying concealers that didn&#x27;t live up to expectations!</li>
            <li>a bout this particular product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>This concealer applies a little better if you dab it with a finger instead of using the concealer brush</li>
            <li>The light color doesn&#x27;t show up as much as expected.</li>
            <li>(for example, my cheeks are pinker, forehead slightly more tan, and chin really pale).</li>
            <li>I love E.L.F., but I prefer the pale stick concealer they have for the coverage.</li>
            <li>Brush is a lil stiff but after a while it works better.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have real dark puffiness, forget about this product because even though the concealer works great, the dark holes can still be visible</li>
            <li>The other thing is you want something that lasts this product does not leave you needing a touch up huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li>(I am a mix of asian mexican, however my skin a bit light</li>
            <li>If I do want extra coverage, or brightening, the first two shades can achieve that.</li>
            <li>I purchased all three palettes, light, medium and dark, to use for contouring.  </li>
            <li>I think if I used very much of it for a long day, it would end up looking shiny on my already-oily skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was the product, or is got old sitting somewhere.</li>
            <li>But I had no trouble covering any and</li>
            <li>it came a day early.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something to completely cover, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>I ended up giving it to my 20 something year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I think is too soft but it helps with the foundation</li>
            <li>I love elf products - when they say &amp;#34;light,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;medium,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dark,&amp;#34; they mean it</li>
            <li>At first I was worried because none of the colors looked like they would match my skin tone, especially when I have slightly different skin tones on my face</li>
            <li>I have used all of the concealer in the 3rd from the left well and wish I could order just that color instead of buying the whole palette!</li>
            <li>Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new concealer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mature woman and one of the draw&#x3D;backs of most &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; concealers is how dry they go on and tug on the delicate skin.  </li>
            <li>Several other reviewers said it was too light or didn&#x27;t cover well, but, as I was out of other options, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>but beware it only takes a little to get the job done right</li>
            <li>But it covers as well as any other I have found, and I do really like the option of several colors in one package.</li>
            <li>I have yet to use the fourth color because it is a little too dark for my skin tone, but it would be a good color for subtle contouring.</li>

            <li> This product is great however, I think it needs better &amp;#34;sticking to the skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The product is good goes on nicely, blends nicely.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love that I have colors to mix!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Great coverage but wipes/smudges easily</li>
            <li> This is an amazing concealer.</li>
            <li> amazing coverage  </li>
            <li> But its nice to have while you have it.</li>
            <li> I totally liked this palette.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> I considered it because I had read good reviews, and then decided to purchase once I had looked it up on the EWG SkinDeep database and found that it was rated a 1 (0-10 rating system with 10 being the most toxic).</li>
            <li> They accidently sent me 2, which was nice.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> The concealers are decent quality, but provide medium coverage at best.  </li>
            <li> elf Eyes lips is a good price and the seller shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it melts very easy and stayed that way.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m fair skinned, so it&#x27;s not too light for me.</li>
            <li> I first opened the package I thought it was too light for my skin, however it was my perfect skin tone when I blended it a bit more onto my skin</li>
            <li> The product itself is very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Conceals very lightly.</li>
            <li> I love that you choose the colors needed on a daily basis, this is perfect for your daily changing concealer needs LOL its great.</li>
            <li> Very nice, a really  concealer, buy it again!</li>
            <li> It just crumbled, and as I tried to wipe it off it crumbled even more.</li>
            <li> nice coverage smooth looking</li>
            <li> so i guess its ok</li>
            <li> Another issue is the way most &amp;#34;emphasize&amp;#34; the lines instead of doing it&#x27;s job as intended.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This worked just as well, includes more colors, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and has much better ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like it better.</li>
            <li> I really liked the packing, the brush, and most importantly the consistency and quality of the concealer.</li>
            <li> Love the product  many colors</li>
            <li> I love my concealer and the fact that I can mix it to match my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The price is great, but it really doesn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> but the reason I didn&#x27;t get it from telco is because I thought Amazon would give more product in it</li>
            <li> I love this product I use it every day</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, even though is very creamy</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I like the  product because you are able to blend the colors to what you need.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I like this, but don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it works on my skin</li>
            <li> Love these concealers.  </li>
            <li> product is ok</li>
            <li> You can use different shades on your face to  highlight your best features!!!</li>
            <li> If you have a tan complexion, these might work better for you.</li>
            <li> The different colors are nice for a good match though!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good coverage.</li>
            <li> This one is a pretty good buy.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good stuff.  </li>
            <li> just a click away perfect coverage and lasts a long time,.</li>
            <li> its a very compact palette,, the concealer does its job really well,, best buy for the price..</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and the light worked just right for me.</li>
            <li> Easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of the creams, the pigmentation is excellent -- it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover a large area -- and they blend very well.</li>
            <li> The colors in order are a light peachy color, warm yellow, a darker warm peach, and a more beige/tan color.</li>
            <li> I originally decided to try it because it had a great color palette, but it is pretty much like putting nothing on your skin.</li>
            <li> I picked a shade too light.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and brings out a refreshed/awakened look.</li>
            <li> It says light</li>
            <li> This is a smooth and creamy consistency and a quality product.</li>
            <li> The color choices were great, but not enough coverage.</li>
            <li> Website help is also available if you desire to seek help on how to use this product correctly.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this concealer pallet a lot and will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> but i wish the convealer wasnt so creamy but other than that all the colors are great went well with my skintone :)</li>
            <li> The darkest one I can use alone right now, and the other shades will be perfect for winter and spring.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great for covering up blemishes and also great for highlighting under eyes especially after a long night!</li>
            <li> Ok but really haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li> Works better when you use your finger to apply, the brush applies too much.</li>
            <li> It is too sheer for good coverage in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Blending between colors and problem areas was pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned, so I really only use the first two colors in the palette, and those work very well for me.</li>
            <li> Tecsture is not so good, it dries my skin and not lasts long.</li>
            <li> As long as you use it correctly, it really does work great.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for, like to use it to highlight my face!</li>
            <li> - I prefer to tap concealer on so that it blends more naturally anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the most gentle; flattering concealer at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have the kind of skin tone that matches these colors, but it didn&#x27;t when I applied it.</li>
            <li> I am having fun playing with the concealers in this kit.</li>
            <li> but there is never the right hue</li>
            <li> Used on 2 different skin types and both experienced the same issue.</li>
            <li> The coverage sucks, looks cheap, but pigmentations good.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the color on the far left, which looks great with my skin.</li>
            <li> I actually use them together most days to get just the right shade.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for this product very much.</li>
            <li> I found a long time ago, actually goes on smoothly; covers gently if you want, or more if you care to layer it more.  </li>
            <li> The little box it came in said &amp;#34;fair to light,&amp;#34; which scared me because I AM fair and cannot wear &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; foundations.</li>
            <li> I am fairly pleased with the performance of the product as a concealer, although is it really possible for any concealer to truly provide 100% coverage??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying with both a brush and hands - I&#x27;ve used Smashbox concealer and NYX concealers and they are a lot higher quality - so this one is a 3.5 star, just like the eye shadow palette, and I&#x27;m glad I got it, but I have to apply some heavy layers for it to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to my skin! :)</li>
            <li> Studio Complete Coverage Concealer Color Light</li>
            <li> At first, I was leary because I did think it would be so creamy and thought &amp;</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried higher end brands</li>
            <li> It is not as thick which is great also because you don&#x27;t want a cake look.</li>
            <li> I put a layer of elf sparkly under-eye powder on top, which helps it last longer.</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe my other concealer was a more complete cover</li>
            <li> Nice colors came as expected and colors as pictured!</li>
            <li> I love the different tones of more yellow and more pink variations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought, and for beginners in makeup, this is absolutely perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pots are exceptionally small but a good product.</li>
            <li> After a certain age, those under eye circles need to be concealed.</li>
            <li> Elf cosmetics are pretty decent.</li>
            <li> This concealer goes on ok, but after an hour or so, it looks like the area it&#x27;s been applied on becomes very dry and patchy looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very mindful of my budget.</li>
            <li> this stuff does really well.</li>
            <li> I am really liking the ELF products.</li>
            <li> I was very unpleased with my order.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and it blends in really well without rubbing off or attracting my liner or mascara to it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> fast delivery....</li>
            <li> I have other products that work better.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors looked really orange-y and dark, but match better on the skin.</li>
            <li> For my dark circles, which are purple, the third color does a good job.</li>
            <li> I was in the mall buying concealers that didn&#x27;t live up to expectations!</li>
            <li> a bout this particular product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This concealer applies a little better if you dab it with a finger instead of using the concealer brush</li>
            <li> The light color doesn&#x27;t show up as much as expected.</li>
            <li> (for example, my cheeks are pinker, forehead slightly more tan, and chin really pale).</li>
            <li> I love E.L.F., but I prefer the pale stick concealer they have for the coverage.</li>
            <li> Brush is a lil stiff but after a while it works better.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have real dark puffiness, forget about this product because even though the concealer works great, the dark holes can still be visible</li>
            <li> The other thing is you want something that lasts this product does not leave you needing a touch up huge plus in my book.</li>
            <li> (I am a mix of asian mexican, however my skin a bit light</li>
            <li> If I do want extra coverage, or brightening, the first two shades can achieve that.</li>
            <li> I purchased all three palettes, light, medium and dark, to use for contouring.  </li>
            <li> I think if I used very much of it for a long day, it would end up looking shiny on my already-oily skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was the product, or is got old sitting somewhere.</li>
            <li> But I had no trouble covering any and</li>
            <li> it came a day early.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to completely cover, this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving it to my 20 something year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I think is too soft but it helps with the foundation</li>
            <li> I love elf products - when they say &amp;#34;light,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;medium,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dark,&amp;#34; they mean it</li>
            <li> At first I was worried because none of the colors looked like they would match my skin tone, especially when I have slightly different skin tones on my face</li>
            <li> I have used all of the concealer in the 3rd from the left well and wish I could order just that color instead of buying the whole palette!</li>
            <li> Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new concealer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mature woman and one of the draw&#x3D;backs of most &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; concealers is how dry they go on and tug on the delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> Several other reviewers said it was too light or didn&#x27;t cover well, but, as I was out of other options, I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> but beware it only takes a little to get the job done right</li>
            <li> But it covers as well as any other I have found, and I do really like the option of several colors in one package.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use the fourth color because it is a little too dark for my skin tone, but it would be a good color for subtle contouring.</li>
            <li> I like this but not enough to last very long obviously.</li>
            <li> However it is very long lasting</li>
            <li> Since I have a hard skin tone to match, this works very well with me.</li>
            <li> Will buy again, I just wished I found this in the stores a long time ago, then again maybe I over looked</li>
            <li> I sometimes use 2 of the other colors for specific blemishes on darker / redder skin.</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I do like this product but its a little cakey and it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty useless for actually applying the correct coverage</li>
            <li> I previously (Christmas 2013, I think) ordered an elf concealer in corrective colors - the green, blue, yellow, pink one.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few weeks ago and have used it several times.</li>
            <li> Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve been transitioning to non toxic make-up and beauty products.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be a bit powdery, but it is pasty and creamy.</li>
            <li> lighter than expected, but works and won&#x27;t break me out,</li>
            <li> Does not feel heavy, doesn&#x27;t cake up, doesn&#x27;t dry your face.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is amout of product.  </li>
            <li> Also not worth the money on Amazon</li>
            <li> Comes in four shades so unless you have REALLY dark skin, you should find a shade that works for you or you can mix them.  </li>
            <li> The colors are not as dark as they look in the photo.  </li>
            <li> I have dark cricles and bags and use ii with the Corrective palate and it covers them to where you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> I have heavy dark circles.  </li>
            <li> So any little thing shows up.</li>
            <li> A little wierd..</li>
            <li> Look at my other revues, I don&#x27;t do negative revues a whole lot, but this one was BAD..</li>
            <li> These concealers are a little bit too thick, and the shades don&#x27;t match me at all.</li>
            <li> Three stars because the texture was poor; not what I expected from e.l.f.&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does the job, not perfect but enough for the price.i would recommend it still</li>
            <li> :/  </li>
            <li> It covers in enough, but doesn&#x27;t look too caked up of too fake.</li>
            <li> the product is so small and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s picture.</li>
            <li> I usually like elf products</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the actual concealer</li>
            <li> I usually can find my color</li>
            <li> (it also comes with a small brush, by the way).</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Coverage not very good.</li>
            <li> and they work for my skin which is very pale.</li>
            <li> I hardly have to use any&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> At least without looking caked on at 1/4&amp;#34; thickness on your face?</li>
            <li> The EWG rating of 1 for this product accidentally left out a review of a dangerous ingredient in it, namely PROPYLPARABEN.</li>
            <li> But the worst part is that the color was super off no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> and it was no good.</li>
            <li> so not good for all day wear</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a little disappointed at the quality of e.l.f studio concealer.</li>
            <li> The chalky texture made blending difficult.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to blend in, even with the brush provided and a concealer brush.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Sits in wrinkles bad but as a highlighter</li>
            <li> HATED this product.</li>
            <li> but I hated this.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product because I found my found out that the concealers I had been using contained all sorts of nasty chemicals that shouldn&#x27;t be on ones&#x27; face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great!!!!! I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like this but not enough to last very long obviously. But its nice to have while you have it.</li>
            <li> I threw it out after the 1st use.. You get what you pay for. I put it under my eyes and it began to crumble and it was no good. I don&#x27;t know if it was the product, or is got old sitting somewhere. I don&#x27;t throw anything away. I&#x27;m very mindful of my budget. HATED this product. It just crumbled, and as I tried to wipe it off it crumbled even more. Had to use a washcloth. Ew.  Look at my other revues, I don&#x27;t do negative revues a whole lot, but this one was BAD..</li>
            <li> I love elf products - when they say &amp;#34;light,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;medium,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dark,&amp;#34; they mean it so there&#x27;s no guessing games. This concealer applies a little better if you dab it with a finger instead of using the concealer brush - I prefer to tap concealer on so that it blends more naturally anyway. Great palette and the shades blend well together for better coverage of whatever you&#x27;re concealing!</li>
            <li> Sits in wrinkles bad but as a highlighter it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Tecsture is not so good, it dries my skin and not lasts long.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but darker than what I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I totally liked this palette. Easy to blend. I picked a shade too light. Otherwise would have given it a 5!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for, like to use it to highlight my face!</li>
            <li> nice coverage smooth looking</li>
            <li> Love it! Great concealer for a great price!</li>
            <li> I feel like it is kinda cheep, but it was.. so you get what you pay for... it works and i use it so i guess its ok</li>
            <li> Great colors and easy to apply! For the price it is a steal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mature woman and one of the draw&#x3D;backs of most &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; concealers is how dry they go on and tug on the delicate skin.  Another issue is the way most &amp;#34;emphasize&amp;#34; the lines instead of doing it&#x27;s job as intended.&lt;br /&gt;This I found a long time ago, actually goes on smoothly; covers gently if you want, or more if you care to layer it more.  It&#x27;s one of the most gentle; flattering concealer at a reasonable price.  I purchased this as a back-up so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Does not have very good coverage</li>
            <li> i am happy with the color options in the palette.. its a very compact palette,, the concealer does its job really well,, best buy for the price.. really happy.. :)</li>
            <li> Three stars because the texture was poor; not what I expected from e.l.f.&lt;br /&gt;so thats what my girl  said a bout this particular product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does the job, not perfect but enough for the price.i would recommend it still, it&#x27;s not as good as Mac studio finish so don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product because I found my found out that the concealers I had been using contained all sorts of nasty chemicals that shouldn&#x27;t be on ones&#x27; face. :/  This worked just as well, includes more colors, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and has much better ingredients.</li>
            <li> I do like this product but its a little cakey and it doesn&#x27;t last too long. The different colors are nice for a good match though!</li>
            <li> A bit drying. Used on 2 different skin types and both experienced the same issue. The chalky texture made blending difficult.  However it is very long lasting and this is a great pallet for VERY light skin</li>
            <li> Very happy I purchased it!  It goes on smoothly and brings out a refreshed/awakened look.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage.  Would repurchase.  Only complaint is amout of product.  Pots are exceptionally small but a good product.</li>
            <li> I like it but one thing I didn&#x27;t like was it was too creamy for me.</li>
            <li> The colors are perfect, easy to mix &amp; match your skin tones. Does not feel heavy, doesn&#x27;t cake up, doesn&#x27;t dry your face. I will say this puts several brands, more expensive I may add and I like it better. Will buy again, I just wished I found this in the stores a long time ago, then again maybe I over looked bc I was in the mall buying concealers that didn&#x27;t live up to expectations!</li>
            <li> Very good product. As long as you use it correctly, it really does work great.</li>
            <li> I previously (Christmas 2013, I think) ordered an elf concealer in corrective colors - the green, blue, yellow, pink one. I really liked the packing, the brush, and most importantly the consistency and quality of the concealer. That&#x27;s why I chose to get another elf concealer palette, this time in the shade Fair. The little box it came in said &amp;#34;fair to light,&amp;#34; which scared me because I AM fair and cannot wear &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; foundations. Some of the colors looked really orange-y and dark, but match better on the skin. The colors in order are a light peachy color, warm yellow, a darker warm peach, and a more beige/tan color. For my dark circles, which are purple, the third color does a good job. It covers in enough, but doesn&#x27;t look too caked up of too fake. If I do want extra coverage, or brightening, the first two shades can achieve that. I have yet to use the fourth color because it is a little too dark for my skin tone, but it would be a good color for subtle contouring. I&#x27;m happy with this product, and I hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> Love the product  many colors</li>
            <li> I love my concealer and the fact that I can mix it to match my skin tone. For me, it&#x27;s just perfect! I have fair skin and the light worked just right for me.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. At first I was worried because none of the colors looked like they would match my skin tone, especially when I have slightly different skin tones on my face (for example, my cheeks are pinker, forehead slightly more tan, and chin really pale). But I had no trouble covering any and all blemishes I had. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> They all melted together</li>
            <li> Ok but really haven&#x27;t used it</li>
            <li> Was awesome! Covered up all the acne!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for this product very much. Smears, runs, goes into lines.</li>
            <li> The price is great, but it really doesn&#x27;t do anything.  I originally decided to try it because it had a great color palette, but it is pretty much like putting nothing on your skin.</li>
            <li> If I could I would get this a zero the product is so small and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s picture. Also not worth the money on Amazon it&#x27;s $5.95 but in telco it&#x27;s $3.00 but the reason I didn&#x27;t get it from telco is because I thought Amazon would give more product in it</li>
            <li> very good coverage! it came a day early. I love this product I use it every day</li>
            <li> I really only use one of these colors. Works better when you use your finger to apply, the brush applies too much.</li>
            <li> I needed the lighter shades....these are great!</li>
            <li> I received this product a few weeks ago and have used it several times. I considered it because I had read good reviews, and then decided to purchase once I had looked it up on the EWG SkinDeep database and found that it was rated a 1 (0-10 rating system with 10 being the most toxic). I am fairly pleased with the performance of the product as a concealer, although is it really possible for any concealer to truly provide 100% coverage?? At least without looking caked on at 1/4&amp;#34; thickness on your face? If so, I haven&#x27;t found it. But it covers as well as any other I have found, and I do really like the option of several colors in one package. Blending between colors and problem areas was pretty easy. I think if I used very much of it for a long day, it would end up looking shiny on my already-oily skin. So it&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it meets my basic expectations.</li>
            <li> A+ Service and Product!</li>
            <li> I usually like elf products but I hated this. It&#x27;s difficult to blend in, even with the brush provided and a concealer brush. But the worst part is that the color was super off no matter what I did. I definitely have the kind of skin tone that matches these colors, but it didn&#x27;t when I applied it.</li>
            <li> Over the last few months, I&#x27;ve been transitioning to non toxic make-up and beauty products. The hardest items to replace have been a mascara that actually works, and a concealer. I have fair, sensitive skin. So any little thing shows up. I did a lot of product research and found e.l.f. Studio Concealer. It scores a 1 on EWG.org. Several other reviewers said it was too light or didn&#x27;t cover well, but, as I was out of other options, I decided to try it. Okay, maybe my other concealer was a more complete cover up.&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff does really well. And I&#x27;m fair skinned, so it&#x27;s not too light for me. I love that I have colors to mix! The darkest one I can use alone right now, and the other shades will be perfect for winter and spring. Overall, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my new concealer. It stays all day, gets the job done, and, it&#x27;s non-toxic!</li>
            <li> The coverage sucks, looks cheap, but pigmentations good.</li>
            <li> love the coverage give me that flawless finish....but beware it only takes a little to get the job done right</li>
            <li> its amazing! works perfectly!</li>
            <li> The colors are great and together they could provide great concealing but it doesn&#x27;t quite \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to your skin as it should - I have tried a lot of concealers and I&#x27;m going to keep using this, but I&#x27;m a little disappointed at the quality of e.l.f studio concealer. I&#x27;ve tried applying with both a brush and hands - I&#x27;ve used Smashbox concealer and NYX concealers and they are a lot higher quality - so this one is a 3.5 star, just like the eye shadow palette, and I&#x27;m glad I got it, but I have to apply some heavy layers for it to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to my skin! :)</li>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> The light color doesn&#x27;t show up as much as expected. Good for highlighting eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good coverage. Elf cosmetics are pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I am really liking the ELF products. This one is a pretty good buy. Comes in four shades so unless you have REALLY dark skin, you should find a shade that works for you or you can mix them.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointing. Coverage not very good. Too oily.</li>
            <li> The colors are not as dark as they look in the photo.  The concealers are decent quality, but provide medium coverage at best.  I have used all of the concealer in the 3rd from the left well and wish I could order just that color instead of buying the whole palette!</li>
            <li> This product is great however, I think it needs better &amp;#34;sticking to the skin&amp;#34; properties.  I still like it a lot and would buy again.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. Studio Complete Coverage Concealer Color Light #83311 elf Eyes lips is a good price and the seller shipped very quickly. The product itself is very light and not greasy. Conceals very lightly. Good for concealing bruises. Okay for the money and excellent shipping.</li>
            <li> Using to cover spots missed by a BB cream. Since I have a hard skin tone to match, this works very well with me. The brush is pretty useless for actually applying the correct coverage so I blend with my fingertips or a sponge.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to completely cover, this isn&#x27;t it.  I have other products that work better.</li>
            <li> I was very unpleased with my order. It says light but I received the medium shades instead. Nothing wrong with the actual concealer but I meeded the lighter shades.</li>
            <li> Nice colors came as expected and colors as pictured!</li>
            <li> Great item and quality! I love the different tones of more yellow and more pink variations. I usually can find my color but there is never the right hue, this allows me to mix and match!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, even though is very creamy and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have real dark puffiness, forget about this product because even though the concealer works great, the dark holes can still be visible, that&#x27;s why this product isn&#x27;t a 5 star from me.</li>
            <li> Good Variety of coverage samples.</li>
            <li> Great colors. Goes on good</li>
            <li> Its a good product but i wish the convealer wasnt so creamy but other than that all the colors are great went well with my skintone :)</li>
            <li> This concealer goes on ok, but after an hour or so, it looks like the area it&#x27;s been applied on becomes very dry and patchy looking.  It does not cover up redness that well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing concealer. Great for covering up blemishes and also great for highlighting under eyes especially after a long night! Love it.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and the brush that comes with it is awesome. They accidently sent me 2, which was nice. The product is good goes on nicely, blends nicely. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it melts very easy and stayed that way.</li>
            <li> I like the  product because you are able to blend the colors to what you need. The coverage is good.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It blends flawlessly into my skintone!! I got two for the price of one. A little wierd.. But it&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd elf product I&#x27;ve purchased and reviewed.  I&#x27;ve used this palette twice.  So far so good.  It has 4 different colors depending on the needs of your blemish you want to cover up.  The price was great.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> I am having fun playing with the concealers in this kit. After a certain age, those under eye circles need to be concealed. This is a smooth and creamy consistency and a quality product.</li>
            <li> At first, I was leary because I did think it would be so creamy and thought &amp;#34;great, my liner is going to show up below my lashes&amp;#34;.  What&#x27;s interestitng is, you put it on, just wait a minute and it blends in really well without rubbing off or attracting my liner or mascara to it.  I have dark cricles and bags and use ii with the Corrective palate and it covers them to where you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> It did not cover as well as I would like.  I have heavy dark circles.  I ended up giving it to my 20 something year old daughter.  The color choices were great, but not enough coverage.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be a bit powdery, but it is pasty and creamy. It is still a great concealer; if i do say so myself... It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought, and for beginners in makeup, this is absolutely perfect!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the package I thought it was too light for my skin, however it was my perfect skin tone when I blended it a bit more onto my skin (I am a mix of asian mexican, however my skin a bit light [I use the third and second colors]).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really recommend this. (it also comes with a small brush, by the way).</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin I wouldn&#x27;t say this is for you it does flake off quit a bit but if you are thinking about buying this I would say use a primer or moistureiser it will  help with the flaking of the product but this does provide a very good amount of covarge and covers my redness on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great coverage but wipes/smudges easily :/ so not good for all day wear</li>
            <li> This is pretty good stuff.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> lighter than expected, but works and won&#x27;t break me out,</li>
            <li> I like this, but don&#x27;t love it. It is too sheer for good coverage in my opinion. I love E.L.F., but I prefer the pale stick concealer they have for the coverage.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  I&#x27;ve never tried higher end brands so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the same.  I like the color options and they work for my skin which is very pale.</li>
            <li> Loved this it is great for all over coverage it also allows you to mix a color you want. It is not as thick which is great also because you don&#x27;t want a cake look. I am a makeup artist and buy a lot of different brands. You should always have different brands of makeup for your clients. E.l.F is a great brand. The other thing is you want something that lasts this product does not leave you needing a touch up huge plus in my book. It also spreads evenly and with ease. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Got it on time. I love how it works on my skin</li>
            <li> I purchased all three palettes, light, medium and dark, to use for contouring.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the quality of the creams, the pigmentation is excellent -- it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover a large area -- and they blend very well.</li>
            <li> great colors can&#x27;t find them else where not to mention don&#x27;t have to search threw for hours to find them at the stores just a click away perfect coverage and lasts a long time,.</li>
            <li> All expectations were met. Ver</li>
            <li> Love these concealers.  You can mix to match.  I purchased them for my daughters as well as myself.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I am very fair skinned, so I really only use the first two colors in the palette, and those work very well for me. I actually use them together most days to get just the right shade.  I love the fact that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have used this concealer often. I like the fact that it has 4 colors to mix and match. Goes on easy. I have oily skin so I have to put powder on it to keep it in place. I have an olive complection but the colors work well. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I hardly have to use any&lt;br /&gt;Does amazing coverage  on my skin</li>
            <li> fast delivery....product is ok</li>
            <li> Very nice, a really  concealer, buy it again!</li>
            <li> You can customize this makeup to any color you want it to be. Brush is a lil stiff but after a while it works better. I love that you choose the colors needed on a daily basis, this is perfect for your daily changing concealer needs LOL its great. Website help is also available if you desire to seek help on how to use this product correctly. Eyeslipsface.com</li>
            <li> The EWG rating of 1 for this product accidentally left out a review of a dangerous ingredient in it, namely PROPYLPARABEN. The EWG website rates that one ingredient as a toxicity of 7 out of 10, so very hazardous.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  You can use different shades on your face to  highlight your best features!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! E.l.f is good at the basics. I enjoy this concealer pallet a lot and will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Finally finally found a concealer that works.  Great color selection</li>
            <li> Did not perform as I thought it would</li>
            <li> I mainly use the color on the far left, which looks great with my skin. I sometimes use 2 of the other colors for specific blemishes on darker / redder skin. If I put any on or above my eyelids my skin starts flaking for some reason, so I only use it under my eyes and in the far/lateral corners. I put a layer of elf sparkly under-eye powder on top, which helps it last longer.</li>
            <li> These concealers are a little bit too thick, and the shades don&#x27;t match me at all. If you have a tan complexion, these might work better for you.</li>
            <li> The texture is a bit too creamy, but The colors blend phenomenonally and shipping was veey speedy. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> works well,nice for the price.</li>
            <li> is not the best concealer but is not bad. I think is too soft but it helps with the foundation</li>
