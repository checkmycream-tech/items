            <li>love this sponge for natural curls .Only  </li>
            <li>Definitely a smart purchase !</li>
            <li>It works better the longer your hair is, but I have only not used it 1 days since I got it.</li>
            <li>It was ok at first, but then it really wasn&#x27;t twisting my hair like it was supposed to be, and the foam started to break off into the hair easily and messy.</li>
            <li>Very  upset</li>
            <li>I brought this for my son and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>nudred for cheap point blank period add a lil berries and juices and and be how your way</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Better for short short hair</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas gift for my two teen boys, each of whom have longer hair on top and like to twist/curl it daily.  </li>
            <li>This is the main reason my son wanted it.</li>
            <li>If it wasnt for him wanting his hair a certain way for school pictures, which was the next day after he got it in the mail, I would have returned it!  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, started to come apart in a few days.</li>
            <li>Both boys have made it part of their daily haircare routines and really like the look it delivers.  </li>
            <li>You know, sometimes you just have to spoil yourself  &amp; spend the extra and invest in buying the real thing.</li>
            <li>When I purchased this I was a bit skeptical but when I started to use it I was amazed by how good of a job it did.</li>
            <li>The picture looks like a professional barber tool...but the actual product is nothing like the picture .</li>
            <li>Not great but not horrible.</li>

            <li> Not great but not horrible.</li>
            <li> total waste of money</li>
            <li> After looking into Nudred, based on the recommendation of their barber, I simply found the price to be too excessive for the product.  </li>
            <li> Was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Also the brush&#x27;s quality was average.</li>
            <li> The holes in this hair sponge are cut way too narrow to grasp the hair and imitate anything remotely resembling a &amp;#34;coil&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve had it for less than a month.</li>
            <li> Did the job, but the black sponge starts to break off in the hair.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s  small  </li>
            <li> My son LOVES his twist sponge and uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> The sponge still gets the job done for small afros.</li>
            <li> Very messy.</li>
            <li> The sponge sucks.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is poor, though ot does work, the sponge breaks off into small pieces as its run through the hair.</li>
            <li> Its sucks really bad</li>
            <li> what this means, is now having spend the additional money to get the results this knock off failed to deliver.  </li>
            <li> Fake!</li>
            <li> He and I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> the board base fell off because of the moisture of the oil</li>

            <li> Exactly what I thought it&#x27;ll be works good</li>
            <li> The product works great and really gives me the look I was hoping for. Problem is that its falling apart and i&#x27;ve had it for less than a month. Imagine a dish sponge thats literally falling apart, and thats what&#x27;s happening here. Good thing, the item is not expensive.</li>
            <li> love this sponge for natural curls .Only  problem the board base fell off because of the moisture of the oil I was apply. undecided about repurchasing</li>
            <li> Its start to fall apart in a couplr of weeks</li>
            <li> It was in perfect condition works perfectly and it looks cool</li>
            <li> Better for short short hair</li>
            <li> Great for getting curls and twists</li>
            <li> it works how i was told it would</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, started to come apart in a few days. Was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Omg this Magic twists sponge is the bomb 5 stars ...</li>
            <li> Works well. Works better is your hair is damp and with gel</li>

            <li> Great product &amp; fantastic delivery!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works just not filling that it should be a 4 to 5 star. The product works. That&#x27;s all it matters.  Peace</li>
            <li> Did the job, but the black sponge starts to break off in the hair. Very messy.</li>
            <li> nudred for cheap point blank period add a lil berries and juices and and be how your way</li>
            <li> Very good product for good price shipping very fast A+++++</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my two teen boys, each of whom have longer hair on top and like to twist/curl it daily.  After looking into Nudred, based on the recommendation of their barber, I simply found the price to be too excessive for the product.  This brush works identically to Nudred and was a fraction of the price.  Both boys have made it part of their daily haircare routines and really like the look it delivers.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It was ok at first, but then it really wasn&#x27;t twisting my hair like it was supposed to be, and the foam started to break off into the hair easily and messy.</li>
            <li> My son used this sponge about 4 times and yes it did what it was suppose to do.  But now the sponge is falling apart and will not curl his hair anymore. I know your probably saying &amp;#34;maybe his hair is growing&amp;#34; but no he actually cut it lower. The sponge sucks.</li>
            <li> The holes in this hair sponge are cut way too narrow to grasp the hair and imitate anything remotely resembling a &amp;#34;coil&amp;#34;.  You know, sometimes you just have to spoil yourself  &amp; spend the extra and invest in buying the real thing. For me what this means, is now having spend the additional money to get the results this knock off failed to deliver.  Oh well, lose some - learn some. You got me this time Haiku.  Fake!</li>
            <li> This sponge works just fine.  A good buy!</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is poor, though ot does work, the sponge breaks off into small pieces as its run through the hair.</li>
            <li> My son loves this sponge!!</li>
            <li> The image makes it look like the word Twists is on the brush itself. But it does not. Most of this type of sponge brushes does say Twist on it. This is the main reason my son wanted it. He and I was disappointed. If it wasnt for him wanting his hair a certain way for school pictures, which was the next day after he got it in the mail, I would have returned it!  Also the brush&#x27;s quality was average. Not great but not horrible.</li>
            <li> My son love the sponge.</li>
            <li> For now it&#x27;s a 3 when I get to use it we&#x27;ll see how it&#x27;ll be when it comes win</li>
            <li> Does a good job. Just crumbled after 3rd use.</li>
            <li> It works better the longer your hair is, but I have only not used it 1 days since I got it. Works perfectly</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do. Great product!!</li>
            <li> After a week of usage, pieces of the sponge begin to wear away.</li>
            <li> Its sucks really bad&lt;br /&gt;A total waste of money</li>
            <li> Great product. Works just fine</li>
            <li> Works just as well as a &amp;#34;nudered brush&amp;#34; . Only difference is the bargain price !</li>
            <li> Well worth the money works great</li>
            <li> It work just fine. Package came when it said it would.</li>
            <li> I received a totally different sponge than pictured I want the one I choose from the pic.. this looks like a knock off..</li>
            <li> I received the sponge earlier than anticipated.  Still trying to figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> Product does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I now get the look that I wanted. Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> My son loves his sponge works great and also a great price!  Fast delivery</li>
            <li> The picture looks like a professional barber tool...but the actual product is nothing like the picture . The sponge still gets the job done for small afros. Wider holes are necessary for a bigger afro.</li>
