            <li> Quality is as expected from Sonicare</li>
            <li> One of the second best things I have purchased for my dental health. Would not be without this product and my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it i thought the whole family would be able to use it for the price, it squirts all over, i am very disappointed and feel it is useless and a big waste of money!</li>
            <li> They clicked right in to the handle and worked great.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  The water pulses out, not like a water pick in a contentious flow.</li>
            <li> Just a replacement, but was delivered timely.</li>
            <li> Love the Airfloss so this is a natural purchase to continue using it.  Dentist is very pleased with the results, too.</li>
            <li> We have the machine that goes with these refills.  It&#x27;s a bit messy but the dentist advised it is very good for plaque build up.  It is nice to see instruments coming out for us lay folks.  I use it about once per week.  It does feel great afterwards.  You use ACT mouthwash with it.</li>
            <li> The Airflosser is the best thing I have gotten for my husband and I.  Our dental check-ups have been excellent.  Our hygienist is recommended it to all her patients.</li>
            <li> These are from Phillips and made for the Airfloss.  Color coded and both different from my original...nice if I decide to share my Airfloss.</li>
            <li> OK replacement heads.</li>
            <li> works good. what can you say</li>
            <li> It is new and just what I was looking for in great condition mail quickly thanks</li>
