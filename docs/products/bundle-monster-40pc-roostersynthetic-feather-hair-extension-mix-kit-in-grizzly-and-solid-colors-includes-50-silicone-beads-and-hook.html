            <li>It has everything you need but pliars but who doesn&#x27;t have a set of pliars around:)</li>
            <li>They were absolutely amazing, they went perfect with my pink hair!</li>
            <li>me and my girls loved them they were so easy to use and fun</li>
            <li>Very easy and quick to put in.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and changeout feathers.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I loved all the different variety of colors and styles!</li>
            <li>These are nice feathers some synthetic and some natural (that can withstand heat and curling iron).  </li>
            <li>Spend a bit more for the real deal.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>The kit had very nice feathers compared to other kits I bought on amazon which had pieces that were not even usable.</li>
            <li>This particular set is cheap, and LOOKS cheap as well.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a fun thing to do with my daughters.  </li>
            <li>I think I might have gotten 2 real feathers in the whole pack (maybe, im not even sure about that)  </li>
            <li>These are far better</li>
            <li>These were only OK.</li>
            <li>She wanted her hair done first and the wire tool broke the first time we used it.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was crazie that salons sell one feaher for $20 and charge more to put it back on if it falls off!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>They look exactly like the ones you get at the salon.</li>
            <li>The kit is very comprehensive, the only thing not included is a crimper/pliers (which most people have at home).  </li>
            <li>Her best friend has really long hair and the synthetic feathers are about a foot so they are almost long enough to go to the length of her hair.</li>
            <li>The colors are prettier and more vibrant than the last kit I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They fade really quickly, tear, and don&#x27;t work nearly as well as FeatherLocks.</li>
            <li>The feathers are certainly synthetic.  </li>
            <li>This kit does contain real feathers and not just colored extensions.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>they are very affective too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting feather extensions in their hair!</li>
            <li>The tools were decent.</li>
            <li>For all intents and purposes, I&#x27;ve paid for a decent hook to use for pulling hair and extensions, and some crimping beads.  </li>
            <li>The synthetic feathers are not fluffy like natural feathers but the overall effect in the hair is still colorful and exciting.  </li>
            <li>When I looked at the photo of this product,  it looked like the bundle up in the top left corner was a collection of synthetic grizzly feathers; long, slender feathers imprinted with a striped design.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase for a more fun and casual user of extensions.</li>
            <li>The hook worked great but the feathers were a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 8 year old daughters Spa birthday party</li>
            <li>The smaller feathers are real but if you attach them at the scalp, like you would the long feathers, then they stick out.</li>
            <li>They have been in over a week and hair has been washed and fixed several times.  </li>
            <li>Most of the set is synthetic, and I am still not convinced that the rest of the kit is pretty bad as well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> me and my girls loved them they were so easy to use and fun to have they lased a long time</li>
            <li> These were only OK. The tools were decent. But the beads were a bit big and the feathers kept breaking. I bought them for children and they got a kick out of them. But they are certainly not adult quality. But they arrived on time.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loved this set of hair/feather extensions. The kit had very nice feathers compared to other kits I bought on amazon which had pieces that were not even usable. Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I loved all the different variety of colors and styles! I sold some of them to my friends and made twice my money back already. I still have half of them to sell!</li>
            <li> This kit does contain real feathers and not just colored extensions. The colors are prettier and more vibrant than the last kit I bought on Amazon. I would recommend this kit to everyone.</li>
            <li> These feathers are great and are like the ones I got from the hair salon. You get all of these feathers for almost the price of what just one costs when you go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken my girls to the salons and boardwalks to get 1-2 feathers put in their hair and it cost me almost tripple what this entire kit cost.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes feathers for their hair.  Easy to use and changeout feathers.</li>
            <li> Bought it for kids&#x27;s birthday party. it was a huge hit! Easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are nice feathers some synthetic and some natural (that can withstand heat and curling iron).  It was great for my daughter&#x27;s party.  My 11 can put them in herself.  Much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> When I looked at the photo of this product,  it looked like the bundle up in the top left corner was a collection of synthetic grizzly feathers; long, slender feathers imprinted with a striped design.  What it turned out to be was a bundle of single-strand synthetic hair extensions (unknown material) that are dyed to *look somewhat like* a grizzly feather when they are grouped together. The unfortunate thing is that these are synthetic material and they do not stick together due to static.  I am pretty disappointed with this as it was the main reason for my purchase; I am not interested in shorter, wider feathers to add into my hair; I was wanting the slender grizzly feathers for some subtle hair accents.  For all intents and purposes, I&#x27;ve paid for a decent hook to use for pulling hair and extensions, and some crimping beads.  I&#x27;ll probably give the shorter feathers to my dad to use for tying fishing flies!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the &amp;#34;Synthetic Feathers&amp;#34; were not even like feathers. They were strands of plastic hair. They tangled like doll hair and will likely tangle in the girls hair. We used these at a  party today, so I&#x27;m not sure how long they will stay in.  The hook worked great but the feathers were a disappointment.  The smaller feathers are real but if you attach them at the scalp, like you would the long feathers, then they stick out. They don&#x27;t lay flat. I was expecting the Synthetic Feathers to resemble feathers. But they did not.  Don&#x27;t get this if you actually want feather extensions.</li>
            <li> After having feather locks for my daughter and myself, I thought I would bypass the salon and try to find some cheaper versions online. This particular set is cheap, and LOOKS cheap as well. Most of the set is synthetic, and I am still not convinced that the rest of the kit is pretty bad as well. They fade really quickly, tear, and don&#x27;t work nearly as well as FeatherLocks. Don&#x27;t waste your money of this set. Spend a bit more for the real deal.</li>
            <li> I got this for a ladies&#x27; night party I had with a bunch of my girlfriends. The only thing not included was pliers, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t expect them to be included. Definitely worth the purchase for a more fun and casual user of extensions.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 8 year old daughters Spa birthday party and it was a hit!!  The girls loved all the feathers and hair extensions.  They were easy to put in and take out and the colors were great!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a fun thing to do with my daughters.  They love these feathers and get lots of compliments for their friends.  The feathers are certainly synthetic.  I think I might have gotten 2 real feathers in the whole pack (maybe, im not even sure about that)  but it doesnt matter because they look great and are lots of fun.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my daughters 9 birthday party.  The girls absolutely loved it!!  Very easy and quick to put in.  My daughter got 2 hair extensions in her hair.  They have been in over a week and hair has been washed and fixed several times.  So glad I made the purchase.  Everything is included except pliers.  Bought mine at Walmart for $1.50.</li>
            <li> This was for preteen niece for Christmas. She wanted her hair done first and the wire tool broke the first time we used it.  Did have to buy her a set of needle nose pliers to got with it too since they are needed in order to crimp the bead. Synthetic fiber piece (used scissors to cut it down to make it less noticeable)&#x27;is still in my daughter&#x27;s hair which we did the same night.  This was approx 2 1/2 weeks ago!  Holding up well and looks great!  Disappointed the kit didn&#x27;t come with instructions.</li>
            <li> This is a great, affordable kit for girls and teens to experiment and have fun!  The kit is very comprehensive, the only thing not included is a crimper/pliers (which most people have at home).  The synthetic feathers are not fluffy like natural feathers but the overall effect in the hair is still colorful and exciting.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I bought this becuz I thought it was crazie that salons sell one feaher for $20 and charge more to put it back on if it falls off!! This comes with 40 feathers!! It is a great deal. Buy it.  This is a perfect gift for tweens and teens!</li>
            <li> This kit is wonderful. It has everything you need but pliars but who doesn&#x27;t have a set of pliars around:) great quality and variety!:)</li>
            <li> This was just delivered today and my daughter loves it. She is using it for her birthday party next week but she already tore into it. The only bad thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with pliers we had to go to Michaels and purchase some but the product is great. Her best friend has really long hair and the synthetic feathers are about a foot so they are almost long enough to go to the length of her hair. they are very affective too. Plus you don&#x27;t have to pay the insane prices at the mall(the prices are $15 for one and $10 for every additional feather.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Easy to use, great quality and bright colors. Wonderful product! I highly recommend this product to anyone wanting feather extensions in their hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter for Christmas. These are far better then i expected them to be. They look exactly like the ones you get at the salon. They wear, wash and look good. The colors are bright and pretty.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase and will be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> They were absolutely amazing, they went perfect with my pink hair! my only complaint was that i use alot of hairspray so it only lasted for like 2weeks :\</li>
