            <li>i have loved this product for a long time!</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t be able to afford a new bottle.</li>
            <li>This product has helped lessen the depth of the wrinkles on my forehead and also my laugh lines.  </li>

            <li>The last one I oredered seems more greasy</li>
            <li>then my first bottle...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the reviews are so positive for this product.  </li>
            <li>Helps fine lines from becoming deep lines and moisturizes deeply.</li>
            <li>I went on a 17 day trip abroad and forgot my Hydroderm and really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>hydroderm works fast</li>
            <li>This product is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Then I went on Amazon and found it at a very reduced price.  </li>
            <li>Really made a difference around my eyes..</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the last time I ordered the liquid wasn&#x27;t cloudy as before, rather more clear, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  </li>
            <li>No matter where I am, people, especially woman ask me what do I do to look so young and to have such beautiful facial skin.</li>
            <li>Hydroderm Original Age-Defying Serum is the one product that I keep going back to over and over.</li>
            <li>Because I am vain, it&#x27;s hard not to spend more money on something that works better in some aspects, especially because Hydroxatone will lead to breakouts for me because of my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I first ordered this product directly from the Hydroderm folks.</li>
            <li>I guess cuz it has more peptides, I will get the regular next time.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I ordered directly was clear and worked really well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to use with the Hydroderm Moisturizer cream.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that has helped with my laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>If it were to emit even the faintest trace of aroma, I&#x27;d donate it to the woman I saw next to the highway exit ramp yesterday who bore a cardboard sign that read, &amp;#34;Anything helps.&amp;#34; As it stands, I like it too much to share (plus, this stuff&#x27;s pretty pricy</li>
            <li>This is one product that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I cannot live with out it.  </li>
            <li>I am told I look 45 years old when in fact i am very colse to being 60 years old.  </li>
            <li>Hydroderm fast Acting Wrinkle Reducer contains real collagen.  </li>
            <li>I am 52 years old</li>
            <li>I used to get the product from the Hydroderm company directly</li>

            <li>The bottle I got through Amazon was cloudy and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s got a pleasantly smooth, viscous consistency, as long as you don&#x27;t contemplate certain bodily secretions while you apply it to your face, and leaves no gooey trace when it dries, unlike... other things.</li>
            <li>Also this product dried out my skin a little, which is amazing because I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>Moisturizers in general make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that the serum has 4 stars total in reviews.</li>
            <li>end up my face more worse pimples .</li>
            <li>This is the California blend and runny and very hard to manage, The original age-defying wrinkle serum is clear not cloudy and with a thick viscosity that makes the skin smooth and youthful looking.</li>
            <li>Iy works wonderfully on dry very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It removes dark spots very well.</li>

            <li> This is the California blend and runny and very hard to manage, The original age-defying wrinkle serum is clear not cloudy and with a thick viscosity that makes the skin smooth and youthful looking.</li>
            <li> Iy works wonderfully on dry very sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> It can only do so much, naturally, but it does help diminish small lines.  </li>
            <li> im 37 and people to this day think I&#x27;m 25-27yrs old (even got asked out by a few guys 25 and under)</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure anyone else can see a difference in my skin when I use this product, but at least they can&#x27;t smell one, as Hydroderm is free of perfume or other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fragrances.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was an old batch or was damaged in transit.</li>

            <li> It needs to take at least 6 months off for that last star.</li>
            <li> If you are the hard to convince type, try putting Hydroderm on only half of your face for 2 weeks and you will see the difference.  </li>
            <li> Or it needs to cost 75% less.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried many creams and serums for crow&#x27;s feet and facial lines around the mouth and nose. Hydroderm Original Age-Defying Serum is the one product that I keep going back to over and over. I have used this serum on my entire face twice a day for years. It works great and I can always see a difference in my skin if I stop using it. I am 52 years old but I am often told that I look 10 years younger. This is one product that I can&#x27;t live without. It is sometimes hard to find but I can usually find it on Amazon.com. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and was so grateful that I was able to get it on Amazon.  The product&#x27;s website is about $30.00 more with no discount.  This product has helped lessen the depth of the wrinkles on my forehead and also my laugh lines.  I notice a big difference if I do not use this product.  It is the only product that has helped with my laugh lines.  I recommend you try this product, especially at this low price I paid on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I depend on Hydroderm...it softens your fine lines and sort of fills them in for a softer look.  I went on a 17 day trip abroad and forgot my Hydroderm and really noticed the difference. I used to get the product from the Hydroderm company directly and the Hydroderm I received from Amazon seemed less thick (reason for 4 stars) but was cheaper. I would like to know if Amazon&#x27;s vendor gets this products directly from the Hydroderm company. I will continue using this product as it has the collagen that fills the lines. (Retin A &amp; Renova creams sluff the dead skin cells but are not fillers) I use in the AM after washing skin and then use my moisturizer. At night I use the Hydroderm after washing my face and then use Retin A or Renova over that. I tried the Hydroderm cream with the regular Hydroderm Wrinkle reducer and I think they work well together. The cream is a bit expensive so I have cut that out of my routine. If you need a \\&quot;filler\\&quot; to soften lines this worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> hydroderm works fast i&#x27;ve been using for more than a year and it is great, gives you fresh look, I love this product, I really recommend to everybody.  It really works!</li>
            <li> I give this company 5 Stars, but not the product.  The product was ineffective.  It is so hard to get companies  to cooperate that I had just planned to let it go and take the loss of $$$.  However, when I wrote my previous  review and Super Wholesale became aware of the fact I was unhappy with the product, within minutes they processed a refund to my account and told me I did not have to return the ineffective product thus eliminating  that expense and trouble. SO KUDOS TO SUPER WHOLESALE.  It&#x27;s quite refreshing to have done business with a company that has integrity.  It was a very pleasant surprise. Thank You and Keep Up the Good Work!</li>
            <li> I use this product 2x a day both morning and night time after I wash my face.  it works instantly making your lines and wrinkles disappear as it leaves your skin with a healthy glow. Then I follow through with my day or night time moisturizer  Hydroderm also takes away the tightness my skin feels after I wash my face.  This little bottle is a miracle youth restorer in a bottle.  I cannot live with out it.  Iy works wonderfully on dry very sensitive skin.  No matter where I am, people, especially woman ask me what do I do to look so young and to have such beautiful facial skin. I am told I look 45 years old when in fact i am very colse to being 60 years old.  Compared to high end famous named brand serums, Hydroderm fast Acting Wrinkle Reducer contains real collagen.  There is no fragrance, alcohol, or chemical.  This product is 100% natural.  Best of all, the price is extremely reasonable compared to the famous named products that you purchase in the department store that costs hundreds of dollars for 1 oz.  You can find Hydroderm Fast Acting Wrinkle Reducer, 1 oz. on the internet , like Amazon or Ebay, for as little as $21.95.   [[ASIN:B001USON9U Hydroderm-Fast Acting Wrinkle Reducer, 1 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the reviews are so positive for this product.  It has to be just water - or at least watered down to the effect that it runs right off my face before I can get my fingers to it.  There is absolutely no substance to it.  It&#x27;s a good thing it comes with an eye dropper to lift it out otherwise it would puddle in my hand.  But then again it&#x27;s better than the floor which is where it ends up.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brand or the seller but I would definitely not order it again and would not recommend.  I have been trying to use it anyway because it wasn&#x27;t cheap but I have to put moisturizer over it to get any sort of emollience.</li>
            <li> i have loved this product for a long time! i get compliments on my skin all the time and  i feel like this is one of my secret weapons!</li>
            <li> This is the first anti wrinkle product I ever tried so at first I was happy but not convinced. I had nothing to compare it to. So I stopped using this product and tried some of the ones that kept saying they had \\&quot;scientific evidence\\&quot; of how great they worked.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  With every other product I tried, I kept comparing it to Hydroderm and they always came up short. I kept coming back and now I am staying.  If you are the hard to convince type, try putting Hydroderm on only half of your face for 2 weeks and you will see the difference.  You&#x27;ll wish you had started it all over to begin with!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for over a month.  I haven&#x27;t seen a marked improvement in my skin.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen a decline either.  I wont buy it again.  I just wasn&#x27;t impressed with the product or results.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT. My fine lines and crows feet almost all gone within 2 weeks of using this product , even the lines on the forehead . Thank you Amazon for having this product I will be getting more in the future .</li>
            <li> Have used it and loved it for years.  Makes my skin stronger and smoother.  Highly recommend to use with the Hydroderm Moisturizer cream.  I have tried lots of products but always go back to this.  I pray that they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> Very smooth &amp; gentle work into my skin. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin type is oily, before I found Hydroderm, I tried many kind of wrinkle serums, never worked well end up my face more worse pimples . My friend told me about Hydroderm and work well into my skin I use it night time only.</li>
            <li> This product is good but I thought Hydroxatone did a better job for eliminating wrinkles. This product is noncomedogenic and Hydroxatone is not. Also this product dried out my skin a little, which is amazing because I have oily skin. Hydroxatone did a better job for eliminating the wrinkles under my eyes. This product is reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve been switching between this product and Hydroxatone. I&#x27;d rather use this product because of the price. Because I am vain, it&#x27;s hard not to spend more money on something that works better in some aspects, especially because Hydroxatone will lead to breakouts for me because of my oily skin. I recommend this product because it is effective and the price is good.</li>
            <li> This product is as it has been advertised.  It can only do so much, naturally, but it does help diminish small lines.  I think the amount of product is being sold at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.  I am a senior and am always trying to keep the face and neck area in the best condition.  I always get very nice comments about my skin.  Makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> Has visibility reduced my fine lines in just a week!</li>
            <li> Item does NOT remove wrinkles as suggested. It does however make your skin super smooth. I suggest you think of it as a perfect moisturizer. It may prevent faster wrinkling but does not correct ones that are already there. Like so many other products this one delivers no promises but is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Hydroderm for years and it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried for keeping the skin young and minimizing wrinkles.  HOWEVER, the last time I ordered the liquid wasn&#x27;t cloudy as before, rather more clear, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.  Yet the bottle and packaging looks the same.  Has anyone else noticed this . . . that the liquid is not cloudy as before ?</li>
            <li> I first ordered this product directly from the Hydroderm folks. Loved the product but it&#x27;s expensive. So I ordered my second bottle through Amazon. The first bottle I ordered directly was clear and worked really well. The bottle I got through Amazon was cloudy and didn&#x27;t work nearly as well. I&#x27;m not sure if it was an old batch or was damaged in transit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and love it - my wrinkles fade quickly but must be used daily. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used this for more than a month and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in any wrinkles.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am seventy five and no one can believe that its true.&lt;br /&gt;Lifelong friends ask me if I have had some kind of &amp;#34;facelift&amp;#34; surgery&lt;br /&gt;It is magical.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers in general make my skin break out. Acne medication makes my skin break out. Soap makes my skin break out. Even air does it. But somehow, by some miracle, Hydroderm doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a pleasantly smooth, viscous consistency, as long as you don&#x27;t contemplate certain bodily secretions while you apply it to your face, and leaves no gooey trace when it dries, unlike... other things. I&#x27;m not sure anyone else can see a difference in my skin when I use this product, but at least they can&#x27;t smell one, as Hydroderm is free of perfume or other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; fragrances. If it were to emit even the faintest trace of aroma, I&#x27;d donate it to the woman I saw next to the highway exit ramp yesterday who bore a cardboard sign that read, &amp;#34;Anything helps.&amp;#34; As it stands, I like it too much to share (plus, this stuff&#x27;s pretty pricy and I&#x27;m generally broke), so I gave up my Santander extra dark chocolate bar instead. I hope that&#x27;s what the sign meant. I mean, chocolate helps in almost any situation, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, Hydroderm Original Age-Defying Wrinkle Serum makes my skin feel pretty good and it&#x27;s easy to use. The label tells you not to put it on your eyelids. That&#x27;s sage advice because somehow when I accidentally disobeyed that instruction, my eye whites felt like they were fried over-hard for a while. The odd sensation abated after a spell, but that can&#x27;t be particularly good for one&#x27;s eyes. I wish I could give Hydroderm five stars, but my face only looks about 4 months younger than before I started using the stuff. It needs to take at least 6 months off for that last star. Or it needs to cost 75% less. I actually worry that it will be stolen from my gym bag and I won&#x27;t be able to afford a new bottle. I guess that means I like it.</li>
            <li> I loved it, it is a very good product. I love the feeling in my skin and how it looks with this product. thanks so much for your great service</li>
            <li> This product help diminishes the fine lines..  I use this product with their Renewal Moisturizer - with the combination of both products&lt;br /&gt;I find the results amazing...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good genes or the product, but people view me as appearing 10 years younger than I am.  The product quickly absorbs into your skin, and I am able to apply makeup almost immediately.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and the results are great!  I plan on continuing to use this product in the future and have spoken to and recommended this product to friends. They have been able to see the change this product has made to my face and neck area. Yeahhhhhh!!!</li>
            <li> I ran out some time ago and could not afford anymore.  Then I went on Amazon and found it at a very reduced price.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great Product..used all the time.</li>
            <li> This time when I ordered, the product is very thick, not a consistent texture like the previous ones I have ordered.  Not sure if I will order again given that fact.</li>
            <li> I like this serum. It removes dark spots very well. I bought it here several times already.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that the serum has 4 stars total in reviews. I feel it necessary to adjust with my 1 star. My bottle came with an eye dropper. The substance is just like water. Instructions state, \\&quot;apply to your skin with fingertips\\&quot;. I do try, with whatever is left on my fingertips, after the \\&quot;water from the bottle\\&quot; slips between my fingers. It is all terribly inconvenient and I am not sure if it does any help. I would not recommend it to anyone and will not buy it ever again.</li>
            <li> Great product and great customer service from Vitamin Gangster!</li>
            <li> The last one I oredered seems more greasy I guess cuz it has more peptides, I will get the regular next time.</li>
            <li> I  have  used  this  product  for  years,  but  I  don&#x27;t  think  it  is  as  good  it  originally  was.  However,  I  will  probably  continue  to  buy it  from  time  to  time.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not work. I have been using it for about 2 months and not a thing has changed. I figured it was a bunch of hype but decided to try it anyway. Never again.</li>
            <li> This product is not the original age-defying wrinkle serum.  This is the California blend and runny and very hard to manage, The original age-defying wrinkle serum is clear not cloudy and with a thick viscosity that makes the skin smooth and youthful looking. I&#x27;m sorry to be so negative but the box and the bottle say one thing and the product inside the bottle is something completely different.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but its just too expensive! I do have to say it does work miracles, so I guess you can&#x27;t put a price on that....I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I bought Hydroderm from there home page, not here on Amazon.. Really made a difference around my eyes.. I thought it was to pricy so I looked here and it was half price... The picture here is the same as the Hydroderm I purchased on there web site.. After ordering this, It was a completely different bottle. Its called Hydroderm Hollywood collection.. Different ingredients then my first bottle... I then tyied to return it.. They said that it is posted  with Hydroderm Hollywood collection.. Hmm am I blind here... Also to add the bottle is half gone so I paid for a half OZ... After they said it was not different Amazon allow them to close out my responce and also said my reply was a duplicate... Be warned this product is not what it claims to be.. I used for a few days and since I&#x27;m not using the same stuff my face looks nothing like it did with the other product...</li>
            <li> It is a decent product and if used properly am sure will do the trick.  Would recommend to family and friends if need be.</li>
            <li> Helps fine lines from becoming deep lines and moisturizes deeply. I&#x27;ve used for years and Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li> Not only does it work, it is a clear liquid that goes on so easy and then immediately is absorbed into your skin and leaves it smooth and clean.  No after residue or film.  Not greasy.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Does not work, but irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for YEARS and love it im 37 and people to this day think I&#x27;m 25-27yrs old (even got asked out by a few guys 25 and under) lol</li>
