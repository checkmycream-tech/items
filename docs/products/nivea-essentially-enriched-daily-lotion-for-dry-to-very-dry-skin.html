            <li>We love Nivea for body lotion, best bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant smelling lotion.  </li>
            <li>Nivea is good lotion, but a bit overpriced.  </li>
            <li>Good fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Arrived in good condition</li>
            <li>and I am fairly scent-tolerant.</li>
            <li>this is a good lotion.</li>
            <li>This is good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea has a good reputation for skin care</li>
            <li>It feels really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a good moisturizer, but as soon as I put this lotion on, I had to remove it.  </li>
            <li>really good results</li>
            <li>It is really good cream.</li>
            <li>This is good lotion.</li>
            <li>Oh my.. It smells so good</li>
            <li>I have seen some reviews say this doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>I love that it is creamy, but lightweight, and smells great.</li>
            <li>It is one of the top three lotion that I think smell very nice.</li>

            <li>Love it, nothing else to say!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing deal on this</li>
            <li>It mosturizes well and its a good value, but its more greasy than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I liked its texture compared to lubriderm or vasoline I recommend</li>
            <li>i bring my bottle to work and now some of my co-workers have purchased their own.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>So I am Loving it</li>
            <li>Nivea is the absolute best lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I liked how it felt,</li>
            <li>This lotion is good but even better at a steal price.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;---the lotion wears like a VERY heavy-weight cream in which you can &#x27;feel&#x27; what I could best describe at that &amp;#34;residue feeling&amp;#34;, yet it does not perform like a heavy-weight cream&lt;</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a wonderful lotion for the whole body after shower.</li>
            <li>like this for winter months nice that it doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin but goes into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice scent though</li>
            <li>To be honest I probably will not purchase again but I will use what I&#x27;ve already bought.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion, but not as skin absorbent as the Nivea Extended Moisture Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li>Nice consistency,</li>
            <li>Does not soak into skin very easy</li>
            <li>It has a really nice scent that lingers most of the day, which is another thing I look for in a lotion.</li>
            <li>Nivea leaves my skin smooth and hydrated &amp; it smells SO good.</li>
            <li>very rich moisturizer, smells nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Great lotion with nice fragrance, seems to really help my winter skin.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product! :)</li>
            <li>Very lightly fragranced.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion, I have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>I think I would prefer this more if I wasn&#x27;t using it on my hands.</li>
            <li>Feels more like a paste than lotion</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I stopped looking for a better product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Alcohol free!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the lotion and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I really love the scent, but it leaves a waxy finish on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years during the winter months and there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you look at the richness scale at the bottom front of the lotion to get whichever you prefer.</li>
            <li>I can see better results</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love Nivea?</li>
            <li>its smell, and considering a hospital had given it to me to use on a newborn, I felt confident it was a safe choice.  </li>
            <li>of us love it.  </li>
            <li>Still, not a fan of the smell, and I think many would agree.</li>
            <li>It hydrates the best and leaves the skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry but I don&#x27;t feel qualified in writing out an elaborate review regarding lotion and its moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I really love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and there are many products on the market that do not&lt;br</li>
            <li>the lotion worked as well as a heavy-weight cream, I would be OK with the somewhat greasier feeling.</li>
            <li>I love Nivea products &amp;</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Nivea brand items.</li>
            <li>Love Nivea...doesn&#x27;t need to have all the  bells and whistles to sell me.</li>
            <li>This is an all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I love Nivea lotion and how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have faith. : )</li>
            <li>I prefer Lubriderm a lot better.</li>
            <li>glad i purchased this one</li>
            <li>We love this.</li>
            <li>Love the hydration and smell.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion not just moisturizer for your skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to buy hair gel to style my hair anymore because this explosive product is better than anything else for keeping the fuzz out of it.  </li>
            <li>Bought with special discount, satisfied!</li>
            <li>because of how much better the Gold Bond or Cetaphil is (and how much more convenient and comfortable they are to use.)Daily Advance Lotion.</li>
            <li>because of how much better the Gold Bond or Cetaphil is (and how much more convenient and comfortable they are to use.)</li>
            <li>This lotion is wonderful for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent cream for very dry skin</li>
            <li>but as long as hubby happy I am happy with this ;)</li>
            <li>I love it and enjoy wearing it every day.</li>
            <li>Sinks into skin wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>If you like Nivea products, I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light but clean.</li>
            <li>It spreads easily on application and stays on the for the day.</li>
            <li>This one so far is superior but doesn&#x27;t top the Aveeno brand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;---the scent itself is rather strong</li>
            <li>I tried this Nivea because I wanted a lotion that would absorb more quickly than coconut oil for days when I need to dress immediately after my shower.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been ordering this lotion for a while, and it feels great on our skin (makes my skin super soft).  </li>
            <li>My wife love it, great cream for dry skyn</li>
            <li>If the consistency was more like a cream and less like a liquid I would love it more, but it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smooth, no oily feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and make ur skin smooth as well.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>great price, bought it for my mom, she pays double for it at CVS,she loves this cream, raves about it!</li>
            <li>But, as I say, they did not add anything to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rich formula of the Nivea body lotion moisturizes and nourishes my skin leaving it smooth and feeling supple.</li>
            <li>My family love it very much and we will buy this product again.</li>
            <li>but I am not extremely disappointed that I bought it either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type of person that likes the thicker rich creams.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s only used it as a hand lotion though, and not it&#x27;s intended use as body lotion. :P</li>
            <li>So rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, it leaves your skin  really soft and smooth. :)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago.</li>
            <li>I had to clean the floor, wall AND my clothes.  </li>
            <li>great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It creates a beautiful sheen on the skin and is extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry and this lotion works great to moisturize and soften.</li>
            <li>so I mixed it with up&amp;up Aveeno knock-off - which is actually pretty great.  </li>
            <li>the best really thick skin feels hydrated</li>
            <li>It does leave a layer of grease on your hands when using a full pump</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the price, and the size of the bottle, I feel like this really is one of the better values in hand lotions - and it works like a champ.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Good basic lotion which does the job.</li>
            <li>it is good value for a big bottle of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My home is full of Nivea products.</li>
            <li>This lotion is full of lotiony goodness.</li>
            <li>(I really should drink more water....)</li>
            <li>Soaks in quickly and provides quick relief for dryness.</li>
            <li>but it soaks in really quickly .</li>
            <li>was more than enough to cover all of my bits and pieces and still have more to spare.  </li>
            <li>There are several types of Nivea, which I have tried, I like the Essentially Enriched best.</li>
            <li>But at the end of the day, I always come back to this product because it&#x27;s simply the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but If you have super try skin like me</li>
            <li>It smells so good and does such a good job of helping my super dry skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks..!!</li>
            <li>but it is pretty oily/shiny!</li>
            <li>Great, but my mistake to buy it with the oil thing and made it super heavy.</li>
            <li>After my skin became dry and itchy I decided to go back to using it and am very happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Added bonus - the dispenser actually puts out the perfect amount with a single pump!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it because I was looking for something alcohol free, but I&#x27;m not using it too often because I really don&#x27;t like having to feel so oily.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering scent.</li>
            <li>A tad bit greasy, but lets much longer than the Nicea Smooth Sensation or Extended Moisture lotions</li>
            <li>Every time I have to clean it up the formula is like a magic explosional stress relief happening with less effort to feel better.  </li>
            <li>This lotion made me feel oily and once absorbed</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves your skin so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the scent at all, it is actually kind of gross</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>I believe it to be a perfect combination of thickness and lightness, as it is able to deeply penetrate the skin and leave it feeling soft and smooth, without the long wait for it to dry sitting on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for people who have dry or normal skin.</li>
            <li>The lotion indeed does a pretty good job of moisturizing skin and it is certainly priced economically, but I think it has some downsides that make it a product I personally do not recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smoothly, has a really great scent (that&#x27;s not overwhelming), and it really does seem to soak into your hands within minutes.  </li>
            <li>The price is right - but the lotion isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>I cover the area right before i go to bed, and let the lotion soak in while i sleep.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to using coconut oil, and will splurge on a good quality (expensive) lotion that absorbs quickly and beautifully like Desert Organics Sweet Almond to use when I&#x27;m in a hurry and need fast absorption.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say this is on the high side of the Rich scale.  </li>
            <li>Like many other Nivea products, this one is also wonderful product, and has a long lasting effect on skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is pretty oily, which I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night and sleep peacefully in its heavenly smell...</li>
            <li>Out of the dozens of overwhelming options, this was the only one we found with no drying alcohol listed in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>At first I didnt like it</li>
            <li>i like it so much!</li>
            <li>First off, I tried to post this review on Nivea&#x27;s website, but they rejected it.  </li>
            <li>First off, the consistency, as another reviewer pointed out, is like spreading glue.</li>
            <li>I definitely won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li>But this is really independent of the quality of the product, since maybe my skin is better suited for something else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, and I always come back to Nivea.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nivea!</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this product to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>We brought home Nivea from Germany in 2007 also; the European versions are even better than the US version.</li>
            <li>The smell is appropriate for males and females so the entire family uses it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that your skin looks oily at first</li>
            <li>but when its dried feels good.</li>
            <li>But it does not work nearly as well as a heavy weight cream, and I honestly think there are numerous good light-weight lotions that provide just as much moisturizing without the heavy feeling, greasiness, or difficulty to work in (like CeraVe, and the CeraVe is practically unscented, super easy to work into skin, not greasy at all, is made without ingredients that can cause irritation, does not clog pores, and has a better dispenser</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>This lotion moisturize my skin really well, leaving it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This product is a true revolutionary miracle that everyone should try massaging into even their most sensitive skin since my dermotologist first tested a tube of it on my dry skin when visiting her because of a rash on my penis.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s: The Seller may want to reconsider how the product is shipped to prevent damage, be aware that this is &amp;#34;enriched&amp;#34; body lotion and will leave a very oily layer on your skin upon application.</li>
            <li>you like fast absorbing lotion, this might not be for you!</li>
            <li>Good, but very heavy enriched body lotion.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks, it transformed my dry skin into more nourished and hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>(ok, i&#x27;ll call myself cheesy on your behalf for that), but kother than that, its an amazing lotion.</li>
            <li>But in a few minutes it is all smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember this lotion being very oily.</li>
            <li>lotion is very runny.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using it much</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t justify throwing so much lotion out</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing but can be oily.</li>
            <li>It is soo creamy...and the fragrance is so mesmerizing and soft....</li>
            <li>We stood in the lotion aisle of a big box store trying to find a lotion that was alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>I like this product so much, I am still not done with my bottle but have placed another order</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Thanks to the distributor to have it listed and sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>With this stuff, I&#x27;m ready to go in just about 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into the smell so much.</li>
            <li>everywhere else is a LOT softer thanks to this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Fast to absorb.  </li>
            <li>Really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Its definitely more of the &#x27;wet&#x27; look as its like a lotion/oil</li>
            <li>but it really pays off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice that it does any better job than other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; moisture products</li>
            <li>Its not too watery, and rich enough to keep my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Working on a farm your skin tends to get a bit dry, I have tried many products and this one goes on nice and smooth without leaving a feeling of a ton of grease left behind on your skin.</li>
            <li>Rich, thick but easily spreads.  </li>
            <li>Has the typical Nivea scent which I love.</li>
            <li>so I am constantly on the move looking for a super moisturing product.</li>
            <li>This body lotion in particular is one of my favorites from Nivea.</li>
            <li>Nivea is a classic lotion.</li>
            <li>~ Softens skin ~ Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It is a little oily, but ok.</li>
            <li>A little to greasy for me and the scent is not that appealing.</li>
            <li>There is minimal fragrance which is important to me.</li>
            <li>but it really help to make your skin soft.</li>
            <li>Love using it everyday.</li>
            <li>There are many body lotions in the market, but few of them can match this one in terms of effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li>Nice, thick lotion.</li>
            <li>I just make sure I don&#x27;t need to touch anything in the new few minutes</li>
            <li>Secondly and more importantly, after a few days of use both of my arms were on fire with red itchy bumps.</li>
            <li>They are such High quality, and not outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li>I live in fear of the day they decide to discontinue this product.</li>
            <li>We live in Wisconsin and use about 6 bottles of Nivea lotion every winter.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin with psoriasis</li>
            <li>; My skin is super dry</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This lotion definitely does the job in helping keep my families skin full of moisture and not dry and ashy.</li>
            <li>It is not irritating or perfumed for sensitive skin, not too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li>Love this especially with the winter months and our current low temps.</li>
            <li>Sam Club where myfamily usually gets it for me, does not carry in any more.</li>
            <li>You know its good because it hardly ever goes on sale, and people buy it anyway!!</li>
            <li>Usually what I prefer to do with this lotion, is put a very large glob on the skin area that is the most dry ( in my case, it is my feet).</li>
            <li>It feels a little greasey sometimes, but by the time you rub it on your skin its fine.</li>
            <li>I opened the envelope, and a huge mess spilled out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;---it is greasier and more difficult to rub in than other lotions which work just as well (or better) while being easy to rub in and less greasy</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft but it also feels like it&#x27;s getting the moisture it needs.  </li>
            <li>he uses this mositurizer only , it works very well for him...</li>
            <li>but so far, not a fan.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been this soft until I found out this product.</li>
            <li>Really moisture get that last ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>The smell dissipates after a bit, but that might bother people who are sensitive to these types of smells.</li>
            <li>I even use this on my 22 month old son because he says it &amp;#34;smells nice!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and hadn&#x27;t used this lotion in years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and thick lotion</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate up in the mountains and this lotion isn&#x27;t capable of moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li>Low price and help tremendously with my dry skin</li>
            <li>It definitely does its function to heal dry skin quick.</li>
            <li>nivea may be pricer than some other drug store brands, but its well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the first creme I&#x27;ve ever used that actually makes my face look younger.</li>
            <li>A little hard to rub into darker skintones as it&#x27;s very white right out of the bottle but blends in nicely after some work and doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of whiteness.</li>
            <li>This lotion is quite oily and is better suited to extremely dry skin where you may require lotion as a protective shield---that is if you can stand a heavily fragranced lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not good for the face, but for the body I don&#x27;t think you can get much better.  </li>
            <li>Not only that I don&#x27;t really care about that, but I have never experience such thing in the 15+ years that I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li>Smooth thick lotion that really heal dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It was very greasy feeling and didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I would have expected.  </li>
            <li>I can put this on my hands and they feel silky soft, yet I can still open a doorknob with no problems immediately after.</li>
            <li>I use it on dry legs and arms and hands in the winter particularly.</li>
            <li>Mine came broken at the top</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many body lotion that it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li>Rich and thick, just how I like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, rich but not sticky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Reasonably priced, no off-putting smell, enriched with natural sea minerals and Almond Oil that provide relief to dry to very dry</li>
            <li>It does get a little oily and the skin does not seem to absorb very fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;---the lotion contains a few ingredients which can cause sensitive skin to become very irritated&lt;</li>
            <li>im a male with sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for extremely dry skin !!</li>
            <li>I also think it leaves that &#x27;heavy&#x27;, almost &#x27;residue-like&#x27; feeling similar to how many heavy weight creams</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, it seems at first as thought it isn&#x27;t going to absorb, just sit and feel heavy.</li>
            <li>This is a very  creamy lotion,not watered down like some are.</li>
            <li>Though I typically have to slather this lotion on twice a day due to my extra dry skin, Nivea seriously does a great job at keeping me from flaking all over the house.</li>
            <li>It helps with my really dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nivea products are so soft and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Some are very expensive, and really don&#x27;t do anything more than the cheaper drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>Live Nivea products this product is very moisturizing and thick so</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the thick protection in spite of the slight greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I like it so much,  I bought five bottles of lotion at once and gave them as little gifts to family members ~ Not greasy</li>
            <li>It feels a little too oily without having a fast absorption, making me want to wipe my hands on a cloth after I apply.  </li>

            <li> It is a pleasant smelling lotion.  </li>
            <li> Nivea is good lotion, but a bit overpriced.  </li>
            <li> Good fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> and I am fairly scent-tolerant.</li>

            <li> This is good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea has a good reputation for skin care</li>
            <li> It feels really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a good moisturizer, but as soon as I put this lotion on, I had to remove it.  </li>

            <li> It is really good cream.</li>
            <li> This is good lotion.</li>

            <li> I have seen some reviews say this doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>

            <li> Love it, nothing else to say!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing deal on this</li>
            <li> It mosturizes well and its a good value, but its more greasy than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I liked its texture compared to lubriderm or vasoline I recommend</li>
            <li> i bring my bottle to work and now some of my co-workers have purchased their own.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> So I am Loving it</li>
            <li> Nivea is the absolute best lotion I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I liked how it felt,</li>
            <li> This lotion is good but even better at a steal price.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;---the lotion wears like a VERY heavy-weight cream in which you can &#x27;feel&#x27; what I could best describe at that &amp;#34;residue feeling&amp;#34;, yet it does not perform like a heavy-weight cream&lt;</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a wonderful lotion for the whole body after shower.</li>
            <li> like this for winter months nice that it doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin but goes into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice scent though</li>
            <li> To be honest I probably will not purchase again but I will use what I&#x27;ve already bought.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, but not as skin absorbent as the Nivea Extended Moisture Body Lotion.  </li>
            <li> Nice consistency,</li>
            <li> Does not soak into skin very easy</li>
            <li> It has a really nice scent that lingers most of the day, which is another thing I look for in a lotion.</li>
            <li> Nivea leaves my skin smooth and hydrated &amp; it smells SO good.</li>
            <li> very rich moisturizer, smells nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great lotion with nice fragrance, seems to really help my winter skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! :)</li>
            <li> Very lightly fragranced.  </li>
            <li> Love this lotion, I have used it for years.  </li>
            <li> I think I would prefer this more if I wasn&#x27;t using it on my hands.</li>
            <li> Feels more like a paste than lotion</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I stopped looking for a better product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Alcohol free!  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the lotion and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent, but it leaves a waxy finish on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years during the winter months and there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you look at the richness scale at the bottom front of the lotion to get whichever you prefer.</li>
            <li> I can see better results</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Nivea?</li>
            <li> its smell, and considering a hospital had given it to me to use on a newborn, I felt confident it was a safe choice.  </li>
            <li> of us love it.  </li>
            <li> Still, not a fan of the smell, and I think many would agree.</li>
            <li> It hydrates the best and leaves the skin feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry but I don&#x27;t feel qualified in writing out an elaborate review regarding lotion and its moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I really love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and there are many products on the market that do not&lt;br</li>
            <li> the lotion worked as well as a heavy-weight cream, I would be OK with the somewhat greasier feeling.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea products &amp;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nivea brand items.</li>
            <li> Love Nivea...doesn&#x27;t need to have all the  bells and whistles to sell me.</li>
            <li> This is an all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I love Nivea lotion and how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have faith. : )</li>
            <li> I prefer Lubriderm a lot better.</li>
            <li> glad i purchased this one</li>
            <li> We love this.</li>
            <li> Love the hydration and smell.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion not just moisturizer for your skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to buy hair gel to style my hair anymore because this explosive product is better than anything else for keeping the fuzz out of it.  </li>
            <li> Bought with special discount, satisfied!</li>
            <li> because of how much better the Gold Bond or Cetaphil is (and how much more convenient and comfortable they are to use.)Daily Advance Lotion.</li>
            <li> because of how much better the Gold Bond or Cetaphil is (and how much more convenient and comfortable they are to use.)</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful for people with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for very dry skin</li>
            <li> but as long as hubby happy I am happy with this ;)</li>
            <li> I love it and enjoy wearing it every day.</li>
            <li> Sinks into skin wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> If you like Nivea products, I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is very light but clean.</li>
            <li> It spreads easily on application and stays on the for the day.</li>
            <li> This one so far is superior but doesn&#x27;t top the Aveeno brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;---the scent itself is rather strong</li>
            <li> I tried this Nivea because I wanted a lotion that would absorb more quickly than coconut oil for days when I need to dress immediately after my shower.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been ordering this lotion for a while, and it feels great on our skin (makes my skin super soft).  </li>
            <li> My wife love it, great cream for dry skyn</li>
            <li> If the consistency was more like a cream and less like a liquid I would love it more, but it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smooth, no oily feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and make ur skin smooth as well.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> great price, bought it for my mom, she pays double for it at CVS,she loves this cream, raves about it!</li>
            <li> But, as I say, they did not add anything to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rich formula of the Nivea body lotion moisturizes and nourishes my skin leaving it smooth and feeling supple.</li>
            <li> My family love it very much and we will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> but I am not extremely disappointed that I bought it either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person that likes the thicker rich creams.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s only used it as a hand lotion though, and not it&#x27;s intended use as body lotion. :P</li>
            <li> So rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it leaves your skin  really soft and smooth. :)</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago.</li>
            <li> I had to clean the floor, wall AND my clothes.  </li>
            <li> great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It creates a beautiful sheen on the skin and is extremely hydrating.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and this lotion works great to moisturize and soften.</li>
            <li> so I mixed it with up&amp;up Aveeno knock-off - which is actually pretty great.  </li>
            <li> the best really thick skin feels hydrated</li>
            <li> It does leave a layer of grease on your hands when using a full pump</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the price, and the size of the bottle, I feel like this really is one of the better values in hand lotions - and it works like a champ.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Good basic lotion which does the job.</li>
            <li> it is good value for a big bottle of moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My home is full of Nivea products.</li>
            <li> This lotion is full of lotiony goodness.</li>
            <li> (I really should drink more water....)</li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly and provides quick relief for dryness.</li>
            <li> but it soaks in really quickly .</li>
            <li> was more than enough to cover all of my bits and pieces and still have more to spare.  </li>
            <li> There are several types of Nivea, which I have tried, I like the Essentially Enriched best.</li>
            <li> But at the end of the day, I always come back to this product because it&#x27;s simply the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but If you have super try skin like me</li>
            <li> It smells so good and does such a good job of helping my super dry skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks..!!</li>
            <li> but it is pretty oily/shiny!</li>
            <li> Great, but my mistake to buy it with the oil thing and made it super heavy.</li>
            <li> After my skin became dry and itchy I decided to go back to using it and am very happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Added bonus - the dispenser actually puts out the perfect amount with a single pump!  </li>
            <li> I ordered it because I was looking for something alcohol free, but I&#x27;m not using it too often because I really don&#x27;t like having to feel so oily.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering scent.</li>
            <li> A tad bit greasy, but lets much longer than the Nicea Smooth Sensation or Extended Moisture lotions</li>
            <li> Every time I have to clean it up the formula is like a magic explosional stress relief happening with less effort to feel better.  </li>
            <li> This lotion made me feel oily and once absorbed</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves your skin so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent at all, it is actually kind of gross</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> I believe it to be a perfect combination of thickness and lightness, as it is able to deeply penetrate the skin and leave it feeling soft and smooth, without the long wait for it to dry sitting on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for people who have dry or normal skin.</li>
            <li> The lotion indeed does a pretty good job of moisturizing skin and it is certainly priced economically, but I think it has some downsides that make it a product I personally do not recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smoothly, has a really great scent (that&#x27;s not overwhelming), and it really does seem to soak into your hands within minutes.  </li>
            <li> The price is right - but the lotion isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> I cover the area right before i go to bed, and let the lotion soak in while i sleep.</li>
            <li> Price was right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to using coconut oil, and will splurge on a good quality (expensive) lotion that absorbs quickly and beautifully like Desert Organics Sweet Almond to use when I&#x27;m in a hurry and need fast absorption.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say this is on the high side of the Rich scale.  </li>
            <li> Like many other Nivea products, this one is also wonderful product, and has a long lasting effect on skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty oily, which I&#x27;m not a fan of.</li>
            <li> I apply it at night and sleep peacefully in its heavenly smell...</li>
            <li> Out of the dozens of overwhelming options, this was the only one we found with no drying alcohol listed in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> At first I didnt like it</li>
            <li> i like it so much!</li>
            <li> First off, I tried to post this review on Nivea&#x27;s website, but they rejected it.  </li>
            <li> First off, the consistency, as another reviewer pointed out, is like spreading glue.</li>
            <li> I definitely won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li> But this is really independent of the quality of the product, since maybe my skin is better suited for something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, and I always come back to Nivea.</li>
            <li> Thanks Nivea!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this product to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> We brought home Nivea from Germany in 2007 also; the European versions are even better than the US version.</li>
            <li> The smell is appropriate for males and females so the entire family uses it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that your skin looks oily at first</li>
            <li> but when its dried feels good.</li>
            <li> But it does not work nearly as well as a heavy weight cream, and I honestly think there are numerous good light-weight lotions that provide just as much moisturizing without the heavy feeling, greasiness, or difficulty to work in (like CeraVe, and the CeraVe is practically unscented, super easy to work into skin, not greasy at all, is made without ingredients that can cause irritation, does not clog pores, and has a better dispenser</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> This lotion moisturize my skin really well, leaving it smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This product is a true revolutionary miracle that everyone should try massaging into even their most sensitive skin since my dermotologist first tested a tube of it on my dry skin when visiting her because of a rash on my penis.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s: The Seller may want to reconsider how the product is shipped to prevent damage, be aware that this is &amp;#34;enriched&amp;#34; body lotion and will leave a very oily layer on your skin upon application.</li>
            <li> you like fast absorbing lotion, this might not be for you!</li>
            <li> Good, but very heavy enriched body lotion.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks, it transformed my dry skin into more nourished and hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> (ok, i&#x27;ll call myself cheesy on your behalf for that), but kother than that, its an amazing lotion.</li>
            <li> But in a few minutes it is all smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember this lotion being very oily.</li>
            <li> lotion is very runny.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using it much</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t justify throwing so much lotion out</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing but can be oily.</li>
            <li> It is soo creamy...and the fragrance is so mesmerizing and soft....</li>
            <li> We stood in the lotion aisle of a big box store trying to find a lotion that was alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> I like this product so much, I am still not done with my bottle but have placed another order</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> Thanks to the distributor to have it listed and sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> With this stuff, I&#x27;m ready to go in just about 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into the smell so much.</li>
            <li> everywhere else is a LOT softer thanks to this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Fast to absorb.  </li>
            <li> Really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Its definitely more of the &#x27;wet&#x27; look as its like a lotion/oil</li>
            <li> but it really pays off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that it does any better job than other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; moisture products</li>
            <li> Its not too watery, and rich enough to keep my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Working on a farm your skin tends to get a bit dry, I have tried many products and this one goes on nice and smooth without leaving a feeling of a ton of grease left behind on your skin.</li>
            <li> Rich, thick but easily spreads.  </li>
            <li> Has the typical Nivea scent which I love.</li>
            <li> so I am constantly on the move looking for a super moisturing product.</li>
            <li> This body lotion in particular is one of my favorites from Nivea.</li>
            <li> Nivea is a classic lotion.</li>
            <li> ~ Softens skin ~ Highly recommend</li>
            <li> It is a little oily, but ok.</li>
            <li> A little to greasy for me and the scent is not that appealing.</li>
            <li> There is minimal fragrance which is important to me.</li>
            <li> but it really help to make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love using it everyday.</li>
            <li> There are many body lotions in the market, but few of them can match this one in terms of effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li> Nice, thick lotion.</li>
            <li> I just make sure I don&#x27;t need to touch anything in the new few minutes</li>
            <li> Secondly and more importantly, after a few days of use both of my arms were on fire with red itchy bumps.</li>
            <li> They are such High quality, and not outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> I live in fear of the day they decide to discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> We live in Wisconsin and use about 6 bottles of Nivea lotion every winter.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin with psoriasis</li>
            <li> ; My skin is super dry</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This lotion definitely does the job in helping keep my families skin full of moisture and not dry and ashy.</li>
            <li> It is not irritating or perfumed for sensitive skin, not too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li> Love this especially with the winter months and our current low temps.</li>
            <li> Sam Club where myfamily usually gets it for me, does not carry in any more.</li>
            <li> You know its good because it hardly ever goes on sale, and people buy it anyway!!</li>
            <li> Usually what I prefer to do with this lotion, is put a very large glob on the skin area that is the most dry ( in my case, it is my feet).</li>
            <li> It feels a little greasey sometimes, but by the time you rub it on your skin its fine.</li>
            <li> I opened the envelope, and a huge mess spilled out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;---it is greasier and more difficult to rub in than other lotions which work just as well (or better) while being easy to rub in and less greasy</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft but it also feels like it&#x27;s getting the moisture it needs.  </li>
            <li> he uses this mositurizer only , it works very well for him...</li>
            <li> but so far, not a fan.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this soft until I found out this product.</li>
            <li> Really moisture get that last ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> The smell dissipates after a bit, but that might bother people who are sensitive to these types of smells.</li>
            <li> I even use this on my 22 month old son because he says it &amp;#34;smells nice!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and hadn&#x27;t used this lotion in years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and thick lotion</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate up in the mountains and this lotion isn&#x27;t capable of moisturizing my skin.  </li>
            <li> Low price and help tremendously with my dry skin</li>
            <li> It definitely does its function to heal dry skin quick.</li>
            <li> nivea may be pricer than some other drug store brands, but its well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the first creme I&#x27;ve ever used that actually makes my face look younger.</li>
            <li> A little hard to rub into darker skintones as it&#x27;s very white right out of the bottle but blends in nicely after some work and doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of whiteness.</li>
            <li> This lotion is quite oily and is better suited to extremely dry skin where you may require lotion as a protective shield---that is if you can stand a heavily fragranced lotion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good for the face, but for the body I don&#x27;t think you can get much better.  </li>
            <li> Not only that I don&#x27;t really care about that, but I have never experience such thing in the 15+ years that I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> Smooth thick lotion that really heal dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It was very greasy feeling and didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> I can put this on my hands and they feel silky soft, yet I can still open a doorknob with no problems immediately after.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry legs and arms and hands in the winter particularly.</li>
            <li> Mine came broken at the top</li>
            <li> and I have tried so many body lotion that it&#x27;s ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Rich and thick, just how I like it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, rich but not sticky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Reasonably priced, no off-putting smell, enriched with natural sea minerals and Almond Oil that provide relief to dry to very dry</li>
            <li> It does get a little oily and the skin does not seem to absorb very fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;---the lotion contains a few ingredients which can cause sensitive skin to become very irritated&lt;</li>
            <li> im a male with sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for extremely dry skin !!</li>
            <li> I also think it leaves that &#x27;heavy&#x27;, almost &#x27;residue-like&#x27; feeling similar to how many heavy weight creams</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, it seems at first as thought it isn&#x27;t going to absorb, just sit and feel heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a very  creamy lotion,not watered down like some are.</li>
            <li> Though I typically have to slather this lotion on twice a day due to my extra dry skin, Nivea seriously does a great job at keeping me from flaking all over the house.</li>
            <li> It helps with my really dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nivea products are so soft and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Some are very expensive, and really don&#x27;t do anything more than the cheaper drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> Live Nivea products this product is very moisturizing and thick so</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the thick protection in spite of the slight greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I like it so much,  I bought five bottles of lotion at once and gave them as little gifts to family members ~ Not greasy</li>
            <li> It feels a little too oily without having a fast absorption, making me want to wipe my hands on a cloth after I apply.  </li>
            <li> somehow the wizards at Nivea figured out a way to make it last as long as possible on your hands.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time even though he usues it multiple times during the day.</li>
            <li> but I got use to it especially since my skin seems to stay moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I will use for as long as it is around.</li>
            <li> have one in the car, at work and multiple bottles around the house since I have severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, Amazon ships it in one of those yellow envelopes with a single layer of bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I love this one because it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of parabens and some of the other dirty things that are in other main stream lotions.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s minor, but we&#x27;ve had some pump dispensers that seem to dish out half a cup with each press - and others that barely give you enough to lotion up a knuckle...</li>
            <li> I have very dry elbows and knees, especially in the colder months.</li>
            <li> I try very hard to keep my skin soft and elastic, but living in New England in the winter can be a trial.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works to keep my skin from dying out, but the smell is kinda funky (I don&#x27;t know how to describe it - kind of like bad smelling baby powder)</li>
            <li> Feels soft on skin and lasts a few hours during the day.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin feel and look moisturized all day long, without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Its quit thick and grease putting it on but does work very well once applied</li>
            <li> Heavy duty for dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It will not clog pores like other lotion products that I have tried before, and it does not leave you feeling sticky or gross.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hands feeling moisturized for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I still felt like my hands and feet were dry.  </li>
            <li> i have dry skin, and i like the fact that it makes my skin shiny like i&#x27;ve used baby oil but isn&#x27;t sticky and keeps my skin moist.</li>
            <li> and it restores my hands from being dry in no time.</li>
            <li> When my son was born almost 31 years ago, he was overdue, causing his skin to be dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> We both suffer from extremely dry hands during the winter months here in Chicago.  </li>
            <li> Since my skin is moderately dry, I felt it was too creamy.</li>
            <li> Have been using need for my dry skin since I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I am limited with the kinds of products I can use.</li>
            <li> whereas not that well for me as I have extra extra dry skin, but only my palm and somehow itw quiet weak for my palm..</li>
            <li> thick and a little bit oily, but absorb very fast.</li>
            <li> I use it all year long, but it manages to keep my skin nourished during the very dry winter months as well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;He has very dry hands</li>
            <li> I have a very dry skin</li>
            <li> but since this is for Very Dry skin, it is understandable.  </li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin, this does the job.</li>
            <li> My skin is usually very dry and itchy all winter.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with very dry skin..</li>
            <li> and I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 40yr old black male &amp; this lotion leaves my skin moisturized threw out the day &amp; is not as thick or oily as compared to cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale and figured I could stop stealing my wife&#x27;s Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy for a little while...</li>
            <li> is a little thicker ten</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin, and has a sensitivity to other lotions or skin care products.</li>
            <li> Great to use, especially in cold weather</li>
            <li> If curious, Google \\&quot;Nivea lotion and allergic reaction.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used this lotion a few years back</li>
            <li> I have a black dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since researched on the internet that the preservative they use in this lotion has been banned in the UK due to causing skin</li>
            <li> Then in hot lost in the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I can stroke it on any of my skin 3 times longer than any other cream or lube out there.  </li>
            <li> This body lotion shows improvement in my dry skin within a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;---the pump design is not very well done (mine broke about half way through the bottle)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought Nivea&#x27;s Essentially Enriched Body Lotion at the beginning of winter to help protect from Dry skin and cold sores that frequently erupt consequent to the weather.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and takes quite a few hand-washings to feel like you need to re-apply.</li>
            <li> As expected, on time.!!</li>
            <li> Totally not worth the mess.</li>
            <li> However, my husband does not like it, he prefers something lighter and less oily feeling.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than something like Gold Bond Ultimate or Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that is only made worse with Minnesota&#x27;s harsh winters.</li>
            <li> Not a super heavy lotion, but</li>
            <li> Winter makes skin very dry and is even worse when you already have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky/greasy, but seems like it moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little oily/thin.</li>
            <li> Being that I&#x27;m at the computer all day, I don&#x27;t want to have to stop working for 10 minutes every time I want to put a little bit of lotion on my hands for fear of greasing up my keyboard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little creamy, but it works.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and my face gets especially dry and flaky in the winter; not attractive.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to lotion for everyday use for years.</li>
            <li> And worse, it does not properly moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I used to use it everyday, all the time.</li>
            <li> The cap was a bit broken but the lotion is the same I have always used.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and yet absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> and Nivea is one of the few products I have found that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> What works for me is plain coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Nivea helps get rid of any and all scars I have had thru surgery or gust plain</li>
            <li> Particularly food in cold weather.</li>
            <li> I like this, very thick and emollient for my hands, washing them all day long in my job.  </li>
            <li> Has the usual Nivea quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to spread around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Indeed the price of the Nivea is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> However, I think that if you compare performance between the Gold Bond or Cetaphil versus the Nivea that the Nivea will be hard to justify (lower price or not)</li>

            <li> and I have a really hard time keeping it moisturized during the winter.</li>
            <li> It is really thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> This goes on thick and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film.</li>
            <li> agree with other users that this Nivea is somewhat greasy and is difficult to rub in (note this advertised on the bottle as their richest lotion).</li>
            <li> The cold weather is coming, the furnace is on, my skin will become dry.</li>
            <li> It just smelled awful to me, very strong, and very unpleasant, almost like that bottle of lotion you find tucked away in a supply closet after a few years.  </li>
            <li> THICK AND NOURISHING!</li>
            <li> I had used Nivea products in the past and have had a few scent issues, but none were ever this bad.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy which takes some getting used to since I am accustomed to thinner lotions.</li>
            <li> Very thick, almost like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy, however it rubs into the skin and does not make skin overly covered in lotion, or shiny like others do.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped promptly and arrived on time, however, when the package was opened, part of the dispenser was BROKEN.</li>
            <li> /&gt;---the lotion can clog pores (and hence it can make acne worse) -</li>
            <li> Reeks of feminine-smelling artificial fragrance &amp; contains mineral oil which I&#x27;m now reading is terrible for your skin (companies use it because it&#x27;s cheap).  </li>
            <li> I like Cetaphil and Aveeno for my everyday use and made a wrong purchase!</li>
            <li> Wish it would come unscented as well, these fake hormones are not good for you.</li>
            <li> A very thick lotion that takes some work to rub in  but does the job!</li>
            <li> call me cheesy, but i started using this lotion because i read that beyonce uses it</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I threw this lotion out.</li>
            <li> On humid days, this starts to feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have horrible dry skin</li>
            <li> I have used their cold cream in winters (comes in a navy colored tub).</li>
            <li> and you thought the gulf coast was bad.  </li>
            <li> Terrible...  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooth, no oily feeling. great for winter/dry weather</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, I have used it for years.  I wish they made a perfume out of it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is pretty oily, which I&#x27;m not a fan of. I ordered it because I was looking for something alcohol free, but I&#x27;m not using it too often because I really don&#x27;t like having to feel so oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember this lotion being very oily. After putting it on my skin seemed drier. I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to lotion for everyday use for years. But this batch, (I got 2 bottles) is not up to par.,&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is very runny. Not the same consistency (thickness) as what you buy in the store.</li>
            <li> It mosturizes well and its a good value, but its more greasy than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy which takes some getting used to since I am accustomed to thinner lotions. I like the size and smell of the product and will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> A lot thicker than I thought and prefer but still works well. I won&#x27;t be using it much but I am not extremely disappointed that I bought it either.</li>
            <li> As expected, on time.!! Thanks..!!</li>
            <li> Smooth thick lotion that really heal dry skin.  Great for the winter. There is minimal fragrance which is important to me. It does tend to feel just the slightest of oily but probably bc there IS oil in the lotion - not a deal breaker</li>
            <li> This lotion made me feel oily and once absorbed I still felt like my hands and feet were dry.  I couldn&#x27;t justify throwing so much lotion out so I mixed it with up&amp;up Aveeno knock-off - which is actually pretty great.  My skin feels soft but it also feels like it&#x27;s getting the moisture it needs.  I live in a dry climate up in the mountains and this lotion isn&#x27;t capable of moisturizing my skin.  The price is right - but the lotion isn&#x27;t.  I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky/greasy, but seems like it moisturizes well. I think I would prefer this more if I wasn&#x27;t using it on my hands.</li>
            <li> Feels more like a paste than lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and thick lotion and it&#x27;s GREAT for the body.  It&#x27;s not good for the face, but for the body I don&#x27;t think you can get much better.  If the consistency was more like a cream and less like a liquid I would love it more, but it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> Nivea is good lotion, but a bit overpriced.  I only buy when on sale. You can get the same results from jergins.</li>
            <li> Great lotion with nice fragrance, seems to really help my winter skin.</li>
            <li> Only lotion I use. Love the scent. Heavy duty for dry, sensitive skin. Have used for 20 years. This is a great price (when you do subscription).</li>
            <li> Good fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Good moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky</li>
            <li> I like it so much,  I bought five bottles of lotion at once and gave them as little gifts to family members ~ Not greasy ~ Softens skin ~ Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Recently bought this as a part of Subscribe and Save option on Amazon. I liked its texture compared to lubriderm or vasoline I recommend</li>
            <li> the best really thick skin feels hydrated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for several years now. I&#x27;m a 40yr old black male &amp; this lotion leaves my skin moisturized threw out the day &amp; is not as thick or oily as compared to cocoa butter. It also has a great scent.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been ordering this lotion for a while, and it feels great on our skin (makes my skin super soft).  However, Amazon ships it in one of those yellow envelopes with a single layer of bubble wrap. This last time we received it, though, it had burst in the envelope!  I opened the envelope, and a huge mess spilled out.  I had to clean the floor, wall AND my clothes.  Totally not worth the mess.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;He has very dry hands &amp; this does its job perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t leave any smell, which is great for him. Lasts a long time even though he usues it multiple times during the day.</li>
            <li> Rich and thick, just how I like it.  It helps with my really dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly and provides quick relief for dryness.</li>
            <li> Live Nivea products this product is very moisturizing and thick so apply sparingly even gives u a nice sheen on your skin !! Highly recommend for extremely dry skin !!</li>
            <li> Working on a farm your skin tends to get a bit dry, I have tried many products and this one goes on nice and smooth without leaving a feeling of a ton of grease left behind on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  It soaks right in.  Added it to Subscribe and save so I never run  out.</li>
            <li> great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I only use Nivea Essentially Enriched for both face and body for years now. It is not irritating or perfumed for sensitive skin, not too heavy or too light. I live in fear of the day they decide to discontinue this product.</li>
            <li> Love this especially with the winter months and our current low temps.</li>
            <li> call me cheesy, but i started using this lotion because i read that beyonce uses it (ok, i&#x27;ll call myself cheesy on your behalf for that), but kother than that, its an amazing lotion. i have dry skin, and i like the fact that it makes my skin shiny like i&#x27;ve used baby oil but isn&#x27;t sticky and keeps my skin moist. i bring my bottle to work and now some of my co-workers have purchased their own. nivea may be pricer than some other drug store brands, but its well worth it. my skin loves this lotion.</li>
            <li> We love Nivea for body lotion, best bang for the buck. We live in Wisconsin and use about 6 bottles of Nivea lotion every winter.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful for people with very dry skin. I use it all year long, but it manages to keep my skin nourished during the very dry winter months as well!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It is very moisturizing but can be oily.</li>
            <li> I have horrible dry skin and this is the only lotion that will work for me!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves your skin so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and make ur skin smooth as well. I have a very dry skin and it&#x27;s effective. So I am Loving it</li>
            <li> I bought Nivea&#x27;s Essentially Enriched Body Lotion at the beginning of winter to help protect from Dry skin and cold sores that frequently erupt consequent to the weather. The product was shipped promptly and arrived on time, however, when the package was opened, part of the dispenser was BROKEN. We decided to try out the cream anyway, and two months after use there are some pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s that I think work and do not work for this product-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: Reasonably priced, no off-putting smell, enriched with natural sea minerals and Almond Oil that provide relief to dry to very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: The Seller may want to reconsider how the product is shipped to prevent damage, be aware that this is &amp;#34;enriched&amp;#34; body lotion and will leave a very oily layer on your skin upon application.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ever. I have very sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use just anything on it. When I finally found Nivea I stopped looking for a better product. This is the best! I am so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> It is soo creamy...and the fragrance is so mesmerizing and soft.... This is sheer bliss. I apply it at night and sleep peacefully in its heavenly smell...</li>
            <li> Alcohol free!  We stood in the lotion aisle of a big box store trying to find a lotion that was alcohol free.  Out of the dozens of overwhelming options, this was the only one we found with no drying alcohol listed in the ingredients.  It is a pleasant smelling lotion.  Very lightly fragranced.  Soothing when applied.  Great consistency.  It has almond oil in it, which is great for your skin!  Very happy with the lotion and will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;m the type of person that likes the thicker rich creams. However, my husband does not like it, he prefers something lighter and less oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Low price and help tremendously with my dry skin</li>
            <li> Does not soak into skin very easy</li>
            <li> he uses this mositurizer only , it works very well for him... whereas not that well for me as I have extra extra dry skin, but only my palm and somehow itw quiet weak for my palm.. but as long as hubby happy I am happy with this ;)</li>
            <li> Nivea is the absolute best lotion I have ever used! It is very moisturizing and just the right consistency. I have used it for years and will continue to use this awesome product!</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> thick and a little bit oily, but absorb very fast. And it smell very good. It is one of the top three lotion that I think smell very nice.</li>
            <li> Not only is it greasy (until it comes off on my clothes), but it leaves a waxy residue on my skin that I notice in the shower the next day. And worse, it does not properly moisturize my skin. What works for me is plain coconut oil. I tried this Nivea because I wanted a lotion that would absorb more quickly than coconut oil for days when I need to dress immediately after my shower. I&#x27;m going back to using coconut oil, and will splurge on a good quality (expensive) lotion that absorbs quickly and beautifully like Desert Organics Sweet Almond to use when I&#x27;m in a hurry and need fast absorption.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful. I really love the scent, but it leaves a waxy finish on the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent at all, it is actually kind of gross and I am fairly scent-tolerant. It feels a little too oily without having a fast absorption, making me want to wipe my hands on a cloth after I apply.  I don&#x27;t notice that it does any better job than other &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; moisture products so I see no reason I would ever get this again.</li>
            <li> this is a good lotion. It has baby oil in it but it soaks in really quickly . It is really thick and creamy. At first I didnt like it but I got use to it especially since my skin seems to stay moisturized for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years during the winter months and there is nothing better. My skin is extremely dry and my face gets especially dry and flaky in the winter; not attractive. I started using Nivea on my face in the winter and applied make-up or powder over it and my face is flawless! My mother-in-law has been doing it for years and she swears by it. It feels a little greasey sometimes, but by the time you rub it on your skin its fine. A little goes a long way, and takes quite a few hand-washings to feel like you need to re-apply. You know its good because it hardly ever goes on sale, and people buy it anyway!!</li>
            <li> and you thought the gulf coast was bad.  I&#x27;m a big girl and one pump of this ooze was more than enough to cover all of my bits and pieces and still have more to spare.  Felt slimier than the days of slathering baby oil before playing on the waterbed.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much, I am still not done with my bottle but have placed another order bc i like it so much!</li>
            <li> we always have Nivea in the house</li>
            <li> Terrible...  so greasy can&#x27;t get rid of it and now it&#x27;s on everything I touch.  Never buying again I wish I didn&#x27;t buy 2 of them...</li>
            <li> I really like this but it is pretty oily/shiny!</li>
            <li> This is good but I prefer the coconut oil lotion.</li>
            <li> Like many other Nivea products, this one is also wonderful product, and has a long lasting effect on skin. Love using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the thick protection in spite of the slight greasy feel. I also use it on my infant with no issues.</li>
            <li> First off, I tried to post this review on Nivea&#x27;s website, but they rejected it.  Here&#x27;s what I said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea has a good reputation for skin care so I purchased this body lotion. First off, the consistency, as another reviewer pointed out, is like spreading glue. It&#x27;s hard to spread around. Secondly and more importantly, after a few days of use both of my arms were on fire with red itchy bumps. I discontinued using this lotion 2 days ago and my arms are still bumpy. Needless to say, I threw this lotion out. I&#x27;ve since researched on the internet that the preservative they use in this lotion has been banned in the UK due to causing skin allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  Nivea is refunding the price I paid for this lotion, but they insist none of their ingredients have been banned.  Hmm.  If curious, Google \\&quot;Nivea lotion and allergic reaction.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> THICK AND NOURISHING!</li>
            <li> I love it and enjoy wearing it every day. Nivea is my preferred body lotion brand and it works so great with my skin. Thanks to the distributor to have it listed and sold on Amazon. It saves a lot of my time to go get it from a store. Sam Club where myfamily usually gets it for me, does not carry in any more.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  Its not too watery, and rich enough to keep my skin moisturized.  Nivea sells different lotions with different levels of richness.  Make sure you look at the richness scale at the bottom front of the lotion to get whichever you prefer.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t kidding when they say this is on the high side of the Rich scale.  It does leave a layer of grease on your hands when using a full pump but since this is for Very Dry skin, it is understandable.  I just make sure I don&#x27;t need to touch anything in the new few minutes and it restores my hands from being dry in no time.</li>
            <li> It definitely does its function to heal dry skin quick. My family love it very much and we will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have very dry elbows and knees, especially in the colder months. I bought this because it was on sale and figured I could stop stealing my wife&#x27;s Gold Bond Ultimate Skin Therapy for a little while... It works to keep my skin from dying out, but the smell is kinda funky (I don&#x27;t know how to describe it - kind of like bad smelling baby powder) and it&#x27;s a little oily/thin. The Gold Bond doesn&#x27;t have the smell and it&#x27;s thicker, so I&#x27;ll use this stuff up, but once it&#x27;s gone I definitely won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li> Nivea products are so soft and long lasting. This lotion feels silky, without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Great to use, especially in cold weather</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this lotion.  It was very greasy feeling and didn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I would have expected.  Maybe with prolonged use I can see better results but so far, not a fan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Nivea...enough said!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I have super dry skin with psoriasis so I am constantly on the move looking for a super moisturing product. This one so far is superior but doesn&#x27;t top the Aveeno brand. Find out for yourself.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Nivea? The fragrance, and richness of this lotion is a winner! Love it, nothing else to say!</li>
            <li> Rich, thick but easily spreads.  Sinks into skin wonderfully.  I use it every night before bed.</li>
            <li> When my son was born almost 31 years ago, he was overdue, causing his skin to be dry and flaky.  This is the lotion they gave me to use on him.  I liked how it felt, its smell, and considering a hospital had given it to me to use on a newborn, I felt confident it was a safe choice.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  There are several types of Nivea, which I have tried, I like the Essentially Enriched best.</li>
            <li> My mother has used Nivea products for years.  My wife and I, however, have just recently made the switch.  We both suffer from extremely dry hands during the winter months here in Chicago.  I&#x27;ve recently started using the &amp;#34;Nivea for Men&amp;#34; 3-in-1 lotion at work, and my wife bought a bottle of this Enriched Body Lotion for the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of us love it.  The lotion goes on smoothly, has a really great scent (that&#x27;s not overwhelming), and it really does seem to soak into your hands within minutes.  Being that I&#x27;m at the computer all day, I don&#x27;t want to have to stop working for 10 minutes every time I want to put a little bit of lotion on my hands for fear of greasing up my keyboard.  With this stuff, I&#x27;m ready to go in just about 2-3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus - the dispenser actually puts out the perfect amount with a single pump!  I know it&#x27;s minor, but we&#x27;ve had some pump dispensers that seem to dish out half a cup with each press - and others that barely give you enough to lotion up a knuckle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, and the size of the bottle, I feel like this really is one of the better values in hand lotions - and it works like a champ.</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin, this does the job. I&#x27;m not into the smell so much. It reminds me of baby powder. Since my skin is moderately dry, I felt it was too creamy. On humid days, this starts to feel uncomfortable. But this is really independent of the quality of the product, since maybe my skin is better suited for something else. Still, not a fan of the smell, and I think many would agree.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years. It hydrates the best and leaves the skin feeling so soft and smooth. The smell is very light but clean. This is the only lotion I will use for as long as it is around.</li>
            <li> Reeks of feminine-smelling artificial fragrance &amp; contains mineral oil which I&#x27;m now reading is terrible for your skin (companies use it because it&#x27;s cheap).  I regret buying this.  Back to Aveeno I go!</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she likes the way it smells, but it left her with a greasy feeling. She&#x27;s only used it as a hand lotion though, and not it&#x27;s intended use as body lotion. :P</li>
            <li> Great lotion for people who have dry or normal skin. Particularly food in cold weather. Feels soft on skin and lasts a few hours during the day. I have used Nivea for over 10 years and swear by it.</li>
            <li> I like this, very thick and emollient for my hands, washing them all day long in my job.  This is great to use at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I have a black dry skin and I have tried so many body lotion that it&#x27;s ridiculous! But at the end of the day, I always come back to this product because it&#x27;s simply the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I heard some people say that it darkens your skin. Not only that I don&#x27;t really care about that, but I have never experience such thing in the 15+ years that I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best body lotion I&#x27;ve ever owned. It goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy. This is lotion. It moisturized my skin. Me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry but I don&#x27;t feel qualified in writing out an elaborate review regarding lotion and its moisturizing properties. I&#x27;m a dude, what the hell do I know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Brad</li>
            <li> very rich moisturizer, smells nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I use this as a makeup artist in my kit. It creates a beautiful sheen on the skin and is extremely hydrating. A little hard to rub into darker skintones as it&#x27;s very white right out of the bottle but blends in nicely after some work and doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of whiteness.</li>
            <li> The cold weather is coming, the furnace is on, my skin will become dry. I try very hard to keep my skin soft and elastic, but living in New England in the winter can be a trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every moisturizer known to man. Some are very expensive, and really don&#x27;t do anything more than the cheaper drugstore brands. I recently found Nivea again. I used to use it everyday, all the time. Then in hot lost in the expensive stuff. But, as I say, they did not add anything to the mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rich formula of the Nivea body lotion moisturizes and nourishes my skin leaving it smooth and feeling supple. It is&lt;br /&gt;enriched with sea minerals and Almond Oil. This body lotion shows improvement in my dry skin within a few days. Within two weeks, it transformed my dry skin into more nourished and hydrated skin. It feels really good. I like the Nivea scent,and the luxurious feel of the lotion. It is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 10-25-14</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a good moisturizer, but as soon as I put this lotion on, I had to remove it.  It just smelled awful to me, very strong, and very unpleasant, almost like that bottle of lotion you find tucked away in a supply closet after a few years.  I had used Nivea products in the past and have had a few scent issues, but none were ever this bad.</li>
            <li> Bought with special discount, satisfied!</li>
            <li> The only lotion I use on my skin is Nivea . This lotion moisturize my skin really well, leaving it smooth and soft. This lotion will make improvements on your skin if you gave it a try.</li>
            <li> The best part is the price. This lotion is good but even better at a steal price. Lats all day and seems to persists after several hand washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, and I always come back to Nivea. I saw this one and decided to give it a try. My skin is usually very dry and itchy all winter. This lotion makes my skin feel and look moisturized all day long, without feeling greasy. I can put this on my hands and they feel silky soft, yet I can still open a doorknob with no problems immediately after. It has a really nice scent that lingers most of the day, which is another thing I look for in a lotion. I would definitely recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> A WONDERFUL LOTION FOR THE PRICE.  Leaves my hands feeling moisturized for a very long time.  Not a super heavy lotion, but somehow the wizards at Nivea figured out a way to make it last as long as possible on your hands.  It smells very nice, and I&#x27;ve noticed my hands, feet, and everywhere else is a LOT softer thanks to this lotion.  I may never buy another brand of lotion again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-Long-Lasting&lt;br /&gt;-Pleasant Smell&lt;br /&gt;-Luxurious Feel&lt;br /&gt;-It does a MAGNIFICENT job at moisturizing skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-If you like fast absorbing lotion, this might not be for you!</li>
            <li> Very thick, almost like sunscreen. It does moisturize well, though.</li>
            <li> Amazing deal on this and it feels so good!  So rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been this soft until I found out this product. It&#x27;s cheap and definitely worth trying. It does get a little oily and the skin does not seem to absorb very fast but If you have super try skin like me this is great for you.</li>
            <li> Really moisture get that last ALL DAY. Love it!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I really love the smell of this lotion. However, the smell of the lotion only last about an hour.  It moisturizes you skin well and last all day. It does have almond oil in it so I am a bit weary of letting my son, who has a nut allergy, use it.</li>
            <li> Fast to absorb.  Stay moisturized all day.  Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> If you like Nivea products, I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Its quit thick and grease putting it on but does work very well once applied</li>
            <li> Nice, thick lotion. Has the typical Nivea scent which I love.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer ever. It&#x27;s thick, rich but not sticky. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion a few years back and I have not bought it again since. The lotion indeed does a pretty good job of moisturizing skin and it is certainly priced economically, but I think it has some downsides that make it a product I personally do not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other users that this Nivea is somewhat greasy and is difficult to rub in (note this advertised on the bottle as their richest lotion). I also think it leaves that &#x27;heavy&#x27;, almost &#x27;residue-like&#x27; feeling similar to how many heavy weight creams feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I did not buy this product again because...&lt;br /&gt;---it is greasier and more difficult to rub in than other lotions which work just as well (or better) while being easy to rub in and less greasy&lt;br /&gt;---the lotion wears like a VERY heavy-weight cream in which you can &#x27;feel&#x27; what I could best describe at that &amp;#34;residue feeling&amp;#34;, yet it does not perform like a heavy-weight cream&lt;br /&gt;---the pump design is not very well done (mine broke about half way through the bottle)&lt;br /&gt;---the scent itself is rather strong&lt;br /&gt;---the lotion contains a few ingredients which can cause sensitive skin to become very irritated&lt;br /&gt;---the lotion can clog pores (and hence it can make acne worse) - and there are many products on the market that do not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the lotion worked as well as a heavy-weight cream, I would be OK with the somewhat greasier feeling. But it does not work nearly as well as a heavy weight cream, and I honestly think there are numerous good light-weight lotions that provide just as much moisturizing without the heavy feeling, greasiness, or difficulty to work in (like CeraVe, and the CeraVe is practically unscented, super easy to work into skin, not greasy at all, is made without ingredients that can cause irritation, does not clog pores, and has a better dispenser design.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed the price of the Nivea is hard to beat. It is less expensive than something like Gold Bond Ultimate or Cetaphil Daily Advance Lotion. However, I think that if you compare performance between the Gold Bond or Cetaphil versus the Nivea that the Nivea will be hard to justify (lower price or not) because of how much better the Gold Bond or Cetaphil is (and how much more convenient and comfortable they are to use.)Daily Advance Lotion. However, I think that if you compare performance between the Gold Bond or Cetaphil versus the Nivea that the Nivea will be hard to justify (lower price or not) because of how much better the Gold Bond or Cetaphil is (and how much more convenient and comfortable they are to use.)</li>
            <li> I love Nivea products &amp; this is no different. I have used their cold cream in winters (comes in a navy colored tub). This body lotion is what keeps hydrated in summers. I have Keratosis Pilaris &amp; I read that hydration &amp; moisturizing would be helpful in my case. I am NOT saying this lotion reduced/ eliminated my condition- it can&#x27;t go away. But now, with Nivea, I have made peace with KP. Nivea leaves my skin smooth and hydrated &amp; it smells SO good. It&#x27;s a Great price too. I won&#x27;t use this on my face though coz it&#x27;s got perfume in it. But it&#x27;s a wonderful lotion for the whole body after shower. Thanks Nivea!</li>
            <li> really good results, i feel my skin as babies&#x27; skin</li>
            <li> My wife love it, great cream for dry skyn</li>
            <li> This product is always awesome!!!! I love that it is creamy, but lightweight, and smells great.</li>
            <li> Have been using need for my dry skin since I was a kid.  The product has only improved with years.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nivea brand items. They are such High quality, and not outrageously expensive. This body lotion in particular is one of my favorites from Nivea. It is very thick and creamy, however it rubs into the skin and does not make skin overly covered in lotion, or shiny like others do. It will not clog pores like other lotion products that I have tried before, and it does not leave you feeling sticky or gross. I believe it to be a perfect combination of thickness and lightness, as it is able to deeply penetrate the skin and leave it feeling soft and smooth, without the long wait for it to dry sitting on top of the skin. Usually what I prefer to do with this lotion, is put a very large glob on the skin area that is the most dry ( in my case, it is my feet). I cover the area right before i go to bed, and let the lotion soak in while i sleep. Upon waking up, it&#x27;s almost as if a miracle happened! I recommend this product to anyone with dry skin, and has a sensitivity to other lotions or skin care products. This is  must try if you have never used Nivea before!</li>
            <li> I started using this because it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens. This is the first creme I&#x27;ve ever used that actually makes my face look younger. You could tell the difference with and without. Of course, this is just filling in the cracks not actually doing anything about them, but I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> It is really good cream. I like it.</li>
            <li> It is a little oily, but ok.</li>
            <li> Love Nivea...doesn&#x27;t need to have all the  bells and whistles to sell me. Its a must have in tje winter its the only lotion I know that hydrates this well. Remember to lotion up when your body is still damp!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion as well as the rest of the Nivea lotion line. It goes on smooth, absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering scent.</li>
            <li> I like the lotion, but it does have a bit of a perfumey smell.  The smell dissipates after a bit, but that might bother people who are sensitive to these types of smells.</li>
            <li> Best of the Nivea Line. A tad bit greasy, but lets much longer than the Nicea Smooth Sensation or Extended Moisture lotions</li>
            <li> Perfect for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Price was right. It&#x27;s a little creamy, but it works. Glad I bought this product to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I like this one because it is not oily.it is a little thicker ten some nivea products.&lt;br /&gt;I like this for winter months nice that it doesn&#x27;t sit on the skin but goes into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like it for chapped,dry skin.nice size,good price,fast delivery</li>
            <li> The cap was a bit broken but the lotion is the same I have always used. You cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with very dry skin..I apply this just before going to bed but itching starts in the midnight..I like Cetaphil and Aveeno for my everyday use and made a wrong purchase!</li>
            <li> Perfect lotion for me!</li>
            <li> A very thick lotion that takes some work to rub in  but does the job! Not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb diggty. Love it! It smells so good and does such a good job of helping my super dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good, but very heavy enriched body lotion.</li>
            <li> Good basic lotion which does the job. Has the usual Nivea quality. Inam a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Really like this lotion. My skin is very dry and this lotion works great to moisturize and soften.</li>
            <li> Like the lotion, not the scent.  Wish it would come unscented as well, these fake hormones are not good for you.</li>
            <li> I use it already and purchased as a gift for my sister who loves it. She is hiding that fact from her husband so he won&#x27;t use it too!</li>
            <li> This is an all time favorite. It spreads easily on application and stays on the for the day. Definitely a buy.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it definitely has a greasy feel. Probably will not buy again. Nice scent though</li>
            <li> This is beautiful lotion and the price is great. I love Nivea lotion and how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is good lotion. It is heavy and yet absorbs into the skin. I use it on dry legs and arms and hands in the winter particularly. Solves the problem. They also make a creme. The creme gets 5 stars, too. I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it seems at first as thought it isn&#x27;t going to absorb, just sit and feel heavy. But in a few minutes it is all smooth and comfortable. Have faith. : )</li>
            <li> Winter makes skin very dry and is even worse when you already have dry skin.  This lotion definitely does the job in helping keep my families skin full of moisture and not dry and ashy.</li>
            <li> Greasy after, takes a while to get moisturized. I prefer Lubriderm a lot better. It doesn&#x27;t have a lingering greasiness.</li>
            <li> it is good value for a big bottle of moisturizer.  However, I still prefer Aveeno products which is non-greasy.  This product is too oily, that I leave finger prints all over my phone and laptop after applying the body lotion with my hands.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and product in all respects.  AAAAA  +++++</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it leaves your skin  really soft and smooth. :)</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! :)</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that is only made worse with Minnesota&#x27;s harsh winters. This goes on thick and it doesn&#x27;t leave a film. I&#x27;m a big fan and will be buying another bottle once this runs out.</li>
            <li> Nivea helps get rid of any and all scars I have had thru surgery or gust plain being clumcy.  BEST STUFF EVER</li>
            <li> Have used this for years daily, only thing I use for aftershave, doesn&#x27;t sting at all. I&#x27;ll like to mention that  im a male with sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> Nivea is my brand..glad i purchased this one</li>
            <li> My home is full of Nivea products. We brought home Nivea from Germany in 2007 also; the European versions are even better than the US version. Nivea Nivea Nivea. This lotion is full of lotiony goodness. Nivea Nivea Nivea. No innuendo here. We use it for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> great price, bought it for my mom, she pays double for it at CVS,she loves this cream, raves about it!</li>
            <li> We love this. There are many body lotions in the market, but few of them can match this one in terms of effectiveness and price.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for very dry skin</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin hydrated for hours unlike some brands and I have very dry skin (I really should drink more water....) That being said it was great product. Mine came broken at the top but it was still usable and I considered that a fluke</li>
            <li> Nivea is a classic lotion. I love this one because it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of parabens and some of the other dirty things that are in other main stream lotions. I even use this on my 22 month old son because he says it &amp;#34;smells nice!&amp;#34; My skin is super dry and I have a really hard time keeping it moisturized during the winter. Though I typically have to slather this lotion on twice a day due to my extra dry skin, Nivea seriously does a great job at keeping me from flaking all over the house. At the price point, it is excellent.</li>
            <li> Oh my.. It smells so good ☺️😍</li>
            <li> Love the hydration and smell. The first time I used it was in Europe many moons ago. It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s reasonably priced available in the US now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one in the car, at work and multiple bottles around the house since I have severely dry skin. Holds up great in Florida summer heat!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this does the trick.  Its definitely more of the &#x27;wet&#x27; look as its like a lotion/oil but I like it.. been using it for years and keep on buying it.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and Nivea is one of the few products I have found that lasts all day. The smell is appropriate for males and females so the entire family uses it.</li>
            <li> Great, but my mistake to buy it with the oil thing and made it super heavy.</li>
            <li> Not the worst but definitely not the best lotion Ive tried. To be honest I probably will not purchase again but I will use what I&#x27;ve already bought.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, but not as skin absorbent as the Nivea Extended Moisture Body Lotion.  This lotion is quite oily and is better suited to extremely dry skin where you may require lotion as a protective shield---that is if you can stand a heavily fragranced lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion not just moisturizer for your skin but it really help to make your skin soft. the oily think I might complain is its just too greesy from the beginning but when its dried feels good.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency, but I don&#x27;t like the the smell at all. Plus it leaves a white residue like sunscreen does.</li>
            <li> This is a very  creamy lotion,not watered down like some are. I keep one in each bathroom,great after shaving your legs.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome.  I can stroke it on any of my skin 3 times longer than any other cream or lube out there.  Every time I have to clean it up the formula is like a magic explosional stress relief happening with less effort to feel better.  It truly has been the best thing ever because of all the stress relief given to me in my life.  I don&#x27;t even have to buy hair gel to style my hair anymore because this explosive product is better than anything else for keeping the fuzz out of it.  My wife loves the spare time because before she had to spend 3-6 hours a day rubbing my back and lower body.  This product is a true revolutionary miracle that everyone should try massaging into even their most sensitive skin since my dermotologist first tested a tube of it on my dry skin when visiting her because of a rash on my penis.</li>
            <li> Best value for quality lotion. Eucerin is the next step up in price and reported quality.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and hadn&#x27;t used this lotion in years. After my skin became dry and itchy I decided to go back to using it and am very happy. I am limited with the kinds of products I can use. I have seen some reviews say this doesn&#x27;t smell good. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and is what this brand of lotion has smelled like for the last 20+ years. Give it a try and decide for yourself in the smell.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  This provide a creamy layer that great during the winter and also non greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that your skin looks oily at first but it really pays off. After I apply it in the morning I don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying lotion all day</li>
            <li> A little to greasy for me and the scent is not that appealing.</li>
    </ol>
