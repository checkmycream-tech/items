    <ol>
            <li>Blends perfectly with my hair color.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product wonderful company.</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>May be good for Halloween though</li>
            <li>These bangs are actually true to their color which is awesome!</li>
            <li>but luckily when I got it, it matched my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t been honest, they would have though I cut my hair into bangs.</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t even care.</li>
            <li>They stay on nicely.</li>
            <li>These bangs were too cute.</li>
            <li>Perfect fr just jazzing up a regular hair style.</li>
            <li>They are really fun to wear and match my hair color surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li>Not the most convincing, but also not a horrible quality.</li>
            <li>but over all I was pleased</li>
            <li>Easy to clip in and out, very secure.</li>
            <li>Very soft and looked great.</li>
            <li>I love mine so much, and I get so many complements. :-)</li>
            <li>I ordered the LIGHT BROWN color.</li>
            <li>The packaging even stated light brown.</li>
            <li>If the color was right, the cut was kind of funny too.</li>
            <li>Best 5$ I have spent on Amazon for hair thus far!!!</li>
            <li>While the product is way more well made than what I thought I would be getting for under $2, it arrived and was more of a deep chocolate brown.</li>
            <li>So if you have hair color similar to the light brown, beware!</li>
            <li>Overall, it was just okay.</li>
            <li>The color is of the bang is pretty.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fun to experiment with new looks.</li>
            <li>The bangs are just alright, they are not as short as they appear in the pictures, but they are easily adjusted.</li>
            <li>It was very well made which is why I gave 2 stars and not just one.</li>
            <li>The hair was so real.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought I loved the second one not so much the hair was bent up and hard to get it&#x27;s original shape back</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back.</li>
            <li>I wanted this for a halloween costume and it will work for that, but the piece is way too wide to look real or nice if you want it to actually pull off a different look for everyday</li>
            <li>I ordered it in brown black, and when I got it, it was a light reddish brown that looked like shiny plastic doll hair.</li>
            <li>But it actually looks better than I expected especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cannot use because it&#x27;s too shiny, it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all.  </li>
            <li>The color was an off black and really shiny</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The clipon were put on upside down so it was inconvenient for me to take it apart and sew  it back on.</li>
            <li> These bangs were too cute. Perfect fr just jazzing up a regular hair style. I blended this piece wth some Brazilian and Indian hair wth ease.</li>
            <li> Would not suggest buying this product! I ordered it in brown black, and when I got it, it was a light reddish brown that looked like shiny plastic doll hair. Total waste of money</li>
            <li> I ordered the LIGHT BROWN color. While the product is way more well made than what I thought I would be getting for under $2, it arrived and was more of a deep chocolate brown. Definitely not the color pictured!! The packaging even stated light brown. So if you have hair color similar to the light brown, beware! You might not get what you think you are. It was very well made which is why I gave 2 stars and not just one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to select a color option, which was weird. The item took a bit of time to ship but luckily when I got it, it matched my hair perfectly. I wanted this for a halloween costume and it will work for that, but the piece is way too wide to look real or nice if you want it to actually pull off a different look for everyday</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it yet.  But it actually looks better than I expected especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> Never received these bangs with my order of another hair piece.  Was disappointed as this was one piece I was looking forward to.</li>
            <li> These bangs are actually true to their color which is awesome! I love mine so much, and I get so many complements. :-)</li>
            <li> They are really fun to wear and match my hair color surprisingly well.  Easy to clip in and out, very secure. I haven&#x27;t had bangs in a long time so it&#x27;s fun to experiment with new looks.</li>
            <li> hair very shiny and fake looking. May be good for Halloween though</li>
            <li> Waste of money, there is nothing I could do with this bang when I got it and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this hair piece. For one it looks too fake , and second  they are to short.</li>
            <li> The bangs are just alright, they are not as short as they appear in the pictures, but they are easily adjusted. Not the most convincing, but also not a horrible quality. Overall, it was just okay.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought I loved the second one not so much the hair was bent up and hard to get it&#x27;s original shape back it could have been packing and shipping fault</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use for a costume. It looked perfectly fine, but it made my forehead itch like crazy. I avoid wearing it now. (I should note that I trimmed it myself so that may have had something to do with the itchiness factor)</li>
            <li> The hair was so real. Very soft and looked great.</li>
            <li> these bangs were super thick and didn&#x27;t work very well.  :-(</li>
            <li> I have worn these bangs several times with several diffrent hair styles. If I hadn&#x27;t been honest, they would have though I cut my hair into bangs. The girls at work still get a kick every time i put these on. Best 5$ I have spent on Amazon for hair thus far!!! I got the dark drown version. Blends perfectly with my hair color.</li>
            <li> Cannot use because it&#x27;s too shiny, it doesn&#x27;t look natural at all.  If the color was right, the cut was kind of funny too.</li>
            <li> The color was an off black and really shiny so it looks like a piece.  I ended up spraying it with black temp color which reduced the shine and color.</li>
            <li> Very good product. When mine didn&#x27;t arrive on time they immediately got me another one within a few days .excellent quality. Wonderful product wonderful company.</li>
            <li> This thing didn&#x27;t have any clips to install it in my hair and way too shiny looks fake</li>
            <li> They took forever to come in and were thicker than I imagined they would be but over all I was pleased</li>
            <li> I like the bangs that I received and I like the color of the bang. The color is of the bang is pretty. I want my hair the same color of the bang. But I thought that I was going to get all four but I only got one. It was in a auburn-reddish color.</li>
            <li> came when it did people was shocked when they found out it was fake matched my hair great</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t match my hair but I honestly don&#x27;t even care. They stay on nicely. I recommend.</li>
