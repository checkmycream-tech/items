            <li>Great scent and long lasting bars.  </li>
            <li>I bought a case of this soap without even trying it out first just based on the scent alone</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with Dial products</li>
            <li>but they really outdid themselves this time around!  </li>
            <li>soap lathers pretty well with softened water .</li>
            <li>I was so excited because it cleans extremely well, keeps things dry and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is anything better about this then my normal Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>Bars have a good smell, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Protection seems to last a good, long time...</li>
            <li>Strong scent, unlike regular Dial.</li>
            <li>is the new hip odors for hipsters on the go, marketed towards Millennials most likely.</li>
            <li>you open the box, the whole bathroom smells strongly with the embedded fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>Delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>lathers up well, but the bar of soap shrinks very quickly!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better than I expected.</li>
            <li>My wife wants to seduce me after I use this...</li>
            <li>and I really like the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will buy as much of it as I can from my supplier</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells kind of harsh...</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>I really do like it, and this my new go to soap.  </li>
            <li>Decent size bars for an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>I was a loyal Irish Spring patron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>This soap DESTROYS odor and keeps it away all day long while keeping your skin smelling fresh and clean and it doesn&#x27;t even dry it out.  </li>
            <li>Lathers nice, you only need a little.</li>
            <li>The only positive I can think of is that it doesn&#x27;t make you dirtier by using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ladies, you can use this soap, the scent isn&#x27;t too masculine.</li>
            <li>All of the stores near me have quit carrying this product for who knows what reason.</li>
            <li>It lasts a lot longer than the Dollar General soap I had previously been using (I&#x27;m a broke college student, what do you expect?) and not having to replace my soap once a week is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like that this soap doesn&#x27;t dissolve as fast as many dial products--the scent is definitely to be &amp;#34;MANLY.&amp;#34;  I thought it was pretty expensive for 3 bars of soap.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll be back for more</li>
            <li>So after trying several different bar soaps I settled on this one, which seems to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not dry out his skin.  </li>

            <li> Does not dry out his skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so solid and seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this soap in stores and what makes it worse is that this is my favorite soap!</li>
            <li> Will keep on subscribe and save as long as it stays around $2 for 3 bars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only do I stay dry all day, but unlike other products this soap doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product when I was single.</li>
            <li> Works as well as most deodorant soap.&lt;br /&gt;After showering, the scent becomes very faint after one hour.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I like it but take the blue color out; it makes a mess in the soap dish and tub.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a computer tech, so the last thing I want when working around people is to be smelly, and strong smelling antiperspirant is just as bad.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this soap to others (especially other broke college students.)</li>
            <li> It also seems like they are being a little skimpy with the amount of product.</li>
            <li> I tried to tolerate it for a few days</li>
            <li> Kinda harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This works well, except it leaves a lot of soap scum.</li>
            <li> Subtle formula makes it usable for toddlers or small children with the strength to perform for the working man!</li>
            <li> Smells bad, dries out your skin, not very good soap at all.</li>
            <li> unfortunately this is not the one.</li>
            <li> The ladies Caress soap just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for my husbands manly odor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;re going to stop making it.  </li>

            <li> Great scent and feel very clean. Not to overpowering and just the right amount fragrance. Didn&#x27;t even need deodorant with it!</li>
            <li> Dial soap does the job dependably. And the Amazon price is unbeatable. Delivery is fast. Order your Dial soap from Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are great maybe even better than Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> Great deal on soap, bought this for $2.99 (it wasn&#x27;t an add-on item when I bought it) and I like the scent. It lasts a lot longer than the Dollar General soap I had previously been using (I&#x27;m a broke college student, what do you expect?) and not having to replace my soap once a week is a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this soap to others (especially other broke college students.)</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find this soap in stores and what makes it worse is that this is my favorite soap! So, I decided to search here on Amazon to find it and they had it! I was so excited because it cleans extremely well, keeps things dry and smelling good. It&#x27;s not expensive and its overall amazing. It destroys odor and keeps me smelling fresh all day!  And the lather is awesome! Lathers up very good, easy to rinse off but the scent stays. I love it!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s soap.  Decent size bars for an affordable price.  It makes the stink disappear.  If you&#x27;ve never heard of this stuff, your co-workers are wishing you&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> This works well, except it leaves a lot of soap scum.</li>
            <li> Damn this is some strong smelling stuff, gives me a headache! Dries my skin up!</li>

            <li> Smells good, not overpowering. Lathers well. Does seem to help with odor, per my son. Does not dry out his skin.  Perfect for my ASD teen who doesn&#x27;t yet appreciate deodorant.</li>
            <li> All of the stores near me have quit carrying this product for who knows what reason. It&#x27;s a great deodorant bar soap and I really like the fragrance. The price paid here was pretty steep so I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll be back for more though.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The price has been dropped now and I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not like a bloodhound, like a cologne.</li>
            <li> The soap does a good job of washing my body</li>
            <li> My husband only uses Dial for Men Odor Armor soap.</li>
            <li> This soap smells like a cigarette smoke-filled casino!  I tried to tolerate it for a few days but I couldn&#x27;t stand the scentbany longer.  If you love that smell then this is the soap for you.  If you do not, STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> Husband is satisfied and it helps keep the whole bathroom smelling nice.</li>
            <li> The ladies Caress soap just wasn&#x27;t cutting it for my husbands manly odor so I bought this Dial for Men soap for him and he loves it. No longer does he have to smell pretty, he now smells like a man.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soap that is not slimy, that is without moisturizer... unfortunately this is not the one. I just want the simplest deodorizing soap....still haven&#x27;t found...</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Has an awesome smell too!  If you are a outside worker like me, you&#x27;ll can&#x27;t wait to get a shower with this soap. Not overpowering and suds up good too.</li>
            <li> Cleans well. Cheap! Will keep on subscribe and save as long as it stays around $2 for 3 bars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a computer tech, so the last thing I want when working around people is to be smelly, and strong smelling antiperspirant is just as bad. So after trying several different bar soaps I settled on this one, which seems to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I stay dry all day, but unlike other products this soap doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this bar soap! He smells sooo good!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this soap. Not only for men.....</li>
            <li> Helps keep my husband from stinking. LOL Gotta love that! It seems to keep the odor away longer than regular dial.</li>
            <li> Bars have a good smell, and last a long time.  I like that they come each in a box (inside the wrapped package), vs each in a wrapper.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  Wife likes the smell of the soap and that is what is most important.</li>
            <li> love the scent.  Sure works good at keeping me smelling fresh longer</li>
            <li> The smell is good and fresh, but the soap gets soggy easily and since it&#x27;s blue all my bathtube is now covered with bright blue streaks.</li>
            <li> 3 bars. OK price. Good product</li>
            <li> Great Soap Smell Very Nice</li>
            <li> Provides all day protection with a great fresh scent. Subtle formula makes it usable for toddlers or small children with the strength to perform for the working man!</li>
            <li> I was a loyal Irish Spring patron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great soap, the smell is fantastic I will continue to buy this soap but NOT from Amazon, this is almost a dollar cheaper at my local Wegmans... which means it may be cheaper at Wally-World.</li>
            <li> Great value for the soap and it has a great long lasting scent</li>
            <li> Wow!!! I&#x27;m actually surprised that this is a great soap</li>
            <li> Great smell, clean feeling bar soap!!</li>
            <li> NICE DEODORANT BAR SOAP</li>
            <li> Great scent and long lasting bars.  These bars work well in the shower, and leave the bathroom smelling great.</li>
            <li> I like that this soap doesn&#x27;t dissolve as fast as many dial products--the scent is definitely to be &amp;#34;MANLY.&amp;#34;  I thought it was pretty expensive for 3 bars of soap.</li>
            <li> Keeps me smelling great even through long work days.</li>
            <li> Hmmm...conflicted here. The soap cleans great. Protection seems to last a good, long time...but the scent is just too...medicinal.&lt;br /&gt;It smells kind of harsh...I can&#x27;t really explain it, but once out of the shower, it smells nice on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Not overpowering out of the shower, but not so nice while showering.</li>
            <li> Nice masculine fragrance, cleans well.  A good choice.</li>
            <li> Great item. Great price.</li>
            <li> I like it but take the blue color out; it makes a mess in the soap dish and tub.  It also seems like they are being a little skimpy with the amount of product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;re going to stop making it.  It&#x27;s so solid and seems to last a long time.  Feels good in my hand and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  My hands feel clean after washing.  Don&#x27;t stop making this Dial!</li>
            <li> smells great and great price.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap.  We have a standing order so he won&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> This soap is where it&#x27;s at!  I bought a case of this soap without even trying it out first just based on the scent alone and I must say it was a good buy.  This soap DESTROYS odor and keeps it away all day long while keeping your skin smelling fresh and clean and it doesn&#x27;t even dry it out.  I will buy as much of it as I can from my supplier cos I really do like it, and this my new go to soap.  Overall I am satisfied with Dial products but they really outdid themselves this time around!  Thank You Dial for producing such a magnificent personal cleansing product!</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It has a clean manly scent that I enjoy. Will be ordering more because I cannot find any in this area</li>
            <li> Yup, got me clean alright.</li>
            <li> Good strong odor and a MANLY SOAP!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap, seems to work fine.  I don&#x27;t know if there is anything better about this then my normal Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> Kinda harsh on the skin.  Lathers nice, you only need a little.</li>
            <li> Has three blue bars of soap in the box, not yellow as you might think with the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Once you open the box, the whole bathroom smells strongly with the embedded fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;They smell pretty good....if you like AXE products.&lt;br /&gt;This is the new hip odors for hipsters on the go, marketed towards Millennials most likely. Very strong fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers pretty well with softened water .</li>
            <li> Strong scent, unlike regular Dial.</li>
            <li> Purchased this soap for my son. He likes it very much and would buy more. Very nice smell. Came in good time.  I recommend this seller.</li>
