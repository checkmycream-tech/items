            <li>Overall its okay, great for acne prone skin and great price.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, a tad too &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; for a face cream, that the reason why I got rid of ambi, it has to rub in quickly and dissolve into the skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased a package of 6 and want to make sure it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>have struggled with brown spots on my face for quite some time and used many things before</li>
            <li>and I can tell most of my darker spots are lighter already  </li>
            <li>However, I do like the cream itself, it&#x27;s nice and light with a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>I simply love it.</li>

            <li>This product is great, of course you&#x27;ll start to see the effects after several weeks using it.</li>
            <li>, my face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years , I am very happy with this product I would recommend it to everyone , I&#x27;m putting all my expensive lancome /clinique on the trash cause</li>
            <li>This product works great on dark spots.</li>
            <li>I like how its light and non greasy, but dont think its works as fast as others lighteners.</li>

            <li>I have to say that this product really works better than lancome , clinique , avon , olay , mary kay and many others I had used in the past .I</li>
            <li>but I am told its pretty much gone and this worked.</li>
            <li>but nothing really seem to work until I found this</li>
            <li>It took me about 6 months to use the whole 1.78 oz tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for half a year already, and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s been nearly 6 months, and I am upgrading by a star bc</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fault the cream as it definitely works but only up to a certain point.</li>
            <li>The dark spots on my cheeks have faded A LOT; not completely but significantly.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough but it comes in a big tube</li>
            <li> Good stuff, a tad too &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; for a face cream, that the reason why I got rid of ambi, it has to rub in quickly and dissolve into the skin. Its alright and does the job.</li>
            <li> I  notice  that  my  dark  spots  have  disappeared  after  I  month  of  use.  It  is  a  good  product.</li>
            <li> Is this product supposed to have a strong chemical smell? I purchased a package of 6 and want to make sure it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This product works great on dark spots. I wear it at night after a shower and have been doing this for a week and I&#x27;m already seeing results. My complexion is a caramel color and it definitely works well.</li>
            <li> It soften your skin, but doesn&#x27;t lighten your skin.</li>
            <li> I like how its light and non greasy, but dont think its works as fast as others lighteners. And I hate that it has fragrance. Overall its okay, great for acne prone skin and great price.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots, no scar, left over from shingle attack on my left leg. After applying the cream for a few weeks, so far I don&#x27;t see any changes on the spots that is treated to the spots not treated.</li>
            <li> It works. I faded some spots that I could never scrub. Took a few days but I am told its pretty much gone and this worked. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> It really works I love it!</li>
            <li> It works so well, and it&#x27;s a great deal. I usually put a bit on a cotton square and rub it on the areas that need lightning. I used to pick at my skin a lot and get marks from it, so I bought this in hopes of having them cleared. I&#x27;ve been using it for half a year already, and I&#x27;m satisfied. It takes about 1-3 weeks to take affect. Apply it twice a day, use fair proportions, and you&#x27;ll be fine. It works great, if you have marks you want to get rid of you should definitely consider this. Do not expect immediate affects!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product really works better than lancome , clinique , avon , olay , mary kay and many others I had used in the past .I have struggled with brown spots on my face for quite some time and used many things before but nothing really seem to work until I found this , I have been using it for a week and I can tell most of my darker spots are lighter already  , my face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years , I am very happy with this product I would recommend it to everyone , I&#x27;m putting all my expensive lancome /clinique on the trash cause they can&#x27;t compare with this , hands down no doubt this is the bomb.</li>
            <li> Good price, at time , good delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 wks now. I haven&#x27;t unfortunately noticed any effect (although I&#x27;ll update if I do). However, I do like the cream itself, it&#x27;s nice and light with a lovely fragrance. I&#x27;m still keeping my fingers crossed that if I doubledown and use twice a day, it might actually fade some of my sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been nearly 6 months, and I am upgrading by a star bc I do see an impact. A few months ago, however, I moved, to a sunnier clime and just as of the last week am noticing a slight darkening. I can&#x27;t fault the cream as it definitely works but only up to a certain point.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for last 6 months &amp; it has lighten my spots. really good. i like it very much .</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that I can find that gets rid of the brown spots that I get from having type 2 diabetes and poly cystic ovary syndrome.  This is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> This product is great, of course you&#x27;ll start to see the effects after several weeks using it. I simply love it.</li>
            <li> Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras</li>
            <li> The product works well, I have been using the product for about 4mths, I lost my job and could not afford the dermatologist so I tried this product and it works just as well as the others&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am telling all my friends and family about this product.</li>
            <li> It took me about 6 months to use the whole 1.78 oz tube. I started to see results after about two months. The dark spots on my cheeks have faded A LOT; not completely but significantly. I definitely recommend this cream to anyone with hyperpigmentation. The key is to be patient. It may take 6 months but a stronger fade cream will probably irritate the skin.</li>
