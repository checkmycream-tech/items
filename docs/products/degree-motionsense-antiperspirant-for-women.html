            <li>Even better than Secrets Clinical Strength (which directs you to apply at bedtime)!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a magic eraser!  </li>
            <li>but i will not say its amazing in that criteria.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the click and use creamier kind</li>
            <li>Nice Scent.  </li>
            <li>I really like, it lasts and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This scent is not powdery or flowery at all, fresh, clean, perfect.</li>
            <li>Have tried almost every brand of deodorant and this is by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Degree doesn&#x27;t leave residue and is just as strong as Mitchum!</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit too strong for my liking, but it is better than B.O.!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is so fresh smelling that sometimes i like to lift up my own arms to get a whiff of it !</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading reviews on amazon, and they were accurate!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overpowering or flowery, and when you do catch a whiff of it, it&#x27;s nice and light.  </li>
            <li>Has been my favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it shipped</li>
            <li>Love this product, but it is so overpriced.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again, great formula!</li>
            <li>Nothing has me jumping to buy more..</li>
            <li>But its ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed degree products BUT not this one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product &amp; will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Great product,  woorks very well.</li>
            <li>Protection when you need it most.</li>
            <li>I love that it really does a great job of preventing/masking any body</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest finding this at a drug store to make sure you like its odor before ordering online.</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the cheapest but most reliable deodorants I&#x27;ve used, but I guess I have to keep looking for one that works better with</li>
            <li>love the scent as well.  </li>
            <li>I like to use all of the Degree Deodorants for Women, the scents are very nice and they are very reliable.</li>
            <li>It smells great and seems to offer decent protection.</li>
            <li>Degree lasts all day and has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant by far - nice, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean and neutral.</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant and not too much.</li>
            <li>I can easily go 2 days without needing more, even after bathing.</li>
            <li>48 hour protection is true!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>WELL - I am very impressed with the quality of this deodorant (keeps you dry and smelling fresh!).</li>
            <li>I was a very loyal Degree user for years.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, when I use it my eyes water and I have a very mild headache.</li>
            <li>, Shower Clean is much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been gagging over the ridiculously strong scent all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a baby-powder scent but a really strong one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>Dont like the strong smell while wearing it on self.</li>
            <li>but it smells very good, lasts long time, and your not stinky.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is the nice, baby powder smell.</li>
            <li>It did just wonderfully and didn&#x27;t have to reapply, as I thought I would have to based on the hot weather, overall conditions and activity.  </li>
            <li>It works fine as a deodorant and antipersperant.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but not overpowering, and the best part is that I have antiperspirant action without getting the swollen glands that appear with the heavy duty anti-perspirants (the ones you put on the night before).  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes which is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great buy for teen girls</li>
            <li>This deodorant does exactly what I ask and so much more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it ever since it was available, and it&#x27;s true, it lasts for 48+ hours.</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>Works great all day long!</li>
            <li>Very mild, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t transfer to my clothes and smells clean.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit strong smelling if you put too much on but that is an easy fix.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and came in original packaging.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone who sweats alot or has strong body odor!</li>
            <li>One swipe and you are good to go the entire day.</li>
            <li>It does what it says and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>It lasts for almost two full days if you don&#x27;t wash it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hot and sweat easily.  </li>
            <li>Mild scent and it WORKS as stated.</li>
            <li>oh so quickly.</li>
            <li>Very strong and slightly masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>Gosh I was really worried after reading some of the reviews about strong smell</li>
            <li>It might be good for keeping you dry, but I noticed it lacked protection for body odor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about deodorant, and this one rocks!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great, it keeps me dry, even out here in Afghanistan, and I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>but I have to say most of the time it isn&#x27;t strong enough to control odor for me.</li>
            <li>My favorite smelling deodorant has always been Dove Original clean solid -</li>
            <li>I also am a ginger :) with very sensitive skin - this stuff is soothing, even right after I shave.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve had my head wrapped in a fresh diaper all day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothes and I smell just as fresh at the end of the day as I did in the beginning even after sweating.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Keeps me fresh all day</li>
            <li>I just smell fresh.</li>
            <li>Degree Motion sense lasts ALL day long, you never feel dry, you never feel sticky and it smells INCREDIBLE!</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean smell, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine - has a decent scent, not too strong (I have very sensitive allergies).</li>
            <li>It sits right about my husbands belly button line.</li>
            <li>And staying nice and protected during long hours of yoga practice!</li>
            <li>But I did use it before a zumba class, and I stayed nice and dry!</li>
            <li>My dog rubbed his nose on the ground for 5 minutes trying to make the smell go away when I first put it on</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different deodorants.  </li>
            <li>When they came out with the clinical strength version, it was better but oil leaks out of the bottom (on several containers)</li>
            <li>Some perfumes give me headaches, but this is the first deodorant to do it.</li>
            <li>It is almost always hot here</li>
            <li>I love this brand, and it is the only antipersperant/deoderant that I have used for years.</li>
            <li>I would definately reccommend this, absolutely!</li>
            <li>Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li>All in all, it does the job, but I like the regular Degree deodorant better.</li>
            <li>Amazon never fails for the lowest price.</li>
            <li>Tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li>this strong - I definitely do not go 2 days without putting on fresh deodorant, but I think that&#x27;s what you are supposed to do with this.</li>
            <li>This degree is great for women or men and has a subtle smell depending on which scent you choose.</li>
            <li>I bought this in Walmart for $3.88, I put it on the next morning, and did a lot of rushing around that day, and I still smelt good the next morning!</li>
            <li>The costume is really quite funny.</li>
            <li>It goes on comfortably and smells subtle but nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not feminine either, and I got my husband to start wearing it because men&#x27;s deodorants can be SOOO smelly and strong (gross!)</li>
            <li>I always hope for more protection, but this provides as good, if not better than other brands.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly link this product with the strange soreness, but there were no other changes made besides my deodorant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The Motion Sensor really does work.</li>
            <li>Why would someone pay over 2x as much as it is in stores?</li>
            <li>I have noticed this on all the sellers, unless it is an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item that cannot be purchased unless I buy more items... which is getting harder to do.</li>
            <li>but it protects REALLY</li>
            <li>but I really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>This works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling this product.</li>
            <li>But the smell really turned me off.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and keeps the smell and sweat at bay</li>
            <li>Secret gel deodorants start out smelling great but smell super chemically to me shortly after.</li>
            <li>This has given me a new confidence!</li>
            <li>Feels fantastic going on and has kept me dry all day.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell is a little strong at first</li>
            <li>This is high quality grade A deodorant.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s about 4&amp;#34; too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for women who have a perspiration and odor problem.</li>
            <li>Lasts way longer than normal deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dove&#x27;s Ultimate Go Fresh.</li>
            <li>I compared the ingredients and there are a few more in the Degree brand.</li>
            <li>I normally dont like to wear scented deoderant</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I was purposely testing this, but I was out on an overnight boat trip, and there was no shower available, so we were out for 2  1/2 days with just a change of clothes and some other necessities, so I depended on my Degree deodorant/anti-perspirant to work.</li>
            <li>Only this brand has managed to get me through the hot days where we live.  </li>
            <li>But Degree for Women keeps me dry, not sweating and I smell fresh.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t leave white on clothing and keeps me dry and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I really like the clean scent even though I usually prefer no scent.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me dry better then other non-prescription products.</li>
            <li>I switched to the Anti-perspirant and deodorant after trying some herbal natural stuff that did not work at all.  </li>
            <li>No staining so far, either.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who works out, sweats, or just wants to know they have that extra protection.</li>
            <li>So if your nose is sensitive I recomend you not to buy this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at how well it does work.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well, actually.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhere between baby powder and old lady smell.</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming, just crisp and fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent is fairly strong, stronger than my past deodorants.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that works through the gym, hot days outside, swimming, anything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about it, and find that I use the smallest possible amount to avoid smelling it all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low, trying product after product.</li>
            <li>Does not sting or dry out like Certain Dri.  </li>
            <li>I am a heavy sweater, and also feel like I get stinky quickly.  </li>
            <li>It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel thick, gummy or sticky at all.</li>
            <li>However, it has a very stong, long lasting, detergent like smell.</li>
            <li>No wet clothing.  </li>
            <li>Better than Secret, but I am not a fan of the scent options.</li>
            <li>There is a sewn in waste that is supposed to be right</li>
            <li>I use this daily and don&#x27;t have to reapply like i did with the degree ultra clear red satin.</li>
            <li>Suave was by far the worst brand I&#x27;ve ever tried (the smell clashed with my sweat, it left residue, and it was sticky), and avon&#x27;s liquid was the best.</li>
            <li>It is a good size, larger than the average Secret or other brands I would get and</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> Even better than Secrets Clinical Strength (which directs you to apply at bedtime)!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a magic eraser!  </li>
            <li> but i will not say its amazing in that criteria.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the click and use creamier kind</li>
            <li> Nice Scent.  </li>
            <li> I really like, it lasts and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This scent is not powdery or flowery at all, fresh, clean, perfect.</li>
            <li> Have tried almost every brand of deodorant and this is by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li> Degree doesn&#x27;t leave residue and is just as strong as Mitchum!</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit too strong for my liking, but it is better than B.O.!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is so fresh smelling that sometimes i like to lift up my own arms to get a whiff of it !</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews on amazon, and they were accurate!  </li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering or flowery, and when you do catch a whiff of it, it&#x27;s nice and light.  </li>
            <li> Has been my favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it shipped</li>
            <li> Love this product, but it is so overpriced.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, great formula!</li>
            <li> Nothing has me jumping to buy more..</li>
            <li> But its ok.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed degree products BUT not this one.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product &amp; will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Great product,  woorks very well.</li>
            <li> Protection when you need it most.</li>
            <li> I love that it really does a great job of preventing/masking any body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest finding this at a drug store to make sure you like its odor before ordering online.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the cheapest but most reliable deodorants I&#x27;ve used, but I guess I have to keep looking for one that works better with</li>
            <li> love the scent as well.  </li>
            <li> I like to use all of the Degree Deodorants for Women, the scents are very nice and they are very reliable.</li>
            <li> It smells great and seems to offer decent protection.</li>
            <li> Degree lasts all day and has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant by far - nice, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean and neutral.</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant and not too much.</li>
            <li> I can easily go 2 days without needing more, even after bathing.</li>
            <li> 48 hour protection is true!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> WELL - I am very impressed with the quality of this deodorant (keeps you dry and smelling fresh!).</li>
            <li> I was a very loyal Degree user for years.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, when I use it my eyes water and I have a very mild headache.</li>
            <li> , Shower Clean is much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been gagging over the ridiculously strong scent all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a baby-powder scent but a really strong one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> Dont like the strong smell while wearing it on self.</li>
            <li> but it smells very good, lasts long time, and your not stinky.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is the nice, baby powder smell.</li>
            <li> It did just wonderfully and didn&#x27;t have to reapply, as I thought I would have to based on the hot weather, overall conditions and activity.  </li>
            <li> It works fine as a deodorant and antipersperant.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but not overpowering, and the best part is that I have antiperspirant action without getting the swollen glands that appear with the heavy duty anti-perspirants (the ones you put on the night before).  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great buy for teen girls</li>
            <li> This deodorant does exactly what I ask and so much more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it ever since it was available, and it&#x27;s true, it lasts for 48+ hours.</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> Works great all day long!</li>
            <li> Very mild, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t transfer to my clothes and smells clean.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit strong smelling if you put too much on but that is an easy fix.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and came in original packaging.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone who sweats alot or has strong body odor!</li>
            <li> One swipe and you are good to go the entire day.</li>
            <li> It does what it says and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> It lasts for almost two full days if you don&#x27;t wash it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hot and sweat easily.  </li>
            <li> Mild scent and it WORKS as stated.</li>
            <li> oh so quickly.</li>
            <li> Very strong and slightly masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> Gosh I was really worried after reading some of the reviews about strong smell</li>
            <li> It might be good for keeping you dry, but I noticed it lacked protection for body odor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about deodorant, and this one rocks!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it keeps me dry, even out here in Afghanistan, and I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> but I have to say most of the time it isn&#x27;t strong enough to control odor for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite smelling deodorant has always been Dove Original clean solid -</li>
            <li> I also am a ginger :) with very sensitive skin - this stuff is soothing, even right after I shave.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve had my head wrapped in a fresh diaper all day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothes and I smell just as fresh at the end of the day as I did in the beginning even after sweating.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh all day</li>
            <li> I just smell fresh.</li>
            <li> Degree Motion sense lasts ALL day long, you never feel dry, you never feel sticky and it smells INCREDIBLE!</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean smell, and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine - has a decent scent, not too strong (I have very sensitive allergies).</li>
            <li> It sits right about my husbands belly button line.</li>
            <li> And staying nice and protected during long hours of yoga practice!</li>
            <li> But I did use it before a zumba class, and I stayed nice and dry!</li>
            <li> My dog rubbed his nose on the ground for 5 minutes trying to make the smell go away when I first put it on</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different deodorants.  </li>
            <li> When they came out with the clinical strength version, it was better but oil leaks out of the bottom (on several containers)</li>
            <li> Some perfumes give me headaches, but this is the first deodorant to do it.</li>
            <li> It is almost always hot here</li>
            <li> I love this brand, and it is the only antipersperant/deoderant that I have used for years.</li>
            <li> I would definately reccommend this, absolutely!</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> All in all, it does the job, but I like the regular Degree deodorant better.</li>
            <li> Amazon never fails for the lowest price.</li>
            <li> Tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li> this strong - I definitely do not go 2 days without putting on fresh deodorant, but I think that&#x27;s what you are supposed to do with this.</li>
            <li> This degree is great for women or men and has a subtle smell depending on which scent you choose.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Walmart for $3.88, I put it on the next morning, and did a lot of rushing around that day, and I still smelt good the next morning!</li>
            <li> The costume is really quite funny.</li>
            <li> It goes on comfortably and smells subtle but nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not feminine either, and I got my husband to start wearing it because men&#x27;s deodorants can be SOOO smelly and strong (gross!)</li>
            <li> I always hope for more protection, but this provides as good, if not better than other brands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly link this product with the strange soreness, but there were no other changes made besides my deodorant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The Motion Sensor really does work.</li>
            <li> Why would someone pay over 2x as much as it is in stores?</li>
            <li> I have noticed this on all the sellers, unless it is an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item that cannot be purchased unless I buy more items... which is getting harder to do.</li>
            <li> but it protects REALLY</li>
            <li> but I really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> This works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling this product.</li>
            <li> But the smell really turned me off.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and keeps the smell and sweat at bay</li>
            <li> Secret gel deodorants start out smelling great but smell super chemically to me shortly after.</li>
            <li> This has given me a new confidence!</li>
            <li> Feels fantastic going on and has kept me dry all day.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell is a little strong at first</li>
            <li> This is high quality grade A deodorant.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about 4&amp;#34; too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for women who have a perspiration and odor problem.</li>
            <li> Lasts way longer than normal deodorant.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove&#x27;s Ultimate Go Fresh.</li>
            <li> I compared the ingredients and there are a few more in the Degree brand.</li>
            <li> I normally dont like to wear scented deoderant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I was purposely testing this, but I was out on an overnight boat trip, and there was no shower available, so we were out for 2  1/2 days with just a change of clothes and some other necessities, so I depended on my Degree deodorant/anti-perspirant to work.</li>
            <li> Only this brand has managed to get me through the hot days where we live.  </li>
            <li> But Degree for Women keeps me dry, not sweating and I smell fresh.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t leave white on clothing and keeps me dry and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I really like the clean scent even though I usually prefer no scent.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me dry better then other non-prescription products.</li>
            <li> I switched to the Anti-perspirant and deodorant after trying some herbal natural stuff that did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> No staining so far, either.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who works out, sweats, or just wants to know they have that extra protection.</li>
            <li> So if your nose is sensitive I recomend you not to buy this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at how well it does work.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well, actually.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhere between baby powder and old lady smell.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming, just crisp and fresh.</li>
            <li> The scent is fairly strong, stronger than my past deodorants.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that works through the gym, hot days outside, swimming, anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about it, and find that I use the smallest possible amount to avoid smelling it all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low, trying product after product.</li>
            <li> Does not sting or dry out like Certain Dri.  </li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweater, and also feel like I get stinky quickly.  </li>
            <li> It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel thick, gummy or sticky at all.</li>
            <li> However, it has a very stong, long lasting, detergent like smell.</li>
            <li> No wet clothing.  </li>
            <li> Better than Secret, but I am not a fan of the scent options.</li>
            <li> There is a sewn in waste that is supposed to be right</li>
            <li> I use this daily and don&#x27;t have to reapply like i did with the degree ultra clear red satin.</li>
            <li> Suave was by far the worst brand I&#x27;ve ever tried (the smell clashed with my sweat, it left residue, and it was sticky), and avon&#x27;s liquid was the best.</li>
            <li> It is a good size, larger than the average Secret or other brands I would get and</li>
            <li> If using daily, it leaves behind a film that needs to be sloughed off before you can get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This is the new packaging, as I&#x27;ve reviewed it previously.</li>
            <li> I sweat a LOT, and this deodorant keeps me relatively dry (not totally, you still sweat, only botox can stop your sweat glands from producing moisture) and there&#x27;s no odor.</li>
            <li> and they do not last long.</li>
            <li> It lasts long, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks, doesn&#x27;t bunch up, or irritate my skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> and it is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> A definite do for long term odor and sweat protection!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really last long, and I have no idea what chemicals they have, but it made me so itchy!</li>
            <li> It only keeps it dry for about 4 to 6 hours</li>
            <li> This is working the same at the other that advertises no white marks.</li>
            <li> even when I&#x27;m really sweaty/working hard</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> I am not sensitive it at all.</li>
            <li> After trying Degree Motion Sense I will never go back to any other type of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I used to have to reapply other brands multiple times a day to stave off odor.</li>
            <li> No more target trips for this busy girl!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really no different from and other costume</li>
            <li> I have been searching forever for a deodorant that would keep me dry and from smelling.  </li>
            <li> This works well to keep me dry.</li>
            <li> It kept my sister&#x27;s armpits dry for the day, but mine?</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smell and thought long &amp; hard before ordering online.</li>
            <li> I usually only get the solid that stated little black dress approved because I don&#x27;t like white marks on my clothing.</li>
            <li> Then this invisible product turns into this goopy white, chalky mess that doestn come out of anything.  </li>
            <li> Cuts down on wetness and odor above and beyond other store brands.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Mitchum, because I sweat profusely even when I hardly exert any energy and Mitchum helped stop the sweating but left white residue on my shirts.</li>
            <li> No real &#x27;smell&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like many women, hate getting those white lines on my shirts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> I tried clinical strength (other brands)</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t change personal hygiene products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to itch after using it like I do with some other antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t floral and annoying, its subtle and pleasant if you are into that.</li>
            <li> jiu jitsu and anything else a very active person can do.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s hot or cold</li>
            <li> It does rub off on my black bar a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Even though it says it wll work up to 48 hours, I&#x27;m just not comfortable testing</li>
            <li> I just started using this deodorant a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> not sure how it compares to the other Degree I usually use.</li>
            <li> Not a strong odor and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> Not much more</li>
            <li> I usually have to wait for the sales and not always on degree</li>
            <li> The smell is so overpowering, I can smell it throughout the whole day and it makes me sick to my stomach.</li>
            <li> Not very good wetness protection.</li>
            <li> Works well through a tough workout.</li>
            <li> It does not get on clothes as bad as other deodorants</li>
            <li> and it can be very expensive.</li>
            <li> I never have bad body odor with this product.</li>
            <li> Degree is better/stronger than secret!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought this deoderant locally, but found that it&#x27;s actually cheaper in bulk through Amazon, and it comes in two days to my doorstep with PRIME.  This product doesn&#x27;t leave white on clothing and keeps me dry and comfortable.  Very mild, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I switched to the Anti-perspirant and deodorant after trying some herbal natural stuff that did not work at all.  I really like the clean scent even though I usually prefer no scent.  It does rub off on my black bar a little bit.  Nothing too noticeable though.</li>
            <li> Nothing works like degree! I usually only get the solid that stated little black dress approved because I don&#x27;t like white marks on my clothing. This is working the same at the other that advertises no white marks. I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy sweater, and also feel like I get stinky quickly.  I also run marathons.  This is the only deodorant that I feel do the jobs, and I think I´ve basically tried them all.  A definite do for long term odor and sweat protection!</li>
            <li> Great product, nice value. Would buy again from subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant by far - nice, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant. Works great.</li>
            <li> I was a very loyal Degree user for years.  But when they changed their formula to the invisible solid mass that it is now I had to stop using it.  Ive ruined a bunch of shirts.  It goes on well, and works well---until you wash your clothing.  Then this invisible product turns into this goopy white, chalky mess that doestn come out of anything.  I had to soak my dress shirts in vinegar to get this stuff to dissolve.  Then I realizes why I was killing the razors in my shower.  This stuff doesnt wash off of anything.</li>
            <li> I got this 2-pack in the mail yesterday. I&#x27;ve been gagging over the ridiculously strong scent all day. I guess I&#x27;ll be throwing these away. What a waste! My dog rubbed his nose on the ground for 5 minutes trying to make the smell go away when I first put it on and I can&#x27;t blame him. It&#x27;s a baby-powder scent but a really strong one. I feel like I&#x27;ve had my head wrapped in a fresh diaper all day. I think I&#x27;m going to need to take my second shower of the day just to get this stuff off. Frankly I&#x27;d prefer the smell of sweat.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it keeps me dry, even out here in Afghanistan, and I really like the smell.  It&#x27;s not overpowering or flowery, and when you do catch a whiff of it, it&#x27;s nice and light.  Very enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> What are you supposed to say its Deodorant! Lol but it smells very good, lasts long time, and your not stinky.</li>
            <li> Provides great protection. 48 hour protection is true! Very satisfied with this product and will continue to purchase it. Have tried almost every brand of deodorant and this is by far the best on the market.</li>
            <li> I initially thought that this Degree brand was a knockoff of Rexona because their brand and logos look so similar. But in terms of functionality, they couldn&#x27;t be different. I don&#x27;t like Rexona because the smell isn&#x27;t too good and they do not last long.</li>
            <li> She likes them so I&#x27;m recommending them! Not much more I can say, If She likes them they must work and be good!</li>
            <li> I have used alot of brands and types of deodorants. Suave was by far the worst brand I&#x27;ve ever tried (the smell clashed with my sweat, it left residue, and it was sticky), and avon&#x27;s liquid was the best. Until now. This degree is great for women or men and has a subtle smell depending on which scent you choose. I have anxiety so I sweat alot during school because I get nervous, but for this I haven&#x27;t sweat at all and I don&#x27;t smell after running in P.E or riding my bike. It lasts long, doesn&#x27;t leave white marks, doesn&#x27;t bunch up, or irritate my skin after shaving. I highly recommend this product to everyone who sweats alot or has strong body odor!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different deodorants.  This is the only one that works through the gym, hot days outside, swimming, anything.  I also am a ginger :) with very sensitive skin - this stuff is soothing, even right after I shave.  I&#x27;ll never buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> Not very good wetness protection. Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the click and use creamier kind</li>
            <li> My favorite smelling deodorant has always been Dove Original clean solid - but I have to say most of the time it isn&#x27;t strong enough to control odor for me. When they came out with the clinical strength version, it was better but oil leaks out of the bottom (on several containers) and it can be very expensive. This deodorant is so fresh smelling that sometimes i like to lift up my own arms to get a whiff of it ! It does not get on clothes as bad as other deodorants but i will not say its amazing in that criteria. Secret gel deodorants start out smelling great but smell super chemically to me shortly after. This scent is not powdery or flowery at all, fresh, clean, perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great shipping from a great dealer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been searching forever for a deodorant that would keep me dry and from smelling.  I tried clinical strength (other brands) and I even made my own deodorant thinking that would work best but hasn&#x27;t.  This deodorant does exactly what I ask and so much more.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any marks on my clothes and I smell just as fresh at the end of the day as I did in the beginning even after sweating.  I LOVE this product!  It is a bit strong smelling if you put too much on but that is an easy fix.  One swipe and you are good to go the entire day.</li>
            <li> Love the this brand and it works great</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite for many years.  Cuts down on wetness and odor above and beyond other store brands.  Does not sting or dry out like Certain Dri.  Smell is pleasant and not too much.</li>
            <li> I workout a lot and sweat a lot when I do.  This works well to keep me dry.</li>
            <li> This works well in the heat and humidity while exercising or work. It also doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes which is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Awesome deodorant, smells amazing. Lasts all day and night. Minimizes sweat. Will definitely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> After trying Degree Motion Sense I will never go back to any other type of deodorant. Degree Motion sense lasts ALL day long, you never feel dry, you never feel sticky and it smells INCREDIBLE! This is high quality grade A deodorant.</li>
            <li> The smell before use is quite different than the one when you are actually wearing it. It doesn&#x27;t really last long, and I have no idea what chemicals they have, but it made me so itchy!</li>
            <li> I am a repeat user of Degree deodorant. It smells great and seems to offer decent protection. I always hope for more protection, but this provides as good, if not better than other brands. I just wish there was a deodorant that didnt leave residue and prevents arm pit staining on tshirts.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t change personal hygiene products. If it works I stay with it. The brand I used since the 80&#x27;s is no longer made and I&#x27;ve been searching for a great replacement. FOUND IT!  I have tried several. I am very sensitive to smell and thought long &amp; hard before ordering online. I&#x27;m very pleased. Mild scent and it WORKS as stated. Great product.</li>
            <li> I used to have to reapply other brands multiple times a day to stave off odor. This is the only brand I have ever found (including medical grade) that works. This has given me a new confidence! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews on amazon, and they were accurate!  The scent is pleasant but not overpowering, and the best part is that I have antiperspirant action without getting the swollen glands that appear with the heavy duty anti-perspirants (the ones you put on the night before).  No staining so far, either.</li>
            <li> Nice Scent.  Seems to work for me.  I don&#x27;t seem to itch after using it like I do with some other antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Even better than Secrets Clinical Strength (which directs you to apply at bedtime)! I ABHOR &amp;#34;BAD BODY ODOR&amp;#34; as it literally makes me want to &#x27;throw up&#x27;! I&#x27;ve searched high and low, trying product after product. The Motion Sensor really does work. Even though it says it wll work up to 48 hours, I&#x27;m just not comfortable testing that &#x27;claim&#x27;. No real &#x27;smell&#x27;. It does what it says and that&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  This is the new packaging, as I&#x27;ve reviewed it previously. I&#x27;ve used it ever since it was available, and it&#x27;s true, it lasts for 48+ hours. It&#x27;s not that I was purposely testing this, but I was out on an overnight boat trip, and there was no shower available, so we were out for 2  1/2 days with just a change of clothes and some other necessities, so I depended on my Degree deodorant/anti-perspirant to work. It did just wonderfully and didn&#x27;t have to reapply, as I thought I would have to based on the hot weather, overall conditions and activity.  I would recommend this product to anyone who works out, sweats, or just wants to know they have that extra protection. Thank you for a great product,timely delivery, and a good choice of scents!  I&#x27;m a customer for life!</li>
            <li> This definitely works. It lasts for almost two full days if you don&#x27;t wash it off. For some reason, when I use it my eyes water and I have a very mild headache. I&#x27;ve never had that reaction with deodorant before. Some perfumes give me headaches, but this is the first deodorant to do it. Perhaps it just doesn&#x27;t go with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Gosh I was really worried after reading some of the reviews about strong smell but it goes to show you that our sense of smell is very personal. I am very selective and yet found this deodorant to be perfect in terms of smell and invisible way it went on and the price was very fair. It is a good size, larger than the average Secret or other brands I would get and it was excellent value. I also love that it shipped oh so quickly. No more target trips for this busy girl! And staying nice and protected during long hours of yoga practice!</li>
            <li> I like to use all of the Degree Deodorants for Women, the scents are very nice and they are very reliable. Whether it&#x27;s hot or cold the protection is there and it is long lasting.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but it is so overpriced. Why would someone pay over 2x as much as it is in stores? I have noticed this on all the sellers, unless it is an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; item that cannot be purchased unless I buy more items... which is getting harder to do.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells nice</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell is a little strong at first but it protects REALLY WELL - I am very impressed with the quality of this deodorant (keeps you dry and smelling fresh!). Will definitely buy again, great formula!</li>
            <li> does what I need it to do</li>
            <li> Great buy for teen girls</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well, but within a few days started making my chest sore. So I stopped using it and about 4 to 5 days later the soreness went away. I can&#x27;t honestly link this product with the strange soreness, but there were no other changes made besides my deodorant. I will not get this again because of that.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit too strong for my liking, but it is better than B.O.! It lasts for quite a while and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> They smell really nice!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years. It has a pleasant scent and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Nothing has me jumping to buy more.. But its ok.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. Lasts way longer than normal deodorant. I won&#x27;t buy anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> Very strong and slightly masculine smell.  Overpowered any cologne.  Order lasted all day.  Effectiveness seems about the same as similar products.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about deodorant, and this one rocks!  It doesn&#x27;t transfer to my clothes and smells clean.  This is the only deodorant I&#x27;ll use!</li>
            <li> BEST deodorant I have ever used...even when I&#x27;m really sweaty/working hard I don&#x27;t ever get sticky or smell.&lt;br /&gt;(I know my username says &#x27;Adam&#x27; but I am his girlfriend and bought this under his account!)</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine - has a decent scent, not too strong (I have very sensitive allergies). I don&#x27;t sweat a ton, so not sure how it compares to the other Degree I usually use.</li>
            <li> The smell is so overpowering, I can smell it throughout the whole day and it makes me sick to my stomach. So if your nose is sensitive I recomend you not to buy this</li>
            <li> Have to return. There is a sewn in waste that is supposed to be right ah the belt line but the manufacturer messed up and it&#x27;s about 4&amp;#34; too high. It sits right about my husbands belly button line. I&#x27;m sending back for an exchange and a larger size in hopes that it was just a defective costume. The costume is really quite funny. It&#x27;s not the best quality but it&#x27;s really no different from and other costume I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Works great all day long!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and bargain. I am never disappointed with my amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> It might be good for keeping you dry, but I noticed it lacked protection for body odor and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed degree products BUT not this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best deoderent that I have ever used. It survives kick boxing, running, jiu jitsu and anything else a very active person can do. The scent lasts throughout.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and the price was good compared to what I would have to search for in the stores. I usually have to wait for the sales and not always on degree so it was great to find the sale price and get it delivered.</li>
            <li> The scent is very clean and neutral. Not overwhelming, just crisp and fresh. It&#x27;s not feminine either, and I got my husband to start wearing it because men&#x27;s deodorants can be SOOO smelly and strong (gross!)</li>
            <li> Lasts long. I love it. I started reacting to the spray deodorant so decided to try this. This has been good to my skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used Degree Motion Sense for a while, but after they came out with the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version, it hasn&#x27;t seemed to work as well for me.</li>
            <li> This works well but I really appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. It glides on easily and doesn&#x27;t feel thick, gummy or sticky at all. It doesn&#x27;t claim to be &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; but I haven&#x27;t noticed any big white marks on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A helpful tip to erase deodorant marks from clothing if you do get them: nylon... As in stockings, pantyhose, tights or whatever you have that is made from that material! Just bunch it up and rub. It&#x27;s like a magic eraser!  I keep a couple of cut up pieces from worn out/run stockings tucked into my sock drawer &amp; every suitcase or overnight bag just so I always have one... you never know when you might need it!</li>
            <li> I used to use Mitchum, because I sweat profusely even when I hardly exert any energy and Mitchum helped stop the sweating but left white residue on my shirts. Degree doesn&#x27;t leave residue and is just as strong as Mitchum!</li>
            <li> This deodorant/antiperspirant  works well. The only reason for dropping one star is that I don&#x27;t care for the fragrance. It&#x27;s a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hot and sweat easily.  Degree does the job.  I never have bad body odor with this product. it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> This works very well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothing.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and came in original packaging. I have been using this deodorant for a while now and it works great. Degree lasts all day and has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Only this brand has managed to get me through the hot days where we live.  It is almost always hot here and I do not get any underarm stains, ever!  No wet clothing.  No embarrassing situations.  Love this product &amp; will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Works great  for  me.</li>
            <li> Works great.  It&#x27;s probably the best deodorant I have found for me.  It goes on comfortably and smells subtle but nice. I can easily go 2 days without needing more, even after bathing. The price was competitive and it delivered just as it should.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, and it is the only antipersperant/deoderant that I have used for years. It has a fresh, clean smell, and is reasonably priced. I would definately reccommend this, absolutely!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and don&#x27;t have to reapply like i did with the degree ultra clear red satin. This works well for wetness protection and as a deodorant. I&#x27;m surprised at how well it does work. Works well through a tough workout.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry better then other non-prescription products.</li>
            <li> Arrived sooner than promised and exactly as expected-thanks</li>
            <li> Great product,  woorks very well. Worth the money. Shipping was fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! This product does what it says is does! Protection when you need it most. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove&#x27;s Ultimate Go Fresh. Degree for Women, Invisible Sold Motion Sense, Shower Clean is much better. I have a big perspiration problem particurly in the summer. I also dread the underarm smell. But Degree for Women keeps me dry, not sweating and I smell fresh. I compared the ingredients and there are a few more in the Degree brand. Those added ingredients must be doing the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for women who have a perspiration and odor problem.Problem solved!</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh all day</li>
            <li> I bought this because I work as a waitress for about 8 hours at a time. I sweat a LOT, and this deodorant keeps me relatively dry (not totally, you still sweat, only botox can stop your sweat glands from producing moisture) and there&#x27;s no odor. I just smell fresh. I feel good about this purchase. Do it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I need a deodorant this strong - I definitely do not go 2 days without putting on fresh deodorant, but I think that&#x27;s what you are supposed to do with this. If using daily, it leaves behind a film that needs to be sloughed off before you can get a clean shave. All in all, it does the job, but I like the regular Degree deodorant better.</li>
            <li> Feels fantastic going on and has kept me dry all day.</li>
            <li> I normally dont like to wear scented deoderant but I do with degree because it doesnt smell like  deoderant.I recommend this one or Dove collection.Dont like the strong smell while wearing it on self.</li>
            <li> I really like, it lasts and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Degree is better/stronger than secret!!!</li>
            <li> I just started using this deodorant a few weeks ago. The first thing I noticed is the nice, baby powder smell. The scent is fairly strong, stronger than my past deodorants. It says &amp;#34;Motion Sense&amp;#34;. I thought that was just a marketing ploy but it&#x27;s true! When I work out I suddenly smell that baby powder smell. I love that it really does a great job of preventing/masking any body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, like many women, hate getting those white lines on my shirts. This deodorant has been excellent at not getting everywhere. I put it on and it stays. I won&#x27;t ball up and it wont smear all over my clothes. This deodorant is awesome!</li>
            <li> Not a strong odor and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It works fine as a deodorant and antipersperant. However, it has a very stong, long lasting, detergent like smell. I&#x27;m not crazy about it, and find that I use the smallest possible amount to avoid smelling it all day long. I&#x27;d suggest finding this at a drug store to make sure you like its odor before ordering online.</li>
            <li> Amazon never fails for the lowest price. Tried this for the first time. Lasts all day! no stink at the end of the day. Thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> Nice pleasant smell, and worked well.</li>
            <li> Gave one to my sister and one to myself. It kept my sister&#x27;s armpits dry for the day, but mine? It only keeps it dry for about 4 to 6 hours and then I start noticing the stain in my shirts. I think this is one of the cheapest but most reliable deodorants I&#x27;ve used, but I guess I have to keep looking for one that works better with me.&lt;br /&gt;Also the smell isn&#x27;t floral and annoying, its subtle and pleasant if you are into that.</li>
            <li> One of the best deodorant on the market today. I am not sensitive it at all. Thanks for selling this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Walmart for $3.88, I put it on the next morning, and did a lot of rushing around that day, and I still smelt good the next morning! best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well, actually. But the smell really turned me off. It&#x27;s somewhere between baby powder and old lady smell. I just couldn&#x27;t get passed it. But I did use it before a zumba class, and I stayed nice and dry! Amazing stuff. Just wish it smelled good! Also when I sweat, the smell increased in intensity, so it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> great item - wonderful protection, smells great</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and keeps the smell and sweat at bay</li>
            <li> works well and helps me throughout the day.  love the scent as well.  purchase this product often.  would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Very effective and in use at all times when bought.</li>
            <li> Better than Secret, but I am not a fan of the scent options.</li>
    </ol>
