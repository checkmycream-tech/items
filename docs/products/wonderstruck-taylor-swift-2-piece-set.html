            <li>Came in a beautiful velvet box.</li>
            <li>The gift set is a great deal, too.  </li>
            <li>SO happy I checked here before purchasing it retail.  </li>
            <li>THE SMELL IS GREAT</li>
            <li>I am thinking about stocking up and buying more while it lasts!!</li>
            <li>The packaging of this item is fabulous!!!</li>
            <li>Also, the gift box that it comes in is actually very nice, a purple velvety material</li>
            <li>The scent is gorgeous and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I love perfume, this is a great addition to my collection.  </li>
            <li>First off this perfume is awesome, I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this set!  </li>
            <li>Nice set.</li>
            <li>Nice gift set.</li>
            <li>Either it was an ok deal or an amazing deal</li>
            <li>But wow, the box came in great packaging and for the price I paid, I&#x27;m blown away!</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the way it was packaged.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure it was supposed to say 1oz bottle.</li>
            <li>The roller perfume and jewelry box are an added bonus. :)</li>
            <li>Purse spray was a bonus and her friends love spraying it.</li>
            <li>Love the way this smells.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>While replacement item was slightly more in cost, if I wanted that I would have ordered it.</li>
            <li>Very unique, I have never smelled another perfume like it.</li>
            <li>The jewelry box is kind of cheap looking, made of purple velvety material, but I took the bow off and it looks fine on my dresser.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly delicious fragrance, light enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li>The roller is easy to carry in any purse to refresh the fragrance mid-day.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, and has no musky smell at all.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and sweet smelling, like floral vanilla, but not too sweet.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a beautiful purple velvet box to make it extra special.</li>
            <li>Very nice for a teenage girl.</li>
            <li>This was such a good deal, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>Somehow this frag seems kind of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; to me although it has no green notes, it might be the tea.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to size and comes in a jewelry box to keep in a pretty purple color!</li>
            <li>So when I saw this one on Amazon as a 3.4oz bottle AND a roll on perfume bottle for only $21 I honestly thought that it was a mistake.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and packaging was good as usual.</li>
            <li>so I took the chance and ordered it and to my surprise it really is a 3.4oz bottle!</li>
            <li>The packaging looks higher in quality in person.</li>
            <li>The little spritzer for her purse is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>I decided to check out how much it would be on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Very girly scent and presentation.</li>
            <li>I really like the roll on bottle that comes in this set because I can keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li>and you can take the blue plastic out and just use it as a box to keep stuff in, pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, just as pictured, would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>Buying another one right now, actually!</li>
            <li>I get good wear out of this, I can usually still smell it the next day although it fades into something very similar to D&amp;G Light Blue.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this doing the summmer, and her red scent during the winter and spring.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice everyday fragrance, not too juvinile but still a bit whimsical.</li>

            <li> Did not get Wonderstruck Jewelry Box gift set as ordered, item was switched without approval and did not have time to exchange due to Christmas rush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re here looking for review of the fragrance, Wonderstruck is primarily a black tea/blackberry scent on me with a woody dry down.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece for her birthday, it is subtle, soft and delicate.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy at all.</li>

            <li> wonderful smell and very cute bottle and roll on!  I really enjoyed the way it was packaged.  Perfect for a gift or just for yourself!</li>
            <li> First off this perfume is awesome, I love the smell! Very unique, I have never smelled another perfume like it. I bought a 1oz bottle last year at a store for about $20 and that seemed like the average price. That bottle lasted me until now. So when I saw this one on Amazon as a 3.4oz bottle AND a roll on perfume bottle for only $21 I honestly thought that it was a mistake. I thought for sure it was supposed to say 1oz bottle. Either it was an ok deal or an amazing deal so I took the chance and ordered it and to my surprise it really is a 3.4oz bottle! Cannot believe what a terrific deal it is. I am thinking about stocking up and buying more while it lasts!! Shipped quick and packaging was good as usual. Also, the gift box that it comes in is actually very nice, a purple velvety material and you can take the blue plastic out and just use it as a box to keep stuff in, pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I was hesistant to buy this because of the price. In stores it is a lot more expensive. But wow, the box came in great packaging and for the price I paid, I&#x27;m blown away! Buying another one right now, actually!</li>
            <li> Love it!  The scent is gorgeous and not overpowering.  The gift set is a great deal, too.  I went to the post exchange on Ft Lewis and the 3.4 oz bottle was almost 50 dollars.  I decided to check out how much it would be on Amazon.  SO happy I checked here before purchasing it retail.  The roller perfume and jewelry box are an added bonus. :)</li>
            <li> Delivered in time for Xmas and she wears the perfume all the time. Purse spray was a bonus and her friends love spraying it.</li>
            <li> This was such a good deal, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. The jewelry box is kind of cheap looking, made of purple velvety material, but I took the bow off and it looks fine on my dresser. If you&#x27;re here looking for review of the fragrance, Wonderstruck is primarily a black tea/blackberry scent on me with a woody dry down. The tea is very sharp at first but after a few minutes the berry scent comes out. It&#x27;s a very nice everyday fragrance, not too juvinile but still a bit whimsical. I get good wear out of this, I can usually still smell it the next day although it fades into something very similar to D&amp;G Light Blue. Sillage isn&#x27;t the best, it sits close to your skin. Somehow this frag seems kind of &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; to me although it has no green notes, it might be the tea. This one is not a sugarbomb like Wonderstruck Enchanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece for her birthday, it is subtle, soft and delicate.  Very nice for a teenage girl.</li>
            <li> The packaging of this item is fabulous!!! Would make for a wonderful gift! I was blown away! It&#x27;s true to size and comes in a jewelry box to keep in a pretty purple color!</li>
            <li> my daughter loves the set!  The little spritzer for her purse is a nice touch.  Very girly scent and presentation.</li>
            <li> When I got it the bottle was smashed and the perfume was everywhere I was not happy at all. I would get it from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Nice set. Came in a beautiful velvet box. Love the way this smells.</li>
            <li> I wear Wonderstruck on a daily basis.  It is very light and sweet smelling, like floral vanilla, but not too sweet.  I get complimented on it often.  It is not too strong, and has no musky smell at all.  I really like the roll on bottle that comes in this set because I can keep it in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love perfume, this is a great addition to my collection.  The purse size roller is perfect.  Comes with a beautiful purple velvet box to make it extra special.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. I mainly use this doing the summmer, and her red scent during the winter and spring.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS GREAT BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T LAST ALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  I WOULD STILL RECOMMEND BUYING IT.  .. ..</li>
            <li> Nice gift set. The packaging looks higher in quality in person.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly delicious fragrance, light enough to use every day.  The roller is easy to carry in any purse to refresh the fragrance mid-day.</li>
            <li> Love this set!  Was a great gift for my daughter!  Very pretty, just as pictured, would definitely buy again!</li>

            <li> It was a gift and she loves it</li>
